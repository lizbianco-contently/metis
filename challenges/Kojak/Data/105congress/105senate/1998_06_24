Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Coverdell education conference report. Under the \nprevious order, after the expiration or yielding back of debate time, \nthe Senate will proceed to vote on the adoption of the conference \nreport. That vote is expected to occur at approximately 11:30 a.m. \nFollowing that vote, the Senate will immediately resume consideration \nof the defense authorization bill.\n  It is my hope that the defense bill can be concluded soon, hopefully \ntoday, certainly tomorrow. In that vein, I want Senators to be on \nnotice that we will plan on working into the night. I have tried very \nhard all year, and since I have been majority leader, to be sensitive \nto night sessions so that Members can be with their families, but we \nmust get more work done. We must get this bill done. So Senators can \nexpect a vote around 8 o'clock tonight. That may be moved a little bit \none way or the other depending on how the debate is going, but we will \nhave a vote on the defense authorization bill, an amendment, or on a \njudicial nomination tonight. So just make your plans to be here around \n8 o'clock. If the committee wants to continue to work after that, they \nshould do that also.\n  So Senators should be on notice that we could very well be in session \nlate Thursday night, and they should be prepared to have votes Friday \nafternoon at around 2 o'clock. So if you have flights out of here \nThursday night, cancel them unless you want to miss some votes. If you \nplan on leaving Friday morning, cancel it, unless you want to miss some \nvotes. We will be voting as it now stands Friday afternoon. It may be \non DOD, if we haven't completed it; it may be on a conference report. \nIt could be on IRS reform and restructuring. I don't think any Senator \nwould want to miss a vote on that conference report. If we could get \nsome more cooperation around here, which we have not been getting, we \ncould maybe not have to do that. But we are going to act on this \nauthorization bill, we are going to move toward appropriations bills, \nwe are going to do conference reports, and we are going to do \nnominations.\n  I asked the Senate to help me. The Senate has not been doing that. \nAnd so we will be voting tonight, Thursday night, and Friday afternoon. \nIn fact, I don't have to leave until Saturday afternoon late so I would \nbe delighted to stay here. This sword can be pointed both ways. But we \nhave to go to work, and we have to cooperate with each other on behalf \nof the country. We are talking about defense authorization. Is there a \nmore important bill we will do this year? We are developing a hollow \nmilitary. We are not funding defense adequately, and yet we have \nmilitary men and women steaming all over the world, stretched to the \nlimit. It is ridiculous that we are here arguing over details when we \nought to be acting on this very important bill.\n  If you have amendments, what are you waiting on? Get over here and \noffer them, because I have already heard, ``Well, I haven't had my \nchance yet.'' This is the sixth day, I believe, we have been on this \nbill. If you have an amendment, come offer it. Otherwise, I would like \nto move to third reading and just let the chips fall where they will \nbecause enough is enough. If you have an amendment that is important, \nyou should be over here at 11:30 to offer it as soon as we go back to \nthat bill.\n  Rollcall votes should be expected throughout the day. We are still \nworking to try to get an agreement on the Higher Education Act. There \nis a great deal of irresponsibility on that act; Senators are saying, \noh, I have two, three, six amendments. This bill expires, the \nauthorization expires July 1, and we are not going to have it passed in \nthe Senate. I think that is a real problem also.\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\n  I mentioned the IRS reform conference report. We have at least four \nappropriations bills that are ready, and we would like to work with \nboth sides to see if we could not clear some Executive Calendar \nnominations. For instance, the Amtrak board, if we don't approve the \nboard by July 1, the Amtrak authorization expires. Now, anybody who \nwants their Amtrak efforts last year to be for naught better be \nthinking about it, because if we don't get the authorization, we don't \nget the reforms, we are not going to get the money in the future. I \nhave been a supporter of Amtrak, but I said last year it is the last \ntime. We are going to do it right or we are not going to get the money \nwe need in the future.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I again thank Senator Coverdell and his \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who have worked on this very \nimportant education bill. I am excited, honestly excited, that we are \nabout to pass one of the most important education bills that the Senate \nhas acted on in years to encourage more savings for our children's \neducation, for their needs. That is certainly worthwhile.\n  I particularly note that in addition to Senator Coverdell, Senator \nTorricelli has been very helpful, sticking to his guns against a lot of \nopposition. It would encourage prepaid tuition. Twenty-one States have \nthat program. My State has that program. It will be very helpful to get \ntax benefits of prepaid college tuition. Also, we should encourage \nemployers to give employees benefits for pursuing higher education. \nThis is a really great bill. I believe it will pass with a wide \nbipartisan margin, and I believe that education will benefit and \nchildren in America will be better off because of it.\n  So I thank those who have been involved. I think it will be one of \nthe most important things that we have done this year. I hope the \nPresident will find it in his heart to sign this legislation.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  (Mr. ALLARD assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield to the \ndistinguished President pro tempore.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the able majority leader for his remarks and \nhis plan of action. It is the least we can do in the Senate to \ncooperate with him. He has outlined the procedure here to get results, \nand we all ought to help him all we can to go forward with this bill \nand other matters before the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S6917-5", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. 2646, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference Report on H.R. 2646 to amend the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to allow tax-free expenditures from \n     education individual retirement accounts for elementary and \n     secondary school expenses, to increase the maximum annual \n     amount of contributions to such accounts, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, is \nrecognized to speak up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have available \nsome leadership time, so I yield myself additional time, if necessary, \nunder the leadership time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I just heard the majority leader call this \none of the most important bills for education that the Senate could \npass, and he hoped that the President would sign it. I regret that I \nmust disagree with the judgment of the majority leader. This could have \nbeen one of the most important bills that we pass. We had an \nopportunity in the Senate to be able to really deal with the broad \nissue of education reform and the education needs of our Nation, but \nthis bill does not do it. What it does do, it does in a way that winds \nup being a perpetuation of the divisions in our country between those \nwho have and those who do not, and a division between our school \ncommunities in what is available to our children to be able to get the \nbest education in our country.\n  So I would not only say to the President don't sign it, I would say \nveto it. This is a bill that, in its current form, deserves to be \nvetoed. Why? The bill is definitely better than the bill that left the \nfloor of the Senate. It is better because the Gorton amendment, which \nput all of our education assistance into a block grant, is gone. It is \ngone for good reason, because it would be an enormous mistake to make \nthat judgment in the country where education is in such enormous need \nof help. Education now, obviously, is the most important focus of the \nNation in terms of revitalizing our democracy, making a skilled labor \npool available to all facets of our high value-added job base, to the \ntechnology future we know is coming, and to the management of \ninformation, all of which requires a first-rate elementary and \nsecondary school system. This bill, regrettably, through the Gorton \namendment, would have diminished our ability to achieve that.\n  The bill, also, in its current form, doesn't do any of that--and I \nwill speak to that in a moment.\n  The second reason why it is better in its current form is that the \nbill no longer has a prohibition on the ability of people to implement \ntesting standards. Obviously, at a time when our schools are struggling \nto be able to produce a verifiable and accountable product, it is \ncritical for us not to deprive those schools of the ability to adhere \nto some kind of national measurement of what we are and are not \nachieving. Parents all across this Nation want to know that their \nchildren are, indeed, learning something. So it is important that we \nnow have empowered the schools to be able to conduct some kind of a \ntest that measures that, on a voluntary basis. It allows them to say, \n``Here is what they are accomplishing in California, here is what they \nare doing in Massachusetts, here is what they are doing in Georgia. Is \nthere something that we are not doing in our State that maybe we ought \nto that would allow us to be able to do a better job?''\n  So that is why it is better. The answer to the question why this \nparticular bill still deserves to be vetoed is very simple. I am in \nfavor of a savings program for our parents to be able to send their \nkids to school, and particularly to a school of choice. This bill, in \nwisdom, says: Private, parochial, public--you choose. That is good. \nThat is part of what this country is. But the basic choice that it is \ngiving to those parents is, in my judgment--I say this respectfully \nto my friends who support it--fundamentally flawed because, according \nto the Treasury Department, 70 percent of the benefit of the savings \naccount given in this bill will go to the top 20 percent income earners \nin America.\n\n  I know my colleague will try to refute that, but the facts are the \nfacts. If you earn $45,000 or less in this country, the tax benefit to \nyou through this bill is $2.50, on average. But if you are in the \nhigher income-earning area, because of the benefit of a tax credit, you \nwill get upwards of $96 or so. So what this bill does is comfort the \ncomfortable and do very little to assist the problems of those who are \nin the most challenged areas of our school system in this Nation. And \nthat is wrong.\n  I asked my colleagues how they can come to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate for the last 3\\1/2\\ weeks--the Senator from Texas, Senator \nGramm, the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft--with this \nextraordinary concern for the working poor of America. By God, we \nweren't going to pass a tax bill in this Senate that somehow fell \ndisproportionately on blue-collar, working-class people who went out \nand bought a pack of cigarettes. For weeks the Senate was subjected to \nthe notion that our friends on the other side of the aisle really do \ncare about working people and the burden that they bear. And the first \nbill to come along after that debate turns around and offers a classic \nRepublican giveaway to those who are already earning the most in \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S6919]]\n\n  The second reason why this bill, I think, deserves to be rejected is \nit really does not deal with the problems of our school system today. \nIt just does not deal with them. It is all well and good to say to a \nparent: ``We are going to give you this tiny little bit of savings. If \nyou earn less than $45,000 a year, you are going to get $2.50.'' That \nis amazing. You are not going to be able to do much with that. And if \nyou are even in the upper end, let's look at what they get. On an \nannual basis maybe in the $90 range, somewhere like that--$96.\n  What is lacking in our schools is far more profound than what this \nbill is ever going to address. All across this country we have \nsecondary and elementary schools that are failing. We also have some \nextraordinarily successful public schools in the country. We designate \nsome of them annually as blue ribbon schools, and the Department of \nEducation singles them out and gives them an award for being a very \nspecial school.\n  I have taken some time to go into those schools to try to find out \nwhy is one school a blue ribbon school and another school, maybe 10 \nblocks away or two districts away, is failing. Almost invariably you \nwill find in the school that is a success a hybrid relationship that \nhas been built up between the school committee and the school board and \nthe teachers and the principal. And absolutely without fail, in the \nschool that is very successful you will find a principal who is \nextraordinarily capable, energized, very skilled in leadership \ncapacity, who has worked out a very special relationship with the \nschool board so they can move teachers who need to be moved who are not \nperforming correctly, who has brought parents into the school, and who \nhas created a dynamic in that school that makes it special.\n  In effect, what has happened is that in those successful schools, you \nhave effectively created a kind of charter school. What I proposed last \nweek in some public comments is the notion that what we really ought to \nbe doing, if we are going to talk about education reform, is figure out \nhow we stop talking past each other in the U.S. Senate, how we stop \nbringing these sort of Band-Aid, stop-gap measures to the floor, \npretending that we are dealing with education reform in America with \n$2.50 to $96, when the real issue of education reform is how do you \ncreate accountability in a system that is imploding on itself? How do \nyou create a system where teachers can be brought in, even from the \nliberal arts, rather than just from the education monopoly that we have \ncreated? How do you create a system where we are going to attract a \nwhole new wave of principals with the capacity to offer the kind of \nleadership I have talked about? How do you create a system where you \ncan move those teachers out of the system who are burnt out, or who are \nunwilling to improve sufficiently to raise our kids to the standards \nthat we want? These are the real issues of education reform.\n  We are going to lose 2 million teachers in America in the next 10 \nyears. We have to hire an additional 2 million teachers. If we are \nreduced to hiring from the current pool that is available, a pool where \nwe know the SAT scores and the ACT scores are universally lower than in \nany other discipline that tests in the United States--that is the \npool--and that we lose 40 percent of those teachers in the first 4 \nyears, we are asking ourselves a set of very serious questions that are \nnot being asked on the floor of the U.S. Senate. You cannot attract \nteachers out of most of the colleges that I represent in Massachusetts, \nwhether it is the University of Massachusetts or BU or MIT or Boston \nCollege or any number of schools--Clark University, you name it. We \nhave 136 of them in our State, one of the best networks of universities \nand colleges in America.\n\n  But when I go to those campuses, and I turn to the kids, and I say, \n``Are you thinking of teaching?'' I might get one hand raised out of \n150. And one of the primary reasons for that is, you cannot tell a kid \nwho has $20,000 to $50,000 to $100,000 worth of student loans that it \nis of value to them to go teach when they are going to be fundamentally \nindentured servants for the rest of their lives. If they get a master's \ndegree and maybe even a Ph.D., they can eke their way up into the high \nforties, fifties, sixties in some school systems, but their peers are \ngoing to be earning a lot more than that.\n  We do not value teaching in America. We pretend we do, but we do not \nvalue it. We have left our schools in a state of chaos, where they are \ncompeting with districts that have a lot more money, a lot more \nsecurity, a lot more capacity to make ends meet. And then we wonder why \nthings are imploding. This bill does not do anything to really help \nthat, except, I might add, to encourage the flight from the school \nsystem that is already in trouble.\n  Mr. President, I have news for my friends in the U.S. Senate. There \nare not enough vouchers, there are not enough savings programs to go \naround to save the public school system, which is the place where 90 \npercent of the children of America go to school. So you give a few \nvouchers and you give a few savings plans, and a few kids are going to \nopt to go to a parochial school or somewhere else, but, meanwhile, what \nis happening to pull that other system back from the brink?\n  I have heard people make the argument, it is immoral to leave 1,000 \nkids in the Washington, DC system, for instance. And the answer is, \nyes, it is. But it is even more immoral to say that we are satisfied, \nas the richest Nation on the face of the Earth, to simply save the \n1,000 and not do something for the other 4,000 that are left behind.\n  That is essentially what this bill says. It says that it is OK to \ncome along and offer the wealthiest people in America, who already have \nthe best school systems, a little more help to take their kids out of \nthe system that most needs help today.\n  I think we ought to find ourselves in a middle ground. I believe the \nwhole teacher certification process needs change. If we are going to \nattract 2 million new teachers of the quality that we want, we need \ndesperately to change the way in which we have created this education \nmonopoly within the teacher certification process. We need to be able \nto attract even liberal arts graduates, people out of government, \npeople out of corporations, and bring them into the system and let them \nteach.\n  We need to liberate our principals from the layers of bureaucracy \nthat are literally snuffing out creativity in too many of our schools. \nWe need to encourage the capacity of teachers who have burnt out or do \nnot want to pursue further skills and raise the standards of the \nschools. We need to find ways to encourage them, decently and in a \nhumane way, to move to some other discipline or at least to raise the \nstandard within that school. And we clearly need to provide principals \nthe ability to be able to manage locally and make things work.\n  You look at what is happening out in Chicago with Mayor Daley who has \ninstituted a tough system. If kids fail a class during the year, they \ntake summer school. And if they fail the summer school, they repeat the \ngrade. And the way he did it was by breaking through bureaucracy and \nbreaking through the system and making certain that he was going to be \nable to institute that as the mayor, regardless of where the politics \nof the school board and everybody else were.\n  I believe that that is the kind of effort that the U.S. Senate ought \nto be encouraging broadly across this country. That is the kind of real \nreform that is going to make a difference in teacher tenure, which \nneeds to be changed. Teacher certification needs to be changed. Teacher \npay needs to be changed. Principals and accountability need to be \nchanged. Recruiting of teachers across the country needs to be changed.\n  How much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I have used--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have used 5 minutes of leader time.\n  Mr. KERRY. So I used all the time available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. I simply say to my friend from Georgia, I hope the time \nwill come that we will get both sides of the fence here talking about \nreal, broad, systemic reform that will save the public school system of \nthis country.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\n  Before the Senator from Massachusetts leaves, I just have to make \nthis point, that the families who are eligible to participate in these \nsavings accounts are identical, the very same families and same \ncriteria designed by the President for his savings accounts that we \npassed last year and celebrated on the White House lawn. There is not \none comma different. We cannot celebrate it on the one hand, the \nPresident's savings accounts, and say this one is just for the wealthy. \nThey are the same.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the President and thank my friend from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. President, as the remarks from my friend from Massachusetts \nindicate, there is a broad and shared concern about the quality of \neducation in our country today that is felt by every Member of this \nSenate. And I think the question is, What do we do about it? Can we go \nfrom that concern to making something happen that will improve the \nfuture of our children?\n  There is no cure-all here. The way to begin is with a simple, small, \nbut potentially significant idea such as that involved in these \neducation savings accounts. The question is, Will we break out of our \nown sense that our idea is the only idea that will work and listen to \nthose who have a different idea or get together on common ground to \nallow 1,000 flowers to blossom, to allow doors to open up, to allow a \nhost of reform ideas across this country to be tried?\n\n  That is exactly the spirit of the education savings account bill \nbefore us. This is not a bill that comforts the comforted. This is a \nbill that lightens the burden on the overburdened middle class families \nof this country who are struggling to enable their children to realize \ntheir dream of a better education and therefore a better life ahead of \nthem.\n  As the Senator from Georgia says, the income limits in this bill are \nexactly what they were in the bill that we all voted for. It had strong \nbipartisan support last year. The Joint Tax Committee analysis of this \nbill says that 70 percent of the tax benefit from these expanded \nsavings accounts will go to families with annual incomes of less than \n$75,000. That is the middle class--working, struggling, trying to find \na way to get their kids to rise on the ladder of American life, and \nknowing that the way to do that is with a better education.\n  Mr. President, it is true, there are very few poor families who are \ngoing to be able to afford to take advantage of this bill. Some will. \nBut I say to my colleagues who want to help the poorest families, \nsupport the school choice voucher scholarship bill that Senator Coats \nand I have put before this Senate and that we will offer as an \namendment within the next month or two.\n  This is a small step forward to encourage parents to do exactly what \nthe President and the Secretary of Education have asked them to do, \nwhich is to get more involved in the education of their children, to \nsave--most of the benefit of this bill will be used by parents of kids \nin public schools. And the truth is, because the benefits of this bill \ngo right on through college and graduate school, most of the savings \nwill be used for college and graduate school.\n  Mr. President, I know the President of the United States has \nindicated that he will veto this bill. I appeal to him to reconsider \nthat statement. This is a good bill that ought to be the basis of a \nbroader agreement on how to give the parents and children and teachers \nand school administrators of our country some room to innovate reform \nand improve the quality of public education.\n  I urge the President not to use that veto pen, but instead to ask my \ncolleague from Georgia and others who support this bill to come up to \nthe White House. Let us sit down and reason together and see whether we \ncan use this bill as the basis of a broader agreement on education \nimprovement in our country.\n  The conference committee, the majority of whom were members of the \nRepublican Party, took some steps in the direction of accommodation. \nThey removed the school block grant and the testing amendments which \nwere objectionable to most Democrats. That creates a spirit of \ncompromise. I urge the President to respond to that by moving toward \nthe sponsors of this bill and seeing if we can attach to it, in some \nfashion here legislatively, some of the school construction and \nreduction of school size proposals that are good proposals that the \nPresident has made.\n  The point is, this conference report offers us an opportunity. Let's \nnot respond to it defensively and rigidly. Let's keep in mind not the \nstatus quo, those with a vested interest in the status quo of our \neducation system, but the millions of our children who are not \nreceiving a good education in our schools today. Let's give them the \nopportunity to dream and realize their dreams.\n  I thank my colleagues. I urge a vote for this conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor his arduous efforts on behalf of education reform. I yield up to 10 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. President, when this bill was last before this body, I voted \nagainst it. I voted against it because it had some amendments to which \nI could not agree. Those amendments have been removed by the conference \ncommittee. I am very pleased to announce my support for this bill.\n  To some, this bill will not be politically correct. For me, it is \ntime to try new initiatives in education and to be guided in the future \nnot necessarily by what is politically correct, but by what works in \nthe homes, in the families and in the schools all across this great \ncountry.\n  If this bill encourages savings for education, our country will be \nbetter for it. If it encourages parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles \nto help their families' children become educated, this will be a major \nachievement. I believe this bill will help. I am happy to support it. \nI, too, urge the President of the United States reconsider and to not \nveto it.\n  I have heard this bill called many things, but let's analyze for a \nmoment what this bill does do. It increases the limit of contributions \nfrom $500 to $2,000 for an education savings account which is currently \navailable for postsecondary education. Thus, families will be able to \nquadruple the annual contributions they can now make into education \nsavings accounts. It allows families to spend the money from these \naccounts on elementary and secondary education, both public and \nprivate.\n  Of course, there is the rub. Some feel we should not provide anything \nfor private education. I disagree. The bill enables people other than \nparents--grandparents, aunts, uncles--to contribute to a niece, nephew, \nor grandchild's education and to get a small tax deduction for so \ndoing. It provides grants to States to implement teacher testing and \nmerit pay programs at a time when everyone is concerned about education \nand sees that teaching is one of the most productive investments we can \nmake to improve learning. It allows schools to use existing state \nschool innovation funds (ESEA Title IV) funds to reward schools with \ngrants when they demonstrate high achievement. It allows weapons \nbrought to school to be admitted as evidence in any internal school \ndisciplinary proceeding, the bill I introduced with Senator Byron \nDorgan.\n  Now, the key feature of this bill is that it creates incentives for \npeople to save for education. Some have said this bill benefits the \nrich. I disagree. These accounts would be available to couples earning \nunder $150,000 a year and to single people earning under $95,000 a \nyear. This will help many Americans.\n  A major reason I support this bill is that Americans are not good \nsavers. Our current savings rate has dropped from 4.3 percent in 1996 \nto 3.8 percent in 1997. Americans today save at one-third the rate that \npeople save in Germany, at one-third the rate they save in France, and \nat one-third the rate they save in Italy.\n  If this bill encourages people to save for the education of their \nchildren--whether they use that in public education, in private \neducation, in religious education--I am all for it. The point is, let's \nencourage America's families to save for education. If we\n\n[[Page S6921]]\n\nfail to save for education, if we fail to place a value on education, \nwe will sink as a first-class society. That is what I think is the \noverwhelming message of this bill--we value education.\n\n  As has been said, the Joint Tax Committee has estimated that 58 \npercent--that is nearly 60 percent--of the tax benefit would accrue to \nthose taxpayers filing 10.8 million returns with children in public \nschools. In California, out of 13 million tax returns filed, 10.4 \nmillion or 78 percent of tax returns reflect earnings under $50,000. \nThe average per capita income in California in 1998 is $28,500. One out \nof every four students lives with a single parent. This bill could, in \nfact, help many Californians.\n  Let's take the example of a family that earns less than $30,000 a \nyear. And if you have a grandparent who could save and contribute, an \naunt who could save and contribute, an uncle who could save and \ncontribute, this bill gives them an incentive to save for their \ngrandchild or niece or nephew. Plus, we are saying we value this kind \nof savings. After all, if we can authorize it for postsecondary \neducation, why don't we authorize it for primary education? The reason \nis simple: Some people here say you shouldn't provide anything for \nprivate schooling. I say if a family can accumulate savings and thus \nhave a choice of whatever school they want their youngster to go to, as \nlong as that youngster receives a good education, is that not really \nwhat government is all about?\n  Mr. President, I am very happy to support this bill. I want to make \none other comment. I am particularly pleased that the conferees \naccepted the Safer Schools Act of 1998. This provision is based upon a \nbill which Senator Dorgan and I introduced. It ensures that if a \nstudent brings a gun to school, the gun will be admissible as evidence \nin any school disciplinary hearing. As we are all acutely aware, we \nhave seen a wave of tragedy in recent months involving students \nshooting other students. It goes without saying that schools should be \nsafe places. Schools should be for books and learning, not guns and \nshooting. So I hope we will take comprehensive action to reduce these \ntragedies in the coming months. I would like to work with those who \nwant to help do just that.\n  In the meantime, I am pleased that we are taking this common-sense \nstep today to reduce the risk by ensuring that our schools can safely \nexpel students who bring guns into their school.\n  In summary, again, to some this bill is simply not politically \ncorrect. To me, it encourages American families to save for what is the \nmost vital aspect of American life and that is giving our youngsters a \ngood education. People can put their money into an IRA and they can \nthen use this money based on their own choice for public education, for \ntutoring, for books and tuition, for private education or for religious \neducation. I believe the time has come to try new initiatives.\n  I thank Senator Coverdell, Senator Torricelli, and those who have \nproposed and supported this legislation. I am happy to join with them.\n\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes from the \nleader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will oppose the Coverdell education \nIRA bill. In my view, it provides precious little help to parents and \neven less help to schools. The IRA provisions of the bill do not \nprovide any real opportunity for schools to improve themselves. In the \ndebate we had here in the Senate, it was clear that most of the efforts \nto improve the bill and get to what I would refer to as core \neducational issues were rejected. And one key provision that was \naccepted has, of course, now been stripped out of the bill by the \nconference committee; that is, a provision that tries to address the \nvery serious dropout crisis that we have in our schools.\n  I believe that a failure to give attention to this crisis is perhaps \nthe best example of the limitations of this bill. Each day that there \nis school in this country, we have an average of 3,000 students between \ngrades 7 and 12 who leave school and leave permanently before \ngraduating. In many schools, the graduating class is half the size of \nthe entering freshman class of 4 years before.\n  Unfortunately, a disproportionate number of the students who are \ndropping out are Hispanic. We see that problem in real terms in my home \nState where our Hispanic population is large. Those students often \nattend the most overcrowded and least well-equipped schools in the \nNation. The vast majority of our dropouts are not Hispanic, though, and \nthey are Anglo students--students from all ethnic and racial \nbackgrounds who are bothered with watered-down classes. They are \nalienated from large schools where nobody seems to care about the work \nthey do.\n  To address this problem, I proposed an amendment, along with Senator \nReed, which was the dropout prevention provision of the bill. The \nSenate adopted this proposal to provide $150 million in dropout \nprevention funds to authorize that funding by a vote of 74-26. So, \nclearly, there was strong support here in the Senate for this \ninitiative.\n  With this $150 million, we could have provided funding to help \nschools that have the highest dropout rates, to reduce those dropout \nrates and transform their educational programs so that students would \nstay. With the $150 million, we could have taken the first concrete \nsteps toward meeting the bipartisan goal that President Bush and the 50 \nGovernors agreed to back in 1989 when they met in Charlottesville. The \ngoal was that at least 90 percent of our students would complete high \nschool. Despite the obvious need for this dropout prevention effort and \nthe overwhelming support that we had here in the Senate for this \namendment, the provision has been dropped from the bill that is before \nus today.\n  I believe that the House and Senate need to address these core \neducational issues. I hope very much that there is an opportunity in \nthe appropriations bills that we consider to have a serious debate and \nhopefully do better to get the Federal Government on the side of \naddressing core educational issues.\n  This conference report that we are going to vote on does little, but \nit promises much. In that regard, I think the people of the country are \nbeing misled about the extent of the effort and extent of the \naccomplishment that we are talking about today. I was very proud to be \nwith Senator Reed, Congressman Hinojosa, and well-known actress/\nentertainer Rita Moreno yesterday at a press conference where we talked \nabout the importance of the dropout problem and the importance of \ngetting Federal support to deal with that. I am disappointed that the \nconference report on this Coverdell bill does not include any provision \nto help address the crisis.\n  I intend to vote against the bill.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana off our side's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Coverdell for his work and \nSenator Torricelli, on our side, who has contributed so much to this \ndebate. It gets down to basics: Are we interested in helping kids and \nfamilies or helping buildings? I think the clear argument is that we \nshould be helping students and helping families educate their children, \nwherever they attend school.\n  One of the arguments against this bill I have heard is that, well, it \ngives some type of Government assistance to private or parochial \nschools. I want to address that issue because I think it is not a \nlegitimate concern. I have a book here that is put out by the \nDepartment of Education, our Federal department here in Washington. It \nis a book of all the programs that exist currently where Federal tax \ndollars are used to help students regardless of where they go to \nschool, as long as it is a legitimate school. This book is full of \nprograms. It has about 70 pages of Federal programs that go to \nchildren. If you are poor, if you are disadvantaged, or if you have a \ndisability, you can use that assistance to go to the school you want to \ngo to.\n  Now, the largest program we have in the Federal Government is Title I \nof\n\n[[Page S6922]]\n\nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It has been federal law \nsince 1965. Let me read where Title I funds go:\n\n       Elementary and secondary education as originally passed by \n     Congress in 1965. Under this legislation, private school \n     students, private school teachers, private school other \n     personnel are included in the program.\n\n  We do that already. We have done it since 1965. One in four schools \nin the country happen to be private or parochial. We are talking about \nhelping the child get a better education, which is in the national \ninterest. Yet, people say we are breaking a tradition of not helping \nprivate or parochial schools. We have bookloads of programs that do \nexactly that. This bill is consistent with that--completely and \ntotally.\n  In addition to Title I, which goes to students, like this education \nsavings account goes to the families and students, we have other \nprograms in the book. I will mention one or two. Child nutrition \nprograms--do we not help private/parochial students with child \nnutrition programs? Of course, we do. It is important. Students with \ndisabilities also get help.\n  What about students who are not disadvantaged and do not have a \ndisability? Are we going to ignore them? That is the largest group of \npeople out there. I suggest this makes a great deal of sense.\n  Talk about consistent. Just last year, this Congress, this body, most \nDemocrats, and Republicans as well, voted for the $500 IRA savings \naccount for higher education. It has the same limits on income as this \nproposal. The only thing we have done is make this for students in K \nthrough 12, and parents can set aside a little private money to help \nthe child go to the school that is in their best interest to go to. We \nare not talking about a voucher; we are talking about a family taking \ntheir own money and putting their own money in their own savings \naccount to help educate their child.\n  It was very clear that the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997--the President \nsigned it and I congratulate him for participating and signing it--is \nthe same program. It is just that it was for higher education. If you \nwent to Saint Michael's College, you got a $500 savings account. Nobody \nthought that was an infringement on trying to give Federal aid to \nprivate/parochial schools. We all applauded that.\n  Let's do the same thing for the same families, with the same income \nlimits. Let them, for K through 12, set aside a private savings account \nand draw interest on it and use it for school expenses for the child. \nAll of a sudden, this is something that is novel, something we have \nnever done before. Of course, we have. We did it last year. We have \nbeen aiding those students since 1965 with the largest Federal \neducation in program, Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct.\n  Students in Louisiana, when they are in a private or parochial \nschool, get the same dollars, the same money, the same program \nbenefits, the same child nutrition programs, and the same education for \ndisabilities assistance. That is part of what our country is about--\ntrying to help educate children. We are not talking about vouchers. We \nare not talking about doing anything other than help families help \ntheir children.\n  Why do we always ignore middle-income working families? If you are \npoor, we have a program. If you have a disability, we have a program. \nIf you have other problems and special education needs, you have a \nprogram. But if you are middle income and struggling to make it and \nraise a family and keep the family together, we say no, that is an \ninfringement.\n  It is time to encourage working middle-income Americans who are \nstruggling, to help them to have more savings to invest in their \nchildren's education. Let's not encourage families to say, ``I have no \ninterest in it; let the government do it.'' We are saying let's create \nan incentive for families, middle-income working families, to help \ntheir children K through 12, and not be, I think, arguing that somehow \nwe are breaking new ground, and saying ``My God, what are we going to \ndo?'' We are doing what we have done consistently since the government \nhas been involved in trying to help many families and help counties and \nparishes in my State improve the educational systems in their \nrespective.\n  I commend this bill for our support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself 5 minutes of \nleader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that we are here today again to discuss \neducation. It is probably the most critical issue that we have before \nus in this country. Parents know it. Community leaders know it. Our \nfamilies across this country want all of us to address the important \nissues of education so that every child in America, no matter where \nthey come from, have the opportunity to get the American dream in \ntoday's society.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us--the Coverdell A+ bill, will only \nhelp those people who can afford to put away $2,000 a year. \nUnfortunately, that will not be a lot for parents out there who are \nworried about their child's education, or the children in our \nneighborhoods who we all worry about and whether or not they will get \nthe skills they need to go out in the job market and to succeed.\n  Mr. President, there are ways that we can help every child in America \nget a good education. I have been on the floor many times to talk about \nthe issue of class size, and how too many children are in overcrowded \nclassrooms today and don't get the individual attention that they need \nin order to succeed. I have had many young people tell me that when \nthey are in a math class with 35 students, they don't get the \nopportunity to ask their teacher for individual help when they don't \nunderstand. Yet, we sit on this floor and decry the fact that too many \nof our young children today don't get the skills they need in math and \nscience, so they can go on and be competitive in tomorrow's world. We \ncan make a difference if we reduce class size.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send a bill to the desk for \npurposes of introduction today that will address the fact of class \nsize.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Reserving the right to object, is the Senator sending \na bill to the desk?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Just for introduction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the bill I sent to the desk on behalf of myself, \nSenator Daschle and many other Members, will add 100,000 teachers to \nour workforce across this country so that we can begin the process of \nmaking sure that every student has a well-qualified teacher in a class \nthat has a number of students to whom that teacher can pay attention.\n  Mr. President, this is a beginning step that will make a difference \nfor average children across our country. I think it is essential we \naddress many of the issues I have heard my colleagues talk about.\n  Senator Feinstein spoke for a moment about violence in school. I have \nhad teachers tell me, I have had police officers tell me there are so \nmany kids in our classes today that they don't get individual \ninstructions. They feel anonymous in our neighborhoods and in our \nclassrooms. And, as a result, we are seeing some of the impacts in our \nschools today, and we are reading about some of the headlines that we \nare seeing when violence hits our schools. Reducing class size so that \nchildren have individual attention when they need it so they don't feel \nanonymous makes a difference in addressing those issues.\n  I heard Senator Bingaman talk about dropout prevention. He has done \nan outstanding job. He has been a leader in our Nation in addressing \nthis critical issue of class size reduction so that children get the \nattention they need, the help they need which will make a difference in \ndropout prevention.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues today to reject the bill in front \nof us. It does little; it promises a lot. If we really focus on the \nissues that parents and students and teachers know will make a \ndifference, we can change what is happening in our country today. We \nhave a responsibility to do that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\n  I retain the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank Senator Coverdell for bringing some creativity into our \npublic education system.\n  If you talk to parents and teachers in America, it is clear that many \nof them are frustrated, because they are not satisfied with the \neducation children are getting in our public schools. So we can take \none of two approaches to address this problem.\n  We can take the approach that we will continue to just go along as we \nhave been year after year after year while the money spent on education \ngoes up and up at the same time that test scores go down and our \nnation's children are increasingly unable to compete. We can do that. \nBut we don't have to.\n  We have today an opportunity to bring some innovation into our public \nschool system. We can give parents and their children more options and \nmore opportunity at success. That is what the Coverdell bill does, and \nI thank the senator for his leadership in shepherding this bill through \nCongress.\n  This bill adds options--options for parents to give their kids a \nbetter chance at success. Under the Coverdell A+ bill, parents will be \nable to save after-tax dollars and use those funds on a tax-free basis \nfor a whole variety of K-through-college education expenses. Even \ngrandparents can contribute to these education savings accounts. As the \ncost of college in particular continues to climb, this added savings \ntool for parents will become essential for more and more American \nfamilies. But in addition to enhancing the ability of families to save \nfor college, the bill also addresses the need all parents have of \nsupporting their children's elementary and high school education.\n  I heard Senator Bingaman talk about the dropout rate among Hispanics. \nI am alarmed at that statistic. But I don't understand, knowing that we \nhave this problem, why we can't go forward and say what will take \ninnovative steps to help make our kids more motivated and more able to \nsucceed in school. What can we do?\n  The Coverdell bill gives families options they do not presently have. \nIt allows parents to set aside an extra amount of money, up to $2,000 \neach year, to enhance their elementary and secondary education \nopportunities for their children. One option they will have is to then \nuse that money, tax-free, for private or parochial school, if they feel \nthat is the atmosphere that will be best for their children.\n  Parents would also have the option of adding tools to enhance their \nchild's education in public school, like buying the child a computer. \nThat would be allowed in the Coverdell bill, and buying a child extra \nbooks so that the child can go beyond just what is in the classroom and \nenhance his or her knowledge; even buying band uniforms, because we \nknow that children who participate in extracurricular activities are \nthe ones most likely to stay in school, to be interested and to do \nbetter in school. In fact, we have seen that children who have arts \nclasses do better in the other classes as well. So buying school-\nrelated art supplies would be another option that is conceivably \nallowed under the Coverdell bill.\n  So as we witness the continued underperformance of our public school \nsystem, we are offering through this bill originality and creativity \nthat will save children who might otherwise be lost in the present \nsystem.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference committee kept my \namendment that passed on the Senate floor by a 69 to 29 vote to allow \nthe option of public, single-sex schools and classrooms.\n  This is not a mandate, of course. But many parents try to send their \nchildren to single-sex private schools because they think they will \nhave a better chance in that environment. In fact, many studies show \nthat for some children, single-sex education is their best chance at \nacademic and life-long success. In a single-sex environment, hundreds \nof thousands of America's children have reported that they are allowed \nto excel, flourish, and grow, because they are not hampered by the \ndistractions and disruptions that are found in many coed environments.\n  I am pleased that we have in our education budget an innovative \neducation reform program. It is called title VI. Title VI funds a wide \nvariety of education reform projects, almost anything a school, \ncommunity, or state feels will be in the best interests of their \nchildren and will help improve students' academic performance. And the \nDepartment of Education can give grants for these innovative programs.\n  What my amendment and this bill will do is specifically include \nsingle-sex schools and classrooms as one of the innovative education \napproaches that can be funded under Title VI.\n  We have an example that has gotten wide notoriety of late. It is the \nYoung Women's Leadership School in East Harlem, in the New York City \npublic schools. This is an elementary school. This school has a 90-\npercent attendance rate, one of the highest in the New York City public \nschools. They are well above the average in test scores in both math \nand English. When interviewed, the girls who go to this school say they \nlove going to school; they feel safe there. And they are excelling. \nThis is a success story.\n  However, the bad news is the ACLU and the National Organization of \nWomen are suing to close this school, and have filed a complaint with \nthe U.S. Education Department to cut off all the school's federal \nfunding. They say the school violates the constitutional equal \nprotection clause and Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments Act. In \naddition to the obvious question of why in the world anyone would want \nto close this school down when it does so much good for the young girls \nwho attend it, these groups' legal arguments are absolutely wrong. \nTitle IX and the equal protection clause were intended to be protection \nagainst discrimination, not against educational enhancements for \nstudents who choose to learn in an environment where they can excel. In \nfact, in the amendment that is in the bill before us, it specifically \nstates that one can offer options of single-sex classes or schools only \nif comparable opportunities are given for the other sex. That standard \nis fair, and that standard will protect against any possible \ndiscrimination against one sex or the other. In fact, that is why the \nstate of Virginia lost in its defense of the previously all-male \nVirginia Military Institute, because the state did not offer a \ncomparable educational opportunity for women. Time after time we have \nseen the courts uphold single-sex schools.\n  What we want is for every parent in our country to have the same \noption that a parent who can afford a private school has. The parent \nwho can afford a private school can choose among all the options--\nsingle-sex private schools, single-sex parochial schools, coeducation \nat parochial schools or private schools. They have these options. \nParents of public school students do not. This bill and my amendment \nwill allow every family to make these choices and do what is best for \ntheir children.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud that I am a product of public \neducation. I think free, public education is what makes this country \ndifferent from every other country in the world, because we open our \neducational system to every child. Why not offer even more opportunity \nto every child and thereby improve every child's chance to achieve the \nAmerican dream?\n  That is what the bill before us does, and that is why I strongly \nsupport this bill. I hope it will pass by an overwhelming margin, and I \nhope the President will see that the bill's benefits to America's \nfamilies are so great that he could not possibly veto this legislation \nand halt this historic opportunity to give parents and their children \nmore and better education options.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Coverdell.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nJersey is recognized to speak up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first let me say at the end of this long road how \npleased I have been to work with the Senator from Georgia. He has \nreached across\n\n[[Page S6924]]\n\nthe aisle to Senator Feinstein, Senator Breaux, Senator Graham, Senator \nLieberman, and others in making this a genuine bipartisan effort. I \nadmire his leadership and appreciate very much his extended hand that \nhas brought us to this day.\n  Mr. President, I want at the outset to begin, even at a moment of \nsome personal satisfaction, by stating some considerable \ndisappointment. The 105th Congress was to be the ``Congress of \neducation,'' the time in which America was going to finally face the \nreality that the great variable in American life is the quality of the \neducation we are affording our children. Recognizing that with a \nquality education accorded to our children everything--at a time of \nglobal competition and rising technological standards--is possible and \nwithout it everything is in peril, the President challenged Congress to \ntake leadership in the rebuilding of our schools, the raising of \nstandards through voluntary testing, and the hiring of new teachers to \nreduce class size. Perhaps this was done because the President, like \nall of us, recognized that it is late. Forty percent of American fourth \ngraders are failing to attain a basic level in reading; 40 percent of \neighth graders are failing basic tests in mathematics. In math and \nscience, America ranks 19th of 21 industrial nations.\n  Thomas Edison once noted that ``discontent is the necessity of \nprogress.'' Every Member of this Senate should feel discontent because \nin the year of education, the Congress that was to take up all of these \nchallenges has failed in all but this one last chance.\n  The Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, has worked in the last year \nto bring before this Congress a simple, a modest but nevertheless an \nimportant addition in the fabric of American education, the A+ savings \naccount. This provision returns to the Senate floor from a conference \ncommittee without any of the objectionable amendments that I and my \nDemocratic colleagues rightfully found both disconcerting and, indeed, \ncontrary to the efforts to improve educational quality in America. All \nthat remains is the simple and bipartisan effort to provide for working \nAmerican families the chance to save their own money to educate their \nown children in the school of their choice.\n  It is simple, it is direct, but nevertheless it is important. Taken \nin its most basic form, this is an invitation for $12 billion of new \nmoney to enter American education. My colleagues, that cannot be bad. \nAt a time when American schools struggle to pay teachers, to repair \nthemselves, to improve curriculum, new money--without a dollar of \ntaxpayers' contribution--all given voluntarily by American families, \ncannot be bad, and yet there are objections.\n  It is claimed that this will be, as you will hear on this floor in \nthe debate to follow, a diversion of public resources, a threat to the \npublic schools. My colleagues, not a dollar, not a dime of public money \nis being taken from the public schools--nothing. It is all private \nmoney. Whatever the public schools got yesterday, after this bill \nbecomes law, they will get tomorrow.\n  Then it is argued, well, it may not be a diversion from the public \nschools, but it will help a privileged few.\n  Mr. President, on the contrary, this Senate last year argued, in \nestablishing almost identical accounts to educate college students, \nthat we should put a cap on this tax benefit--$90,000 for a single \nparent, $150,000 for a married couple. Under this proposal by the \nSenator from Georgia, we have adopted the identical income caps--not \nfor the privileged few but for working-class families who want to \ncontribute to the education of their own children.\n  Like the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux, I make no apologies. How \nmany Members of this Senate line up on the Senate floor to either have \nprograms designed for the poor or the privileged few, tax benefits for \nthe rich, or Government programs for the poor? Finally, there is a \nchance to stand on the floor of this Senate Chamber to help the \neducation of working middle-income, middle-class Americans. And that \ncannot be bad.\n  Then it will be said, ``Perhaps it doesn't help the privileged few, \nand perhaps it doesn't divert money from public education, but it \ndoesn't help everybody.'' If Senators come to the floor to object to \nevery piece of legislation because it doesn't help everybody, they will \nhave a frustrating experience in this Senate. I learned a long time ago \nnever to make the perfect the enemy of the good. We help as many people \nas we can in each instance when we can, and that is exactly what the \nCoverdell legislation does.\n  Mr. President, 70 percent of the families who will benefit from these \ntax-free savings accounts will be families who earn under $75,000 a \nyear--70 percent. That is the vast majority of the American people. \nDoes it include everybody? No. But the vast majority of Americans will \nhave an opportunity to save under these A+ savings accounts.\n  Who are these families? And how will it help? In one of the great \nironies of this legislation, 75 percent of those families who will \nbenefit now have their students, their own children, in public schools. \nThe greatest beneficiaries are public school students, simply because \nthe overwhelming majority of American students go to the public \nschools. Under our legislation, the money in these savings accounts can \ngo to buy a home computer, school uniform, and afterschool activity, a \nschool band instrument, books, or--most important, in my judgment--the \nhiring of a public school teacher after school to be a tutor to a \npublic school student struggling in math or science.\n  There was an article in the Washington Post a few weeks ago, quoting \na young woman, Tiffany Johnson, a high-school senior in Maryland, who \nsaid, ``It's totally impossible to function [in school] without a \ncomputer. . . . It's a big handicap not to have one at home.''\n  Mr. President, 61 percent of all public school students in America \ntoday are doing their homework and their school work with no computer--\nunless they are a minority student. If they are black or Hispanic, 85 \npercent have no access to a home computer, creating a new stratum in \nAmerican education that is potentially dangerous economically, \neducationally, and socially. It is not simply that the A+ savings \naccounts are the best idea to get computers in the hands of these \nstudents, it is not they are the best idea, it is the only such idea \nbefore this Congress, because these accounts will allow public school \nstudents to purchase that new tool of education.\n  Then there are those 10 percent of Americans who choose to send their \nchildren to private schools. There is a benefit here for them, too, in \nhelping to ease the burden of tuition. In the great cities of America, \nfrom New York to Los Angeles to Chicago to Newark and Miami, the \nparochial private schools in America today almost uniformly are \ndesigned to help the working poor. Mr. President, 65 percent of the \nstudents in Newark and Camden in parochial schools are black and \nHispanic. Their tuition is $1,500, $1,600, $1,800 a year. It cannot be \nbad that these middle-income, working-class families, struggling to pay \nthese tuitions in these cities, who want an alternative to the public \nschools, get a chance to save their own money tax-free to pay that \ntuition.\n  It is no coincidence, in my judgment, in the last few years in the \nHouse of Representatives, the principal Democratic sponsor of this \nlegislation was former Congressman Floyd Flake who, in the heart of \nQueens, took an African American church, built a school based on \npeople's own savings in a struggling working-class neighborhood, and \nnow says that this, and this singularly, could help those families pay \nthis tuition bill. This is a community that asked for nothing from the \nFederal Government but to rebuild itself with its own resources. Mr. \nPresident, I come here today with the same belief--$12 billion in \nresources from working families to educate their own children, public \nand private.\n  But there is one more thing that is, to me, as exciting as any of \nthese statistics, impacting any of these neighborhoods or communities, \nand it is this. I remember a time in America where the education of a \nchild was a family responsibility. Communities rushed to choose school \nboard members; parents came after school; grandparents were involved in \nthe grades and the homework. Somehow, in the last generation of \nAmerica, we decided that education was now the province of bureaucrats \nand unions and everybody but parents and families themselves.\n\n[[Page S6925]]\n\n  Senator Coverdell and I, I hope, if we create nothing else with this \nlegislation, we have provided an invitation to get them back involved \nin American education, because from the birth of a child these savings \naccounts are available to grandparents at birthdays, aunts, uncles, \nchurches, unions, employers, to put money in these accounts where \neveryone is involved, again, in preparing for a child's future. If that \nmoney is not used in high school or grade school, every dollar of it \ncan be rolled into a savings account for college that we established \nlast year in the Senate under the leadership of President Clinton.\n  I believe it is a compelling case. It is not a perfect answer. It \ndoes not solve every educational problem in America. But it is an \nimportant, if modest, beginning in a great debate.\n  I have a great hope for this Senate, a great hope, that in the next \ndecade, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, and conservatives will be \ninvolved in a fierce competition for who has the best ideas to rebuild \nAmerican education; who can challenge the American people to do the \nmost for rising standards, greater access to opportunity; who can reach \ninto the heart of our cities and challenge parents that I, and I alone, \nhave the best idea for your child.\n  This is the beginning of that debate. From here, we can go to school \nconstruction, lowering class size, national testing, a host of ideas. \nAnd, in spite of my alliance with the Senator from Georgia on this \nissue so that we have made this bipartisan, I want my party to win that \nfight. And I believe we can. I think we have the most ideas. I think we \nhave the best ideas. But this idea, nevertheless, is a good idea and it \nis a beginning. I hope when we vote in a short period of time, we can \nact together.\n  Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. once said ``. . . the greatest thing in \nthis world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are \nmoving.'' This legislation, A+ savings accounts, has America moving, if \nmodestly, in the right direction. I am enormously proud to have been \npart of this effort. I am grateful to the Senator from Georgia for his \nleadership and to my Democratic colleagues for participating in what \nhas become this bipartisan effort. I urge my colleagues, by an \noverwhelming vote, to give their approval to the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Under the previous \norder, the Senator from Florida is recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, first, that Mr. \nMark Williams, a congressional fellow in my office, be allowed floor \nprivileges for the balance of the debate on this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Second, I ask unanimous consent that any of the time \nwhich I have been allocated but which will be unused will be returned \nto the minority floor leader of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I supported this bill when it passed the Senate \nseveral weeks ago. And I regretfully rise to oppose this conference \nreport. As has been said by several of the speakers, there are many \npositive elements in this legislation. I am particularly supportive of \nthose, for instance, which will make it easier for families to plan and \nprepare for the college/university education of their children and \nfamily members through things like the education savings account and \nthe prepaid college tuition plans which Florida and several other \nStates have established. Those are all positives.\n  When I face legislation at the final vote, there are two questions \nthat I ask of myself. One is, Is this legislation better than the \nstatus quo? And, second, If it is better than the status quo, is it \nsufficiently an improvement to justify the investment of public \nattention, political energy, and the likelihood that, should this \nbecome law, it will be considered this Congress' final statement on \nthis subject?\n  I find this bill, as it returned from the conference committee, to \nfail to meet that test. I think this bill is too minimalist in terms of \nits capacity to identify those major challenges that face this Nation, \nin terms of education, and to construct an appropriate Federal policy \nto move us forward in an area that will probably, more than any other, \ndetermine our Nation's status into the 21st century--the education of \nour people.\n  I believe that this legislation in the conference committee lost its \nfocus. It did not return with the balance that it had when it left this \nChamber. I am particularly concerned about the issue of school \nconstruction.\n  Admittedly, I come from a State which has experienced a dramatic \nincrease both in new students entering our school system--40,000 to \n50,000 new students every year entering the public schools of Florida--\nand a State which is reaching a point of maturity where many of its \nolder schools are requiring substantial rehabilitation. And almost all \nof our schools require the new technologies to bring them up to current \nstandards of educational modernity.\n  In this legislation, as it left the Senate several weeks ago, there \nwas what I thought was a creative provision, which received broad \nsupport in the Senate, which would have encouraged public-private \npartnerships in the construction and rehabilitation of schools. It \nwould have used a financing technique, called private facility bonds, \nwhich has been used effectively in areas such as water and sewer, \ntransportation, and housing for public school construction.\n\n  Ironically, a provision almost identical in final impact to what was \ncontained in the Senate version is now being used for private \nelementary and secondary construction. But for reasons which are \ninexplicable to me, the conference dropped that provision and therefore \nwill deny, through the Federal Tax Code incentives, the opportunity for \nmany school districts that are facing enormous pressures to be able to \nutilize that technique as a means of building and rehabilitating \nschools.\n  I hope that when we come back to this issue--and that hope is that we \nwill return before this Congress adjourns--that the central role of \nadequate school facilities in achieving adequate education, and the \nrole which the Federal Government can play creatively in helping us \nprovide those adequate physical facilities, will be reexamined.\n  I am also concerned, Mr. President, as to a provision which was \ndropped at the front door but seems to have reentered at the back door \nrelative to block grants for Federal education.\n  Since the 1960s, the Federal Government has focused its attention on \neducation in three primary areas: One, civil rights; two, the at-risk \nstudent, whether that was a handicapped student, a student from a \ndisadvantaged background, or other factors which made that student a \ngreater educational risk and generally a more expensive student to \neducate than the general student population; and, third, access to \nhigher education through a variety of Federal grants and loans.\n  There was a provision which many of us objected to which would have \nprovided that those carefully crafted, long-standing pillars of Federal \neducation policy would be collapsed into block grants. I am pleased \nthat that attack through the front door was dropped. But I am concerned \nthat there still is in this legislation an attack through the back \ndoor.\n  I bring your attention to page 12 of the report which outlines the \nlegislation. And under the category of ``State Incentives For Teacher \nTesting And Merit Pay,'' the first section talks about State incentives \nthrough a grant program for teacher testing and merit pay.\n  I would like to say, as an aside, personally, while I was a member of \nthe Florida State legislature, and later as Governor, I supported \nconcepts of teacher testing, both upon entry into the profession and \nwhile in the profession. And we established what we called a career \nladder, which was a form of recognition of the superior teacher. So I \nam, as a matter of policy, inclined to support the principles.\n  But what concerns me is a provision that says, under paragraph (e), \n``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State may use Federal \neducation\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\nfunds--to carry out [these two purposes of teacher testing and \nestablishing a merit pay program for teachers].''\n  As I read this, what we are saying is that we have returned to this \nconcept of a block grant by saying that a State, without any other \nconstraints, because ``notwithstanding any other provision of law''--it \nis not limited to elementary, secondary funds, but all education \nfunds--vocational funds, higher education funds, elementary, secondary \nfunds, maybe even funds for specialized programs such as veterans \neducational benefits--that a State can collapse all of those funds into \na block grant for the purposes of teacher testing and establishment of \na merit pay plan. I think that is a very bad educational policy and, in \nand of itself, makes this conference report unacceptable.\n  So, Mr. President, I reluctantly will oppose this legislation. I do \nso in the hope that when the President has exercised his stated \nintention to veto this legislation, and we are back to ground zero with \nwhat should the Congress do relative to a Federal role in enhancing our \nNation's educational opportunities for its children and for its adults, \nthat we will come back to this task with a new spirit of \nbipartisanship, with a commitment to a clear diagnosis of what are the \nprincipal shortfalls in our education system, and what the Federal role \nshould be in attempting to overcome those deficiencies.\n  There is no task more important to our Nation, as we face a new \ncentury, than a renewed commitment to education. It will be the key to \nour ability, in an increasingly globalized economy, to be able to \nmaintain the American standard of living while we are also competitive \nin the world economy.\n  The only means by which we will do so will be to assure that each \nAmerican is as fully prepared to be as productive and as contributing \ntowards our total economy and our total society as they can be because \nwe have given them the opportunity of the best possible education.\n  Mr. President, again, I regret that we are not able to move forward \nwith this legislation today, but I commend the Senator from Georgia for \nhis very genuine interest and his leadership in this area, and hope \nthat leadership will soon be rewarded. Thank you.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am sorry to hear that the Senator has \ncome to the conclusion he cannot vote for it. As he knows, I did agree \nwith him on the school construction component and was outvoted. I \nthought the Senator made a good contribution to the legislation. I \nyield up to 5 minutes from our side to the distinguished Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nEducation Savings and School Excellency Act that is embodied in the \nconference report which is before the Senate today. I take the \nopportunity to congratulate and commend Senator Coverdell for his \nleadership and, indeed, a bipartisan leadership of Democrats and \nRepublicans attempting to deal with the most important area that we \nface as a Nation, and that is improving the educational opportunities \nfor our children. That is critical. This bill makes a great \ncontribution to education in a number of areas.\n  First, it gets parents more involved in educational decisions by \nincreasing the annual contribution limits into a child's education \nsavings account. I can't think of anything better. There are some \npeople who don't want to do that. I don't know why. Why wouldn't you \nwant to give people of modest means the ability to provide for the \neducational choice that they decide is best for their child?\n  It increases those accounts from $500 to $2,000, and the bill allows \na parent or a grandparent to really make an impact on a child's \neducation. More parental involvement is an absolute critical piece of \nthe educational puzzle. We must do everything we can to give parents \nmore power in education, and that is what this bill does, because when \nparents have input into educational decisions, the children are \nwinners. It seems all too often that we are worried about everybody but \nthe children. That is what it comes down to. This bill helps parents \nand children.\n  In addition to more parental involvement, another critical education \nreform relates to teachers. We simply must make sure that all teachers \nare competent in the subjects they teach. Most teachers are, and, \nindeed, we have dedicated, great teachers who make magic in the \nclassroom. That is why there are particular important provisions in \nthis bill that give to States and will give to local school districts \nthe ability to reward the great and the outstanding educators in the \nclassroom by making merit pay available.\n  Why not give to the best and the brightest? And why not allow local \nschool districts, working with their teachers, working with their local \nschool boards the opportunity to design programs to do exactly that? \nGive the best and the brightest the compensation they are entitled to; \nreward them with merit pay.\n\n  Secondarily, why shouldn't we see to it that every teacher who \nteaches our children is competent and proficient in the subject matters \nthat they are teaching? We can't pay the great teachers enough, but we \nshould attempt to find a system that does reward them. In addition to \nthat, outstanding performances should be recognized.\n  I am pleased to see that the conference included the merit amendment \nthat Senator Mack and I offered. Indeed, one of our colleagues spoke to \nit just recently and indicated, wouldn't it be terrible if local school \ndistricts could actually draw revenues from other areas for this \npurpose. I think it is great. Why shouldn't they be able to make that \ndecision? Why shouldn't they set up a system that rewards the competent \nteachers? Why shouldn't they set up a system where there is regular \ntesting every 3 to 5 years to ascertain who is the best and who is the \nbrightest and who is doing the work for our children?\n  When we look at reforming our public schools, one thing must always \nbe kept foremost in our efforts: We must put our children first. Our \nchildren are the best and the brightest, and they are our most precious \nresource. A fight to reform our education system is a fight for \nAmerica's future.\n  Our children are depending on us, and it is clear that parental \ninvolvement, merit pay, teacher competency testing are necessary if we \nare going to give the children the education they need. The time for \ntalk is over; the time for action is now.\n  Again, I commend Senator Coverdell for his outstanding leadership and \nhis dedication to this process, because that is what this bill begins. \nIt is not going to solve all the problems, but it really begins to make \na difference and begins to address the area of increasing parental \nresponsibility, giving them the opportunity to make resources \navailable, and to also local districts and States, giving them the \nopportunity to provide those great teachers with the merit pay to which \nthey are entitled. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes off time \nchargeable to the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport, but let me say to the distinguished Senator from Georgia and \nothers that I appreciate the bipartisan effort and spirit that has gone \ninto it in an attempt to formulate a bill that could receive bipartisan \nsupport. Indeed, it is evident on the floor today that it has some \nbipartisan support and will pass by a significant margin.\n  Let me say also, I agree with the concerns mentioned by the Senator \nfrom Florida with respect to some changes that took place in the \nconference. The Senator from Florida and I served as Governors of our \nrespective States in the early eighties, along with the current \nPresident, the current Secretary of Education and others, and all of us \nhad education as the very top priority in terms of things that we were \ndoing.\n  Let me say with respect to this bill, though, it is, again, about \npriorities. It is not that this bill does bad things. I continue to \nsupport many of the things, and certainly encouraging parents to save \nfor education, but if you only have $1.6 billion to spend in terms\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\nof the Federal participation, it seems to me it makes more sense than \nto spend it on a tax cut that would be about $7 per family to those who \nare in the public schools and $37 a family in private schools, to spend \nit where it is most needed.\n  If 90 percent of our public schools are either in need of repair or \novercrowded, we ought to spend that money in terms of building or \nrepairing schools. We ought to spend that money to hire more teachers, \nand if technology is as important in the world economy today as we know \nit to be--indeed, as we speak, the World Congress on Information \nTechnology is concluding just across the river with nations throughout \nthe world that are here to discuss information technology--we ought to \nbe spending the money to try to assist schools in connecting to that \ninformation technology that is going to be so critical to their future.\n  I believe if we want to continue to support public education, which I \nbelieve is our principal responsibility, then we ought to spend it on \nthose most critical needs, notwithstanding the fact that this bill, as \nit currently exists, does some good things for education, but it \ndoesn't do the kind of things that, if we only have $1.6 billion to \nspend, I believe we ought to do.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have remaining to \nthe distinguished Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I could ask a question, it is my \nunderstanding that Senator Kennedy has 10 minutes of his own time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take 8 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think I have 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield; if I could have 8 minutes, I \nyield the other 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That would be wonderful.\n  Would the Senator from Massachusetts like to go next?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to have the Senator speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators have 12 minutes collectively.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Daschle gave me 3 minutes of his leader time, so \nI have 3 minutes from him, the time remaining of the Senator from \nVirginia, and 2 minutes from the Senator from Massachusetts; what might \nthat add up to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for up to 7 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, we had such a golden moment in history here in the \nSenate to do something for our children. Finally, after both parties \ntalked about how much we care about our kids, we had a chance to pass a \nbill that did something to help them. We had the opportunity to pass an \neducation bill that addressed the real issues that face parents and \nchildren every single day. We know what those are.\n  Kids have nothing to do after school. They sometimes go home to an \nempty home. We know afterschool programs are critical for these \nchildren. We know they lift up those children. We know it improves \ntheir scores when they have afterschool programs. The police tell us it \nkeeps them out of trouble at a time when the juvenile crime rate soars. \nSo we did nothing about that. I offered an afterschool amendment on \nthat on the Coverdell bill. We lost by two votes. The people on the \nother side who today say they are doing so much for education couldn't \nsupport afterschool for our kids.\n  We also know class sizes are too large. We could lower those class \nsizes. We had such an amendment to the Coverdell bill; down it went. \nAnd the amendments that did pass on school construction and dropout \nprevention, which were offered by people on our side of the aisle, were \ndropped in conference like a hot potato.\n  So what comes back to us today? A $7-a-year tax cut for people who \nsend their kids to public school, a $37 tax cut for people who send \ntheir kids to private school. This leaves unaddressed issues that face \nparents and children.\n  I didn't come to the Senate to be able to go home and say I voted for \nan education bill just for the sake of saying I voted for an education \nbill. There is not anything to this bill. ``There is no `there, there,' \n'' as someone once said. We can go home and claim we did something, but \nI wouldn't do that. I don't want to squander money on things that don't \nreally make a difference in the lives of the people who I represent.\n  We need to fix up our schools. To hear my superintendent of public \ninstruction back home talk about it, these kids are learning about \ngravity because the ceiling is falling down on their desk. They are not \nlearning about it from a textbook. But we do nothing. We walk away.\n\n  I heard my friend from New Jersey, who is supporting this bill, talk \nabout these issues. He made the best speech I ever heard on education, \nexcept nothing that he said is in this bill. What is the point in \nvoting for a bill that takes over $1 billion away from funds we could \nuse for education and gives so little benefit? It really seems to me it \nis a poor excuse for an education policy.\n  I am not going to vote for this bill today just to say I voted for \nsomething. Education is the No. 1 issue in my State. I came here to \nmake a difference in the lives of the people of my State. If we are \ngoing to spend $1.6 billion; it better be on something that helps those \nchildren.\n  In the end I think the President is not going to support this bill. \nThe President has been a very strong leader for really doing something \nfor our children. He calls for tough national standards. That is not in \nthis bill. He calls for afterschool programs. They are not in this \nbill. He calls for school construction. That is not in this bill. He \ncalls for putting 100,000 new teachers in the classrooms. That is not \nin this bill.\n  Some say this is bipartisan. To some narrow extent, it may be but \nthose supporting this bill did not really reach out and sit down with \nour President. When he was Governor, education was his No. 1 issue, and \nhe tried some good things. We could have had a bill before us that he \nsupported, that we supported, that could have become a good law. We \ncould have had a bill where I could go home and look at kids' eyes in \nmy State and say, ``I just did something to make your life better, to \ngive you a good quality education.'' I cannot do that today. I am \nextremely disappointed, extremely disappointed.\n  I hope I live to see the day that we have an action plan for our \nschools, an action plan for our families, an action plan for our \nchildren so I can go home and be proud that I really did something \nabout education.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, President Clinton long ago announced his \nintention to veto the Education Savings and School Excellence Act. For \nreasons I will describe in a moment, I oppose this bill and agree with \nthe President's decision to veto it.\n  However, apart from the merits of the legislation, I do want to thank \nChairman Roth for insisting that the appropriate place for initial \nconsideration of the Coverdell legislation was in the Finance \nCommittee, not on the floor. This legislation was reported by the \nCommittee on February 10, 1998, by a vote of 11-8.\n  This is one of those infrequent occasions in which Chairman Roth and \nI disagree on a policy matter. The good intentions of the proponents of \nexpanding the availability of education individual retirement accounts \nare clear. However, in my view the proposed changes to the education \nIRA provisions, passed just last July and effective on January 1 of \nthis year, are fraught with serious policy and technical defects. \nSecretaries Rubin and Riley have expressed strong opposition to the \neducation IRA provisions in this bill, and President Clinton agrees \nwith their recommendation that he veto this conference agreement.\n  In a letter to members of the Finance Committee dated February 9, \n1998, the Secretaries of the Treasury and Education stated that the \neducation IRA provisions in this bill would disproportionately benefit \nthe most affluent families and provide little or no benefit to lower \nand middle-income families. In addition, they indicated that the \nprovisions ``would create significant compliance problems.'' In a \nletter to Speaker Gingrich dated June 16, 1998, President Clinton \nstates ``If the conference report on H.R. 2646 is presented to me, I \nwill veto it because the A+ accounts that it would authorize are bad \neducation policy and bad tax policy.''\n  Treasury Department analyses conclude that 70 percent of the tax \nbenefits from this provision would go to the top 20 percent of all \nincome earners. In\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\na memorandum of March 2, 1998, the staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimates that 52 percent of the tax benefits of the enhanced \neducation IRA provision would to 7 percent of taxpayers: those with \ndependents already enrolled in private primary or secondary schools. \nThe Joint Committee memorandum indicates that the per tax return \nbenefit for taxpayers with children in private schools will be five \ntimes greater than the benefit to taxpayers with children in public \nschools.\n  This bill will not result in greater opportunity for middle and lower \nincome families to send children to private schools, as supporters \ncontend. Instead, it will merely provide new tax breaks to families \nalready able to afford private schools for their children. If the \nproponents are truly concerned about the middle class, the tax benefits \nshould be targeted there. In order to accomplish this, the income \nlimits would have to lowered, and the ability to circumvent those \nlimits would have to be prevented.\n  Nor will this legislation result in an increase in national savings. \nThe expansion of the education IRA will provide further incentives for \ntaxpayers to shift money to tax-favored accounts, and to spend funds \nthat would otherwise be used for retirement.\n  Further, the additional complexity these new provisions would add to \nthe Internal Revenue Code is of real concern. Taxpayers are just \nbeginning to become aware of the hundreds of changes made in the 1997 \ntax bill. And now we are considering additional changes to a provision \nthat became effective on January 1, 1998. More confusion for taxpayers; \na boon for H Block.\n  A week after a vote in the House to terminate the Internal Revenue \nCode for among other things its mind-numbing complexity, we have before \nus a bill that would create a maze of rules in attempting to define \nwhat constitutes as ``qualified elementary and secondary education \nexpense.'' For example, the bill defines such expenses to include \ncomputers and related software and services, but how is the IRS to \nmonitor whether a computer (or the use of the Internet) is used by a \nchild for educational purposes or for entertainment, or by the child's \nparents for unrelated purposes?\n  Under this bill, the ability to contribute up to $2,000 per year in \nan account for elementary and secondary education expenses would sunset \nafter 2002. However, money contributed through 2002 could still be used \nfor such expenses. There will be different rules depending on whether \ncontributions were made in 1998, 1999 to 2002, or post-2002. It will be \nup to the taxpayer to track--and the IRS to examine--when funds were \ncontributed, the earnings on those funds, and whether they can be used \nfor only higher education, or both elementary and secondary education \nand higher education. Who will understand these rules?\n  Mr. President, we are already spending enough on IRAs and other tax-\nadvantaged savings vehicles. At a cost of $40 billion over 10 years, \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created the Education IRA and the Roth \nIRA, and significantly expanded existing IRAs and the tax benefits of \nState-sponsored prepaid college tuition plans.\n  Having said all of that, I must also express continued bewilderment \nat the opposition by the House of applying the income exclusion for \nemployer-provided educational assistance, which is section 127 of the \nInternal Revenue Code, to graduate students. The conference agreement \nextends the income exclusion for undergraduates, but once again fails \nto restore such treatment for graduate studies.\n  Section 127 is one of the most successful Federal education policies \nwe have. A million persons per year are provided tax-free higher \neducation by their employers; about a quarter of those are students \nenrolled in graduate-level education courses.\n  In a world of continuing education, section 127 permits an employer \nto send an employee to school to learn something new, get a degree, and \nbring the skills back into the workplace. The employee gets more \nincome, and the Federal Treasury gets more tax revenue. This is a \nprogram that works, and it administers itself.\n  This is a repeat of what took place last year. The Senate version of \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 would have made this absolutely easy; \nit made section 127 permanent for both undergraduate and graduate \nstudy. For reasons I will never understand, the Senate language was \ndropped in conference.\n  Finally, I appreciate Chairman Roth's good faith efforts in working \nwith members on both sides to try and come up with measures designed to \naddress the issue of school infrastructure. Last year, Senators Carol \nMoseley-Braun and Bob Graham brought the issue of crumbling schools to \nour attention, and they continue to be the leaders in the effort to \naddress this serious problem. Most of use would prefer not to address \nthis issue via the Tax Code, but previous attempts at more direct \nsolutions have been opposed. I am afraid that such opposition has \nresulted in the nominal tax provision we find in this bill to address a \nproblem that is estimated to cost at least $112 billion--a figure that \ndoes not include the cost of building new schools.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nconference report on the Education Savings and School Excellence Act.\n  Mr. President, whenever I return to Alaska, the one issue I \nconsistently hear about is the state of public education. I think it is \nfair to say that Alaskans and all of the American people are extremely \nconcerned that despite annually spending hundreds of billions of \ndollars at the federal, state and local level, our educational system \nis failing. The simple fact that 78 percent of all two and four-year \ncolleges offer remedial courses in math, reading and writing, suggests \nthat many high school students are being short-changed in their \nacademic preparation for adulthood.\n  The conference report before us raises the amount that parents and \ngrandparents can contribute to education savings accounts from $500 to \n$2,000. Most importantly, it allows parents to make the choice to \nwithdraw these funds tax-free for use either in college or in grades K \nthrough 12.\n  Although modest in scope, these education savings accounts will give \nreal choices to lower and middle income families who believe their \nchildren's best chance for the future lies in gaining an education in a \nprivate school.\n  Income limits insure that the benefit of these education savings \naccounts are focused on middle income families. Wealthy families most \noften do not need to use these education accounts because they can \neasily afford the cost of private K-12 tuition and because the tax base \nin wealthy communities often provides the best possible public \neducation in the country.\n  But middle and lower income families don't have the same choices that \nthe wealthy have when it comes to education because they don't have \nadequate resources to pay private tuition. Allowing these families the \nchoice of using funds in an education savings account for K though 12 \nschooling, could enable families with modest incomes to send their \nchildren to the school where they believe their child will get the best \npreparation for college.\n  What's wrong with that, Mr. President? If educational savings \naccounts can be justified for college tuition, shouldn't they also be \nallowed for the education expenses that give a child the opportunity to \napply to college?\n  Mr. President, this conference report contains an important provision \nthat will benefit many families in Alaska. Under this measure, \ndistributions from qualified state tuition programs, like Alaska's will \nbe tax exempt if the proceeds are used for college or graduate school \nexpenses.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am pleased the bill extends until 2002 the \n$5,250 per year exclusion for employer-provided educational expenses. \nHowever, I would have preferred that this exclusion would have also \napplied to graduate student expenses.\n  Mr. President, I would hope that this win-win education bill will be \nsigned by the President. It promotes greater choice for families in \nselecting their educational options for their children at a time when \nfamilies are demanding greater accountability from all of their \neducational institutions.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my intention to vote \nin favor of the conference report to the Coverdell education savings \naccounts legislation. I do not believe that this alone will save our \nnation's education\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\nsystem, and I realize that this bill will only provide limited help to \na very small percentage of students. But I believe it is one small step \nwe can take to help improve education in this country, and that it will \nopen the door for a discussion of other new approaches.\n  Let me state unequivocally that I strongly support our public school \nsystem. I believe we should be doing much more to help States and local \nschool districts address the challenges they face in improving public \nschools. Over 90% of our nation's children are educated in public \nschools, and we must not abandon our efforts to help educators, parents \nand communities provide the best education possible.\n  Unfortunately, it is becoming apparent that despite our best efforts, \nwe are not doing the best we can for our children right now. Too many \nof our children are falling behind and performing below their \npotential. Too many schools are in need of repair or modernization. Too \nmany students are bringing guns and drugs to school. Too few classrooms \nhave access to technology, and too few teachers have the training \nnecessary to help students succeed in an increasingly global, \ntechnology-based economy.\n  Clearly, it is time that we take a look at some new approaches to \nimproving education. The status quo is unacceptable and we owe it to \nour children to do better. I initially opposed the Coverdell \nlegislation in part because it included two amendments that I strongly \noppose. Both amendments --one that would block grant one-third of \nFederal education programs, and another that prohibits the development \nof voluntary national tests--were dropped in conference. I am pleased \nthat the conferees decided to omit these amendments, which I believe \nwould have seriously undermined our commitment to public school \nstudents.\n  Now that these two troubling amendments have been dropped, I have \ndecided to support the Coverdell legislation. While this legislation \nwill not solve all of the problems in public schools, it provides \nlimited assistance to families that choose to use their own money to \ndecide what type of education their children receive. I realize that it \nwill only help a small number of families, but limited doses of \ncompetition could help encourage all schools to strive to do a better \njob. In addition, this legislation sunsets after five years. If, at \nthat time, it is clear that this approach has not worked or has harmed \npublic education, Congress can decide not to reauthorize this program. \nBut I believe that there are benefits to trying this new approach now \nto see if it might contribute to the overall improvement of education \nin our country.\n  We certainly do not want to abandon public education, and I believe \nthere are better ways to help public schools address the many problems \nand challenges they face. During the course of this debate, I voted for \nmany alternative education proposals that I felt would do a better job \nat improving public education. I am still hopeful that the Senate will \nmake other education reform proposals a top priority during the \nremaining months of this session. But so far, our nation's education \nsystem has failed too many of our children--we cannot ignore that fact. \nIt is time to look to new and innovative strategies to improve \neducational opportunties in America. The Coverdell legislation could be \na small part of that effort, but it is certainly not the only step we \nshould take. I will continue to support a strong investment in our \nnation's public school system, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to make sure that happens.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this conference \nreport for the same reasons that I objected to the legislation when we \ndebated it here on the Senate floor in March. But I do not take this \nvote lightly. How we educate our kids better is a serious issue. I know \nthat in regard to the legislation proposed by Senator Coverdell, I have \na different opinion than my Catholic schools friends in Nebraska, Jim \nCunningham of the Nebraska Catholic Conference and Sister Pat Mulcahey, \nsuperintendent of the Omaha Archdiocese. But when it comes to the core \nissue of whether we want to provide a better education for America's \nyoung people, Jim, Sister Pat, and I are always on the same side: Yes, \nwe do.\n  First of all, let me say that I am deeply appreciative and respectful \nof the mission of parochial schools in Nebraska and throughout the \nnation. But I am also, and always have been, a strong supporter of \npublic schools. I would support legislation that truly helped the vast \nmajority of public school and parochial school parents improve \neducational opportunities for their children. I do not believe that \nthis legislation accomplishes that goal.\n  Granted, this legislation looks better than it did when it was \noriginally passed in the Senate. But I believe it is still flawed. This \neducation IRA bill for K-12 expenses will add significantly to the \nnearly $75 billion annually paid by taxpayers in an effort to comply \nwith the tax code. It is also an example of how Congress passes tax law \nwithout considering the cost of administering this new tax law and its \nreal impact on the American taxpayers it is supposed to help.\n  Furthermore, it makes no real investment in those areas of education \nthat are crucial to the success of our young people as they prepare to \nenter the workforce. In order to help more of our children achieve the \nAmerican Dream, we have to equip them with the skills to do so. \nTechnology programs, Title 1, and vocational education are where we \nneed to focus our efforts.\n  And so I would urge my colleagues, if we truly want to help America's \nchildren get a better education, let's invest in programs that produce \nresults, and let's make sure all of our students have the opportunity \nto benefit from them.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the conference report \nfor H.R. 2646, the Education Savings Account bill.\n  I regret that I cannot support this legislation because it contains \nseveral provisions that I do, in fact, support. In particular, I \nsupport the provision which would expand the tax benefits of qualified \nstate-sponsored prepaid tuition plans to include tax-free withdrawals \nfor qualified educational expenses. In fact, the Conference Agreement \ngoes beyond the Senate bill, and would allow private educational \ninstitutions to establish tax-favored prepaid tuition plans beginning \nin 2006.\n  I was also pleased that the Conference Report extends by 30 months \nSection 127 of the tax code to allow the income exclusion for employer-\nprovided educational assistance for undergraduates until December 31, \n2002. This measure is critically important to improving the knowledge \nand skills of our work force.\n  These particular provisions were adopted in a spirit of \nbipartisanship and with an understanding that they would provide clear \nbenefits to college-bound students. Unfortunately, these provisions are \njust a small part of a much larger package which marks a step in the \nwrong direction for federal education policy.\n  At the heart of this bill is a proposal to provide tax-free savings \naccounts, funds from which can be used to meet the educational needs of \nelementary and secondary school students. Under the guise of \n``increased choice,'' this proposal turns its back on our nation's \nlong-standing commitment to our public schools.\n  These so-called education savings accounts would cost taxpayers $1.5 \nbillion over ten years. In return for this significant expenditure, \nfamilies will receive very little benefit. Families whose children \nattend public schools--which is to say 90 percent of all students--\nwould receive just $7 annually. Families whose children attend private \nschools would receive just $37 per year.\n  Let me put that into context. In the Washington area, on average, one \nyear of private school costs between $10,000 and $14,000. At those \ncosts, this legislation provides very little assistance to the parents \nwho would choose these schools for their children.\n  Clearly, we are in need of education reforms in this country that \nwill create better educational opportunities for more children. But I \ndon't believe that draining resources away from our public schools will \nadvance the cause of reform one bit.\n  As we consider this legislation, I think that there is one important \nquestion that each member of this body should ask themselves. Aren't \nthere better ways to spend $1.5 billion for our children's education \nthan providing seven dollars a year to public school students? I \nbelieve that there are.\n  We could use that money to help hire new teachers and reduce class \nsizes\n\n[[Page S6930]]\n\nacross the country. If a teacher has 25, 30, or 35 students in his or \nher class, those students are not going to learn as well as they could \nin a class with a lower student-teacher ratio. If we can make these \nclasses smaller, we can greatly increase the learning potential of our \nchildren. The Democratic leadership has proposed committing resources \nto help hire 100,000 new teachers for kindergarten through third grade. \nIf we made this investment, it is estimated that every K through 3 \nclassroom in this country would have no more than 18 students. \nUnfortunately, the conference report we consider today does absolutely \nnothing to help hire these teachers and significantly reduce class \nsizes in this country.\n  We could use this money to help local communities meet the rising \ncosts of special education. In fact, I introduced an amendment during \nthe Senate debate on this bill to redirect its $1.5 billion cost to \nhelp state and local school districts meet the costs of special \neducation. When Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act in 1975, the federal government committed to state and \nlocal school districts that it would contribute 40 percent of the funds \nneeded for special education. However, the federal contribution has \nnever risen above 10 percent. It is estimated that states now provide \n56 percent of the financial support for special education programs and \nservices, 36 percent comes from local sources, and only eight percent \ncomes from the federal government. The burden on local taxpayers is \nincreasing dramatically with each passing day, and it will continue to \nincrease as long as we continue failing to meet the federal commitment \nto fairly share these costs. I have spoken with many mayors, school \nsuperintendents, and other local officials seeking relief and \nassistance in meeting the expenses associated with providing the \nvaluable services required by children who have special needs. \nUnfortunately, my amendment was defeated and these local officials are \nstill in search of relief.\n  We could, additionally, invest the resources used by this legislation \nin school construction so children who currently attend schools in \ndilapidated and sometimes unsafe buildings could have a quality \nlearning environment. In the richest nation in the world, we have \nschools that are literally falling apart. We have schools with broken \nheaters, bursting pipes, and leaky roofs. And beyond basic repairs, \nschools are also lacking electrical and telephone capabilities \nnecessary to install computers in our classrooms.\n  One-third of all students in this country go to school in buildings \nthat are considered structurally inadequate, and 60 percent of American \nstudents attend school in buildings that are in need of repair. In \nfact, the General Accounting Office has estimated that more than $110 \nbillion is needed to repair our schools. Clearly, this is an issue that \nshould be addressed.\n  This legislation is little more than a policy sleight of hand. It \ncreates the illusion of reform without its essence. It offers a hollow \npromise of greater choice, and it delivers negligible benefits to \nAmerican parents. The bottom line is that this bill is bad education \npolicy, and it is also bad tax policy.\n  I realize that this conference report will likely be adopted by this \nbody and by the House of Representatives. But it is my hope that it \nwill be vetoed. I appreciate that my colleagues are working to find \nsolutions to create better educational opportunities for our children. \nUnfortunately, I believe that the proposal before us is a misguided one \nthat creates false hopes instead of real opportunities. This \nlegislation would have a devastating impact on our public schools, upon \nwhich 90 percent of American children rely on for their education, and \nit would mark a missed opportunity to seriously address the education \nneeds of this nation. I hope that this conference report does not mark \nthe end of our efforts this year to improve education in this country, \nand that the Senate will be willing to work in a bipartisan spirit to \ndevelop more substantial and innovative education reform policies that \nsupport our public schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe with the leader's time and the time available \nI have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in just a few moments we will be voting \non the Coverdell conference report. The President of the United States \nhas indicated that he will veto this measure, and he is entirely wise \nto do so and to call on us, the House of Representatives and the Senate \nof the United States, to act on the sound recommendations that he has \nmade to improve public schools. But these recommendations are not just \nones from the President of the United States, but from educators across \nthe country. They have said that these recommendations outlined by the \nSenator from California are absolutely essential if we are going to \nstrengthen academic achievement and accomplishment for the young people \nof this country.\n  Now, you cannot isolate what we are doing here on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate this morning from what our Republican friends did yesterday \nin the House of Representatives on education. You can't just separate \nthese. We have the House and the Senate, combined; we are dealing with \neducation policy and we are together addressing the issue of education \nin our society.\n  Now, today we are discussing legislation will spend $1.6 billion over \na 10-year period to help private schools. We have gone through \nrepeatedly, and the Joint Tax Committee has pointed out, that 7 percent \nof the American families send their children to private schools, and 93 \npercent send their children to the public schools. The benefit of this \nprogram will go where? It will go primarily to the private schools.\n  Now, let us look at what happened yesterday in the House \nAppropriations subcommittee on education matters. While we are being \nasked here to demonstrate our great interest in the cause of improving \neducation for the nation's young people today, yesterday in the House \nof Representatives, Republicans zeroed out the summer jobs program for \nyouth across this country--zeroed it out; $871 million, gone. Find me \nan educator in this country who does not believe that funding those \nsummer jobs is light-years more important than the Coverdell program \nthat is about a potential savings that will go primarily to private \nschools. Find me a single educator who says knock out the summer jobs \nprogram. But that is what our Republican friends did just yesterday, \njust yesterday, in the House of Representatives. They will deny 530,000 \nteenagers the opportunity to gain valuable work experience during the \nsummer months.\n  What else did they do? Did we not hear last night and this morning \nabout the importance of helping American students learn math and \nscience? What did Republicans do yesterday? They cut back significantly \nthe Eisenhower Math and Science Program. What does that program do? It \nupgrades the skills of math and science teachers. Upgrading the skills \nof teachers in the public schools is one of the most important \ninvestments we can make to improve student learning. What did the \nRepublicans do? Slashed the program, the tried and true Eisenhower \nprogram, named after an important President of this country.\n  What else did they do? They cut the title I program by $400 million \nbelow the President's level. By not investing in Title I, the \nRepublicans are denying help for those needy children who are having \ndifficulty in school and are falling behind. It is an enormously \nsuccessful program. While we are over here on the U.S. Senate floor, \nsaying how we are going to have a breakthrough new program that is \ngoing to provide these brilliant new ideas in education, Republicans in \nthe House are cutting back on the title I program that has been a \nmainstay for needy children in this country, which has had bipartisan \nsupport, and they didn't stop there, Mr. President. They cut $137 \nmillion from the President's request for educational technology \nprograms to try to help the public schools that are crying out for \ncomputers and computer training. There are few high schools in this \ncountry that are up to speed and on the Information Super Highway. And \nby denying extra support for training teachers so they can use those \ncomputers and tie them into the curriculum, we are saying to the young\n\n[[Page S6931]]\n\npeople that preparing for the modern workplace is not important\n\n  Mr. President, in these programs alone, Republicans slashed $1.8 \nbillion yesterday of investment on tested, worthwhile programs. And \nRepublicans today in the U.S. Senate are saying, ``We are doing the \nmost revolutionary thing that we can for our public school students. We \nare going to provide $160 million a year in tax breaks for families.'' \nWhich families? The Joint Tax Committee says it is families who are \nsending their kids to private schools. Mr. President, if the President \nis ever-wise and ever-conscious about the importance of vetoing a piece \nof legislation, this is it.\n  I was here last night and I listened to Senators that rose in support \nof the Coverdell legislation and talked about the great study that was \ndone under the Reagan administration in 1983 called, ``A Nation At \nRisk,'' In listening to our colleagues who are supporting this \nlegislation talk about ``A Nation At Risk,'' I wondered what the Nation \nAt Risk report recommended? The fact is that the Nation At Risk \ncommission recommended raising standards for student performance, \ndevoting more time to learning, improving the quality of teachers, \nholding educators and elected officials responsible for providing \nleadership necessary to implement these reforms, and strengthening \ngraduation requirements.\n  Under the leadership of President Clinton in 1994, we took those \nrecommendations and made them central to the hallmark Goals 2000 \nlegislation. Under Goals 2000, over 90 percent of the funds go to the \nlocal community to implement standards-based reforms. What happened \nyesterday in the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee? \nThey gutted the Goals 2000 program that is helping local schools \nimplement the recommendations of ``A Nation at Risk,'' that our \ncolleagues have hailed as a call to action in education.\n  What hypocrisy, Mr. President. Over here, we are talking about how we \nare going to save our public school children, and over in the House of \nRepresentatives, the Education Appropriations Committee is gutting the \nessential programs that make a difference for schoolchildren.\n  Mr. President, we ought to see the Coverdell bill go to the President \nof the United States as rapidly as possible. He ought to veto it as \nfast as he can. He ought to go to the American people and say, if you \nare really interested and concerned about education, let us go ahead in \na bipartisan way and strengthen public schools. Let's not just reject \nout of hand, as our Republican colleagues have done, every one of the \nrecommendations of the President. One of the most important \nrecommendations the President has championed came from the Senator from \nIllinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, who understands the importance of having \nschool facilities and buildings that are going to be worthy of teaching \nour children in.\n  Senator Moseley-Braun is here on the floor at the present time. She \ncan speak to this issue. When we send our children to dilapidated \nschools, we are sending them a very important message: Education \ndoesn't really count. We're saying that we don't really care if young \npeople go to dilapidated schools because we grownups are not prepared \nto put the resources toward modernizing school facilities.\n  So, Mr. President, this is an absolute sham. The Coverdell bill is an \nabsolute sham. People cannot in this body, given what has happened in \nthe House of Representatives yesterday, stand up and say that this bill \nwill really help solve our education problems and strengthen our public \nschools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I remind the Senator that he has used 10 \nminutes of his time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 15 seconds more. They might have some \ncredibility if they stood up and said we deplore that the President's \nproposals have been rejected, but we also want to fight for this one \nand we will fight to restore those funds. But there has been absolute \nsilence on that.\n  Mr. President, I think this measure should be defeated. We don't have \nthe votes to defeat it, but I certainly hope we try. Our goal should be \nto strengthen public schools, not abandon them.\n  I yield whatever time we have to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 20 seconds remain.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his gracious remarks, as well as for yielding me this \ntime.\n  The Federal Government funds less than 7 percent of the cost of \nelementary and secondary education. Most of the funding for it comes \nfrom your local property taxes or from your State. Now, the fact is \nthat we are debating what to do with our paltry 7-percent contribution, \nand whether or not we can spread it out as Senator Kennedy and others \nhave discussed, or whether we should focus our resources on behalf of \nrebuilding schools, providing concrete assistance to help relieve \nproperty taxes. It is illogical to suggest that too few Federal dollars \ncan be divided even further, and yet somehow produce greater results. \nThe fable of the loaves and fishes is not a model for funding public \neducation.\n  What we need to have is a partnership in which the Federal, State, \nand local governments come together to relieve the property-tax burden, \nto engage State support so that all of us, working together, can \nprovide every child in this country with an opportunity for a quality \neducation. This should not be a fight; this should not be finger \npointing, and this should not be dissipating what little we have. We \nshould bring our resources together so we can provide quality \neducation. This legislation doesn't do it. I am happy that the \nPresident is going to veto this bill. I hope we can fix this problem \nhere in the U.S. Congress.\n  So, Mr. President, I oppose this conference report. I hope all my \ncolleagues will join me in opposition to this bad legislation, but I \nknow that the future of this bill has already been determined. I have \nno doubt that this bill will pass the Senate on a near-party line vote, \njust as it passed the House last Thursday on a near-party line vote. I \nalso have no doubt that President Clinton will follow through on his \npledge to veto this bill as soon as it reaches his desk. I have a \nletter, in fact, from President Clinton, that begins, ``If the \nconference report on H.R. 2646 is presented to me, I will veto it . . \n.''\n  Once that happens, we will be right back where we started. Our \nschools will be in no better shape than they were at the beginning of \nthis Congress. Our children will have no greater opportunities than \nthey did at the beginning of this Congress. Our country will be in no \nbetter position to compete in the 21st century economy that it was at \nthe beginning of this Congress.\n  Perhaps the only thing we will accomplish is the further erosion of \nthe confidence of the American people in our ability to address \nimportant issues. No issue is more important to our future--and no \nissue is more important to the American people, as they tell us in poll \nafter poll after poll--than education. We ought to be ashamed of \nourselves as a legislative body that this bill was the best effort we \ncould muster.\n  We also ought to be ashamed of the process that was used to write \nthis bill. I was supposed to be a member of the House/Senate conference \ncommittee that developed this final bill. I can tell you, Mr. \nPresident, that being a member of this conference committee meant \nnothing. There was no opportunity to help shape this legislation. There \nwas no attempt made to bridge the ideological gap that has stalled any \nserious federal efforts to help our schools. It seems the sponsors of \nthe bill are more interested in the political gain they expect to reap \nwhen the bill is vetoed than they are in trying to put together a \nbipartisan initiative to improve our schools.\n  I think the sponsors of this bill have made a mistake in \nunderestimating the acuity of the American people in matters relating \nto their children's education. This bill is a truly bad idea, and I do \nnot think most Americans will be fooled by the sponsors' rhetoric once \nthey see the reality of the legislation.\n  The bill allows families to put up to $2,000 a year into special \neducation IRAs, and withdraw the funds to meet the costs of attending \npublic, private, or religious elementary and secondary schools. \nContributions into these accounts would not be tax deductible, but \ninterest income on the accounts would be tax free.\n\n[[Page S6932]]\n\n  The bill represents bad savings policy. The purpose of IRAs--\nindividual retirement accounts--is to encourage long-term savings. The \nbenefits derived from IRAs are directly related to the length of time \nthe funds remain in the accounts. By allowing withdrawals only a few \nyears after contributions have started, this bill actually discourages \nlong-term savings.\n  This bill is a waste of taxpayers' dollars. The benefits are so small \nas to make them irrelevant as a means of improving education. The \naverage benefit to a family with a child in a public school would be \nonly $7 per year, and only $37 per year for a family with a child in \nprivate school. Even though the benefits to families are so small, the \nscheme still manages to cost taxpayers $1.5 billion over a 10 year \nperiod, funds that could be used for real educational improvements.\n\n  The bill is bad education policy. Instead of addressing the real \nneeds of our nation's schools, it drains support from public education \nin America. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, more than \nhalf the benefits realized under this bill would flow to the seven \npercent of families whose children already attend private schools. \nEnsuring that all children have access to a high-quality education \nshould be a priority for every American. Education is more than just a \ntool to improve the quality of life for individual students. It is a \npublic good as well, as we all benefit from a well-educated citizenry. \nIf some public schools are not up to the challenge of educating our \nchildren, then it is our responsibility to fix them, not abandon them.\n  Mr. President, we can do better than this bill. We must do better if \nwe expect to retain our competitive edge in the 21st century economy. \nEarlier this year, the grades were posted on a set of international \nmath and science tests. The results were profoundly disturbing. \nAmerican students placed at or near the bottom on every one of the math \nand science tests offered--below counties like Cyprus, Slovenia, and \nIceland. These results should serve as a clarion call to every \npolicymaker at every level that we need to do more for our children's \neducation. We need a new partnership to increase the educational \nopportunities available to all our children.\n  When this bill was being considered on the Senate floor, I offered an \namendment that would have created such a partnership. The amendment \nwould have provided tax credits to investors in school bonds, helping \nstates and communities rebuild and modernize their crumbling school \ninfrastructure. The amendment would have helped them modernize \nclassrooms so that no child misses out on the information age. It would \nhave helped them ease overcrowding, so that no child is forced to learn \nthe principles of geometry in a gymnasium. It would have helped them \npatch leaky roofs, fix broken plumbing, and strengthen the facilities \nthat provide the foundation for our children's education.\n  In his veto letter, President Clinton wrote, ``The need for school \nconstruction and renovation has never been more compelling. . . . If we \nwant our children to be prepared for the 21st century, they ought to \nhave 21st century schools.'' Commenting on the ISTEA reauthorization \nbill he just signed, the President continued, ``I have just signed into \nlaw major legislation that will provide more than $200 billion over six \nyears to help build and repair our nation's highways, bridges, and \nother transportation infrastructure. Similarly, we have an obligation \nto invest in the infrastructure needs of our public schools. H.R. 2646 \nignores that obligation.''\n  Once this bill has been vetoed, I intend to again bring up my \nproposal to help states and communities rebuild and modernize our \nschools for the 21st century. Maybe by then the message that the \nAmerican people have been sending to us--that they want us to work \ntogether, put our partisan differences aside, and pass real school \nimprovement legislation--will have gotten through.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia controls 24 minutes. \nThe other side is out of time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to my \ncolleague, the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment that the conference report which accompanies H.R. 2646, \nthe Education Savings and School Excellency Act, does not contain the \nprovisions banning Federal funding for the President's federalized, \nindividualized testing proposal. This provision, which I authored, has \nbeen removed in conference because of the clearly communicated concern \nthat the President would veto the legislation based on this issue.\n  The Senate and House have repeatedly given the administration a \nfailing grade on respecting the role of parents, on local control of \nwhat is taught and how it is taught. The President has insisted on \ntrying to promote federalized control of education. Federal testing \nwould lead to a Federal curriculum.\n  This administration has a lamentable record of harming the interests \nof American schoolchildren.\n  For example, on school choice, the President wants to incarcerate \nAmerica's most disadvantaged youngsters in dangerous, dysfunctional \nschools, rather than give them a choice of schools.\n  On block grants, he wants to keep plowing taxpayer money into the \nbureaucracy, instead of investing more in our classrooms.\n  Now, on school testing, he wants to cut the rug out from under the \nrole of parents and communities--the most important factors in how well \nchildren do in schools.\n  The more Members of this body have learned about the President's \nnational testing proposal, the less they have liked it. Over the past \nyear, the number of Senators opposing national testing has grown to a \nmajority.\n  When we first visited this issue last fall during debate on the \nLabor, HHS and educational appropriations bill, only 13 Senators voted \nagainst allowing the President's national testing proposal.\n  Only one month later, 36 other Senators joined with me to threaten to \nfilibuster the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill unless \nthere was a ban on FY 1998 federal funding for the President's national \ntesting proposal.\n  In April of this year, when I offered my testing ban as an amendment \nto the Coverdell A+ bill, the Senate passed the provision by a vote of \n52-47.\n  Over in the House, Congressman Bill Goodling, Chairman of the House \nEducation and the Workforce Committee, has continued to provide \nleadership in the fight against national testing. His bill to prohibit \nfunds for national testing passed by a vote of 242-174 in February of \nthis year.\n  So it is clear that both Chambers of this Congress agree that \nnational testing should be rejected. And the President of the United \nStates wants to promote national testing, and does so, I believe, in an \neffort that would begin to nationalize the school system. Local control \nof schools is fundamentally important and should be protected. It is \nreflected in the understanding of the House and the Senate.\n  The Senate Majority Leader and the Speaker of the House have provided \nto Chairman Goodling and me a written commitment that they will ensure \nthat the text of the Labor/HHS/Education appropriations bill for 1999, \nand any supplemental or any other such legislation, will not leave \nCongress without a testing provision that Chairman Goodling and I find \nto be satisfactory. That, of course, would be a provision allowing no \nfunds to develop national tests. If the appropriations bill does not \nmake it to the President's desk, they say, then every effort will be \nmade to include this in a continuing resolution or any other must-pass \nlegislation.\n  I appreciate this assurance from our leadership in both the House and \nSenate, and my colleagues can be sure that I will do everything in my \npower to hold them to their commitment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter \nfrom the Major Leader and the Speaker to Chairman Goodling and me \ncontaining these assurances be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Why am I opposed to national testing? Mr. President, we \nmust remember that any movement toward national control of education \nsavages principles that we as Americans hold dear: parental authority \nand control, teachers who are free to teach core subject matter and \nschool boards that are responsive to their communities, not held \ncaptive by distant bureaucrats.\n  President Clinton's proposal for national testing of our children is \nan example of such an attempt at a federal power grab. The President \nwants to move power out of the hands of parents and school boards and \ninto the hands of Washington bureaucrats.\n  America resists that for a number of important reasons, and these are \nthe reasons to oppose federalized national tests.\n  Parental involvement is the most important factor in a child's \neducational success, and national tests would undermine the ability of \nparents to play a meaningful role in the educational decisions of their \nchildren.\n  During my time as Governor of Missouri, and through my work with the \nEducation Commission of the States, learned that the single most \noperative condition in student educational achievement is the \ninvolvement of parents. Study after study has proven the significance \nof parental involvement in their child's education.\n  We should not disengage parents with a federalized national testing \nsystem. Experience has shown that local control is a key factor in \neducational success.\n  Experience has shown that local control is a key factor in \neducational success. As a former Governor who made education a top \npolicy priority, I learned first-hand that local control is needed to \ncreate educational programs that respond to the needs of local \ncommunities and that stimulate success.\n  National tests will lead to a national curriculum. There is wide \nconsensus among teachers, administrators, and education experts that \n``what gets tested is what gets taught.''\n  So, if you determine a test, you determine the curriculum.\n  A national curriculum is detrimental because it eliminates the \nparticipation of parents and local schools--the key elements of \nsuccess. It would do so inevitably. As a result, they key elements of \nsuccess--parents, schoolteachers, and local decision-making--would be \nmissing in our educational systems throughout the country.\n  Lynne Cheney, former Chairperson of the National Endowment for the \nHumanities, reminds us that previous attempts at federal standards have \nbeen disastrous.\n  She points to the politically correct federal history standards which \nwere unanimously rejected in the Senate.\n  Cheney also points to the English/language arts standards, which were \nsuch an ill-considered muddle that even the Clinton Department of \nEducation cut off funding for them after having invested more than $1 \nmillion.\n  The final exam on the Clinton plan for federally controlled testing \nwill come on the Labor/OHS/Education appropriations bill. This \nCongress--and more importantly, the American people--will be watching \nvery carefully to see how the Administration performs on this issue \nthat affects the future of our children. I will do everything in my \npower to protect the ability of parents, teachers, and local schools to \nbe involved in the education of their children by participating in the \ndevelopment of school curriculum, standards, and testing.\n  So I commend this bill to the President. This is an important bill. \nIt would advance substantially the interests of our students. I thank \nthe sponsors for their outstanding work.\n  I look forward to sending to the President an appropriations bill \nwhich would curtail the potential of any money being wasted at the \nFederal level by imposing inappropriate federalized tests upon local \nschool districts. These tests would curtail the ability of local \nofficials to make the kinds of decisions that are necessary for us to \nhave the kind of school quality that we need in order to survive in the \nnext century.\n  With that in mind, I thank the sponsor of this legislation and \ncommend him for the outstanding work he has done by stepping forward \nfor America's schoolchildren, and I look forward to the opportunity of \nworking together again to make sure that as we protect the options of \nparents and local officials to educate their children, we best serve \nthis great land and future generations.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Bill Goodling,\n     Chairman, Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Gentlemen: We are grateful to the two of you for taking the \n     lead on requiring that testing of students remain at the \n     state and local level. The administration's proposal to \n     control student testing at the federal level necessarily \n     would result in government control of the curriculum. \n     Stopping this central government control of student testing \n     is a very important part of our Republican plan to return our \n     schools to the control of the parents and teachers at the \n     local level.\n       We have worked with you and voted with you to pass a \n     federal testing prohibition bill in the House and to add an \n     amendment to H.R. 2646, the Education Savings Act for Public \n     and Private Schools. Obviously, since this bill is under the \n     threat of a veto by the administration and a filibuster by \n     Senate Democrats, it does not serve our interests to pursue \n     the ban on federal testing in this bill.\n       Therefore, in order to ensure that Congress will pass and \n     send to the President a ban on federal testing, you have our \n     commitment to support inclusion of your testing prohibition \n     language (H.R. 2846/Amendment 2300 to H.R. 2646) in the base \n     test of the FY 1999 Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education Appropriations bill. This language will be \n     maintained through floor action and the conference committee \n     process. You have our commitment that this bill will not \n     leave the Congress without a testing provision that you find \n     to be satisfactory.\n       If for some reason the Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations \n     bill does not make it to the President's desk, then we will \n     support efforts to include this provision in any Continuing \n     Resolution(s), or other ``must pass'' legislation in both \n     bodies. We appreciate your leadership over the past months on \n     this most important issue and look forward to continuing to \n     work closely with you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Trent Lott.\n     Newt Gingrich.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my colleague from Missouri for the \ncontribution he has made in this debate and for the work he has \nexpended on behalf of this legislation, and for his remarks.\n  Mr. President, many, many years ago, in my home city of Atlanta, and \nin campaigns, I met a woman who worked and still works in our inner \ncity with many of the inner-city problems. She is now the chairperson \nof the City Wide Advisory Council on Public Housing. Her name is Louise \nWatley.\n  She recently wrote a letter to me and my colleague, Senator Cleland \nfrom Georgia, and she said:\n\n       As a resident of the Carver Homes Public Housing Community \n     since 1955, I have witnessed generations of young African \n     Americans grow up in one our Nation's poorest neighborhoods. \n     In the 1980s, I fought the epidemic of crack cocaine among \n     our youth by working to kick drug dealers out of our \n     community. In the 1990s, I find myself fighting the epidemic \n     of hopelessness that has resulted from the increasing failure \n     of our public schools to educate poor, urban children, As the \n     Chairperson of the City Wide Advisory Council on Public \n     Housing (``CWAC'') and on behalf of the thousands of Atlanta \n     public housing residents the Council represents, I ask you to \n     provide us with hope for improving the K-12 education of our \n     children.\n       By way of this letter, I urge both of you to continue this \n     important trend of granting parents greater choice in the \n     education of their children. Please avoid the temptation of \n     sacrificing the poorest children in America in order to \n     protect an education bureaucracy that seems to care more \n     about money and job security than it does about helping \n     children to read, to write and to recognize right from wrong.\n       Please support the passage of the A+ Accounts for Public \n     and Private Schools Act as well as stronger federal charter \n     school legislation and demonstration public and private \n     school choice projects.\n\n  I have not seen Louise in many, many years. But I am encouraged that \nshe is still at work on behalf of our community.\n  I think she has in this letter crystallized the very severe problem \nwe are having all across the country, for we are graduating students \nfrom all too many schools who do not have the basic skills to enjoy the \nfull benefits of citizenship.\n\n[[Page S6934]]\n\n  Earlier in the debate, the Senator from Virginia, who, while kind to \nthis legislation, indicated he would vote against it on its scoring \npriorities, said this bill, or the education savings account, spends \n$1.5 billion in tax relief for families to open these savings accounts \nand that if we are going to spend $1.5 billion, we ought to do it on \nhigher priorities.\n  The math doesn't work. The education savings account creates $1.5 \nbillion of tax relief on the interest built up on savings that families \nput into savings accounts if they use it for education.\n  It does not spend $1.5 billion; it leaves $1.5 billion in those \nchecking accounts of those families. And what do they do? They save $12 \nbillion. So what we have done is, we have taken $1.5 billion, we have \nleft it home all across the country, and we have built a resource eight \ntimes that size. So instead of looking at it as if it is $1.5 billion \nwe did not ratchet out of somebody's checking account, you ought to \nlook at it as if we have encouraged Americans to save $12 billion that \nwould come to the aid of education. Where else can you invest $1.5 \nbillion and store up $12 billion that would come to the support of \nchildren all across the land.\n  It is a plus. We are causing billions of new dollars to come to the \naid of educators and education. It is just amazing; I heard several \nSenators on the other side view this as an expenditure because we left \nsome money in the checking accounts of American families. It has always \nbeen amazing to me how little incentive it takes to make Americans do \nhuge things. Boy, wouldn't we love it if every billion we invested here \ncould generate $12 billion of value. It would be a remarkable \nachievement. So this is not setting $1.5 billion aside for building \nschools or doing something else. This is leaving $1.5 billion in \nchecking accounts, and it causes them to pull together $12 billion. And \nthat is the minimal estimate. I think it will be much more.\n  I think it is good in the closing minutes here to remind the Senate \nand anybody listening that this legislation has an enormous reach. \nSometimes we forget to analyze or take a look at the total value. I \njust said this legislation will cause Americans to save at a minimum \n$12 billion. If nothing else, helping that would be great, considering \nthe fact we have one of the lowest savings rates in the industrialized \nworld. But this bill will make beneficiaries of half the school \npopulation wherever they go to school--public, private, or home--in the \nUnited States. Fourteen million families will open a savings account. \nWe don't know how many million sponsors--grandparents, companies, \nunions and churches--will come to the aid of those accounts, because it \nallows sponsors, but 14 million families parenting over 20 million \nchildren--that is half the school population--will be beneficiaries if \nthis bill passes and is signed by the President. One million students \nentering higher education will have a better chance of financing it \nbecause it gives tax relief to the 21 States that have prepaid tuition \nplans, and 17 new States are considering it.\n  Fourteen million families, 20 million children, 1 million students in \nhigher education, 1 million employees seeking to improve their \ncontinuing education will be helped by the legislation. In other words, \nMr. President, the reach of the bill that is before us, the bipartisan \nbill, is enormous and will have the effect of causing millions of \nfamilies and millions of students across this land to enter into a new \nconsciousness about improving their education, and it will be the \nsmartest money that was ever accumulated because it will be guided like \na missile system by the parents and relatives and friends of that child \nto the most urgent needs that child faces. If they have special \neducation problems or health problems, if they have a deficiency in \nmath or reading, it will end up paying for it, or a computer or tutor. \nAnd I might point out that over 80 percent of the students in inner-\ncity schools do not have a computer. This can begin to take care of it.\n  Mr. President, this legislation reaches into every community at every \nlevel, and while it is not a cure-all it gives lots of people lots of \nnew tools to go to work on turning this situation around in America. \nAnd if you want the next century to be an American century, you better \nbe focused on grades kindergarten through high school. We need to get \nthat job done.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 6 minutes 5 \nseconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am here to speak as eloquently as I \npossibly can in favor of this proposal. The genius and the persistence \nof the Senator from Georgia in bringing this major educational reform \nthis far is to be commended highly.\n  I feel a particular attachment to this bill because with the help of \nthe Senator from Georgia, while it was being debated before the Senate, \nthere was added to it my own triple option, an opportunity to let each \nState decide whether or not it would continue to get its Federal aid to \neducation in the present fashion, as a block grant to the State without \nFederal regulations, or as a block grant directly to school districts \nwithout either State or Federal regulations, trusting the people who \nprovide education to their children--teachers, principals and elected \nschool board members.\n  Because that is a relatively new idea and highly controversial, its \ninclusion in this bill would have frustrated our ability to pass this \nbill and send it to the President. It was, therefore, with my reluctant \nconsent, dropped from the bill that is before us at the present time.\n  But the perfect should not ever be the enemy of the good, and the \nwork that has gone into this proposal, the fact that it is highly \nbipartisan, the fact that there is a real opportunity that it should \nbecome law makes it one of the most important bills and the most \nimportant debates that we have engaged in in the State so far this \nyear.\n  So I thank my friend from Georgia, congratulate him on his good work \nand commend to all of my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, \nthis important educational reform.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I very much thank the Senator from Washington for his \nremarks.\n  I yield 1 minute to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from Georgia \nfor the manner in which he has handled this bill. There is nothing more \nimportant than education. I started out my career as a schoolteacher. I \ntaught school for 6 years in Edgefield and McCormick Counties and then \nwent to the State senate and spent most of my time in the State senate \non education matters. I believe we should do more in the field of \neducation; that is the hope of the future. And I hope the Congress will \npass this bill and do it promptly.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  I yield up to 2 minutes to my distinguished colleague from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will, believe it or not, take only 1 \nminute.\n  I compliment the Senator from Georgia. I am going to vote with him. I \ntold him when he first introduced this legislation I would support it. \nIn the meantime, it picked up some other amendments, Gorton and \nAshcroft, and I announced at the time I voted against it with Ashcroft \nand Gorton as part of it, that if it came out of conference as it was \noriginally constructed, I could support it.\n  I thank him for his fairness, the way he has dealt with this, the \nopenness in the way he has dealt with this, and I compliment him on \nbringing back to this body a piece of legislation that I and I believe \nprobably another half dozen or more Democrats will be able to support.\n  So I thank him very much for his courtesy.\n\n[[Page S6935]]\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for \nhis interest in this legislation and the fairness with which he has \napproached it. I appreciate very much his decision to vote for the \nlegislation.\n  In closing, I thank the majority leader for his tenacity, all my \ncosponsors who worked so long and hard, nearly 2 years, and the \nconference committee for the extended work to reach out in a bipartisan \neffort.\n  At this time, I yield whatever remaining time there is.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], for \n     himself, Mr. Levin and Mr. Coats, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2975.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the committee has worked very hard to \nachieve consensus on an amendment----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield just \nbriefly?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the clerk has not finished the reading of \nthe amendment and there has been no unanimous consent request to ask \nthat the reading of the amendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1064. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONTINUED \n                   PARTICIPATION OF UNITED STATES FORCES IN \n                   OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The contributions of the people of the United States \n     and other nations have, in large measure, resulted in the \n     suspension of fighting and alleviated the suffering of the \n     people of Bosnia and Herzegovina since December 1995.\n       (2) the people of the United States have expended \n     approximately $9,500,000,000 in tax dollars between 1992 and \n     mid-1998 just in support of the United States military \n     operations in Bosnia to achieve those results.\n       (3) Efforts to restore the economy and political structure \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina have achieved some success in \n     accordance with the Dayton Agreement.\n       (4) In February 1998, the President certified to Congress \n     that the continued presence of United States forces in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998, was necessary in order \n     to meet national security interests of the United States.\n       (5) There is, however, no accurate estimate of the time \n     needed to accomplish the civilian implementation tasks \n     outlined in the Dayton Agreement.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States ground combat forces should not remain in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina indefinitely in view of the world-wide \n     commitments of the Armed Forces of the United States;\n       (2) the President should work with NATO allies and the \n     other nations whose military forces are participating in the \n     NATO-led Stabilization Force to withdraw United States ground \n     combat forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina within a reasonable \n     period of time, consistent with the safety of those forces \n     and the accomplishment of the Stabilization Force's military \n     tasks;\n       (3) a NATO-led force without the participation of United \n     States ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina might \n     be suitable for a follow-on force for Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     if the European Security and Defense Identity is not \n     sufficiently developed or is otherwise considered \n     inappropriate for such a mission;\n       (4) the United States may decide to provide appropriate \n     support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on \n     force for Bosnia and Herzegovina, including command and \n     control, intelligence, logistics, and, if necessary, a ready \n     reserve force in the region;\n       (5) the President should inform the European NATO allies of \n     this expression of the sense of Congress and should strongly \n     urge them to undertake preparations for establishing a \n     Western European Union-led or a NATO-led force as a follow-on \n     force to the NATO-led Stabilization Force if needed to \n     maintain peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and\n       (6) the President should consult closely with the \n     congressional leadership and the congressional defense \n     committees with respect to the progress being made toward \n     achieving a sustainable peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and \n     the progress being made toward a reduction and ultimate \n     withdrawal of United States ground combat forces from Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina.\n       (c) Dayton Agreement Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``Dayton Agreement'' means the General Framework Agreement \n     for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, together with annexes \n     relating thereto, done at Dayton, November 10 through 16, \n     1995.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the committee has worked very hard to \nachieve consensus on an amendment that would represent the majority \nviews of the committee. Since May 13, at the request of several \nMembers, the committee has met at least five times to discuss possible \namendments on Bosnia that would be offered to the defense bill. The \ncommittee also conducted a hearing with Ambassador Robert Gelbard and \nGeneral Wesley Clark to discuss the status of progress in implementing \nthe Dayton Agreement.\n  Despite all meetings and discussions, the committee was not able to \nreach\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\nconsensus on an amendment on Bosnia. However, following the committee's \nmeeting on June 19, Senator Coats and Senator Levin, met, and, using a \ncompromise amendment that I had proposed as a starting point, continued \nthe effort to craft an amendment, which I support and which I believe \nthe Senate can support.\n  While I am aware that there are Senators who would prefer to do more, \nI believe that this amendment represents the view of most Senators.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Coats and Levin, and I urge the Senate \nto adopt it. Let me emphasize, this amendment does not represent a \ncommittee amendment, it merely represents the tireless efforts of \nseveral Members.\n  This amendment would express the concerns of the Congress that U.S. \nground combat forces should not be deployed indefinitely in Bosnia, and \nthat efforts should be taken by the President to work with our Allies \nin Europe so that U.S. ground combat forces could withdraw in a safe \nand orderly fashion from Bosnia within a reasonable period of time. \nAdditionally, the amendment would express our views that the European \nallies should take appropriate steps to develop forces to take on the \nresponsibilities of the Stabilization Force in Bosnia, if necessary, to \ncontinue to implement the Dayton Agreement.\n  Mr. President, by December 1998, U.S. ground forces will have been \ndeployed in Bosnia for three years, and the United States will have \nspent almost $9 billion dollars for its share of the operations. That \nis two years more than the President, Secretary Perry, Secretary \nChristopher and General Shalikashvili told us in 1995 that our forces \nwould be in Bosnia, and $8.0 billion more than their original cost \nestimate.\n  I believe it is imperative that the United States make strong efforts \nto work with our NATO and European allies to provide a situation where \nU.S. ground combat forces can leave Bosnia. The United States has \nworld-wide commitments, and the continued deployment of U.S. forces in \nBosnia is starting to take a toll on the readiness of our military \nforces. The deployment in Bosnia along with our other commitments \nproduces an operational tempo which impacts heavily on the morale of \nour forces and our ability to retain personnel.\n  I believe this amendment sends the message that we have been in \nBosnia too long, and that we should begin working our way out. I also \nbelieve the amendment sends a message that our European allies should \nassume a more equitable leadership role on their borders, while at the \nsame time ensuring some continued level of continued U.S. support.\n  I believe this is a good amendment, and urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, Senator Levin and I, along with the \nchairman and others, have worked long and hard attempting to fashion a \nway in which this Congress could express its dissatisfaction with the \nprospect of an indefinite troop commitment in Bosnia.\n  We now are going on the third year of that commitment at a cost that \ncontinues to escalate. I believe it is approaching, if it hasn't \nexceeded, $9 billion--this is despite the assurances of the \nadministration that the troops would only be necessary to accomplish \nthe military portion of the Dayton accords for 1 year.\n  The then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nShalikashvili, in testimony before our committee on October 18, 1995, \nsaid:\n\n       NATO's plan will call for the implementation force to \n     complete its mission in twelve months and to withdraw.\n\n  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in testimony before the House \nNational Security Committee on October 18, 1995, said:\n\n       NATO's plan will call for the implementation force to \n     complete its mission in twelve months and to withdraw.\n\n  Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary of State, said in a speech to the \nNational Press Club on November 9, 1995:\n\n       We believe that twelve months is a reasonable period of \n     time for the implementation force to have accomplished its \n     mission.\n\n  The President of the United States, President Clinton, in a letter to \nSpeaker Gingrich dated December 13, 1995, said:\n\n       NATO and U.S. military commanders believe and I expect that \n     the military mission can be accomplished in about a year. \n     Twelve months will allow IFOR time to complete the military \n     task assigned in the Dayton agreement and to establish a \n     secure environment. Within 1 year we expect that the military \n     provisions of the Dayton agreement will have been carried \n     out, implementation of the civil aspects and economic \n     reconstruction will have been firmly launched, free elections \n     will have been held under international supervision, and a \n     stable military balance will have been established.\n\n  Those words from the President of the United States. He was supported \nby Richard Holbrooke, former Assistant Secretary of State, who \nnegotiated the Dayton agreement. Mr. Holbrooke said:\n\n       The President has given a very clear commitment on the \n     twelve months. That is our policy. It will remain our policy.\n\n  General Shalikashvili once again said, in an article, in an interview \nwith the Washington Post of April 3, 1996:\n\n       I'm absolutely convinced that America will not participate \n     with military forces in Bosnia after the conclusion of this \n     year.\n\n  On and on it goes. Yet it is now 1998. There is no indication of when \nour military forces will be removed from Bosnia. Their continued \npresence has come at considerable cost to the taxpayer--as I said, $9 \nbillion-plus and counting--and no indications by the administration \nthat forces will be withdrawn at any time soon.\n  There is little disagreement on this floor about the concern over the \nescalating costs and the indefinite commitment. The real question \nbefore the Senate is how we accomplish the goal of withdrawing those \ntroops. It is clear that what was promised by the administration as a \nconsequence of the Dayton accords has not been accomplished on the \ncivil implementation.\n  Our armed forces have done a marvelous job in meeting the military \nobligations. In fact, the military tasks were essentially accomplished \nin that first year. A poitical decision was made, however, that forces \nneeded to remain in Bosnia to provide a secure environment so that the \ncivilian portion of Dayton could be accomplished.\n  I was one who voted against the use of our troops to enforce the \nDayton accord. I did not provide that support. Senator Levin I believe, \ndid provide that support. Yet today we are joining in attempting to \nsend a message from the Congress to the President and to our allies \nthat we do not want an indefinite commitment, that we believe the \nmilitary mission has been successfully achieved--that it is time to \nbegin the process of bringing our troops home. While there has been \nsome progress in civil implementation, when I traveled last December \nwith the President to Bosnia, I saw little evidence of successful \ncivilian implementation.\n  It has taken 2 years and an extraordinary amount of outside pressure \nto get the three nations involved to agree on a common license plate \nand a common foreign currency--what is seemingly the most easily \ndefined civilian implementation aspects of that accord. Yet, the \nparties, over a 2-year period of time, could not even agree on what the \nlicense plate would look like that each of them would put on their \nvehicles, or what the currency would look like, in order to establish a \ncommon currency for that one country.\n  So I stand here as one with grave concerns and deeply held doubts \nabout whether or not we are ever going to accomplish what Dayton \nattempted and promised, and that is reunification of a country that \nappears to not want to reunify. Key issues such as resettlement of \nrefugees; establishment of a civilian police force that, to date, has \nnot been deemed effective in providing any kind of stability; \nestablishment of judicial reforms that would provide a basis for \nenforcement of the law on an equal and fair basis. Resolution of many \nof these issues appear far down the road--if they are even achievable.\n  I come back to the central question, which is, now that our troops \nare there, who makes the determination and what is our obligation as \nMembers of Congress relative to establishing the continued presence, \nlimiting that presence, or requiring that withdrawal? I happen to \nbelieve strongly that our responsibility, as defined by the \nConstitution, is to determine the funding, whether or not we will \nfinancially support the commitment that has been made by our Commander \nin Chief.\n\n[[Page S6937]]\n\n  Now, Senator Levin and I have wrestled with this question in terms of \nhow we can best express a message to the President of the United States \nthat we do not support an indefinite commitment, that we do believe \nthat a transition should take place from an American presence to \nEuropean support for whatever military forces are necessary to provide \ncontinued stability. But we do not believe that we are in a position; \nnor do we have the right to define a timetable or a troop level. We \nbelieve that is a decision that ought to be left to the military, ought \nto be left to the Commander in Chief, and that is where the \nresponsibility lies. We do so because we don't believe we have the \nexpertise to define what that troop level should be.\n  When the discussion was undertaken relative to our placing troops in \nBosnia, virtually every individual who represented the military, from \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, to the Secretary of Defense, to the \ncommanders who were called forward to testify, said we need the \nflexibility to determine what is necessary to accomplish our message \nand to provide for the security for the forces that are deployed in \nBosnia. We need to make that decision based on our military expertise \nand based on what we see as the threat and what is necessary to provide \nfor the security of those forces.\n  This is not a decision that ought to be made by Congress, regardless \nof our own expertise or what expertise we think we might have, having \nserved on the Armed Services Committee or learned through our \nassociation with the Department of Defense. We are not in a position to \ndefine that troop level number. This decision has to be left to the \nmilitary commanders.\n  We learned, by tragic experience, how political intervention and \npolicy can sacrifice lives and place our troops in jeopardy. All of us \nhave freshly imprinted on our minds the tragedy in Somalia, as a \nrequest by the commander of our forces in Mogadishu for armored forces \nto provide the force protection was denied primarily for political \nreasons, because they wanted to avoid the perception that the U.S. was \nenlarging our presence in Somalia, but that we were drawing down. We \ndrew down too far and we lost some great Americans because we were not \nable to provide them with sufficient protection. It is not our decision \nas to what that level of protection should be.\n  Secondly, Senator Levin and I--and he will speak for himself--believe \nthat it is important that we not set an arbitrary timetable for \naccomplishment of the mission or for withdrawal of troops. That simply \nsends a signal to extremist forces and others who are intent on \ndestabilizing the situation. All they have to do is wait until a \ncertain date, pull back and give the appearance of stability, give the \nappearance of cooperation, knowing that when a certain date is reached, \nour troops will be withdrawn.\n  We want to keep that indefinite. It doesn't mean the decision can't \nbe made to remove the troops tomorrow, or the President can't sit down \nwith our allies and discuss what the future force should be. I believe \nan amendment will be offered--if not to this bill, to the defense \nappropriations bill--by the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator \nfrom Texas to establish a certain level and a certain timetable. It may \nbe that that is what our military commanders decide is in the best \ninterests of accomplishing our military mission and protecting our \nforces. But that ought to be their decision, not ours.\n  So those are the primary reasons--the protection of our forces, for a \nlimited success, in stabilizing the war and to protect against the \npotential of extremist groups taking advantage of the knowledge they \nhave of our force size and to protect against the concept that if we \ndefine a specific date through a statutory definition, that any hopes \nof accomplishing a mission that has been agreed to--as I said not by \nthis Senator, but by the President and supported by a majority--can be \nrealized.\n  To conclude, our amendment essentially expresses the sense of \nCongress that the U.S. ground combat forces should not remain in Bosnia \nindefinitely, in view of the worldwide commitments that we have, the \nimpact on our forces, on our readiness, on our deployment, and on our \nability to address other needs; that the President should work with our \nNATO allies, and other nations who have military forces participating \nin the stabilization force, to withdraw ground combat forces from \nBosnia within a reasonable period of time. The difference here is \nreasonable. We allow a reasonable period of time, leaving it again to \nthe discretion of our military, rather than the fixed time. Consistent \nwith the safety of those forces and the accomplishment of the \nstabilization force's military task.\n  We think it is appropriate to define a way in which we can continue, \nwhen we withdraw ground combat forces, to continue to provide support \nfor a follow-on European force, and to have a ready reaction or Ready \nReserve force in the region--not in Bosnia, but in the region, \navailable to help if necessary; that the President should inform our \nEuropean allies of the will of the Congress, should this amendment be \naccepted; and that the President should consult very closely with \ncongressional leadership with respect to the progress he is making in \nterms of achieving the goals of the Dayton accord.\n  That is the essence of our amendment. As Senator Thurmond said, this \nis not a committee amendment that was voted out of committee, though it \nis supported by a number of members on our committee. We think it is an \nimportant amendment to lay down. We think this debate is important. \nFollowing this, there is much about what is going to be said by those \nwho may not support this and who want something different than what I \nam going to agree with.\n  Much of what they have put in their proposed amendment, which \napparently will not be offered to this amendment and to this bill but \nat a later time, I am going to agree with.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have tried to carefully listen to the \nSenator's remarks, and I think I have heard the implication that \nCongress was somehow at fault in Somalia for the lack of supplying of \nheavy equipment.\n  Mr. COATS. I don't believe that is what I said.\n  Mr. BYRD. I didn't say you said that. I thought that it was implied.\n  Mr. COATS. I can assure the Senator from West Virginia that was not \nimplied.\n  Mr. BYRD. It was not Congress' fault?\n  Mr. COATS. No; it was not. Congress had no role in that whatsoever. \nThis Senator believes there is subsequent evidence in the reports that \nfollowed up on that tragedy which indicate that political decisions \nwere made by people within the administration relative to the \nperception American people might have regarding our presence and \ninvolvement in Somalia, and the decision that was then made, either \nthrough the administration or at the Department of Defense, and to deny \nthe request for additional force support.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. I incorrectly drew the \nwrong inference from what the Senator said.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. I apologize if I left that inference. \nIf I had, I am glad the Senator clarified that, because I didn't want \nto leave that impression.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will conclude, so that my colleague, \nSenator Levin, may proceed, simply by saying that we asked for the \nDepartment of Defense response to this amendment. They reported back. \nThe Department of Defense says:\n\n       The Department has no objection to the proposed amendment \n     in general.\n       The Department is concerned that paragraph (2) under Sense \n     of Congress could be misinterpreted as a weakening of US \n     resolve and commitment to the process initiated under the \n     Dayton Agreement. While the Department agrees that there \n     should not be a permanent US presence in Bosnia, the timing \n     and nature of discussions on withdrawal of the international \n     coalition should be driven by our continued progress on the \n     ground and not by artificial deadlines.\n\n  And The New York Times reported the following on June 13, 1996:\n\n       There has been no change in the President's view of the \n     current IFOR mission. It will last about a year.--Michael \n     McCurry, White House spokesman, New York Times, 6/13/96.\n  The Washington Post reported on July 25, 1996 the following:\n\n\n[[Page S6938]]\n\n\n       There is no successor mission. . . . We're not anticipating \n     any such thing.--Vice President Albert Gore, Washington Post, \n     7/25/96.\n\n  I agree in terms of their discussion about ``artificial deadlines.'' \nBut I want to point out that the Dayton agreement clearly stated that \nthe presence of the military was necessary to accomplish the military \ntask. And I believe that military task has been accomplished.\n  I think the debate on this floor, if there is to be a debate about \nour troop presence, should not be defining what the size of that \npresence should be and the timing of that presence. I think it should \nbe on whether or not there ought to be a presence.\n  There is going to be a legitimate debate, I believe, as to whether or \nnot we want to stay involved in Bosnia. And the will of the Congress \nought to be expressed on that, or the appropriations ought to be \ndefined in a way to support whatever is necessary, if we are going to \nbe there, determined by the military, or zero if we determine they \nshouldn't be there.\n  That ought to be the debate, rather than defining what the mission \nshould be, what the size of the force should be, and putting deadlines \nin terms of achieving those goals.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator take a question? \nMomentarily, I will follow the distinguished ranking member.\n  Mr. COATS. I will be glad to take a question from the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to make sure.\n  First, I think the thrust of the amendment is one with which I agree. \nI was part of the deliberations over a period of time. I certainly want \nto acknowledge the participation by the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, and the Senator from Texas, and the work they have \ndone.\n  But I want to make certain--I have read through this carefully a \nnumber of times--there is nothing in it that could be misinterpreted at \nthis particularly sensitive point in time in the Kosovo negotiations \nwith Ambassador Holbrooke--who is, I think, perhaps at this very moment \ntrying to work with Milosevic--that nothing in this amendment indicates \na lessened support of the United States, together with our principal \nallies, to try our very best to preclude a repetition in Kosovo of the \ntragedies that unfolded over the past years in Bosnia. It is my \nunderstanding that nothing in this amendment should be interpreted by \nMilosevic or anyone else that this is less than full support of the \neffort on behalf of the President and his designated Secretary of State \nand Ambassador to work on that problem.\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator, I believe, is correct. There is nothing in \nthis amendment that I believe could be interpreted contrary to what the \nSenator has just stated.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nIndiana on his excellent remarks on this subject.\n  I now yield to the able ranking member of this committee, Senator \nLevin.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank the chairman, Senator \nCoats, and others who have worked on this amendment. It is a sense-of-\nthe-Congress amendment regarding the continuation of United States \nforces and operations in Bosnia. We worked very hard on this amendment. \nThe committee did not reach a consensus or, indeed, ever take a final \nvote on the various alternatives which were offered to us. I don't \nthink anything should be said which would suggest that this is a \ncommittee amendment. Indeed, I believe that the chairman and Senator \nCoats made it clear that it was not. But it is an amendment which has a \nsignificant amount of bipartisan support. We offer it to the Senate on \nthat basis.\n\n  I am wondering if at this point, Mr. President, I could ask for the \nyeas and nays on this amendment, so people know there will be a vote \nforthcoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of the \nCongress on a number of aspects of our presence in Bosnia.\n  First, it says that our forces should not remain in Bosnia \nindefinitely. We do not simply want to authorize a significant amount \nof funds without any statement as to the length of time that our forces \nshould remain in Bosnia.\n  As the Senator from Indiana very ably put it, we don't want to set a \ndeadline. We don't want to mandate a certain force structure as of a \ncertain time. We think that would diminish the safety of our forces. We \nthink that would pull the rug out from under our forces.\n  On the other hand, we don't want to write a blank check. We don't \nwant to simply say, here are billions of dollars for our presence in \nBosnia, and not continue to make a statement about the necessity within \na reasonable period of time to remove our combat forces from Bosnia. So \nthis sense-of-the-Congress amendment is an effort to avoid both the \nblank check downside but also to avoid setting a mandated date for the \nremoval of those forces.\n  First, I would note, Mr. President, for our colleagues, that the \nSecretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, General Shelton, in their letter of May 21 wrote to Senator \nThurmond and to me to express their concerns about some of the \nproposals that were being offered relating to Bosnia.\n  In that letter, they said the following:\n\n       We write to express our concerns with any amendment that \n     would legislate a date or schedule for withdrawal or \n     reduction of U.S. forces from the NATO-led mission in Bosnia. \n     Such amendments would make it more difficult to accomplish \n     the mission, which has been remarkably successful to date.\n\n  Later on in that letter, Secretary Cohen and General Shelton said the \nfollowing:\n       We will conduct regular reviews of our force posture and \n     progress towards the benchmarks we have established, and we \n     expect further reductions will be possible, but that \n     determination is best based on the actual situation on the \n     ground, the military advice of our commanders in the field, \n     and the approval of the NATO military and political \n     authorities, not an arbitrary withdrawal or reduction date \n     determined long in advance.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The first reference to the Secretary's letter, would he \nread that again? He quoted the Secretary's letter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n\n       We will conduct regular reviews of our force posture and \n     progress towards the benchmarks we have established, and we \n     expect further reductions will be possible but----\n\n  Mr. BYRD. The first. I believe something came before that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I apologize. I started too late in the quote, and I will \ngo back. The letter starts off with the quote that I gave before.\n\n       We write to express our concerns with any amendment that \n     would legislate a date or schedule for withdrawal or \n     reduction of U.S. forces from the NATO-led mission in Bosnia. \n     Such amendments would make it more difficult to accomplish \n     the mission which has been remarkably successful to date.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. At that point does the Secretary state what ``the mission'' \nis?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is nothing stated beyond that relative to the \nmission in this letter. Of course, we have other statements from them \nas to what their mission is, but this letter does not restate what \ntheir mission is.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I further interrupt the Senator? Mr. President, will \nthe Senator yield further?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is one of the problems we have had with the \nadministration. They have a changing mission. At the beginning, the \nmission was one thing. Then it changed. Then it changed, and it \ncontinues to change. Now, the Secretary, in his letter, according to \nthe quotation by Senator Levin, references ``the mission.'' Well, it is \na moving target, that mission. That is one of the problems I have with \nthis whole situation.\n  I just wanted to make that point. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank our good friend from West Virginia.\n  General Clark appeared on June 4th before the Armed Services \nCommittee,\n\n[[Page S6939]]\n\nand, of course, General Clark commands our U.S. and NATO forces in \nEurope, including Bosnia, and we asked him what effect the adoption of \na legislatively mandated reduction of U.S. forces in Bosnia would have. \nAnd this was part of his response:\n\n       I would not favor as a military professional a mandated \n     limit because it would, I think, hinder our accomplishment of \n     the mission on the ground.\n\n  Then he went on:\n\n       In so doing, I think it could jeopardize force protection. \n     I mean, one of the things that has kept our troops safe, and \n     all of our NATO troops, it has been made very clear to those \n     who might seek to do us harm that it will not be tolerated, \n     that we will take action. We made that very clear personally \n     and in many different statements. So if such a commitment \n     were to be taken by those over there that this was some \n     change in policy, that we were somehow less committed, \n     that it somehow meant that we were not as firm in our \n     resolve, then I would say that could pose a force \n     protection threat.\n\n  And he went on a little later in his testimony as follows:\n\n       I hope that we could move through and live with the \n     benchmark approach that we were urged to adopt. We have some \n     pretty specific benchmarks. We will take a look at how long \n     it might take to achieve these. We will try to do all that we \n     can to encourage those who are responsible for them other \n     than SFOR to move as rapidly as possible on this. But they \n     are not, there cannot be deadlines. There are too many \n     intervening factors, and it will just have to be recognized \n     as such.\n\n  Now, these are the benchmarks that were referred to by General Clark. \nThis perhaps addresses the issue of our good friend from West Virginia.\n\n       The goal of the military presence--\n\n  And now I am quoting from these benchmarks--\n\n       is to establish the conditions under which the Dayton \n     implementation can continue without the support of a major \n     NATO-led military force.\n\n  And at this point the 10 specific benchmarks are set forth. And after \nthose benchmarks are set forth the following statement is made:\n\n       These benchmarks are concrete and achievable, and their \n     achievement will enable the international community to rely \n     largely on traditional diplomacy, international civil \n     personnel, economic incentives and disincentives, confidence-\n     building measures and negotiation to continue implementing \n     the Dayton Accords over the longer term.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire document be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       1. The Dayton cease-fire remains in place, supported by \n     mechanisms for military-to-military transparency and \n     cooperation.\n       2. Police in both entities are restructured, re-integrated, \n     re-trained and equipped in accordance with democratic \n     standards.\n       3. An effective judicial reform program is in place.\n       4. Illegal pre-Dayton institutions (e.g. Herceg Bosnia, \n     Strategic Reserve Office, Centreks and Selek Impeks) are \n     dissolved and revenue and disbursement mechanisms under \n     control of legitimately elected officials.\n       5. Media are regulated in accordance with democratic \n     standards; independent/alternative media are available \n     throughout B-H.\n       6. Elections are conducted in accordance with democratic \n     standards, and results are implemented.\n       7. Free-market reforms (e.g. functioning privatization and \n     banking laws) and an IMF program are in place, with formal \n     barriers to inter-entity commerce eliminated.\n       8. A phased and orderly minority return process is \n     functioning, with Sarajevo, Mostar, and Banja Luka having \n     accepted significant returns.\n       9. In Brcko, the multi-ethnic administration functioning \n     and a secure environment for returns is established.\n       10. The Parties are cooperating with ICTY in the arrest and \n     prosecution of war criminals.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. We on the committee pressed General Clark to give us some \nkind of timeline for the accomplishment of those benchmarks, and it is \nthat timeline, for how long will it take to establish each of these \nbenchmarks--to achieve, excuse me, each of these benchmarks that \nGeneral Clark is referring to and he is going to be sending to the \nCongress within the next few months.\n  This amendment builds on an amendment to the 1998 supplemental \nappropriations bill that urged the President to seek concurrence among \nthe NATO members on the benchmarks detailed in that March 3, 1998, \nreport to Congress on estimated target dates for achieving the \nbenchmarks and a process for NATO to review progress toward achieving \nthe benchmarks. It required a report to be submitted, which was \nsubmitted semiannually thereafter on such progress.\n  NATO has now adopted those benchmarks and will use those benchmarks \nas it conducts its own 6-month reviews of the mission and the size of \nthe NATO led stabilization force in Bosnia. Our amendment is designed \nto keep the pressure on our NATO allies, to continue the process where \nthe United States is able to withdraw our ground combat forces from \nBosnia, while our NATO allies and other nations maintain or increase \ntheir share of the stabilization forces, total force strength in \nBosnia.\n  Again, the amendment does not mandate specific force levels. It does \nnot mandate a specific withdrawal or reduction timetable because we do \nnot believe it would be prudent to do so. Indeed, based on General \nClark's testimony and on the letter from General Shelton and Secretary \nCohen, we believe it could endanger our forces if we mandated a \nspecific date for withdrawal or reduction.\n  The people who do not want those forces there would then know what \nour forces would be doing and when, when they would be leaving and in \nwhat numbers. And it is not to their safety, it is not to our \nadvantage, it would jeopardize their well-being for us to state \nlegislatively in advance that a certain number of troops are going to \nbe leaving in a certain number of months or years, or to set forth a \ntimetable for the reduction or removal or withdrawal of those ground \ncombat forces.\n  Well, then, how do we keep the pressure on our European allies? How \ndo we let them know we are not there for an indefinite period of time? \nHow do we avoid writing that open-ended commitment or blank check? The \nanswer is set forth in this resolution which attempts to let our allies \nknow that we are not there indefinitely. At the same time, we do not in \nany way undermine the morale or the safety of our forces.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the NATO-led mission in Bosnia has been very \nsuccessful. It has been able to carry out its military tasks without a \nsingle combat death. The civilian implementation of the Dayton accords \nhas not proceeded as well as the military implementation, but some \nprogress has been made in the last 6 months. The upcoming September \nelection, which will involve virtually every elective office in Bosnia, \nwill be a major event. If things go well, it could lead to a major \nreduction in the U.S. ground combat presence there.\n\n  I have been to Bosnia on a number of occasions, as have many of our \ncolleagues. On each of my visits I have been struck by the high morale \nand the positive attitude of the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces \nthere. They feel, and I surely concur, that they are making a \ncontribution to the maintenance of an enduring peace in Bosnia. Those \nwho work with the Russian forces on joint patrols in the United States \nsector also feel that they are contributing to a better understanding \nof, and a closer relationship with, Russia.\n  But we have worldwide commitments, and our forces are stretched thin. \nWe cannot remain in Bosnia indefinitely. This amendment--it is a \nbipartisan amendment with strong support--serves to pressure our \nEuropean allies to redouble their efforts to bear more of the burden in \nBosnia so that United States ground combat forces can be withdrawn \nwithin a reasonable period of time.\n  Finally, I will read from the mission statement that guides our \nforces, and then I will put the entire statement in the Record.\n  The mission and objectives of the U.S. military forces deployed in \nand around Bosnia are as follow:\n\n       SFOR and the U.S. military forces participating in it will \n     continue to deter a resumption of hostilities and provide \n     support for civil implementation in a manner similar to the \n     previous approach of SFOR.\n\n  So that is the very narrow mission of the military forces--to deter a \nresumption of hostilities and to provide support for civil \nimplementation in the manner that was adopted by the previous force.\n  The objective of the current mission will be:\n\n       . . . to consolidate the gains achieved to date while \n     sustaining the current pace of\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\n     civil implementation. This approach will encourage the \n     implementation process to become progressively more self-\n     sustaining without exceeding SFOR's current level of \n     intensity and involvement.\n\n  The key military tasks to create that mission have been set forth as \nfollows:\n\n       Maintaining deterrence of renewed hostilities.\n       Preventing removal of heavy or air defense weapons from \n     cantonments.\n       Maintaining the operation of the joint military \n     commissions.\n       Ensuring force protection, freedom of movement and \n     continued compliance with the cease-fire and Zone of \n     Separation.\n       Monitoring the military components of the Dayton Accords \n     and, if required, enforcing compliance.\n       Controlling the airspace over Bosnia and Herzegovinia.\n       Contributing, within means and capabilities and in a manner \n     similar to the SFOR previous approach, to a secure \n     environment within which civil implementation can continue.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that document setting \nforth the mission, setting forth the key military tasks, and then \nsetting forth the key supporting tasks be printed in the Record at this \ntime.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Mission\n\n       SFOR and the U.S. military forces participating in it will \n     continue to deter a resumption of hostilities and provide \n     support for civil implementation in a manner similar to the \n     current approach of SFOR. The objective of the follow-on \n     mission will be consolidate the gains achieved to date while \n     sustaining the current pace of civil implementation. This \n     approach will encourage the implementation process to become \n     progressively more self-sustaining without exceeding SFOR's \n     current level of intensity and involvement. To this end, NATO \n     has established the following tasks:\n       Key military tasks:\n       Maintaining deterrence of renewed hostilities.\n       Preventing removal of heavy or air defense weapons from \n     cantonments.\n       Maintaining the operation of the Joint Military \n     Commissions.\n       Ensuring force protection, freedom of movement and \n     continued compliance with the cease-fire and Zone of \n     Separation.\n       Monitoring the military components of the Dayton Accords \n     and, if required, enforcing compliance.\n       Controlling the airspace over Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       Contributing, within means and capabilities and in a manner \n     similar to SFOR's current approach, to a secure environment \n     within which civil implementation can continue.\n       Key supporting tasks, within means and capabilities and in \n     a manner similar to SFOR's current approach:\n       Supporting the High Representative.\n       Supporting phased and orderly returns of refugees and \n     displaced persons by contributing to a safe and secure \n     environment, but not forcibly returning refugees or displaced \n     persons or undertake to guard individual locations.\n       Supporting OHR and OSCE in the conduct of elections and the \n     installation of elected officials.\n       Supporting the OHR and International Police Task Force \n     (IPTF) in assisting local police by providing back-up support \n     and a secure operating environment towards the creation of a \n     restructured indigenous police force, but without undertaking \n     civil police tasks.\n       Supporting OHR and OSCE in media reform efforts.\n       Supporting ICTY and efforts against war criminals.\n       Supporting the OSCE, on a case-by-case basis, in \n     implementing Annex 1-B of the Dayton Peace Agreement.\n       Supporting the Supervisor in the implementation of the \n     Brcko decisions presently in effect.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator referred earlier to certain \nbenchmarks. What are we to understand with regard to the benchmarks, \nand what are they? The Senator put them in the Record. What are they?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are 10 benchmarks that were referred to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Perhaps I will just read them:\n\n       1. The Dayton cease-fire remains in place, supported by \n     mechanisms for military-to-military transparency and \n     cooperation.\n       2. Police in both entities are restructured, re-integrated, \n     re-trained and equipped in accordance with democratic \n     standards.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. What does that mean? What does that mean, ``democratic \nstandards''?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That means--what it means is, the civilian control over \nthe police, and that the police will operate within the standards which \nare followed in democratic countries, which means a semblance, \npresumably, of process for its citizens, avoidance of physical violence \nagainst its citizens, and the kind of implementation of the law which \ndemocratic countries seek to achieve.\n  I may say to my good friend from West Virginia that it was because \nthese benchmarks, in the judgment of many of us, including me, are not \nachievable within a reasonable period of time--that this involves too \nlong a period, that this would require some significant restructuring--\nthat we pressed General Clark, when he was here, for what would be the \nestimated timeline to achieve those kinds of goals.\n  This is not the military mission, by the way. This is the civil \nrestructuring that mission seeks to support. That was what I just \npreviously read from. The military mission is what I just read from a \nmoment ago. These are the benchmarks which the Dayton implementation, \nhopefully, will follow and achieve.\n  But I must say, I agree with the Senator from West Virginia--at least \nas to what I believe he is driving at--that these benchmarks will take \na significant period of time. That was the point that I made to General \nClark. That is why I pressed him very hard to give us the timeline \nwithin which he believes these individual benchmarks could be achieved, \nbecause I expressed then, and I will express again: I do not believe \nthese benchmarks can be achieved--that these goals, these civilian \ngoals, can be achieved within years. I think this will take decades, in \nsome instances, to achieve these.\n  So if I could just conclude, and I will be happy to yield further.\n  Mr. BYRD. I just wanted to say, Mr. President, I think the Senator \nhas contributed an invaluable service in so questioning General Clark.\n  I did interrupt the Senator. Please proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What I simply was saying was, for instance, benchmark No. \n3, ``An effective judicial reform program is in place.'' I said to the \ngeneral, ``My heavens, we are not going to be doing that in a matter of \nyears. If it is highly successful, that could take a decade to achieve. \nBut we cannot be there that long. We have to let the Europeans know in \nsome way that we can only be there for a reasonable period of time, and \nthen our ground forces must be removed, because we are stretched thin. \nWe are all over the place, all over the world in many different ways, \nand our readiness is going to be jeopardized if we continue to have our \nforces in Bosnia for an unlimited period of time.''\n\n  So what General Clark committed to do is to give us, within a matter \nof months, estimated time lines for achieving these benchmarks. That is \nwhat we are awaiting. I think it will be very helpful. I think all of \nus look forward to his estimates, as to how long would it take for an \neffective judicial program to be in place.\n  He said he is not going to give us a specific year. Then I said, \n``Can you give us a range as to how long it might take?'' He said he \nwill go through this, benchmark by benchmark, in order to give us that \nrange.\n  So I think we are kind of after the same goal here, both making sure \nour mission is clear--and I just put that in the Record, making sure \nthat our particular military tasks are clear, and I just put those in \nthe Record. But as far as these benchmarks being accomplished, the best \nwe are going to do, I think, is to get the time lines, the estimates on \nit, and then make the best judgment as to how long the forces can be \nthere while these processes, hopefully, continue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator did not complete his reading of the benchmarks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will do that, and then I will be happy to yield the \nfloor. There are 10 benchmarks. The third benchmark I just referred to: \nAn effective judicial reform program being in place.\n  The fourth benchmark--again, this is for civil implementation, now, \nof Dayton. This is not our military mission. I want to be real clear, I \nread our military mission before. I read our military tasks before. \nThis is the civil implementation side of Dayton.\n\n       4. Illegal pre-Dayton institutions . . . are dissolved . . \n     .\n\n  And they specify which ones they are talking about. And I would be \nhappy to\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\ngive you a list. There are four of them: and revenue and disbursement \n     mechanisms under control of legitimately elected \n     officials.\n       5. Media are regulated in accordance with democratic \n     standards; independent/alternative media are available \n     throughout [Bosnia].\n       6. Elections are conducted in accordance with democratic \n     standards, and results are implemented.\n       7. Free-market reforms (e.g. functioning privatization and \n     banking laws) and an IMF program are in place, with formal \n     barriers to inter-entity commerce eliminated.\n       8. A phased and orderly minority return process is \n     functioning, with Sarajevo, Mostar, and Banja Luka having \n     accepted significant returns.\n       9. In Brcko, the multi-ethnic administration functioning \n     and a secure environment for returns is established.\n       10. The Parties are cooperating with [the International \n     Criminal Tribunal] in the arrest and prosecution of war \n     criminals.\n\n  Those are the 10.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator to yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I just want to make sure that it is \nunderstood by all concerned--and I am asking the Senator this \nquestion--that the benchmarks that were read are not a necessary \nprecondition to our accomplishing the military mission; that the \namendment that we are offering is an amendment that says our troops \nshould not stay there indefinitely; that we should transition to a \nEuropean-only-led force, supported by us but not with the use of U.S. \nground combat troops.\n  I wouldn't want to leave the impression here that the request by the \nSenator from West Virginia, if I can have his attention, the \nestablishment of those benchmarks are not necessary for the \naccomplishment of the military mission. I think where the Senator is \ngoing is the fact that some of those benchmarks may never be \nestablished. If that was a precondition to our troops staying on the \nground in Bosnia, they might be there for another millennium.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. And I want to make sure that everyone understands that the \namendment that is before the Senate, the sense of the Congress, does \nnot address that question, is not meant to address that question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to respond to the comment. That is exactly \nwhat my point was. It is because it will take such a long time, in our \njudgment, for those kinds of civilian goals to be achieved that we must \nsend a clear signal we cannot be there--\n  Mr. COATS. Exactly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As long as it takes for those goals to be accomplished. It \nis because those goals, as important as they are--those are important \ngoals; they could take decades, as I just said to the good Senator from \nWest Virginia, they could take decades--may never be achieved. Those \ncivilian goals may never be achieved. We hope they are, but we cannot \nbe there militarily until those civilian goals are achieved, or \nbenchmarks, and that is why this resolution is the signal, the \nstatement that we must have our ground forces out of there within a \nreasonable period of time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Michigan \nyield on that point? Did not the President in his explanation for \nkeeping our troops in Bosnia beyond December list these benchmarks in a \nreport to the Congress? Did he not--I don't have them before me now, \nbut it seems to me that I recall he sent a report to Congress.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield for 1 \nsecond? I do have the report, and I know exactly what he is trying to \nsay. I would like to read him exactly what it says.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I can respond first, I will be happy to yield in a \nmoment. I just read the President's report.\n  Mr. BYRD. Wasn't the President saying, in essence, that our troops \nshould stay there until these benchmarks have been achieved? In \nessence, wasn't he saying that?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. He has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy just to yield for a question for the \nmoment, but--we are going to get the exact wording--but it is my \nrecollection that the President did not say until these benchmarks are \nachieved.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, reading from the report that the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia refers to, in the report the \nPresident says:\n\n       The exit strategy for U.S. troops engaged in such \n     deployment--\n\n  And then he notes:\n\n       The goal of the military presence is to establish the \n     conditions under which Dayton implementation can \n     continue without the support of a major NATO-led military \n     force.\n\n  And begins to list the concrete benchmarks that the Senator from \nMichigan has just read. I don't exactly know how you can refer to them \nas concrete, because I think that they are not concrete. I think the \npolice re-integration, the effective judicial reform, and media \nregulation is a giant leap, and I think the Senator from Michigan \nprobably has already said that he also sees that these could be \nlimitless. But, in fact, that is the exit strategy that has been put \nforward by the President, and that is exactly why I think the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is on point to question what is the exit strategy.\n  If these are clear benchmarks--the State of Texas doesn't have \neffective judicial reform yet--there are countries in the European \nUnion that can't meet the economic test that is set out in this exit \nstrategy for Bosnia.\n  I think the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from West Virginia \nand the Senator from Michigan are all beginning to agree that we are \nlooking at an exit strategy from which there is not an exit in the \nforeseeable future, and I hope that we will be able to clarify this as \nwe go down the road. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I can reclaim the floor for a final \nmoment. Our resolution, it seems to me, clearly speaks for itself. \nPeople can try to interpret the President's statement in different \nways, and I will read one line from it in a moment, but our resolution \nis very clear: Our forces cannot be there indefinitely. We want our \nforces out within a reasonable period of time.\n  It is our belief that it will take a long time for these kinds of \ncivilian reforms to occur. If you want to read the President's report \nas saying that the forces cannot leave, in his judgment, until these \nare achieved, I think that is really stretching what the President has \nsaid, but I will read it, and then one can interpret it the way one \nwants:\n\n       The goal of the military presence is to establish the \n     conditions under which Dayton implementation can continue \n     without the support of a major NATO-led military force.\n\n  That is what the President reports. He wants to establish the \nconditions under which progress can continue--``Dayton implementation \ncan continue without the support of a major NATO-led military force.''\n  The way I read that is that these do not need to be reality before \nthe President intends to remove combat forces from Bosnia. If one wants \nto read that differently, one is free to do so. But however one reads \nthe President's report, what our resolution makes clear is we are not \ngoing to be there. We don't believe we should be there for as long as \nit takes to achieve this. That is the point of our resolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan as to his resolution. I agree with him on that. But from his \nreading of the benchmark items and the language that was in the \nPresident's report, it seems pretty clear to me that conditions that \nneed to exist in order that we no longer keep our troops there are \nconditions that the President expects to be achieved before we remove \nour troops. And those conditions, as the distinguished Senator has \npointed out, many of them are impossible within my lifetime, if I live \nto be as old as Abraham, that was 175 years; and if I live to be as old \nas Isaac, that is 180; if I live to be as old as Jacob, that is 147 \nyears; if I live to be as old as Joseph, that is 110 years. So I have a \npretty long while to go to make that. But sincerely, and seriously, I \nthank the distinguished Senator for his comments.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to just respond to that, because the \nwords in the President's language is not ``these need to be achieved.'' \nIn fairness--and I do not consider this to be\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\nan abundantly clear document. That is the reason why I think we should \nspeak as to what our own beliefs are, and that is why this resolution \nis introduced. But the document says, ``conditions under which Dayton \nimplementation can continue without the support of a major NATO-led \nmilitary force.''\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. In a moment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Since we are on this point, I would like to add that \nthe sentence above that, ``The exit strategy for U.S. forces engaged in \nsuch deployment,'' that is the question that was asked by Congress for \nthe President to respond to. In response to the question, What is the \nexit strategy? he lists these 10 benchmarks that we have been \ndiscussing. So----\n  Mr. LEVIN. But I think the Senator would need to then read what it is \nin entirety, which is to establish conditions under which \nimplementation can continue without the support of major NATO-led \nmilitary forces. But that could be argued to read as that \nimplementation of this can continue--not that it has to be achieved \nbefore the force can leave--but that it could continue after a major--\nmajor; a qualification--NATO-led force can continue.\n  But I will simply repeat and then yield the floor. It is because we \nhave our responsibility to state what we believe our policy should be \nin Bosnia that this bipartisan resolution has been introduced. We are \ntrying to state we are not there indefinitely, in our judgment. And we \nwant to let the Europeans know we will not be there indefinitely. We \nare not writing a blank check. We are not making an open-ended \ncommitment. We are putting you on notice, we are there for a reasonable \nperiod of time.\n  Now, why don't we set a specific date? Why don't we then say how many \ntroops, by what date? The answer is, because our top military leaders \nsay that would undermine the safety of our troops. That will jeopardize \nthe well-being of our troops. That will play into the hands of those \nthat want us out of there by one means or another and that will use \nforce if necessary to get us out of there. That is because we want to \nsupport our troops as long as they are there and not harm them.\n  Setting a specific date or setting a specific reduction timetable \nwould, in the judgment of General Clark and General Shelton and \nSecretary Cohen, jeopardize the well-being of our troops.\n  So what our resolution does is say we want to express ourselves, put \neverybody on notice that we are not there for an indefinite period of \ntime. And by the way, we surely are not there until these goals are \nachieved. There is no way--no way --we are going to be there until \nthese goals are achieved. But that is the expression of our opinion.\n  I would be happy to yield for a question or yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Well, I would like to ask the question, if the \nSenator will yield, and that is, I appreciate your interpretation of \nthis because I certainly agree with you that these benchmarks are not \nachievable in a reasonable length of time. But I would just like to ask \nyou the question, What is the next step? The President has said this is \nan exit strategy, that these 10 benchmarks could be--would be reached \nwithout the necessity of major support from the United States. That is \nwhat is on this page.\n  The Senator from Michigan has asked General Clark, What would be the \ntimetable to achieve these 10 benchmarks, which I think we all now have \na consensus are going to be very difficult to quantify? What is the \nnext step? If General Clark comes back and says, well, effective \njudicial reform would be maybe 50 years, or 30 years, the civil Dayton \ngoals, the reestablishment of minority homeowners in each area of \nBosnia, the media regulation, these will take 60 years or 40 years or \n25 years, what then is the next step?\n  If we have the benchmarks in a report from the President, which we \nare now asking, ``OK, you, Mr. President, have said the exit strategy \nis that these will be achieved without the requirement of a major U.S. \npresence,'' we get the timetable back, we think it is unrealistic to \nhave a major U.S. presence for 50 years, and do all of the other \nresponsibilities of the U.S. military, what is the next step?\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, I think I want to just restate what the President's \nstatement here is. It is not that these will be achieved before. That \nis not what this states. It is that ``implementation can continue.'' I \njust want to again reiterate what this document says.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Without the support of a major U.S. force.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Absolutely, without the support of a major NATO-led \nmilitary force.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is the exit strategy for the United States.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is the strategy, that implementation can continue \nwithout the support of a major military force. And what the next step \nis is for General Clark to submit to us, as he said he would, within 2 \nmonths of our hearing, which was early June, June 4--so that, \nhopefully, by the end of July we will then have his timelines for the \nachievement of the benchmarks. At that point we will take whatever \naction we think is appropriate.\n  This resolution is aimed at stating what our position is, again, \nrelative to not having an unlimited commitment from ground combat \nforces in Bosnia. That is what this resolution says. We are not going \nto do that. We are going to say they are there for a reasonable time \nperiod. That is what this resolution does, which is what we think is \nthe responsible thing to do at this time, without having more \ninformation as to what those estimated timelines are. But I would not \nwant to tell you what action, if any, Congress would appropriately take \nafter it receives estimates of timelines, perhaps ranges, from General \nClark before we actually see his response. I don't think it would be \nresponsible for us to project in advance what action, if any, we would \nthink would be appropriate beyond adopting this resolution which states \nquite clearly that we intend that our ground forces only be there for a \nreasonable period of time.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank my colleague.\n  I just want to make sure that I understand that what he is trying to \nsay is that it is important, a discussion over what the benchmarks \nshould be or could be or ought to be, or how it ought to be modified, \nand should not be confused with what we are attempting to do in this \nresolution.\n  Discussing benchmarks, I say to the Senator from Texas, is perfectly \nlegitimate, but not as an objection to the resolution that is before \nus. It is partly, maybe even primarily, I would ask the Senator, \nbecause of the benchmarks, because we agree that they are indefinite, \nbecause we agree they are not achievable that we want this resolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. If I could finish my statement.\n  The only thing we do not want is for those of us in Congress to tell \nthe military how to protect itself. But we want to send a message that \nwe do not care what the President's interpretation is; we are dealing \nwith what Congress wants to say.\n  What Congress wants to say is, Mr. President, I do not care what your \nexit strategy is, whether I agree with it or disagree with it. We \nbelieve that our troops should not be there indefinitely. We believe \nyou should talk to our NATO allies and European allies and tell them \nthat Congress does not support an indefinite troop commitment. We want \nour combat forces out of there. We want a European force--if you think \nit is necessary to stay there, you better tell the Europeans to put a \nEuropean force together. If you want our support, logistics support, \nintelligence support, communications support, rapid reaction that might \nhelp you in a crisis, yes, we can consider that.\n  But we want those combat troops out of there. I just don't want to \nconfuse the President's policies--exit strategy, benchmarks, General \nClark's interpretation. That is not what we are about here. We are \ntalking about Congress' resolution.\n  I ask the Senator if that is what we are up to?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Indiana is the prime sponsor of this \nresolution and is exactly correct.\n  Further, in response to his question, I again state that this is our \nexpression of what Congress intends, that we intend for Europeans to \nunderstand, and\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\nwhat we intend, of course, for the President to understand.\n  Part of this, paragraph 5, is that the President should inform the \nEuropean NATO allies of this expression of the sense of the Congress, \nshould strongly urge them to undertake preparations for establishing a \nWestern/European Union-led or a NATO-led force as a follow-on force to \nthe NATO-led stabilization force, if needed, to maintain peace. In \nother words, there may be a need--in my judgment there will be, by the \nway--for a long period of time for there to be an outside force in \nBosnia.\n  But what this resolution is saying, it cannot have American combat \nforces as part of that force beyond a reasonable period of time and we \nare putting you on notice. Whether we understand your exit strategy, \nwhether we agree with your exit strategy, Mr. President, whatever \ndifferences there are as to the interpretation of it, that is not the \npoint. The point is this is what Congress is telling you and telling \nthe Europeans. This is not an unlimited commitment. We are sending you \na very clear statement that we are only going to support the presence \nof American combat forces there for a reasonable period of time. Plus, \nas long as they are there, we will support them. We are not going to \nharm them by setting a specific exit date or a specific reduction \nschedule. We are not going to jeopardize the well-being of our forces \nwith a specific date for an exit, because our top military leaders have \ntold us that is what the effect would be. We are not going to do that \nin this resolution, at least.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I simply wanted to say to the Senator from Indiana and the \nSenator from Michigan, I think I was the first to raise questions about \nbenchmarks. In so doing, I did not mean to imply that I was against the \namendment that Senator Thurmond has offered. I don't mean that at all. \nI just picked up on Senator Levin's reference to benchmarks and asked \nsome questions about them. I intend to support the amendment.\n  As to the distinguished Senator's reference to the military leaders, \nour military leaders, in part, helped to get us right where we are now. \nWe were misled by some of our military leaders at the very beginning of \nthe discussions concerning Bosnia. I have great respect for our \nmilitary leaders, but I don't accept their word as having come down \nfrom Mount Sinai, as being engraved in stone. They listen to the \nPresident. They say whatever the President thinks. They all do. And \nvery seldom will they venture to say something that isn't in accordance \nwith the administration's viewpoint.\n  I intend to say something about this subject matter later, but I \nwanted to wait to listen to what the distinguished Senator from Texas \nhas to say first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have had a lot of talk here. It is \nabout time for action now.\n  At this time, I yield to the able Senator from Virginia, Senator \nWarner.\n  Incidentally, for the record, Senator Warner served as a sailor in \nWorld War II. In his career he served in the Marines; he served as \nSecretary of the Navy. He is the ranking Republican on this committee. \nHe has had vast military experience.\n  I am very pleased at this time to yield him such time as he desires.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. That was unexpected. \nI assure you that my very modest record of military service pales in \ncomparison to yours, having been the only Member of the Senate to have \nlanded on June 6, 1944, D-day.\n  Moving on, this is a very important debate, if for only the reason \nhere we have some of the most intelligent persons debating documents \nwhich read with clear English language, yet we can't seem to come to an \nagreement. That signifies the desperate need for clarity to our policy. \nThat clarity has to come from the President of the United States.\n  This debate was really fostered some months ago by the efforts of our \ndistinguished colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, and the \nSenator from Texas, when they, consulting with members of the Armed \nServices Committee, and others, showed various proposals. Those \nproposals manifested, in my judgment, the unrest, certainly within the \nSenate and I think largely within the Congress, that we could not keep \ngoing on and going on as we have been, and that it was inflicting a \nvery severe penalty upon research and development budgets, readiness \nbudgets, procurement budgets, and that we must bring this debate to the \nfloor of the Senate so that Senators can have expressions and perhaps \npass a resolution and/or an amendment or, in whatever form, to manifest \nour great concern.\n\n  I wish to compliment the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator \nfrom Texas for their efforts. The Armed Services Committee took into \nconsideration their views. As a result, we have this amendment today by \nthe distinguished ranking member and the Senator from Indiana, which I \nintend to support.\n  My concern is that as I listen to this debate it is clear to this \nSenator that our American troops, particularly the combat troops, are \nsimply hostage, I repeat hostage, to the uncertainty of what these \ngoals are and what the time is within which they are achievable. As a \nconsequence of this amendment, I am concerned that the President and \nothers will take it into consideration and come back to the Congress \nwith specificity and clarity.\n  It will be, in my judgment, impossible for this Congress in the few \nweeks remaining, to make a decision on this subject. My concern is that \nwe really not make a definitive decision other than this amendment, for \nthe following reasons: No. 1, as the Senator from Michigan said, in the \ncourse of General Clark's appearance before the Armed Services \nCommittee, which was a hearing dedicated to the subject of Bosnia and \nat which we received one of the most profound and eloquent \ndissertations by the Senator from West Virginia, expressing the \nresponsibilities of the Congress of the United States as being parallel \nand equal in every precedent to those of the President--an excellent \nstatement.\n  But General Clark, when pressed--this Senator was particular in \nurging him to assess these goals, for General Clark to go back to the \nvarious individuals, government entities and the like, and to establish \na timetable within which they could be achieved. Now, my understanding \nof his reply and my recollection was that he felt he could not provide \nthe Congress, particularly the Senate, with that reply much before \nSeptember. That was my recollection.\n  Now, also in September are a very important series of elections that \nwill take place in Bosnia. Step one is the Clark report. Step two are \nthe elections in Bosnia. Hopefully, those elections will again point in \nthe direction towards greater achievement of the overall Dayton \naccords. Then we have to recognize that this Congress ends and a new \nCongress will come in the January-February timeframe, and that they--\npossibly new Members, possibly different views--they will then have \ntheir opportunity to express their views.\n  I think decisions by the Congress as to the future level of funding, \nwhich is pointed out by the Senator from Indiana, is our explicit \nauthority here, will probably have to await until early next year. In \nthat interim, we have called upon the President, subsequent to General \nClark's announcement, to come forward no later than, I believe, \nDecember 31, of this calendar year and give us a detailed report.\n  We are beginning to lay the foundation now, expressing to the \nPresident, and indeed to our allies, the unrest that exists in the \nCongress, which unrest is reflective of the people across the United \nStates. And that time is running out. We have made a significant \ncontribution in terms of our men and women of the Armed Services \nCommittee working with our allies. We have made a very significant \nfinancial commitment of $9.5 billion.\n  My concern at this particular moment is that we are walking something \nof a high wire, because as we are discussing, I think in a very \nresponsible way, these issues, at the same time we have to take notice \nof the fact of the unrest in Kosovo. With all due respect for my \ncolleague from Texas, I see there is a direct correlation between the \nactions we take in Bosnia and the possible consequences in Kosovo. I\n\n[[Page S6944]]\n\nreadily admit, as my colleague from Texas points out, the legalities--\nnamely, that Kosovo is a sovereign part of the Serbian State and, as \nsuch, it is a civil war. But I say to my colleagues that if the \ncontinued criminal hardships being inflicted upon innocent people in \nKosovo become portrayed in greater detail, and we experience greater \nand greater levels of suffering of those people, all those legalities \ngo to the side. Once the pictures of the horror begin to emanate --and \nI hope they will not--in further amounts from Kosovo, everybody will \nrecognize that there is a conflict that responsible nations of the \nworld must participate in, in trying to bring about a cessation.\n  I urge my colleague from Indiana--and I am certain my colleague from \nMichigan heard--I hope nothing we do here today can in any way be \nutilized by those forces trying to continue the criminal acts being \nperpetrated in Kosovo to give them any encouragement to continue those \nacts. What we are doing today is an important debate, but it is not to \nbe construed in any other way but that the United States will assume \nits responsible role, along with our allies, in trying to stem the \ncrisis that is developing in Kosovo.\n  As we speak, the President has dispatched Mr. Holbrooke--soon, I \nhope, to be confirmed as our U.S. Representative to the United \nNations--a man who had a great deal to do with reaching the accords in \nDayton and who has had extensive experience in this area. It is our \nhope that he can bring about a strong message that will eventually \nbring stability in the Kosovo region. What we do today will have \nconsequences, and it is walking the high wire that nothing be \ninterpreted as lessening our intent to stop the killing, the rape, and \nso on taking place in Kosovo.\n  I will return to the debate. It is clear that these Dayton accords, \nas pointed out by the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from \nTexas, and others, are holding hostage the need for troops. I agree \nwith the Senator. He said they are not achievable unless there is a \nmilitary force in place, and the part that we play or do not play \nremains to be seen, be it combat or support in that continuing military \nforce, because I am sure that the Dayton accords--no matter what time \nwithin which we will require their ultimate achievement--would require \na security force, and that security force must perform only military \nmissions. They cannot perform the missions to directly achieve the \naccords. But only by their presence and the infrastructure that they \nmaintain in place--namely, some semblance of law and order--can we hope \nto achieve any of the Dayton accords. So I commend my colleagues.\n  I intend to support this amendment. But I see a direct linkage \nbetween the problems in Bosnia and the developing problems in Kosovo. I \nhope that nothing as a consequence of this debate today will ever be \nconstrued by anyone as undermining the efforts of our Government, \nbecause I remember so well in the early debates--and this Senator was \nnever in favor of sending in combat troops; the record is clear on \nthat. But once that decision was made and once we have become a party \nand a partner--and I underline ``partner''--with our allies and \nachieved the Dayton accords, then I feel we are there and we should not \njeopardize the $9.5 billion and the personal sacrifices of our troops \nby doing something precipitous now that would undo the progress in \nBosnia.\n\n  But there is a direct correlation between Bosnia and Kosovo. We used \nto argue that we have to contain Bosnia so it doesn't spill over into \nKosovo. The opposite could happen now. The problems in Kosovo could \nspill over into Bosnia and begin to undermine the progress we made in \nDayton. We have to proceed with great caution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of the \nSenator from West Virginia. I did not intend to speak before the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia. If it is his desire to speak \nfirst, I am happy to wait.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I certainly do \nnot wish to speak in advance of the Senator from Texas. I very much \nappreciate the courtesy, but I am very content to wait and listen to \nthe Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, first, let me say I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, because he and I have worked together. We have \nintroduced a bill--the Byrd-Hutchison bill--which would produce a \ndownsizing of our commitment in Bosnia in, I think, a reasonable \ntimeframe, taking into account the safety of our troops. I will talk \nabout that in a few minutes. He has been a leader in this effort, and \nhe is a member of the Armed Services Committee. He has provided a lot \nof input into this debate and certainly a background that none of us \ncan match because of his years in the Senate and his scholarly pursuits \nin Senate history.\n  I also want to thank Senator Thurmond, Senator Levin, and Senator \nCoats for putting forward this amendment. I think this sense of the \nSenate is a good start. It certainly sends the signal to the President \nand the administration from Congress that Congress is very concerned \nabout the policy. I think it is very clear from the recent debate that \nmany of us do not consider that the exit strategy put forward, in \nresponse to our question, from the President is a serious exit \nstrategy. It cannot be considered a serious exit strategy, because I \nthink when General Clark comes back with a timetable, it is going to be \ntotally unacceptable, and I think everybody on this floor agrees that \nit is too nebulous to be in any way dubbed a concrete and clear \nbenchmark.\n  I want to respond because Senator Byrd and I have spoken on this \nsubject and we feel, I think, very strongly about the role of Congress \nand the importance that Congress exercise its responsibility under the \nConstitution. That is why we have been active in this area and why I \nthink it is important that we take this first step with the Thurmond-\nLevin-Coats amendment, and that we eventually go further in making sure \nthat Congress is a part of any effort by the President to have a long-\nterm commitment of our troops in a foreign land.\n  In fact, that is what the Constitution envisioned. It is very clear \nif you read the Federalist Papers, if you study the Constitution, if \nyou read the debate, that our founders had an example. The example was \na king, a monarchy--a monarchy in which the king not only declared war \nfor his country, Great Britain, but the king also paid for it, \nimplemented it, did the strategy. It was all a power of the monarch. As \nthe founders of our country were debating what they wanted, they said \nthey wanted it to be hard to declare war. In fact, in the debate, I \nwill quote from James Wilson, the delegate from Pennsylvania, who said:\n\n       We must have a system of checks and balances in this area \n     that will not hurry us into war. It is calculated to guard \n     against it. It will not be in the power of a single man or a \n     single body of men to involve us in such distress, for the \n     important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature \n     at large.\n\n  Mr. President, we have a situation here in which there is no \ndeclaration of war. So we have a shift of power toward the President, \nputting our troops into combat positions, or into peacekeeping \npositions, certainly into harm's way--however you would like to \ndescribe it--unilaterally.\n  Congress has since World War II, I think it can be fairly said, \ncontinued to allow the President to encroach more and more on the \nresponsibility that was clearly given in the Constitution to Congress, \nbecause, in fact, it should be hard to declare war. It should be hard \nto put our troops into harm's way except in an emergency, which I think \nall of us would agree is within the power of the President to address.\n  So now we have a situation where more and more the President is going \nforward on his own and Congress is stepping back and allowing the \nPresident to take the power without our input, and even when we \ndisagree with the President, unfortunately, I think we have been timid \nabout standing up.\n  I believe it was this timidity that caused the extended Vietnam war. \nI think we extended it by not exercising the responsibility of \nCongress, which clearly knew that this was not a war in which we should \nbe, and most certainly not one in which so much American blood should \nhave been shed.\n  Mr. President, here we are now with an exit strategy given to \nCongress by\n\n[[Page S6945]]\n\nthe President that is not realizable--an exit strategy that many States \nof the United States couldn't meet as benchmarks.\n  On the effect of the judicial reform program, police in both entities \nare restructured, retrained, and equipped in accordance with democratic \nstandards; media-regulated in accordance with democratic standards; \nindependent alternative media available; free market reforms; \nfunctioning privatization; banking laws; an IMF program in place.\n  Mr. President, these are worthy goals. They are worthy benchmarks, \nand I hope we work toward them. But this is not an exit strategy for \nU.S. forces.\n  I am pleased that so many Members of Congress agree with that, and \nare beginning to take first steps that would say to the President you \ndon't have carte blanche to watch our military move into a dangerously \nhollow force while you are spending $10 billion of taxpayer money on \nthis kind of effort with no exit strategy. That is what is happening.\n  I am pleased that we are going to begin to take the first steps to \nsay to the President we want an exit strategy; we want an exit strategy \nthat is reasonable, and we want an exit strategy that is responsible as \nan ally.\n  Everything that Senator Byrd and I have done has been to try to work \nwith our allies as a responsible ally, not to exit totally from Bosnia \nas a requirement, but to say we want to do our fair share, and we want \nour allies to work with us to allow us to continue to have a military \nthat is capable of responding in the only way that America can respond, \nand that is with our unique capabilities, our unique technology, our \nunique modernized equipment, and our uniquely trained forces, which are \nthe best in the world. We don't need our best fighting forces to do the \npolice-keeping mission that we are doing in Bosnia, which can ably be \ndone by many other of our allies.\n  So my goal is going to be to support this very good beginning, but to \nsay that we must be willing to stand up and force this issue because we \nare going in the wrong direction. We are allowing our military to \nbecome hollow because we are in unending missions. Our troop morale is \nsuffering. We are losing experienced people, because they are gone from \nhome so much on missions that they do not see as essential. If you talk \nto military people, as I have, that is what you will hear. They will be \nthere when they see that it is a U.S. security interest. They have \nalways been. But they do not understand continuous deployments when \nthere is no emergency, as they see it, and when they see no exit \nstrategy.\n\n  I am very pleased that the Senator from West Virginia made the \nspecific point of trying to determine what the mission is. Is it a \nclear mission? He asked what the benchmarks for the exit strategy were. \nI think it became very clear to anyone who listened that the benchmarks \nare no exit strategy at all. They are worthy goals. But they will not \nbe met in our lifetime. And, indeed, many countries of Europe do not \nmeet them today.\n  I hope the Senate will take the first step. But I hope the Senate \nwill not be timid about its responsibility under the Constitution, and \ntake further steps along the way.\n  We are going to continue to have other amendments to other bills that \nwill provide the United States an opportunity to speak to our allies to \ndetermine how we can work together to downsize the U.S. commitment, to \nhelp our allies in every possible way within the bounds of reason, \nbecause we do have other commitments. We must respond, if there is a \nreal security threat to our country, or to any of our forces in the \nfield, and we are losing our edge.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this is a first step, not a last step. I \nhope the President will hear what the Senate is saying with this sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. It is a good resolution. The President should \nwork with NATO allies to withdraw U.S. ground combat forces from Bosnia \nwithin a reasonable period of time.\n  That is the resolution. I agree with that--that a NATO-led force \nwithout the participation of the U.S. ground combat forces in Bosnia \nmight be suitable for a follow-on; that we, the taxpayers of the United \nStates, have spent $9.5 billion over the last 6 years at a time when \nour military is telling us that we are dropping in modernization; that \nwe are dropping in our recruitment. We are losing experienced people. \nWe must as responsible Members of the Senate question the priorities in \nspending for an operation that has no exit strategy.\n  We want to take this first step. I certainly do. But I want the U.S. \nSenate to remember our part of the Constitution. If we fail to keep our \npart of the Constitution working, we are failing in our duty and our \nresponsibility to the people of our country, and most certainly to \nthose combat forces who are putting their lives on the line every day.\n  We would never jeopardize troop safety in anything we do.\n  I want to say that Senator Byrd's and my two bills that have been put \nforward both exempt totally the troops that are necessary for the \nsafety of the troops that are on the ground.\n  We want a responsible exit. We want to be responsible allies. We are \nnot walking away from our responsibility to our allies. But we do not \nthink it is fair for the United States to continue to bear the lion's \nshare of the burden in Bosnia. We are now twice as many troops as our \nnearest ally, and I do not think that is a fair allocation.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is a good first step. I think the \nUnited States is taking a necessary first step. I hope the President \nwill listen to the concerns that have been raised in this very good \nresolution, and I hope the Senate will be willing to continue to work \non legitimate, responsible parameters around this Bosnia mission.\n  And just one more response to the Senator from Virginia. I think that \nthis must be separated from Kosovo for many reasons. One is Kosovo is \nan independent country and requires a different set of references. We \nhave been in Bosnia for 6 years, really more. We have been working on \nthe Bosnia issue. Kosovo, we have yet to take the definitive action, \nand I do support the President for getting his emissaries in and trying \nto bring these people to the peace table. I want to be shown to support \nthat effort, and I hope that it works.\n  I think the Bosnia issue is much different, and I think we have \nworked toward coming to some sort of clear mission and clear exit \nstrategy in Bosnia for many years, since I have been in Congress, and I \nthink now is the time for us to exercise our responsibility under the \nConstitution and become more firm in how long we will be in a mission \nin which our troops will be engaged, will be in harm's way, and for \nwhich there is no congressional approval as I think is required by the \nConstitution in spirit if not in actual terms.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Did the Senator just yield the floor? Parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I did not yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has yielded for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's clarify the question of the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thought I heard the Senator from Texas yield the floor. \nI was asking if that was the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator was asked if she will yield for a \nquestion, and she did yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. My question would be, we have our differences on the \nlegal--clearly, the Senator is correct about Kosovo--independent and \nthe like. But it just has been my experience that once the television \npictures and stories come back across the ocean as to the horror and \npillage, and so forth, that could take place in greater porportion than \nnow, then this whole thing blends together, and I do see a direct \nlinkage between the turmoil in one geographic area and turmoil in \nanother just a bare few miles away.\n  But my concern, and it goes to both my distinguished colleagues from \nWest Virginia and Texas; I have followed and respect greatly their \nefforts here, but we are about to get a report from General Clark which \nwill throw, I think,\n\n[[Page S6946]]\n\nsome very clear light on this otherwise unclear situation as the time \nwithin which the goals for Dayton can be achieved. We are about to \nexperience the results of elections in Bosnia which we all hope, again, \nwill move towards a more rapid resolution of the remaining problems in \nBosnia.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Arizona--and I have read through his \namendment, which I support--is going to list, I think, some very \nimportant analysis from the President, Secretaries of Defense and \nState, and then we have the fact that a new Congress is coming in. So \nmy concern is what can we hope to achieve now were we to move along the \nlines of the amendment which I have seen from the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia and the Senator from Texas, given that so much \nremains to be done, and those actions--the Clark report, the elections, \nthe fact that we are going to have a new Congress--in my judgment, all \nhave a direct bearing on what we can achieve by way of reductions in \nthe specific numbers of troops over this period. So I thank the \nSenator. If the Senator cares to reply, I would appreciate it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator.\n  I would just say to the distinguished Senator from Virginia that we \nhave had benchmarks that are clearly not achievable in any lifetime \nthat we are going to have. We have had deadlines that have failed to be \nmet. I think it is time that Congress stand up and say we are looking \nat the facts. The facts are we are having a harder time recruiting for \nthe military. We are having a harder time funding the modernization and \nthe technology. We haven't even addressed missile defense systems. And \nyet we know now that two more countries have joined the nuclear club; \nthat we are talking to troops--at least I am--who are very low in \nmorale, and people who not only are not coming into the service, but \nour experienced people are leaving, and I think it is time that \nCongress take the responsibility to address these concerns. One of them \nis a mission with no exit strategy, which is, I think, an ill-defined \nmission, and no clear policy that shows our enemies or our allies where \nwe would go in the future.\n  Kosovo is another issue. There are problems erupting in India and \nPakistan. Certainly, Iraq is still on the horizon, not to mention \nKorea. The United States has the unique responsibility in the world to \nprovide a security umbrella in a lot of places, and I want to make sure \nthat we are going to be strong enough to respond when there is a threat \nto U.S. security. And if we continue to sit back and let deadline after \ndeadline and benchmarks that do not hold water go forward, I think we \nare abdicating our responsibility.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, and I certainly \nassociate myself with her concerns as to the overall posture of our own \nArmed Forces, which have been degraded, and I so stated in my opening \ncomments, by the heavy expenditures associated with Bosnia. And you are \nquite correct; the India-Pakistan series of regrettable events has, I \nthink, spurred other nations to look more and more to biological and \nchemical missilery and other weapons in the area of mass destruction \nand, indeed, we are all, I think, deeply concerned when we read the \nreports that, indeed, Iraq was preparing its weaponry to incorporate \nthe biological material in its missile heads, and all the more reason \nto proceed with this missile defense program which for years the \nSenator from Texas, myself and others have been urging be adopted.\n  I yield floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Virginia. I think when you \nlook at these other potential necessary points of U.S. defense \ncallings, we have to look at our budget, our defense dollars, our \nmodernization, our technology and our will along with the morale of our \ntroops, and we have got to say that there is a red flag out there, and \nif we do not do something about the priorities, we are going to have a \nhollow force at a time when we really need it. And I think that is the \nresponsibility of this Senate to address and to make sure that it does \nnot happen on our watch. I appreciate what the Senator from Virginia \nhas said. I appreciate the leadership he has shown, along with Senator \nThurmond and all of those. I think we all have the same goal. I just \nhope that we can all as a group of 100 independent operators come \ntogether and realize that because we are so diverse, we cannot allow \nourselves to be inept in action, in doing the right thing that all of \nus, I think, are seeking to do. That is what happens in a legislative \nbody. It is not an easy, clear direction that you can point a \nlegislative body to. But nevertheless, I hope we can overcome the \ninherent problems in dealing in a legislative body and do something \nstrong and courageous and decisive and fulfill our responsibility under \nthe Constitution for our country, for those who are serving our country \nin the military, and for our future generations.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, I \nbelieve, has an amendment. Does he wish to call that amendment up at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no, I am recognized. I am not yielding the floor. I am \nmerely asking the Senator from Arizona if he would like to call his \namendment up.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nrespond to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Without his losing the right of the floor.\n  Yes, I have a second-degree amendment, I say to the Senator from West \nVirginia, concerning this issue that is before us. I believe it is not \ncontroversial. The Senator from Virginia supports it, and others. It is \nconcerning reports that are required about progress in our mission in \nBosnia and certain benchmarks for us being able to determine how long \nwe have to remain there.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator is pressed for \ntime right at the moment, I will be glad to yield to him for that \npurpose.\n  Let me say, before I do so, I congratulate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas on her statement and on the work that she has done in \npreparing legislation on this very issue that has been discussed. I \nalso congratulate the distinguished Senator from Virginia for his work \non the committee and I commend those who have prepared the Amendment \nthat has been offered by Mr. Thurmond, which I intend to support, and I \nhope it will be unanimously agreed to. I think it goes in our \ndirection, but I don't think it goes far enough. But I think it is \nmoving in the direction that Senator Hutchison and I favor.\n  Mr. President, I have waited 3 hours to address the Senate. I want to \nspeak on the same subject. I have had my share of entries into the \ncolloquy by interrupting others and asking questions. I am perfectly \ncontent to desist and await just a few minutes longer, if the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona wishes to call up his amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia to do that, and I thank him. I think it would be important \nbecause this amendment is germane to this debate and should be before \nthe Senate. And then, of course, immediately after it is sent to the \ndesk, the Senator from West Virginia would give us his important \nanalysis of the debate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time would the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona need?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor for not to exceed 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, and I ask unanimous consent that I \nmay regain the floor at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2977 to Amendment No. 2975\n\n   (Purpose: To require the President to submit to Congress certain \n     reports on the missions of United States forces in Bosnia and \n                              Herzegovina)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2977 to amendment No. 2974.\n\n\n[[Page S6947]]\n\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       After subsection (b) of the amendment insert the following:\n       (c) One-Time Reports.--The President shall submit to \n     Congress the following reports:\n       (1) Not later than September 30, 1998, a report containing \n     a discussion of the likely impact on the security situation \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina and on the prospects for \n     establishing self-sustaining peace and stable local \n     government there that would result from a phased reduction in \n     the number of United States military personnel stationed in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina under the following alternatives:\n       (A) A phased reduction to 5,000 by February 2, 1999, to \n     3,500 by June 30, 1999, and to 2,500 by February 2, 2000.\n       (B) A phased reduction by February 2, 2000, to the number \n     of personnel that is approximately equal to the mean average \n     of--\n       (i) the number of military personnel of the United Kingdom \n     that are stationed in Bosnia and Herzegovina on that date;\n       (ii) the number of military personnel of Germany that are \n     stationed there on that date;\n       (iii) the number of military personnel of France that are \n     stationed there on that date; and\n       (iv) the number of military personnel of Italy that are \n     stationed there on that date.\n       (2) Not later than October 1, 1998, a report on the status \n     of the NATO force of gendarmes or paramilitary police \n     referred to in subsection (a)(1), including the mission of \n     the force, the composition of the force, and the extent, if \n     any, to which members of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States are participating (or are to participate) in the \n     force.\n       (d) Report To Accompany Each Request for Funding.--(1) Each \n     time that the President submits to Congress a proposal for \n     funding continued operations of United States forces in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, the President shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the missions of United States forces \n     there.

Mr. President, I understand I have 5 minutes. I thank the \nSenator from West Virginia for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment concerning the continuing \nU.S. military presence in Bosnia. This is a second degree amendment to \namendment No. 2975.\n  Mr. President, I believe everyone in this body knows that I have long \nhad serious concerns about our mission in Bosnia. From the time the \nIFOR mission was first briefed to the Congress, I knew the job could \nnot be completed in one year--nor against any arbitrary deadline. \nInstead, I urged the Administration to set concrete objectives and \nbenchmarks for measuring success.\n  Now, as many members have pointed out, we are in an open-ended and \nill-defined military commitment. The Administration has scrapped all \nthe artificial deadlines. But no clear set of objectives and well-\ndefined military missions has taken its place. We seem to drift in and \nout of going after war criminals, of using the military to resettle \nrefugees, and of taking on a direct political role in parts of Bosnia \nin the name of supporting international civilian authorities. The role \nof our military has expanded, and there is no end in sight.\n  The answer to this problem, however, is not to go back and set new \nartificial deadlines. Bosnia is a long-term, complicated problem. It \ninvolves not only the warring factions, but has direct effects on \nCroatia and Serbia, including Kosovo, and threatens to spillover to the \nwider Balkan region. The credibility of NATO and especially the United \nStates is tied up with finding a solution for the Bosnia crisis. It \nwould be sheer irresponsibility, probably leading to renewed warfare, \nif we were to precipitously pull out of Bosnia after investing so much. \nIt would be a betrayal of our commitment to cooperating with our \nAllies. And it could well lead to an even more costly and dangerous re-\nintroduction of American forces to stop the renewed fighting.\n  Dealing with the Bosnia crisis--even if though our objective is to \nget American troops out of there--requires treating Bosnia as a serious \nlong-term challenge. It is not an issue that lends itself to artificial \ndeadlines for withdrawal. Nor is there any rationale to forcing the \nCongress to vote by some artificial deadline. Worse still would be a \nfunding cut-off, which would only punish our troops for the failure of \npolicymakers in Washington to craft a viable long-term policy.\n  Handling the Bosnia crisis requires us to look beyond just this \nfiscal year. It requires the United States to develop a multi-year \nstrategy that sets out our objectives, the means for achieving these \nobjectives, and a target timetable for getting us there--but no phony \ndeadlines. For the sake of our troops, we need to set out clearly the \nmilitary and non-military missions they are being asked to perform. \n``Creative ambiguity'' may be useful in politics, but it is dangerous \nfor soldiers. We need to be honest with ourselves about the risks we \nare asking our troops to face, and the costs to the taxpayers of \ncontinuing the mission.\n  I am convinced that the direction we should be taking is to move \ntoward a force made up of European nations inside Bosnia, with U.S. \nforces just ``over-the-horizon'' outside of Bosnia--providing a rapid \nresponse capability to deter or defeat security threats, and providing \nlogistical, intelligence, and air support to the European forces inside \nBosnia. This step would free up U.S. forces to prepare for other \ncontingencies.\n  But it is not possible to achieve this goal simply by setting \narbitrary numbers and deadlines for troop withdrawals. Doing so could \nprovoke a crisis with our Allies and could have the effect of simply \nsetting a timetable for restoring violence to Bosnia. Instead, \nachieving this goal requires working together with our Allies and \nrealistically taking account of the situation inside Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, my amendment seeks to do exactly these things. It \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that we need to have a clearer \npicture of our objectives, timetable, missions assigned to our \nmilitary, risks, and costs. It expresses the sense of the Senate that \nwe should be moving toward a European force inside Bosnia, and a U.S. \n``over-\n\n[[Page S6948]]\n\nthe-horizon'' capability outside Bosnia. It also says it is time to \nstop treating Bosnia as an unplanned emergency and include funding for \noperations there as an addition to the defense budget.\n  My amendment also imposes a number of reporting requirements. Each \ntime the Administration submits a budget request for funding military \noperations in Bosnia, the Administration must clearly state its best \nassessment of six items:\n  (1) Our overall objectives and multi-year timetable for achieving \nthese objectives--taking account of the benchmarks already required \nunder the supplemental appropriation passed earlier this year; (2) the \nmilitary and non-military missions the President has directed U.S. \nforces to carry out--including specific language on our policy on war \ncriminals, returning refugees, police functions, and support for civil \nimplementation; (3) the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's \nassessment of the risks these missions present to U.S. military \npersonnel; (4) the cost of carrying out our strategy over several \nfiscal years. (5) the status of plans to move toward a European force \ninside Bosnia with a U.S. force outside Bosnia that would deter threats \nand provide support to the European force; and (6) an assessment of the \nimpact of reducing our forces according to the timetable proposed in \nthe original Byrd-Hutchison amendment.\n\n  This may seem like a detailed and onerous reporting requirement, but \nit is nothing more than the kind of long-term planning the \nAdministration should be doing anyway. And by requiring it in a report \nto Congress, we ensure that the Congress is operating off the same set \nof assumptions and plans as the Administration. This will give us an \nopportunity to look more thoughtfully at the real challenges in Bosnia \nand structure our decisions more appropriately. Instead of broad swipes \nthrough artificial deadlines or prohibitions on certain missions, we \nwill be able to target our policy choices more effectively.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my amendment requires that if the Senate \nvotes to discontinue funding for continued operations in Bosnia, the \nAdministration must submit a withdrawal plan within 120 days. This \nlanguage does not impose any artificial procedure or deadline on the \nSenate. Rather, it acknowledges that the Senate already has the right \nat any time to vote to discontinue funding for Bosnia operations. The \nquestion is whether the Senate chooses to exercise this right. If it \ndoes, and the vote is to pull out, then the Administration must present \na withdrawal plan within 120 days.\n  Mr. President, no one is more frustrated than this Member; all of us \nare. The administration came over and said our troops would be out in a \nyear. We knew that wasn't true at the time. Then they came over and \nsaid they would be out in a year and a half. We knew that wasn't true \nat the time. And the frustration that many of us felt as members of the \nArmed Services Committee during that period was enormous because we \nknew that there was no way that we could possibly have our troops exit \non a date certain which was not an exit strategy. The purpose of this \namendment is to try to force an exit strategy from the administration \nso we have expectations as to, No. 1, what our goals are and, No. 2, \nhow they can be achieved.\n  I also am a student of the Constitution. I also understand the role \nof the U.S. Senate to advise and consent, and if the U.S. Senate wants \nthe troops withdrawn from Bosnia, all we have to do is, on the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill, cut off all funding. That is \nall we have to do. We have that right --and that responsibility, in the \nview of some.\n  What we don't have the right to do, because we don't have the \ncommensurate responsibility, is to devise a strategy for Bosnia. How in \nthe world do we know what troop levels can be dictated so we will know \nthat those young men and women are secure? That is why we have \ngenerals. That is why we have a Pentagon. That is why we have a \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That is why we have a National \nSecurity Adviser and a Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. President, we give them that responsibility that is not a \nlegislative function, to set troop levels. If the Senator from Texas \nwants them out, get them out. I will be glad to debate and discuss an \namendment that says no further funding as of whatever date she wants. \nBut to say at some date there should be a certain level of troops--from \nwhence does this information come? From whence does this judgment that \n5,000 or 10,000 or 50,000 is the right number of troops?\n  Mr. President, occasionally I put myself in the role of a military \ncommander, a position that I aspired to but never achieved. I cannot \nimagine--I cannot imagine, as a military commander, trying to meet a \nnational security threat saying, ``Wait a minute, I've got to be down \nto 5,000''--or 10,000 or 20,000 or whatever it is. I am the one who is \nsupposed to decide that, along with the Commander in Chief. Then we \ncome to the Congress for approval or disapproval. That is the way the \nsystem should work. We cannot have the Senate, the U.S. Senate, decide \nwhat number of troops are there.\n  So, I believe that this administration has failed in devising a \nstrategy. They have failed in giving us an exit strategy. They have \ndeceived, really, the Congress and the American people, when they first \ncame over and said that they would be out by a certain date.\n  But at the same time, to set troop levels, I think, is very, very \ndangerous, not only for our troops and the men and women who are there, \nbut is a dangerous precedent.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I appreciate \nhis courtesy, as always, that he extends to every Member in this body \nin allowing me to propose this amendment and make it part of the \ndebate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might, just for purposes of \nmanagement, seek recognition for a moment. Can the Senator from Arizona \nadvise us with regard to the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator withhold the yeas and nays, because the \nyeas and nays have been ordered on the underlying amendment. I wonder \nwhether or not the Senator might accept a voice vote on the second-\ndegree amendment. I think it has strong support.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withdraw my request for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the original amendment by Senator Hutchison \nand myself does not set troop levels.\n  The original amendment offered by Senator Hutchison and myself does \nnot cut off money for the troops.\n  The original amendment by Senator Hutchison and myself does not \nwithdraw troops from Bosnia.\n  The original amendment by Senator Hutchison and myself sets no \ntermination date for withdrawal of American troops from Bosnia. It does \nnot jerk the rug out from under our troops.\n  The amendment which the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison, and I would have offered and may offer at another time on \nsome bill provides that the President--the Commander in Chief, if you \nwill--submit to Congress a report, a plan, no later than February 2, \n1999, for reducing the military personnel of the United States in \nBosnia to an average of the numbers of troops that Great Britain, \nFrance, Italy and Germany have in Bosnia, the other members of the \ncontact group--an average--and that that reduction occur by February 2 \nof the year 2000.\n  That is not setting troop levels. That is not withdrawing American \ntroops. We are saying, ``We'll stay there with you; we'll stay there, \nbut it's about time that the other members of NATO take on a greater \npart of the burden.'' After all, this situation has developed in their \nown backyard, not in ours.\n  We are not saying we are going to withdraw. We are not suggesting \nthat the money be terminated. We are not suggesting that American \ntroops get out lock, stock, and barrel. We are simply saying that we \nshould at least be able to reduce our troops, now that there is \nstability in Bosnia, we should be able to reduce our troop level to an \naverage, we would say, of the troop numbers that are involved from the \nother members of the contact group.\n  I think Great Britain has 5,000 involved. France has something like\n\n[[Page S6949]]\n\n2,500. Germany has something like 2,500. Italy has fewer. And we are \nsaying to the President, ``Now you submit us your plan--your plan. \nSubmit us your plan, and you don't need to submit it tomorrow or the \nday after tomorrow or next month. Submit it by February 2 of next year, \njust the plan. Tell us how you, Mr. Commander in Chief''--that magic \nterm, that all-encompassing, worshipful term, ``Commander in Chief''--\n``you tell us how you can get our troop levels down to an average of \nthose of Great Britain and Germany and France and Italy, and by \nFebruary 2 of the year 2000.''\n  What is wrong with that? Is there someone here who would say to me \nthat the Congress under the Constitution doesn't have a right or \ndoesn't have a duty even to submit such an amendment calling on the \nCommander in Chief to do that? ``Just let us have your plan, Mr. \nPresident. You have lots of time now. We're putting our allies on \nnotice that we want our troop levels to be down to an average of what \ntheirs are. It doesn't have to be an exact average. Certainly, instead \nof 7,000, it could be 3,500 by then, but we'll still be there with \nyou.''\n\n  What got us into this situation, Mr. President, I have heard it said \nthat our military leaders, our generals, our Commander in Chief, have \nto make these decisions as to troop levels. I don't quarrel with that, \nbut these are the same people, these are the same individuals--there \nmay have been some changes since 1995 and 1996, perhaps some changes in \nthe identity of the personnel in those respective positions, but it is \nthe same administration that got us where we are, the same \nadministration that misled the Congress, misled us into the belief that \nour troops would be there no longer than 1 year, roughly a year.\n  We were told that. We were told that on the Armed Services Committee. \nThe distinguished Senator from Indiana and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan were there when the committee discussed this matter. That \nis what the administration told us, and the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana has set forth a litany of the dates and the things that were \nsaid in keeping with the idea that the United States would be involved \nthere roughly only a year. He has done that for the record, and I \nconsider that to be a service. That is what was there.\n  They are the very people who misled us in the beginning. That is why \nsome of us feel that we haven't been dealt with fairly from the \nbeginning, and that it is about time that the administration come \nforward and give us some reliable statements, give us some reliable \ndata upon which we can depend and the American people can depend. I \ndon't think I have voted at any point against the funding or any \nauthorization of troops in Bosnia. I don't think I have. I am going to \ncheck to make sure, but I was misled along with everybody else.\n  I doubted, at the time, that the administration would have us out in \na year. I was listening to the Commander in Chief through his Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, through his Secretary of Defense, in \ntheir appearances before the Armed Services Committee. I listened.\n  We took them at their word. You see where we are today. That was \n1995, and now this is 1998. I just want to shed a little history for \nthe record--for the record--not necessarily for all Senators. Some \nSenators probably know more about the record than I do. Certainly \nseveral of them are in a good position to remember as much about it as \nI can. But for the record, I want to state a little of the history of \nthis situation.\n\n  To begin with, in a nationally televised address on November 27, \n1995, President Clinton justified dispatching U.S. troops to Bosnia as \npart of IFOR by saying U.S. engagement was needed to stop the great \nsuffering caused by the war, to bring stability in Europe, a region \nvital to U.S. interests, and to maintain U.S. leadership in NATO. \nPresident Clinton said that the deployment would last--and I quote--\n``about one year.''\n  In subsequent statements, administration officials asserted that U.S. \nforces would be out of Bosnia by the end of 1996. President Clinton \ndecided on April 30, 1996, to keep U.S. forces in IFOR at full strength \nthrough the Bosnian election on September 14 in order to support the \nelection process. He said the United States would maintain a robust \nforce in Bosnia until IFOR's 1-year mandate expired on December 20, \n1996. However, administration officials continued to insist that U.S. \nforces planned to leave Bosnia within a few weeks after December 20, \n1996.\n  On November 15, 1996, President Clinton said that the administration \nhad agreed in principle to send U.S. troops to Bosnia as part of a new \nNATO-led peacekeeping force for Bosnia. President Clinton said the \nforce would remain there until June 1998.\n  Now, let me read that again. On November 15, 1996, President Clinton \nsaid the administration had agreed--the administration had agreed; did \nnot say that Congress had agreed; the administration had agreed--in \nprinciple to send U.S. troops to Bosnia as part of a new NATO-led \npeacekeeping force for Bosnia. President Clinton said the force would \nremain there until June 1998.\n  So there the administration had already changed their position. No \nlonger was it said that we would be there about a year. Then it was \nsaid by the President that we would remain there until June 1998.\n  On December 18, 1997, President Clinton announced that he had agreed \nin principle that U.S. forces should participate in a Bosnian \npeacekeeping force after the mandate of the current SFOR expires in \nJune 1998. He did not set a new departure deadline, but said the force \nwould leave only when key peace implementation milestones have been \nachieved. This follow-on force has been unofficially dubbed ``deterrent \nforce'' or DFOR by some observers. So it went from IFOR, which was \n``intervention force''; to SFOR, which was ``stabilization force''; to \nDFOR, which was ``deterrent force.''\n  Mr. President, this is the administration. It was they who said, in \nthe beginning, that American forces would be in Bosnia for about 1 \nyear. We took them at their word. But then, as time went on, the \nadministration, the President, the Commander in Chief, set new dates. \nAfter all, Congress sometimes is faced with a very difficult situation. \nAnd that is what we are faced with. Things are more complicated than \nthey were in 1787 at the time the Constitution was written. Things are \nvery complicated.\n  Here is what Congress is faced with. The administration uses the \ncloak ``Commander in Chief'' to put our men and women in foreign areas, \nin foreign countries where they are in danger; takes them away from \ntheir families, away from their loved ones, away from their \nhearthstones, away from their homes--puts them in foreign countries \nwhere they are in danger. They may never come back. They go, and they \nare there because the Commander in Chief sent them, whoever he is--it \nmay be a Democrat or it may be a Republican.\n\n  I respect the Commander in Chief, whoever he is, be it Mr. Reagan, be \nit Mr. Bush, be it Mr. Clinton. I respect that office. But our troops \nare sent overseas. Congress did not vote to send them overseas. We are \ntold they will be there about a year. The year comes and the year goes; \nthey are still there. Then we are told they will be there until June \n1998. It is now June 1998, and June is about gone.\n  Then we are faced, we in the Senate, we in the Congress are faced \nwith the choice of providing money for the military that has been sent \nabroad. They did not ask to go abroad--these soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines. They have been sent by the Commander in Chief. Then we are \nfaced with the dilemma.\n  The administration knew that when it told the Congress that our men \nand women would be there about a year. The administration knew that \nonce they were there, Congress would be faced with a dilemma. And, of \ncourse, Congress--we are going to support our military people wherever \nthey are. The administration knows that. They knew that back in 1995. \nWe had our doubts on whether we were deliberately misled, the \nadministration knowing that they could not do this within a year. How \nam I to know?\n  Some of us are becoming aware of the fact that we have been dealt \nthat hand more than once. We had the same hand dealt to us in Somalia--\nthe same hand. And there have been other places as well.\n\n[[Page S6950]]\n\n  But I think this is why the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and \nI, and others, are just becoming a little distrustful of what the \nadministration says about these matters. And we want to have a hand at \nthe end of the leash. We want that constitutional leash to be there. \nThe power of the purse, of course, is the most fundamental, the most \nbasic, the greatest power in Government--the power of the purse.\n  We want a hand at the end of the leash. We are not saying, you have \nto take the troops out. We are not saying, you have to set certain \nlevels. We are just saying, as I indicated earlier, let us know by \nFebruary 2, 1999, Mr. President, how you would suggest that we reduce \nthose to a certain level that is more in keeping with what the other \nmajor parties are doing in Bosnia. And you reach that level by February \n2, 2000.\n  Now let me lay the predicate by reading into the Record what the \nConstitution says. Now, how much responsibility, how much power, how \nmuch authority does the Commander in Chief have? After all, the framers \nhad in mind making doubly sure that the Commander in Chief was a \ncivilian, not a military officer; and that this civilian, the \nPresident, would have the authority over the military. The framers were \ndetermined that a civilian would have supreme authority over the \nmilitary. They placed that authority in the President. He would be the \nCommander in Chief. He would be superior to the military. It would not \nbe a military officer who would be Commander in Chief. It had to be a \ncivilian officer, selected by the people through electors who, in turn, \nwould elect a President. A civilian would be the Commander in Chief.\n  The framers were very jealous of that power. They knew the history of \nEngland. They knew that the King was the Commander in Chief and the \nadmiral in chief and that the King in England raised armies and \nmaintained navies, that the King in England declared war and declared \npeace, and that the King in England made the regulations for the \ngovernance of the Armed Forces. They were determined that no King would \ndo that in this country. They were determined that no President would \nsit as a King in this country.\n  The President, a civilian, was to be the Commander in Chief.\n  Now, I want to read for the Record everything that is in this \nConstitution with respect to the powers of the President--the Commander \nin Chief--when it comes to the military.\n  So I look to Article II of the United States. Here it is, Article II \nof the Constitution of the United States. ``The executive power shall \nbe vested in a President of the United States of America.''\n  That sentence vests the executive power in one person, the President \nof the United States. It is just that simple. There is your separation \nof powers.\n  Now, I want to read everything that is in this Constitution that has \nto do with the Commander in Chief and his power. Here we go. Section 2, \nArticle II:\n\n       The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and \n     Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several \n     States, when called into the actual Service of the United \n     States;\n\n  Now, who provides for the calling of the militia into the actual \nservice of the United States? The Congress. I will read that a little \nlater. The Congress provides for the actual calling of the militia into \nthe service of the United States.\n  Then in the second paragraph of section 2:\n\n       He [meaning the President, the Commander in Chief] shall \n     have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, \n     to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present \n     concur;\n\n  In England, the king could make treaties, but the framers decided \nthat that power in this country, under this Republic--it is not a \ndemocracy, it is a republic--under this Republic, would be shared \nbetween the President and the Senate.\n  Continuing to read:\n\n       and he [the President, the Commander in Chief] shall \n     nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the \n     Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors . . . [and other public \n     officers].\n\n  So, there again, the King in the motherland from whom most of the \nMembers came either directly or by their ancestors, the King appointed \nthe officers. But in this Republic, the President can appoint them by \nand with the consent of the Senate.\n  So that is a power that the framers decided to share.\n  Now, there is one more phrase.\n  Section 3, the President, the Commander in Chief, ``shall Commission \nall the Officers of the United States.''\n  Now, there it is, lock, stock, and barrel, every bit of it, all of \nit. There is the Commander in Chief's powers with respect to war. There \nit is. I have read all that the Constitution says regarding the \nCommander in Chief.\n  He shall be Commander and Chief of the Army and Navy of the United \nStates and of the militia of the several States when called into the \nfull service of the United States; he shall have power by and with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate to make treaties, provided two-thirds \nof the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with \nthe advice of the Senate shall appoint, ambassadors; and, finally, he \nshall commission all the officers of the United States.\n  That is it. So the President is Commander in Chief. The Constitution \ndoesn't say what his powers are as Commander in Chief. He is Commander \nin Chief of the Army and the Navy if Congress provides an Army and Navy \nfor him to command.\n  So much for the Commander in Chief. Now, let's read what the war \npowers of the Congress are, according to the Constitution. Here they \nare with regard to warmaking:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to lay and collect Taxes . . \n     . to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense . . .\n\n  Section 8, the very first sentence. I will go ahead:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . borrow money . . .\n\n  The President doesn't have that power.\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . regulate Commerce \n     with foreign nations . . .\n\n  That is a very important power in peace and in war.\n  Continuing, still, in section 8 of Article I of the Constitution:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . define and punish \n     Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and \n     Offenses against the Law of Nations . . .\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . declare War, grant \n     Letters of Marque and Reprisal and make Rules concerning \n     Captures on Land and Water . . .\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . raise and support \n     Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be \n     for a longer Term than two Years . . .\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . provide and maintain \n     a Navy.\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . make Rules for the \n     Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces . . .\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . provide for calling \n     forth the Militia . . .\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . provide for \n     organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for \n     governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service \n     of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, \n     the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of \n     training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed \n     by Congress . . .\n\n  Continuing in Article I, section 8;\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . exercise like \n     Authority over all Places . . . for the Erection of Forts, \n     Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards . . .\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . make all Laws which \n     shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the \n     foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this \n     Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in \n     any Department or Officer thereof.\n\n  Including the Department of Defense, or officers thereof, which \nincludes the Secretary of Defense.\n  So there you are. Then in Article I, section 9:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law . . .\n\n  Congress makes the law. So I have taken the time of the Senate--and \nSenators have been very kind to listen--to read into the record that \nwhich any Member of the Congress, or any individual, can at any time he \nor she wishes to read for himself or herself from the Constitution of \nthe United States. All of the authority of the Commander in Chief is \nthere in the Constitution. That is all. And all of the authority is \nthere in that Constitution for the Congress, when it comes to \nwarmaking.\n\n  From my reading of those portions of the Constitution, it appears to \nme that\n\n[[Page S6951]]\n\nCongress has the authority and the duty, on behalf of the people from \nwhom all power comes, in whom all power resides, under this \nConstitution--Congress has the responsibility and the duty to ask \nquestions and to make laws, and to make appropriations, and to draw \nlines in the sand. Yes; Congress has the authority there to decide \noverall troop levels. One will find that most of the lawmaking powers, \nmost of the authority and the powers that deal with the military forces \nand with military actions, rest in the Congress of the United States. \nDon't blame me for that. You are not arguing with me, you are arguing \nwith the Constitution. I have read the pertinent parts of the \nConstitution into the Record.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator certainly understands that the Senator from \nWest Virginia has a much greater grasp of the Constitution than this \nSenator from Indiana. But I am having difficulty understanding how the \npower of Congress to regulate troop levels--and I understand that we \nset force levels. The Congress, through our committee, authorizes \ncertain force levels for the Army, for the Navy, and the branches. But \nI don't understand how that would apply to the deployment of those \nforces or the utilization of those forces within a specific military \nexercise. I don't know that that is a power that is granted to the \nCongress. I don't see that here in the Constitution.\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't think that I said that.\n  Mr. COATS. Perhaps I misunderstood the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Perhaps I didn't speak clearly. There are those who say \nthat the Congress doesn't have authority to do this, Congress doesn't \nhave authority to do that. If the Congress wanted to limit the troop \nlevels in the war to 5,000 men, is the Senator telling me that Congress \ndoesn't have the authority under the Constitution to say there will be \n5,000 and no more in this theater or that?\n  Mr. COATS. I don't see what grants the Congress the power to do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator doesn't?\n  Mr. COATS. I don't. I wonder if the Senator could point out that \nportion of the constitutional powers that grants Congress that \nauthority.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well----\n  Mr. COATS. I understand how Congress has the power to establish the \nlevel of the militia, the level of the Army, the number of individuals. \nI suppose if Congress said there shall be no more than 5,000 members in \nthe U.S. Navy, that would impose a limit to how many troops could be \ndeployed, and the maximum number you could deploy would be 5,000. But I \ndon't see where once the level is established, and we have established \na level of nearly 500,000 Active Army, for instance, I don't see how \nthat would translate to Congress having the power to dictate how that \n500,000 force level would be assigned.\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't, either. I don't think Congress would attempt to do \nthat. But I think Congress has the power and has the authority to say \nthere will be no more than 5,000.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Total.\n  Mr. BYRD. Total.\n  Is that the troop level?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes.\n  Perhaps I was extrapolating wrongly. I thought the Senator was \nindicating that power would be vested with the Congress relative to the \nByrd-Hutchison amendment which sets a level--attempts to set, to \ndictate a process which would set a level for total number of troops \nthat would be engaged. Perhaps this Senator--\n  Mr. BYRD. No. The Senator heard me. The Senator was in here earlier \nand heard me say that the Hutchison-Byrd amendment did not do that, did \nnot dictate troop levels.\n  Mr. COATS. Would that amendment not lead to Congress making the \ndecision on that?\n  Mr. BYRD. No. It states specifically that the President, the \nCommander in Chief, shall submit to the Congress the plan by February \n2, 1999, which will bring the force levels of the United States in \nBosnia down to a certain number which is more in keeping with the \nnumbers that are provided by Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain.\n  Is there anything unfair about that?\n  We don't say it has to be 2,000, or 2,500, or anything like that.\n  Mr. COATS. But as a condition, that level is required; a level is \nrequired to be reached on the basis of an average of ground force \nlevels of other NATO troops, specified troops from Great Britain, \nGermany, France, and Italy that arrives at a specific number.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is wrong with that? We are saying to the President, \n``You tell us how you would get it down to something which, in the eyes \nof the American people, who are paying the taxes to keep our forces \nover there, would be a fair level in view of the fact that we have \ncarried most of the burden thus far. We have helped stabilize the \nsituation. Why isn't it fair?'' But let the President tell us how he \nwould go about doing it and bring it down more in keeping with what the \nother leading countries of NATO are providing.\n  Mr. COATS. I would respectfully say to the Senator, my reading of the \namendment indicates that it would do more than that. It doesn't just \nask the President as Commander in Chief to tell us what the numbers \nshall be. It tells the President of the United States that he has to \nsubmit to us a number which is the average of four other countries' \nparticipation. That requires the President to tell us a specific number \ndictated by the decisions made by the King.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. COATS. Made by Great Britain, made by France, made by Italy.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is wrong with that?\n  Mr. COATS. I think there is a great distinction between asking the \nPresident, ``What do you think the force should be? What, in your \njudgment as Commander in Chief, with the advice and consent and \nassistance of your military commanders, should the number be to perform \na certain mission?''--there is a great distinction between that and a \ndirection to the President of the United States saying, ``You must give \nus a number based on an average of troops that are committed by nations \noutside Congress' control,'' and it cannot exceed that.\n\n  The President here couldn't have the discretion to say, ``Well, we \nneed whatever troops are necessary to protect, or complete our mission, \nor carry out our mission in this part of the world, or to protect our \nforces.'' The President is being dictated to arrive at a number, which \nthe President may disagree with, or the Commander in Chief, or the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagrees with in terms of \nability to carry out that mission.\n  That is my concern with the Byrd-Hutchison amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the Senator's question? Is he saying that, under \nthe Constitution, Congress cannot ask the President to do this?\n  Mr. COATS. I do not understand where in the Constitution the power is \nvested in Congress to specify not the total force level but to specify \nmilitary strategy.\n  Mr. BYRD. Where in the Constitution does it say that the Commander in \nChief can do that? Where in the Constitution can the Senator point to \nme that the Constitution says the Commander in Chief can do that?\n  Mr. COATS. This Senator interprets the power given to the President \nto be the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. \n``Commander in Chief'' implies that person is in charge. That person \nmakes the decision.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator interprets that.\n  Suppose Congress doesn't raise and support any Army. Suppose Congress \ndoes not provide and maintain a Navy. Then what does the Commander in \nChief command?\n  Mr. COATS. Nothing.\n  Mr. BYRD. He is Commander in Chief. But he has no Navy, and he has no \nArmy to command.\n  Mr. COATS. I agree with the Senator. If the Congress does not choose \nto give the President the military force, he has nothing with which to \ncommand. But if the Congress does give him forces and raises an Army \nand a Navy, this Constitution designates that the President of the \nUnited States is commander of that Army.\n  Mr. BYRD. And that is all. Just that he is Commander in Chief.\n  Mr. COATS. The duties of Commander in Chief are to direct that Army, \nto deploy that Army when necessary to defend the United States.\n\n[[Page S6952]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. This doesn't say that. This Constitution doesn't say that.\n  Mr. COATS. Is the Senator saying those are the decisions to be made \nby this Congress?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am reading the Constitution.\n  Mr. COATS. So am I.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me read it.\n\n       The Congress shall have Powers . . . To make Rules for the \n     Government and regulation of the land and naval Forces.\n\n  And:\n\n       The Congress shall have . . . Power to provide for calling \n     forth the Militia . . ..\n\n  It doesn't say the President has the power to call forth the militia. \nIt doesn't say the President has the power to make rules for government \nand regulation of land and naval forces.\n  I am reading the Constitution, Senator. I am not interpreting it. I \nam reading it word for word.\n\n  Mr. COATS. I ask the Senator, what does the Senator believe the \nfounders intended to be the powers of the President as Commander in \nChief? What would be his duties as Commander? What does the word \n``commander'' imply, or state, or mean?\n  Mr. BYRD. They saw the benefit in having one individual lead the \nmilitary forces of this country.\n  Mr. COATS. How does that individual do that?\n  Mr. BYRD. If Congress declares war.\n  Mr. COATS. It only applies if Congress declares war.\n  Mr. BYRD. I see. The Senator wants to play games.\n  Mr. COATS. No. The Senator wants to understand the Constitution.\n  Mr. BYRD. This Senator cannot teach the Senator from Indiana how to \nunderstand the Constitution. I can only read the Constitution. And it \nis pretty clear.\n  Mr. COATS. This Senator is reading the Constitution. It says the \nPresident shall be Commander in Chief.\n  Mr. BYRD. Period. That is it. That is all.\n  Mr. COATS. If I am in charge of my office, I make decisions about how \nthat office performs its duties. If the President is Commander in Chief \nof the military, he makes decisions about how the military performs its \nduties.\n  That is my understanding of the word ``commander.''\n  Mr. BYRD. The Constitution doesn't say anything about how the Senator \nwould operate his office.\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator was using an analogy to try to illustrate the \nrole of Commander.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is not a good analogy, if I may say so most \nrespectfully.\n  Mr. COATS. Then I will go back to my first question, respectfully.\n  Mr. BYRD. Then I will go back to my first answer.\n  Mr. COATS. How are we to interpret the role and the meaning of the \nword ``Commander in Chief''?\n  Mr. BYRD. In the first place, the courts might do the interpreting at \nsome point.\n  Second place: Read the Constitution. Congress has power over the \npurse strings.\n  I hope the Court will decide that the Line Item Veto Act is \nunconstitutional. I hope it will do that before it goes out for its \nrecess.\n  Congress having the power over the purse, Congress having the power \nto declare war, Congress having the power to raise and support armies, \nhaving the power to provide and maintain a navy, having the power to \nmake rules for the Government and regulation of the land and naval \nforces, having the power to provide for calling forth the militia.\n  It would seem to me that a reading of the Constitution would indicate \nthat the basic power, the power of the purse, is the basic, \nfundamental, rock bottom power in this Government. There is no greater \npower. There is no power as great as the power of the purse. That is \nvested here.\n  It would seem to me that a reading of this Constitution would \nindicate that Congress has more power and authority under the \nConstitution than many Senators are willing to admit.\n  Mr. COATS. I am not disagreeing with the Senator on that point \nwhatsoever.\n  Mr. BYRD. All too many Senators appear to be thinking that the \nCommander in Chief can do this, the Commander in Chief can do that, and \nthat we ought to follow along like the tail on a kite and do whatever \nthe Commander in Chief decides should be done.\n  I am just saying that Congress has these powers in this Constitution \nand Congress should raise some questions. And Congress certainly has \nthe authority to rein in the Commander in Chief if it sees fit.\n  Mr. COATS. I do not disagree with the Senator a bit on anything he \nhas just said.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. But the question I asked the Senator is whether that power \nextends to once that force is raised, once Congress determines to raise \nan army, once Congress appropriates funds for that army, once Congress \nestablishes force levels and sets the rules, at what point does \nCongress, does that extend--I should add, does that extend to the \nactual utilization by the Commander in Chief of the power--does the \nCongress have the power to determine how those forces then should be \ndeployed to protect and defend the interests of the United States?\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator appears bent upon splitting \nhairs.\n  Mr. COATS. But that is the essential question.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not interested in splitting hairs.\n  Mr. COATS. That is the essential question.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator says at what point does Congress have that. \nCongress before, before it provides for calling forth the militia, \nbefore it creates an army, before it creates a Navy, it certainly has \nthe power and authority not to do those things; it has the power to \nissue regulations. I am not suggesting that the Congress ought to try \nto get into the nitty-gritty, teensy-weensy little details of this and \nthat. Of course, there has to be one person who can command the \nmilitary forces of this country.\n  Mr. COATS. That is the Senator's question.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am saying the Congress has not done its duty, and I am \ntaking my responsibility along with others. We have not done our duty. \nCongress has the responsibility not to follow along after the President \nlike my little dog Billy follows after me. The Commander in Chief is \njust a man like I am. I respect the Presidency. I respect the President \nof the United States. I have never served under any President--that is \nthe way I look at being a Senator--but he puts his britches on just \nlike I do, one leg at a time. No more. And he is there for 4 years, \nunless the House impeaches him. He can't impeach us, but the House can \nimpeach and we can convict him and take him out of that office, and we \ncan also provide that he can never again hold an office.\n  I am not one who bows down to the President, who bows down to any \nCommander in Chief. I am not one who believes we have to do what the \nCommander in Chief says, but I respect the Commander in Chief. I \nhaven't cast a vote, I don't think, against our having personnel in \nBosnia. I haven't done that. But I am certainly not one who says that \nCongress has to follow the Commander in Chief.\n  Now, if the Commander in Chief is ever a Republican again, I daresay \nthere won't be as many people on that side who will stand up and \nchallenge his powers as I stand up and challenge the powers of a \nDemocratic President. As far as I am concerned, under this Constitution \nthere is no Democrat; there is no Republican. He is the President of \nthe United States. He is in there for 4 years, and that is it, unless \nhe is reelected.\n  I have been here for 40 years. I hope to be here 40 years more, if \nthe Good Lord lets me live that long. But don't look at this Senator \nand say I am picking on the President. I am not picking on the \nCommander in Chief. I am simply saying that we here in the Congress \nhave not stood up to our duties under this Constitution. And I do not \nread under this Constitution where we have to follow any President \nlock, stock, and barrel, line, hook and sinker. We do not have to do \nthat. We can set a line, and we can say ``this far and no farther. If \nyou want to keep our troops in Bosnia longer, come back, Mr. Commander \nin Chief, come back and we will decide whether or not we want to open \nthe purse strings and provide more appropriations.''\n\n  Mr. COATS. Well, in response--perhaps I should let the Senator finish \nand then I will respond on my own time.\n\n[[Page S6953]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope the Senator doesn't think he has to respond.\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator feels that he should respond because----\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not challenging the Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. I am not challenging the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am talking about the Commander in Chief, in the abstract. \nI haven't said anything about the Senator from Indiana. He shouldn't \nfeel he has to respond to me. He has a right to if he wishes, but I \nhope the Senator will know I haven't challenged him.\n  Mr. COATS. No, the Senator didn't take it that way at all. The \nSenator is simply trying to get an answer to his question as it applied \nto the language in the Byrd-Hutchison amendment which has been talked \nabout today, and trying to understand the role of the Commander in \nChief vis-a-vis the role of Congress in that specific, requiring that \nspecific requirement of the President as Commander in Chief relative to \nthat language in the Byrd-Hutchison amendment. I was just trying to \nclarify it.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator apparently doesn't believe the Congress has the \nauthority to do what the Hutchison-Byrd amendment would require. I hope \nhe does. I think it does.\n  Congress can limit troops by limiting funds for missions. No one \nquestions that. There is great reluctance to placing limits on \nmissions. But when we come to a place where an administration doesn't \nlevel with the Congress, then it is about time that the Congress \nthought about putting some limits on missions, and Congress has the \nconstitutional authority to do it. Don't think it doesn't. I have been \naround here for 40 years in this Senate and 6 years in the other body, \nand as far as I am concerned I am getting a little tired of Presidents \nand Commanders in Chief and their administrations misleading \nCongresses. This isn't the first time it has been done. It has been \ndone before.\n  Madam President, I think I have said about everything already that I \nhave in my prepared remarks. I have read the pertinent parts of the \nConstitution that deal with the Commander in Chief's war powers and the \nwar power and authority that rests with Congress. I do not say this \ndisrespectfully towards our Commander in Chief. I would say the same if \nhe were Republican. The Constitution is not partisan. I hope that we \ncan be able to agree on some legislation--and it is extremely difficult \nunder the circumstances--particularly in regard to the situation we \nhave in the Balkans. And I agree with the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison. In my own mind, I can keep separate the \ncircumstances and conditions that we face in regard to Bosnia from \nthose which we might have to face in Kosovo.\n  I don't understand what our security interests are in relation to \nBosnia. But I do understand what our security interests can be when it \ncomes to Kosovo. I think Congress has to recognize it has a duty here, \nnot just to let the administration do whatever it alone thinks best. \nAnd I think we owe the President that kind of consideration. I would \nhope that we could come out with some kind of proposal, certainly in \nthe long run, that would clearly state what the exit strategy is or \nwhat the limitations are, what is the deadline, what are the phases by \nwhich we reduce our forces.\n  I do not have the magic bullet. I don't claim that the Hutchison-Byrd \namendment has the magic bullet. I have taken the time at this point to \nquote the pertinent provisions of the Constitution for the Record, \nMadam President. I don't claim to add to them or to subtract from them. \nHere they are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, first of all, I have great respect for \nthe Senator from West Virginia. His knowledge of the Constitution \ncertainly is far deeper than mine is, or perhaps will ever be. And I \nalso share his deep concern about the duplicity of this administration \nin terms of its dealings with Congress on the issue of Bosnia. What was \nassured to the Congress by the President and his designees prior to \ndeployment in order to secure congressional support and appropriations \nfor that deployment is far from the picture that exists today. Many of \nus knew that, once in, it would be tough to get out, and that a year, \nprobably, would be far insufficient to accomplish the mission that was \nthere, that was outlined for us. This is the reason I voted against it \nin the first place.\n  As well-intended, as humanitarian, as compassionate as the decision \nwas to try to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia, there was no realistic \nmeans by which that nation could be reborn into a nation of multi-\nethnic harmony that would at least be accomplished within that 1-year \nperiod of time, or perhaps even a decade or more. So, many of us feared \nthat, once in, we would have trouble getting out.\n  I certainly agree with the Senator from West Virginia when he says \nthat the Constitution clearly gives Congress the responsibility for \nproviding the funds for the first person in uniform, the first ship \never built, setting limits on how many ships we build or the size of \nour force. The question that the Senator from Indiana was trying to \nraise, and still doesn't feel he has the answer to, is whether or not \nthe power extended to the Congress extends to defining how that force, \nonce raised, is used in defense of the Nation, in defense of our vital \ninterests. Which is the entity, the Congress or the President as \nCommander in Chief, that makes the decision establishing a process by \nwhich decisions are made, through his military commanders, about \nutilization of the forces that are raised after the Congress \nappropriates the funds to raise those forces? And it goes to the \nspecific question of whether or not we have the authority, in Congress, \nto set specific limits to how those troops, once raised, within that \ncategory of troops--who has the power to do that.\n  But let's set that aside. Let's assume that the power given to the \nPresident as Commander in Chief is nothing more than titular. It is \njust simply a title. It is a phrase that means nothing. It grants no \npower. It just simply says the President of the United States is the \ntitular head of the Army, but there are no powers that go with the \ntitle of ``Commander,'' or the role of ``Commander''--that all powers \nare vested in the Congress.\n  Let's say that the courts interpret the Constitution to clearly mean \nthat Congress makes decisions on how troops are deployed, where they \nfight, whom they fight, how they fight, how many infantry are needed, \nhow many tanks are needed--make the military strategy decisions. It is \ninconceivable to this Senator that our Founding Fathers thought that \nwould be a power delegated to the Congress, but let's assume that it \nwas. Would we want to do that? Would we want to put ourselves in the \nplace of a military commander, with his training and years of \nexperience, honed through hard experience in many cases, to make a \ndecision about how we protect those forces and how we deploy those \nforces? It just seems it would be perhaps the most unwise thing \nCongress could ever do. Who would ever want to take on that \nresponsibility? Which one of us would want to say that, for the \nprotection of our forces deployed overseas in a hostile environment, we \nshould be the ones to make the determination about how many troops are \nnecessary to protect those forces, what weapons are necessary to \nprotect those forces, what enablers are necessary to protect those \nforces? I am not sure any of us would want to do that, even if we did \nhave the power.\n\n  But that is a debate that I think we will have again. The amendment \nbefore us is not the Byrd-Hutchison amendment, which this Senator \nsupports parts of but not all of, because I think it dictates a \nspecific force level inappropriately and I don't think that is \nsomething that we ought to do.\n  But the amendment that is before us is one that I think is supported \nby most Members. It simply says that we want to advise the President \nthat we don't think an indefinite troop deployment in Bosnia. We want \nthe President to understand, the Congress is not going to continue to \nsupport that policy. But the decision that vests with us is whether or \nnot to pay for it. That is the power given to us under the \nConstitution. And, to echo the words of Senator McCain from Arizona, if \nyou want the troops out of Bosnia, cut off the funds. That is our \nresponsibility. But if you are going to appropriate the\n\n[[Page S6954]]\n\nfunds, let's let the Commander in Chief and the people he designates as \nleaders of those troops make decisions as to how those troops are \ndeployed and at what levels they are deployed, and not have the \nCongress dictate force levels.\n  So, I agree with the Senator from West Virginia. We ought to follow \nour constitutional responsibility. That constitutional responsibility \nis to vote on the appropriations, yea or nay. That is the honest, \nstraight-up vote. That is the debate we ought to be having. In the \nmeantime, we would like to send a message to the President of the \nUnited States. That is what a sense of the Congress is. The message \nthat we would like to send to the President of the United States is: \nMr. President, we are concerned that we are looking at an indefinite \ntroop deployment at considerable cost to the taxpayer in Bosnia, and we \ndon't see the light at the end of the tunnel. Because of that, we are \njust giving you a warning flag.\n  We are not going to continue to appropriate funds for this unless we \nhave some idea of how we are going to get out of this morass and \nwhether or not this is achieving the goals that have been set out.\n  So, therefore, we would like you, understanding that message, to \nbegin consultations with our NATO allies and European friends and begin \nthe process of telling them, ``You can't count on us indefinitely. We \nneed to move toward a European force. Now, we will provide support for \nyou, but we are not going to provide combat troops on the ground much \nlonger. So let's move forward with this process.''\n  That is the amendment that is before us. I think it is a message that \nneeds to be sent. We can have debate on whether or not Congress has the \npower or whether or not it is even wise for Congress to get into the \nspecifics of how troops are used once they are there. We will have that \ndebate at another time.\n  Madam President, I don't know that there is any further debate on \nthis particular amendment. It does not mean we can't further debate on \nBosnia or another amendment, but if there is no further debate on this \nparticular amendment, we need to voice vote the McCain second-degree \namendment and then have a recorded vote on the underlying amendment. I \ndo, however, see the Senator from New Hampshire on his feet, as well as \nthe Senator from South Carolina.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nReed from Rhode Island be added as a cosponsor to the Thurmond-Levin-\nCoats amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, just as an inquiry to \nthe managers, I have an amendment that I would like to offer which will \nprobably take 15 or 20 minutes for me to present at the most. I don't \nwant to delay a vote, but it seems that we might be able to put the two \nvotes together. We would have the voice vote on McCain, and then if I \noffer my amendment, we can have two votes together. Will that work for \nthe Senator? I would at least like to debate and offer this amendment \nprior to the vote on your amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, will the able Senator allow the other \namendments to go forward before we take up his amendment?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. My preference, I say to the Senator, is \nthat I be allowed to debate this amendment, present it and allow----\n  Mr. THURMOND. After we finish this amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. No, I prefer to do it prior to this \namendment, because it is on the same subject. It is Bosnia, and once \nyou vote and that amendment is gone--my preference is to do it now if I \ncan do it.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. COATS. I say to the Senator, our vote will not preclude the \nSenator from offering an amendment on Bosnia. If the Senator's \namendment is not a second-degree amendment to the underlying amendment, \nwe strongly prefer to deal with our amendment as it stands and then \nhave the Senator be recognized to offer an amendment on Bosnia.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. All I am trying to do is to make it a \nlittle more convenient for Members. I was saying if I had 15 or 20 \nminutes to present my amendment, we can have both votes on the \nunderlying amendment and my amendment at the same time. That is my \npoint.\n  Mr. COATS. As I understand it--parliamentary inquiry--if the \nSenator's amendment is not a second degree, does it not require \nunanimous consent to set aside the underlying amendment before going to \nhis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, unanimous consent is \nrequired.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent that the \nunderlying amendment be set aside in order for me to offer my amendment \nand subsequently have a vote on both amendments.\n  Mr. COATS. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, and I am \ngoing to object. I don't think that is the procedure we ought to be \nfollowing. I understand the Senator's desire to speak on his Bosnia \namendment, and we will do that, but if an amendment is not being \noffered as a second degree to perfect or change or modify the \nunderlying amendment--we have been working on this since noon. We would \nvery much like to get to a vote. It is second degreed. We have an \namendment. And on that basis, I object.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Further parliamentary inquiry. It is my \nunderstanding the tree is full with the McCain second degree; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The understanding of the Senator from New \nHampshire is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, we have been on this amendment now for \nhours. It is time to vote and take some action. I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I have remarks I would like to make in \ngeneral on the subject of the amendments to the defense authorization \nbill regarding Bosnia. It will take about 5 minutes. I ask the \ntolerance of the distinguished chairman, if that is permissible.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I yield to the Senator to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, the debate on Bosnia has raised some fundamental \nquestions regarding the conduct of our foreign policy particularly with \nrespect to the deployment of U.S. military forces around the world. I \nwill point out just a few of the questions that members have raised:\n  What is the mission of U.S. forces in Bosnia?\n  When can we expect to bring them home?\n  What should the role of the Congress be in the fulfillment of this \nmission?\n  How can we manage the cost of the Bosnia commitment in terms of \ndollars and the overall strain to our forces?\n  It is good that we debate these important issues here in the Senate \ntoday. But I feel it is important to say that I believe we should ask \nonly one question:\n\n\n     Should we continue to support a U.S. troop presence in Bosnia?\n\n  That is a simple question. If the answer is yes, then I do not see \nanything we can do but to support the troops and insure that their \nmission is achievable.\n  If the answer is no, then we should bring them home today.\n  I support the mission. Let me take a few moments to explain why. I \nwas very skeptical of the Bosnia mission before I was elected to the \nSenate. That is part of the reason why I made Bosnia one of the first \nplaces I visited on my first trip abroad as a U.S. Senator. On my \njourney in Bosnia, I had the opportunity to visit with our troops at \nEagle Base and then at Camp Bedrock. I found them surprisingly cheerful \nand confident in their mission\n\n[[Page S6955]]\n\nof peace-keeping in that war-weary countryside. I'm very proud of our \nforces. They are paying a personal price every day in risking their \nlives on our behalf. They are working in a tasking and demanding \nenvironment filled with diplomatic and military minefields. All of the \nmen and women involved in this effort are a credit to the United States \nand the cause of human dignity and freedom in the Balkans. I am proud \nof them all.\n  The effort in Bosnia involves the largest alliance of nations ever to \ncoalesce against a common enemy on the continent of Europe. I applaud \nall the members of the alliance for their contributions to peace and \nstability in Bosnia, particularly the NATO members, and especially the \nRussians, for coming together in a unified effort to prevent further \nbloodshed, enhance stability and pave a pathway for peace. I hope it is \na harbinger of good things to come in the next century in terms of \nenhanced cooperation and communications among our countries for the \nbetterment of mankind.\n  It was raining during the afternoon we were in Bosnia. By the time we \nwere preparing to leave, the rain had ceased and the sun was coming \nout. As we boarded our airplane, I noticed a large rainbow forming in \nthe sky. It was impossible to avoid the symbolism and be reminded of \nthe covenant between God and mankind after the great flood. It was a \nsymbol of hope, I think.\n  Today we are in a new era. No one has quite coined the term for it. \nSome call it the ``New World Order,'' but I prefer to call it The Age \nof Democracy. What I find different and indeed magical about this new \nera is the fact that while it brings with it the spread of democracy \nand democratic principles around the world to places that have been \nburdened by tyranny, it is doing so not through the threat of force, \nbut through the promise of peace. U.S. forces in Bosnia bring with them \nthe promise of peace.\n  A few days after I visited Camp Bedrock, I was in Brussels. An \nAmerican businessman approached me and asked me if I had ``hope'' about \nBosnia. I had to reply, ``Yes.'' I have hope because I believe Europe \nhas learned some painful lessons over the last two centuries. One of \nthose lessons is that alliances--whether against Napoleon, Hitler or \nStalin--can win. Secondly, I have hope because Americans have learned \nsome lessons about European history as well. Particularly, I think \nwe've learned one of the lessons about American involvement on the \nEuropean continent. The lesson is this: ``Pay me now, or pay me \nlater.'' In other words, we as a nation are involved in Europe--\nmilitarily, economically, culturally. Better to work through the \nEuropean Alliance, in particular through NATO, to prevent a conflict \nthan to risk that conflict turning into a greater confrontation or, \neven worse, war itself.\n  I do not know whether the Bosnia mission will ultimately prove to be \nsuccessful, but I do believe we should try. We should not tie the hands \nof our troops.\n  In spite of my support for the Bosnia mission, however, I do not like \nthe fact that it appears to be open-ended. I do not like the fact that \nit is placing a tremendous strain on our Armed Forces. I do not like \nthe fact that we do not know when the mission will be completed. But we \nshould have addressed these issues years ago before we ever sent our \ntroops there. We have violated a fundamental principle about the \ndeployment of military forces.\n  Clauswitz stated that in military matters you should not take the \nfirst step unless you know what your last step is going to be. Four \nyears ago, we had no idea what our last step would be. That has led us \nto where we are today. Today we are deciding by amendment what our \npolicy in Bosnia should be. You can't manage a military deployment that \nway.\n  It seems to me that we are in for a dime, in for a dollar. The \nquestion is should we stay in Bosnia, or should we leave? Once we \ndecide to go in, we need to give our military commanders the resources \nand support they need to get the job done. We cannot change our mind \nevery year with new amendments and new resolutions and new laws.\n\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has debated this matter numerous \ntimes. We could not arrive at a consensus on the matter. The more we \ndebated the issue, the more I became convinced that we should not do \nanything that would undermine the mission in Bosnia. I fear that all of \nthe amendments that have been offered sent the wrong message to both \nour troops and our allies.\n  I was inclined to support a proposal by Senator Levin which would \nhave established expedited voting procedures on the question of whether \nto continue authorization of funds for the Bosnia mission. I believe of \nall of the amendments, his is one of the better approaches. Many \nmembers of the Senate want to have a straight up or down vote on the \nBosnia mission--in or out. Senator Levin's amendment would have \nprovided a mechanism for that.\n  However, I would point that over the past 4 years, the Congress has \ngiven its consent and approval for the Bosnia mission dozens of times. \nThe Congress has appropriated over $9.4 billion for this mission. The \nbottom line is that we have had the opportunity to weigh in on this \nmatter. Enough is enough.\n  Now is the time to focus on ensuring that we do not allow a situation \nlike the current situation with Bosnia to occur again. Before we get to \nthe point of committing our service men and women, we must certainly \ndetermine if we have an appropriate military mission which can only be \naccomplished by military means. Once such a determination is made, we \nmust provide our forces with sufficient resources, and clear and \nconcise rules of engagement to get the job done.\n  In this day and age we must pick and choose our battles carefully. As \nwe have learned so painfully in Vietnam, Somalia and now Bosnia, \nAmerican troops cannot stay there forever. We have learned valuable \nlessons from these engagements and now realize that before approving \nfunding for such missions, Congress must have a defined game plan and \nexit strategy. Senator Snowe and I have offered an amendment to the \ndefense authorization bill which would require the President to submit, \nalong with a request for appropriations to support a military \ncontingency involving 500 or more personnel, a strategic plan regarding \nthe goals and objectives of the contingency and the conditions that \ndefine the success of that contingency. We needed this amendment 4 \nyears ago when we first sent American troops into Bosnia, but we have \nlearned from these important lessons. Congress, by approving such a \nplan would be in on the takeoff, as well as the landing.\n  Frankly, I think this is the most important amendment related to the \ndeployment of forces in the entire bill. I am pleased that the Senate \nhas approved it. I would only urge that we think twice before doing \nanything that would undermine U.S. forces after they have already been \ncommitted.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me just thank the Senator from \nGeorgia not just for his statement but also for the amendment which he \nand Senator Snowe had offered in committee, which was adopted in \ncommittee. It is a very important amendment. It is based on his \nexperience, the experience of so many others relative to the use of \nmilitary force, and the importance of exercising exceeding care when \nthat military force is utilized. And I think the Nation, again, is in \nhis debt and Senator Snowe's debt. I just thank him for it.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2977\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. I urge adoption of the McCain amendment No. 2977, which \nwould amend the amendment offered by myself, Senator Coats, and Senator \nLevin that would require two reports on matters related to U.S. forces \nin Bosnia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I understand that Senator Biden might be \non his way over. I suggest the absence of a quorum for just one brief \nmoment until we can ascertain that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6956]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the McCain amendment?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I urge adoption of the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2977) was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 2975, as Amended\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I ask that we proceed to vote on the \nThurmond, Levin, Coats amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A \n     resolution described in paragraph (1) that is introduced in \n     the House of Representatives shall be referred to the \n     Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (3) Discharge of committee.--If the committee to which is \n     referred a resolution described in paragraph (1) has not \n     reported such resolution (or an identical resolution) at the \n     end of 7 calendar days after its introduction, the committee \n     shall be deemed to be discharged from further consideration \n     of the resolution and the resolution shall be placed on the \n     appropriate calendar of the House involved.\n       (4) Floor consideration.--\n       (A) In general.--When the committee to which a resolution \n     is referred has reported, or has been deemed to be discharged \n     (under paragraph (3)) from further consideration of, a \n     resolution described in paragraph (1), it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the \n     respective House to move to proceed to the consideration of \n     the resolution, and all points of order against the \n     resolution (and against consideration of the resolution) are \n     waived. The motion is highly privileged in the House of \n     Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and is not \n     debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, or to a \n     motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the \n     vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall \n     not be in order.

A \n     motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. \n     An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion \n     to recommit the resolution is not in order. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or \n     disagreed to is not in order.\n       (C) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on a resolution described in \n     paragraph (1), and a single quorum call at the conclusion of \n     the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the \n     appropriate House, the vote on final passage of the \n     resolution shall occur.\n       (D) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the \n     case may be, to the procedure relating to a resolution \n     described in paragraph (1) shall be decided without debate.\n       (5) Coordination with action by other house.--If, before \n     the passage by one House of a resolution of that House \n     described in paragraph (1), that House receives from the \n     other House a resolution described in paragraph (1), then the \n     following procedures shall apply:\n       (A) The resolution of the other House shall not be referred \n     to a committee.\n       (B) With respect to a resolution described in paragraph (1) \n     of the House receiving the resolution--\n\n[[Page S6957]]\n\n       (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     resolution had been received from the other House; but\n       (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution \n     of the other House.\n       (6) Consideration of veto.--\n       (A) Action upon receipt of message.--Upon receipt of a \n     message from the President returning the joint resolution \n     unsigned to the House of origin and setting forth his \n     objections to the joint resolution, the House receiving the \n     message shall immediately enter the objections at large on \n     the journal of that House and the House shall proceed to the \n     immediate reconsideration of the joint resolution the \n     objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding \n     or of a motion to proceed to the immediate reconsideration of \n     the joint resolution, or the joint resolution and objections \n     shall lie on the table.

The motion is highly privileged in the House \n     of Representatives and is a question of highest privilege in \n     the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to \n     amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n     disagreed to shall not be in order.

A motion further to \n     limit debate is in order and not debatable. An amendment to, \n     or a motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business is not in order. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the joint resolution is agreed \n     to notwithstanding the objections of the President or \n     disagreed to is not in order.\n       (D) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on reconsideration of the \n     resolution, and a single quorum call at the conclusion of the \n     debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the \n     appropriate House, the vote on the question of passage, the \n     objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding, \n     shall occur.\n       (7) Rules of house of representatives and senate.--This \n     subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a resolution described in \n     paragraph (1), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, will the able Senator allow me to get \ntwo people on the floor?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I am happy to yield.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a military \nfellow on assignment to my staff, Major Joann Eberle, be permitted \naccess to the Senate Chamber during the consideration of S. 2057, the \nFY-1999 defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Vaughn \nWard, a fellow in Senator Kempthorne's office, be permitted floor \nprivileges during the consideration of the pending bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is not my intention to \ndelay the Senate. I have a very serious amendment, and I have a few \nmoments of time and would like to outline what it is. If there is not a \nlot of argument on the other side, I say to my colleagues, we could \nhave a vote in a very few minutes.\n  The amendment is very simple. It just limits the use of funds to \nsupport the continued deployment of ground forces of the United States \nin Bosnia pending a vote of Congress on the continuation of deployment, \nand to require the President to submit a plan for withdrawal, if the \nCongress does not do so by March 31.\n  Very simply put, Mr. President--Mr. President, may I have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will Members of the Senate who are having \ndiscussions please retire to the Cloakroom.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment is very \nsimple. It simply says that we will have a vote, that the Congress will \ngo on record one way or the other. It doesn't say we have to vote yes. \nIt doesn't say we have to vote no. It just simply says that we exercise \nour opinion so that the Congress can speak, so that we will be on \nrecord one way or the other. Leaving forces in Bosnia, taking them out, \nwhatever that vote turns out to be, that is all this amendment does. If \nthe President decides to keep them there after that, then so be it. But \nwe go on record as making a statement. This does not get into some of \nthe other issues that have been gotten into.\n  I would just like to briefly go back a little bit to remind Senators, \nbecause we hear a lot of talk of frustration about the Bosnia \noperation, about why our troops are there, how long are they going to \nbe there, people complaining about being misled by the President or not \nbeing told the truth by the President and all this. I am hearing all of \nthese comments and here is our chance with this amendment to be heard. \nIt just seems to me if we vote against this amendment, I don't see any \nreason why we should be complaining about the operation.\n  I remind my colleagues of some testimony. Secretary of Defense Perry \non December 1, 1995, said the following:\n\n       We believe the mission in Bosnia can be accomplished in 1 \n     year. So we built our plan based on that time line. And this \n     schedule is realistic because the specific military tasks in \n     the agreement can be completed in the first 6 months and \n     thereafter IFOR's role will be to maintain the climate of \n     stability that will permit civil work to go forward. We \n     expect these civil functions will be successfully initiated \n     in 1 year, but even if some of them are not, we must not be \n     drawn into a posture of indefinite garrison.\n\n  Further, on December 6, 1995, Assistant Secretary of State Holbrooke \nsaid:\n\n       The military tasks are doable within 12 months. There isn't \n     any question. The deeper question is whether the nonmilitary \n     functions can be done in 12 months. That is the real \n     question. But it is not the NATO or U.S. force responsibility \n     to do that. It is us on the civilian side working with the \n     Europeans. It is going to be tough. Should the military stick \n     around until every refugee has gone home, until everything \n     else in the civilian annex has been done?\n\n  No, that is not their mission. That is what Secretary Holbrooke said.\n  So, Mr. President, the mission to Bosnia has very strong advocates \nand strong detractors. We have heard that in the debate in these past \nfew hours. My amendment does not seek to open that discussion nor to \nclose it. It really has nothing to do with that. It simply asks that \nMembers of Congress at some point between now and March 31 of next \nyear, 1999, cast a vote on the wisdom of the United States-Bosnia \npolicy. That is all it does.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I will be happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to make a comment as to the genesis of this. \nI think there might be some misunderstanding. First of all, we did have \na vote back in 1995. That was the resolution of disapproval. And I \nsuggest that we only lost that by three votes. And at that time there \nwas a guarantee it was going to be a 12-month operation, it would not \nexceed $1.2 billion, all of these things. So predicated on that, the \nvote took place.\n  Now we are over there, and, quite frankly, I would have preferred to \nhave an amendment that would require a vote periodically, every 3 \nmonths or every 6 months, on approval of leaving them there, because I \nthink that would\n\n[[Page S6958]]\n\nbe much stronger. I think we need to be on record.\n  But all the Senator is doing is just--he is not saying this is going \nto be a resolution of disapproval or approval that we are voting on; it \nis just a vote.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is correct. And I would just say to \nthe Senator, I agree with him. I would like to vote for and see passed \na resolution of disapproval.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The only thing that the Senator would accomplish, if he \nwill yield for one last question, is the fact that would give us all an \nopportunity to be on record.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. On record.\n  Mr. INHOFE. So the people would have no doubt as to who wants to \nultimately get out of there.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The Senator is exactly correct. It gives \nus the opportunity to go on record as saying, one, let's just keep \ngoing, doing what we are doing. If you vote against the resolution, you \ncan do that, or if you want to get out. But the point is we vote. This \nsays that we have to have a vote by March 31 before we spend the rest \nof the money for the 6 months of the fiscal year 1999.\n  That is all it says. Now, however we vote is another issue. Then \nSenators go on record one way or the other--get out, stay in, either \none, but they will be on record instead of all the complaining that we \nhear around here about the Bosnia policy. Why would anybody object? \nThis is not asking us to vote yes. It is not asking us to vote no. It \nis asking us to vote, have a vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. One last comment. One last question. The reason I bring \nthis up, there are still some Senators who may be thinking this was the \nstronger version in which I joined the Senator. I would have preferred \nto have this as the stronger version, but this is not that version. \nThis is simply that vote to which the Senator is referring.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The Senator is correct. I would have \npreferred the stronger version myself, but given the fact that we \ndidn't have the votes, I decided to step back and just say, look, let's \ngo on record. Let's have the opportunity to go on record. It doesn't \nrequire that the vote be affirmative for the money to be released, only \nthat a vote takes place.\n  So to require that a vote take place and to have that vote taken \nseriously, my amendment uses the constitutional power that Senator Byrd \nspoke so eloquently of an hour or so ago of Congress to restrict funds. \nThe amendment holds back half the money authorized for Bosnia \noperations next year until a vote is held--not a vote to leave them \nthere, not a vote to take them out--a vote on a resolution authorizing \ncontinued deployment of U.S. ground combat forces to Bosnia. If it \nfails, the only result is that the President is required to tell us how \nand when he intends to withdraw. The money is still released.\n\n  The purpose is simple and straightforward. It is to use a small \namount of leverage, half of next year's money, to force Congress to \nexpress itself--that is all, to express itself--clearly on the Bosnia \nmission. The resolution may pass, it may fail, but at least Congress \nwill have expressed itself.\n  As the Senator from West Virginia has said so eloquently a while ago, \nwhy would Congress want to step away from its constitutional \nresponsibilities if it doesn't tell the President what to do? It \ndoesn't restrict the President. It doesn't get into troop strength. It \ndoesn't get into deployment. It doesn't get into any of that. It just \nsimply says Congress will have a vote.\n  Let me just say this. Before we have a vote on this amendment, I \nwould say to my colleagues that our constituents elected us to \nrepresent them. How can we represent them if we are afraid to just \nexpress ourselves on the Senate floor one way or the other? They expect \nus to stand and be counted on major foreign policy issues, and I can't \nthink of any excuse that we would give our constituents that would \njustify refusing to even have a vote on the resolution on Bosnia.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to accept some responsibility for \nUnited States-Bosnia policy, stand up and be counted and to pass the \namendment.\n  Let me be a little more specific, in summary, as to what the \namendment does. It is going to withhold half of next year's funding for \nBosnia until Congress votes on the issue. It doesn't require that the \nmission be approved, just that the vote is one way or the other. The \npurpose is to honor the very strong arguments and strong feelings on \nboth sides of the issue--both sides of the issue--by requiring the \ndebate and a vote. I hope my colleagues understand this amendment \nbecause I think there have been some expressions of misunderstanding.\n  As the Senator from West Virginia so eloquently said awhile back, the \nonly leverage that Congress has is funding. That is our leverage. I \nthink to use it in this manner is to use it responsibly. Unless we \nplace some restriction on it, there will be no pressure to debate \nanything and no pressure to vote on anything, and the debate itself \nwill not, in my view, ever be taken seriously. You know: sense of the \nSenate, sense of the House--these resolutions, they don't mean \nanything.\n  So, to try to get in the middle here so we can get some common \nground, just to have a vote rather than go one way or the other, is my \ngoal. I do not think that is asking that much, that the American \npeople, through their elected representatives, declare either their \nsupport for or opposition to this.\n  Don't you think your constituents are entitled to know how you feel, \non the record, not in some speech where it is easy to say something and \nthen walk it back a little later, but on the record with a vote? I \ndon't think that is unreasonable. I think it is in everyone's interests \nto have this vote. I have been trying to offer this amendment for a \nlong, long time. I have been put off on certain other vehicles because \nit was not the appropriate place to do it, they said. I don't know what \nthe appropriate place is.\n  I remember, as some of my colleagues will who are here on the floor \nwith me, I remember similar debates on the floor of the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives while people were dying every day in Vietnam. \nWhile those men and women were honorably serving their country, the \ndebate raged on and nobody had the guts to do one thing or the other, \neither win the war or get out. I am not saying this is Vietnam, yet. \nBut we do have a situation here where I believe Congress should go on \nrecord.\n  I happen to be a critic of the mission. I agree with Senator Inhofe \nand I supported Senator Inhofe in his mission here, if you will, to end \nthe deployment. But that is not what I am trying to do here. If the \nSenators on both sides cannot force themselves to vote, take a public \nposition, then I don't understand how they can continue to talk about \nit and complain about it and attack the President and say: ``Oh, the \nPresident's going to do this,'' or, ``We might get stuck in Bosnia,'' \nor, ``We ought to do this,'' or, ``We ought to do that.'' Here is your \nchance to say, one way or the other. I want to have a vote. That is all \nit says. No more complaining about costs. No more second-guessing the \nPresident. Just stand up and be counted. Yes, we will have a vote, and \nwhen we take that vote, we can decide one way or the other what we want \nto do.\n  I think I have made the case on this amendment. It uses funding \nleverage. It is an appropriate congressional tool. It does not \nmicromanage the executive branch, as some people have expressed a lot \nof concern about. It does not do that. It doesn't tell the President \nhow to conduct his operations. But it does say that we ought to have a \nvote, and I think it calls for a future vote. Don't wait until next \nyear or the year after; let's have the vote. Let's let the American \npeople know how we feel.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered \nby my friend and colleague from New Hampshire. If I may respond in one \nsense directly to what the proponent of the amendment said about going \non record, I want to make very clear that I oppose the amendment \nbecause I feel that America's involvement in the implementation force \nand in the stabilization force has been critically important to the \nreturn of peace to that region, has been critically important to \nAmerican prestige and credibility militarily in the world, and has been\n\n[[Page S6959]]\n\ncritically important to the stature and force of NATO. That is about as \nunambivalently as I can express it.\n\n  I think American involvement in Bosnia has been a remarkably \nsuccessful involvement at a time when it was very important to draw a \nline in Europe against aggression, against genocide, and to indicate--\nmore than indicate, to make very clear at the end of the cold war that \nwe were not going to stand idly by, that NATO was not going to stand \nback, idly by, and allow the disintegration of sections of Europe that \ncould have led to a wider war.\n  So I am unambivalently proud of the involvement that has occurred \nthere, am supportive of it, and do not want to send any mixed messages. \nI want to oppose the Senate sending any mixed messages to our allies, \nto those who were previous combatants in the war in Bosnia--indeed, and \nmost important, to our own troops there--not to send any mixed messages \nto any of them about the support of the Congress of the United States \nfor the mission that our troops are performing there.\n  Looking back to the early 1990s when this conflict broke out, it was \nmy honor to work alongside the former majority leader, Senator Dole, \nfirst trying to urge an end to the arms embargo on the Bosnians who \nwere being slaughtered and were the victims of genocide, and then to \nurge the United States to lead NATO into doing something to stop this \nconflict.\n  We have been involved in three wars in Europe in this century, two \nworld wars and one long, costly, dangerous cold war. It seemed to many \nof us that the lessons from those conflicts were to act as early as \npossible to contain just the kind of conflict that was occurring in \nBosnia from spreading. And we battled, Senator Dole and I and others in \nboth parties--battled the administration, first the Bush administration \nand then more directly, as the conflict in Bosnia became more \ndesperate, the Clinton administration, to get involved, to exercise \nleadership, to be at least fair with the Bosnians and give them arms.\n  Finally, the resolution to lift the arms embargo did pass in the \nearly part of 1995, here, with bipartisan support. There was a \nsignificant Croatian offensive on the ground, which was making headway, \nwhich contributed to a changing strategic situation on the ground. And \nSrebrenica fell, with a disastrous loss of life which was exposed to \nthe world. And then there were airstrikes on Serbian positions. The \nfear that we had was that this was an indomitable force, one that we \ncould not stop. There were recollections of the futile attempts by the \nNazis to suppress the Serbs. In this case, the power of NATO from the \nair had the effect of bringing the combatants to the peace table in \nDayton, the State of the Presiding Officer, where a historic peace \nagreement was signed.\n  This implementation force, followed by the stabilization force, in \nwhich the United States contributed troops, has been critical to \nimplementing that Dayton agreement. Our presence there has always been \nless than half. The majority of the effort has been provided by our \nEuropean allies and others. And, as success has been attained, the \nnumber of troops has been scaled down again. And yet it goes down \nagain--now, I believe, below 7,000, I think maybe closer to 6,500. As a \nresult of the effort of these troops in IFOR and then followed on by \nSFOR, the conflict has ended, hostilities have ended, and there is a \nslow, steady implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, the military \nand the civilian components of that. IFOR and SFOR have been charged \nwith carrying out that agreement.\n  The economy is up and beginning to flourish again. Elections have \nbeen held; common institutions are beginning to be developed. In the \nSerbian Republic, Srspka, an extraordinary turn of events has occurred \nas a result of, first and most important, I think, the desire of the \nBosnian Serbs to have new leadership, not the leadership of indicted \nwar criminals like Karadzic and Mladic, but to see new leadership. But \nthat was assisted by some very aggressive, determined involvement by \nthe SFOR, particularly by American leadership leading up right to the \nSupreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Wesley Clark, who has \nperformed, in my opinion, with extraordinary skill and effectiveness in \nthis arena of, first combat, and now peacemaking, followed by some very \neffective involvement by Ambassador Bob Gelbard in the political \nsituation in Srspka, resulting in new leadership: President Plavsic \nnow, Prime Minister Dodik, proud Serbian nationalists, but committed to \nthe Dayton peace accord.\n\n  The progress goes on. Benchmarks have been provided, civilian \nbenchmarks have been provided to us by the administration to determine \nprogress as we go along, all of it leading to a hopeful withdrawal and \nan end date.\n  Mr. President, along the way, some mistakes have been made. The \nSenator from New Hampshire mentioned them; others have as well. As part \nof the earlier involvement, there were those in the administration who \noffered deadlines for withdrawal of American forces. I presume that \nsome measure of the motivation for doing that was to reassure Congress \nthat this involvement would be limited. But those deadlines were \nalways, in my opinion, a mistake. They were a mistake because why would \none want to state a date by which one would withdraw from an uncertain \nsituation?\n  Traditional policy would be in a conflict or in a peacemaking \nsituation, one withdraws when one achieves the goals of the \ninvolvement. So the deadline was always a mistake.\n  It was a mistake in another sense because it would send a message to \nthose hostile to our involvement there in the first place, who want to \nreignite the conflict, that there is a date on which we are getting \nout. They could lay back and wait until NATO forces, IFOR and SFOR, \nincluding the U.S. leadership, left.\n  I feel that the proposal here for a vote and the more indirect \nreferences in the amendment that was just voted on for withdrawal, head \nback in the direction of the setting of deadlines, and they have some \nof the same deficiencies that I think were part of the deadline which \nthe administration set, which most all of us in the Senate condemned \nand see now as a mistake.\n  My own feeling is that we are on the right course in Bosnia; that \nthis is all moving in the right direction, both in terms of \nimplementation of the Dayton accords and scaling back the number of \nAmerican personnel who are there on the ground. I think if we now enter \nand say we are going to have a vote on whether to go forward, and if we \ndon't vote to do so, in the middle of the next fiscal year, March 31, \n1999, that we will withdraw, that puts a cloud over our involvement.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, I will be glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. With all due respect, the Senator \nmisunderstands my amendment, because that is not what my amendment \ndoes. You just articulated the policy that you supported. Even if your \nside would lose in the debate that we would have in Congress--let's say \nwe have the debate. If your side lost, the money would still be \nreleased. If my side loses --I happen to favor withdrawal--if I lost, \nthe money would still be released.\n  All my amendment calls for is a vote. It doesn't say that if we vote \nto get out on March 31 that the money is not released. The money is \nstill released.\n  This is on the Senator's time. He has been very generous. The only \nconclusion I can draw is the Senator just doesn't want a vote in the \nCongress at all.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, are we under any time limits?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no limitations.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield to me. Is it not true, \nI ask the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from New Hampshire, \nobviously, as well, that the amendment says the following in paragraph \n(c)(1) that ``after March 31, 1999, none of the funds''--none of the \nfunds appropriated or authorized here or anywhere else can be used ``to \nsupport the continued deployment of United States ground combat forces \nin Bosnia * * * except for'' withdrawal. Is that not your amendment?\n  I guess since the Senator from Connecticut has the floor, let me ask \nthe Senator from Connecticut, is that not the amendment before you.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If I may say to the Senator from Michigan, that is \nexactly\n\n[[Page S6960]]\n\nthe understanding of the impact of the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, which is that if there was a negative vote by March \n31 of next year on our American involvement in Bosnia, that the only \nthing funds would be available for would be to withdraw our personnel.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. If I can respond to the Senator, I need \nto see if we are looking at the same draft, because that is not my \nintention, and if that is in the draft, I will amend that to change \nthat because that is not the intention of the Senator's amendment. I \nyield back to the Senator his time and let me take a look at the draft.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Fine, Mr. President. The statement Senator Levin made \nwas exactly my understanding and was what I saw in the draft. The \ndirect effect of a negative vote next March would be to terminate \nfunding of our operations except to withdraw. I await clarification on \nthat, but I must say again, because I support this involvement, I \nsupport the command overseeing it, and I support the soldiers in the \nfield, I don't want to set a date down for this kind of vote on our \ninvolvement in Bosnia.\n  For those who are against it, they always have the option to try to \neliminate funding for it through the appropriations process. I think to \nstate a date by which we are going to vote next year on whether to \nremain involved in Bosnia or not hangs a sword of uncertainty in this \ncase over the entire operation, over the American troops that are \nthere, over our NATO allies who have said they will leave when we \nleave: ``We went in together, we are going out together.'' That is what \nI have heard them say over and over again. Again, it raises the \nprospect in the minds and hearts of those who are waiting to resume \nthis conflict that they may well have the opportunity come next spring, \nbecause the U.S. Senate may vote to terminate this involvement.\n  I do want to say about our troops there, I have had the occasion to \nbe there now three times in the last year, as it happens: once last \nJuly in a delegation headed by Senator Lott, and the distinguished \noccupant of the Chair was with us; once in December, right before \nChristmas, when we went over with President Clinton to visit the \ntroops; and then again in February when I went with a delegation headed \nby Senator McCain.\n  One thing that struck me was the very high morale of American troops \nthat are part of this peacemaking mission in Bosnia. I have had the \nopportunity as a member of the Armed Services Committee--the honor, \nreally--to visit American soldiers in the field around the world. I \nmust tell you that I have never met a group of American soldiers who \nhad a better, clearer, more positive feeling about why they were \nsomewhere around the world.\n  It struck me as particularly interesting and encouraging, because \nright now they are not involved, certainly not involved in active \ncombat. They are active, they are peacemaking, they are patrolling, but \nthey are involved in a lot of civilian activity. They understand why \nthey are there.\n  One of them said to me that once a month, he went into an orphanage, \nsomewhere around Sarajevo, as some of the troops there do, and visited \nsome children who were orphans as a result of the war in Bosnia. He \nsaid, ``You know, when I go there, I understand why we are here. We are \nhere to stop more children on all sides from becoming orphans; to keep \npeople alive and to help this country to rebuild itself.''\n\n  And I fear that any of these amendments we pass here that incline \ntoward withdrawal or state the necessity for a vote on withdrawal by a \ndate certain puts a cloud over the mission of our personnel in Bosnia \nand runs the risk of diminishing the morale, understandably, of our \ntroops there as well as those who have led them so ably.\n  I do want to take just a moment, Mr. President, to explain, \nconsistent with what I have said here, why I voted against the previous \namendment offered by Senator Thurmond and Senator Levin, a worthy \nattempt to achieve consensus, and in fact it did achieve consensus \nsince the vote was 90-5 on it. It was not an easy vote to vote against, \nto be one of the five.\n  But I was concerned about it because on page 3, beginning in \nparagraph (2), it does say that:\n\n       The President should work with NATO allies and other \n     nations * * * participating in the NATO-led Stabilization \n     Force to withdraw United States ground combat forces from \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina within a reasonable period of time, \n     consistent with the safety of those forces and the \n     accomplishment of the Stabilization Force's military tasks.\n\n  Well, it is not a direct withdrawal. It does condition it on the \naccomplishment of the stabilization force's military tasks, but, to me, \nit inclines toward withdrawal as a matter of policy. Because I am so \nproud of what has been accomplished as a result of the stabilization \nforce that we have led, and because I am so committed to a withdrawal \nthat occurs consistent with the achievement of the goals, the \nbenchmarks that the administration and NATO have set down for this \nmission, I was troubled by that paragraph as well as the succeeding \nparagraphs which suggest the possibility that there might be a need for \ncontinued military presence there but that we should consider that it \nbe a NATO-led force without the participation of U.S. ground combat \nforces.\n  I think once we begin to do that, once we begin to separate ourselves \nfrom NATO, we begin to diminish the unity of that greatest military \nalliance in history and we begin to diminish our leadership of NATO. \nAnd I do not think any one of those is in our national security \ninterest. The fact also is, as I mentioned briefly a moment ago, our \nNATO allies--the Brits, the French, Germans--all of them have said, \n``We went in together. We're going out together. So when the United \nStates departs from Bosnia, we're all leaving.''\n  So on a practical ground, I do not think we have that option. I think \nthe option is to hang in there together, continue what has been a \nremarkably successful mission, and we can see the end in sight. But let \nus not force it. Let us let it come naturally as we achieve the \nbenchmarks.\n  So that is why I voted against the previous amendment No. 2975, and \nall the more so for the current amendment, because it puts us on a \ncourse to vote on withdrawal and sends a mixed signal.\n  One of my favorite expressions from the Bible in cases such as this \nis--I am not going to quote exactly--``If the sound of the trumpet be \nuncertain, who will follow into battle?'' ``If the sound of the trumpet \nbe uncertain, who will follow into battle?'' And I fear here that the \nsound from these amendments is uncertain and the effect will be to \ndiminish the morale, the effectiveness, of the remarkably effective \nhigh-morale mission that American troops have carried out as part of \nIFOR and SFOR in Bosnia.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If there is no further debate at this time, I was going to \nnote the absence of a quorum because I do have some things I want to \nsay about the amendment, but I want to get the amendment straightened \nout.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I say to my colleague, I have a \nmodification, and I will have it ready in a moment. So I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in light of the fact that the managers \nare working out an agreement on the amendment, I am wondering if I \ncould simply address the bill itself for just a few moments.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to register my opposition to \nthe fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense Authorization Act. I have \nnumerous concerns with the bill, especially the continued spending of \nbillions of dollars on wasteful and unnecessary programs.\n  In a time when we are cutting programs and fighting for a truly \nbalanced budget, we cannot really afford to insulate any department of \nour Government from scrutiny as we seek to reduce the Federal debt.\n\n[[Page S6961]]\n\n  I think it is very ironic that programs like health care for veterans \nand social services were put on the chopping block to offset increased \nfunding for our highways and transit systems but we did not have an \nattempt to use defense spending for transportation. It was not even \nconsidered.\n  The message we are clearly sending is that roads and overpriced \nweapons systems are more important than the people who are actually \nliving in this country: We will give you roads and planes, but we will \nhave to take away your health care and programs that serve ordinary \nhuman needs.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of provisions in the DOD bill that \nI oppose and I will continue to oppose. One is the subject of some of \nthe discussion we have been having this afternoon. And that is the $1.9 \nbillion ``emergency'' supplemental appropriations recently passed by \nthe Congress.\n  The Congress has never developed firm rules on how we should define \nan emergency. Everybody assumes, I guess, that we will use common sense \nwhen deciding when to grant special emergency treatment to certain \nexpenditures. And of course common sense tells us that things like \nfloods and tornadoes clearly are unanticipated emergencies.\n  In my view, however, the mission in Bosnia is not. It is a \nsubstantial, long-term commitment. It is something the United States \nhas, for better or worse, decided to do for quite a long term. If \nevents there take an unexpected turn for the worse, of course, we could \nhave some kind of emergency on our hands, but as we stand here today \nand debate this bill, the Bosnia situation is not really something you \ncan call an emergency.\n\n  The line items in the law--military personnel, operations and \nmaintenance, and contingency funds--are really standard military costs \nthat would be part of any military mission. United States troops have \nbeen on the ground in Bosnia for more than 2 years. The change in \ndesignation from IFOR to SFOR was made more than a year ago and is \nscheduled to continue through June of this year. Then, last December, \nthe President announced he would forgo imposing a deadline altogether \nand opted instead for a policy of benchmarks whose definitions remain \nopen to interpretation.\n  Mr. President, how can Congress and the President possibly profess to \nthe American people that the additional costs for the Bosnia mission \nconstitute an emergency? On the contrary, it has been quite clear for a \nwhile now that the cost of this mission would rise continuously and \nsubstantially. And I would say, to me at least, that was really clear \nfrom the start. This was never going to be a temporary emergency \nsituation.\n  Ironically, congressional appropriators and our military leaders have \nplanned for many months, Mr. President, on obtaining these funds in \nthis emergency spending bill. So that invites my next question: What \nare these funds doing in the bill? I just do not think you can equate \nthe long-anticipated needs of the operation in Bosnia with the urgent, \nunexpected needs of the farmers in California or homeowners in Florida \nwho have been devastated by natural disaster.\n  Another matter, Mr. President, in the bill, that concerns me is that \n$3.3 billion authorized for the Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program. \nIt is no secret that I have some questions about this program. But I am \nalso troubled by the activities of the Pentagon and the Navy in moving \nthe Super Hornet airplane forward. And my concerns are not addressed in \nthe least in this bill.\n  The current Hornet program has proven reliable and cost effective. \nWhy do we want to replace the Hornet with a bloated, cost-prohibitive \naircraft that offers only marginally greater benefits over the current \nreliable fighter?\n  Third, I am concerned that the DOD authorization bill shortchanges \nour National Guard by at least $594 million. The National Guard is an \nimmense source of pride throughout the country, and especially in my \nState of Wisconsin. As I travel across the State, I frequently have the \nprivilege of meeting the men and women who compose the Wisconsin Guard, \nand I have been very impressed with the tremendous degree of \nprofessionalism and proficiency with which they complete a wide range \nof missions.\n  They are well-trained, dedicated, professional soldiers who earn rave \nreviews from the Governor's office, down to the villages and \nmunicipalities who often are the principal beneficiaries in regard to \nassistance.\n  Since I arrived in the U.S. Senate more than 5 years ago, my driving \nobjective has been to reduce the Federal deficit and achieve a balanced \nbudget. We have made great progress in that regard. While we continue \nto run a deficit while using the Social Security trust fund to mask the \ndeficit, we have almost overcome the hangover of our 1980 spending \nbinge.\n  A large part of that success has been due to the willingness of both \nthe Congress and the President to do more with less, to trim excessive \nspending wherever possible, and maintain important services but with \nfewer resources. And we have succeeded in almost every area of \ngovernment to do this--in education, in health care, in veterans' care, \nin welfare benefits, and in environmental programs. We have succeeded \nvirtually everywhere, except defense spending, where we continue to \nbuild destroyers the Navy does not ask for and we continue to build \nbombers the Air Force does not want.\n  Balancing the budget, as you well know, is about making difficult \nchoices. Sure, the Navy would rather have a Super Hornet, and if we \nwere in a radically different budgetary position I could possibly \nsupport giving them 300 of those airplanes instead of the 30 they are \nreceiving in this legislation. But can we afford 30 of these new \ntactical fighters when a more affordable and equally effective \nalternative aircraft is readily available? How that question is \nanswered is the difference, that is the difference between fiscal \nexcess and fiscal responsibility.\n  So we have to make smart choices. A truly balanced Federal budget is \nalmost, unbelievably, in sight for the first time in three decades. But \nwe are not going to be able to get the balanced budget or maintain a \nbalanced budget, let alone starting to bring down the Federal debt and \nprotect Social Security, so long as we continue to commit to programs \nand force structures that are so blatantly unaffordable. We must \ncontinue to fight for further spending reductions until we achieve the \nmost effective and cost-efficient military which serves our national \nsecurity interests.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Mr. Smith of New Hampshire.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2912, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it \nbe in order for me to modify my amendment with the text that I now send \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2912), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1064. POLICY ON DEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES FORCES IN \n                   BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--None of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated under this Act may be expended after March 31, \n     1999, to support the continued deployment of ground combat \n     forces of the Armed Forces of the United States in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina unless, on or before such date, each House of \n     Congress votes on passage of legislation that, if adopted, \n     would specifically authorize the continued deployment of \n     ground combat forces of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (b) Plan for Withdrawal of Forces.--If legislation referred \n     to in subsection (a) is not presented to the President on or \n     before March 31, 1999, the President shall submit to \n     Congress, not later than September 30, 1999, a plan that \n     provides for the ground combat forces of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States in Bosnia and Herzegovina to be withdrawn \n     from Bosnia and Herzegovina in an orderly and safe manner.\n       (c) Prohibition.--\n       (1) Use of funds after march 31, 1999.--After March 31, \n     1999, none of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this \n     or any other Act may be obligated or expended to support the \n     continued deployment of United States ground combat forces in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, except for the purpose of \n     implementing the withdrawal plan.\n       (2) Condition.--The prohibition on use of funds in \n     paragraph (1) shall not take effect if a joint resolution \n     described in subsection (d)(1) is acted upon on or before \n     March 31, 1999.\n       (d) Procedures for Joint Resolution of Approval.--\n       (1) Content of joint resolution.--For the purposes of \n     subsection (c)(2), ``joint resolution'' means only a joint \n     resolution that sets\n\n[[Page S6962]]\n\n     forth as the matter after the resolving clause only the \n     following: ``That the continued deployment of ground combat \n     forces of the Armed Forces of the United States in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina is authorized.''.\n       (2) Referral to committee.--A resolution described in \n     paragraph (1) that is introduced in the Senate shall be \n     referred to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate. A \n     resolution described in paragraph (1) that is introduced in \n     the House of Representatives shall be referred to the \n     Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (3) Discharge of committee.--If the committee to which is \n     referred a resolution described in paragraph (1) has not \n     reported such resolution (or an identical resolution) at the \n     end of 7 calendar days after its introduction, the committee \n     shall be deemed to be discharged from further consideration \n     of the resolution and the resolution shall be placed on the \n     appropriate calendar of the House involved.\n       (4) Floor consideration.--\n       (A) In general.--When the committee to which a resolution \n     is referred has reported, or has been deemed to be discharged \n     (under paragraph (3)) from further consideration of, a \n     resolution described in paragraph (1), it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the \n     respective House to move to proceed to the consideration of \n     the resolution, and all points of order against the \n     resolution (and against consideration of the resolution) are \n     waived. The motion is highly privileged in the House of \n     Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and is not \n     debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, or to a \n     motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the \n     vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall \n     not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration \n     of the resolution is agreed to, the resolution shall remain \n     the unfinished business of the respective House until \n     disposed of.\n       (B) Debate.--Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable \n     motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited \n     to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally \n     between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A \n     motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. \n     An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion \n     to recommit the resolution is not in order. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or \n     disagreed to is not in order.\n       (C) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on a resolution described in \n     paragraph (1), and a single quorum call at the conclusion of \n     the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the \n     appropriate House, the vote on final passage of the \n     resolution shall occur.\n       (D) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the \n     case may be, to the procedure relating to a resolution \n     described in paragraph (1) shall be decided without debate.\n       (5) Coordination with action by other house.--If, before \n     the passage by one House of a resolution of that House \n     described in paragraph (1), that House receives from the \n     other House a resolution described in paragraph (1), then the \n     following procedures shall apply:\n       (A) The resolution of the other House shall not be referred \n     to a committee.\n       (B) With respect to a resolution described in paragraph (1) \n     of the House receiving the resolution--\n       (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     resolution had been received from the other House; but\n       (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution \n     of the other House.\n       (6) Consideration of veto.--\n       (A) Action upon receipt of message.--Upon receipt of a \n     message from the President returning the joint resolution \n     unsigned to the House of origin and setting forth his \n     objections to the joint resolution, the House receiving the \n     message shall immediately enter the objections at large on \n     the journal of that House and the House shall proceed to the \n     immediate reconsideration of the joint resolution the \n     objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding \n     or of a motion to proceed to the immediate reconsideration of \n     the joint resolution, or the joint resolution and objections \n     shall lie on the table. Upon receipt of a message of a House \n     transmitting the joint resolution and the objections of the \n     President, the House receiving the message shall proceed to \n     the immediate reconsideration of the joint resolution the \n     objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding \n     or of a motion to proceed to the immediate reconsideration of \n     the joint resolution, or the joint resolution and objections \n     shall lie on the table. A motion to refer the joint \n     resolution to a committee shall not be in order in either \n     House.\n       (B) Motion to proceed.--After the receipt of a message by a \n     House as described in subparagraph (A), it is at any time in \n     order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has \n     been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to \n     move to proceed to the reconsideration of the joint \n     resolution the objections of the President to the contrary \n     notwithstanding. The motion is highly privileged in the House \n     of Representatives and is a question of highest privilege in \n     the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to \n     amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n     disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to \n     the reconsideration of the resolution is agreed to, the \n     resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the \n     respective House until disposed of.\n       (C) Debate.--Debate on reconsideration of the joint \n     resolution, and on all debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 10 \n     hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring \n     and those opposing the joint resolution. A motion further to \n     limit debate is in order and not debatable. An amendment to, \n     or a motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business is not in order. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the joint resolution is agreed \n     to notwithstanding the objections of the President or \n     disagreed to is not in order.\n       (D) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on reconsideration of the \n     resolution, and a single quorum call at the conclusion of the \n     debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the \n     appropriate House, the vote on the question of passage, the \n     objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding, \n     shall occur.\n       (7) Rules of house of representatives and senate.--This \n     subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a resolution described in \n     paragraph (1), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I take 1 minute because I understand the \nSenator from Arizona now is here to move to table.\n  This amendment, I believe, is seriously flawed. What it will do is \nkeep our troops nervous and our commanders nervous, because if there is \nnot a vote that occurs on March 31 next year, then no funds can be \nspent to support our troops.\n  So it really is the worst of all worlds. It attempts to guarantee \nthere will be a vote. Of course, you never can tell what efforts will \nbe made to thwart that. What this amendment says, if there is no vote \nby a certain date, the funding is cut, the troops must be withdrawn, \nthe troops will not be supported--if there is no vote.\n  That is a ``keep the troops and commanders nervous'' approach. I \nthink it is a terrible mistake. I hope our last vote, which was \noverwhelming in this body, will be considered the view of this Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I make one remark before I move to table. \nWe will be taking up the Department of Defense appropriations bill \nafter this. I recommended that the Senator from New Hampshire propose a \nsimple amendment which would cut off funding for further operations in \nBosnia. That is a right, as part of our role as advice and consent--\nkeeping with an earlier debate that we had--to somehow draw down and \nset troop levels in Bosnia.\n  Therefore, since among other things I am opposed to the amendment in \nprinciple, but also there is a parliamentary standpoint, I think it \nwould be much more appropriate to propose an amendment on the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill that would give us all a \nchance to be on record as to whether we support funding or not.\n  I now move to table the Smith amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would call up amendment No. 2892 \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2892.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.''\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, in the defense bill we have language \ndealing with land withdrawal. This is a project that the Air Force has \nbeen working on for some years. The language that I have now proposed \nto the Senate is the perfecting language which has been provided to us.\n  Madam President, this concerns the 366th Composite Wing which is \nbedded down at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. This is a \ncomposite wing that consists of F-15s, F-16s, B-1 bombers, and C-135 \ntankers. This allows them to train as they fight. This is one of our \nrapid deployment Air Force units that would be called to respond \nanywhere in the world where we may have a terrible situation.\n  The current range that we have in place, there is only one \ndirection--that is from the south--from which you can access that \nrange. That worked when this was not a composite wing, but now that you \nhave all of these different aircraft there, they need to have much \ngreater ability for training purposes. This would allow us to maximize \ntraining for this situation.\n  After many, many months of a process, I will tell you that this is \nsomething that has been a high priority for the White House, for the \nAir Force, for the Department of the Interior, for BLM, for the \nGovernor of the State of Idaho, and for the Idaho delegation.\n  With regard to the process, Madam President, this is a process that \nhas taken 2\\1/2\\ years to get us to this point-- 2\\1/2\\ years. During \nthose 2\\1/2\\ years, 16 different public hearings were held in three \ndifferent States. Over 400 witnesses testified as to their thoughts, \neither pro or con, mitigations they would suggest. Over 1,000 different \ncomments were recorded.\n  This is the Environmental Impact Statement that is the result of 2\\1/\n2\\ years of effort, three volumes. Included in the first volume is the \nreference that ``The final EIS has been prepared in accordance with the \nNational Environmental Policy Act,'' or NEPA. So, again, this is a \nprocess that has been in place, that has followed all of the \nguidelines. And really I think the Air Force and the Department of the \nInterior are to be commended for the process which they have utilized, \nand really the mitigations that have been put into place are some of \nthe most significant the Air Force has ever had. Also, the Air Force \nhad no less than 25 meetings with tribal representatives of the \nShoshone-Paiute tribe. Their reservation is Duck Valley.\n  The particular site that was chosen, Madam President, 12,000 acres, \nis currently under ownership by the Bureau of Land Management. When we \ntalk about land withdrawal, who are we withdrawing it from and who \nbecomes its new landlord? Well, currently, because it is BLM, it is \nFederal land. It will remain Federal land. It is being withdrawn from \nthe BLM to be put under the stewardship of the U.S. Air Force.\n  I would like to give you a sense of what this issue is about. In this \nparticular area of the State, these are what are called the Owyhee \nCanyonlands. As you see, they are beautiful. You can see the streams \ngoing through there.\n  Currently, in this area, we have the Mountain Home Air Force Base, \nand under existing regulation those aircraft can fly at 100 feet above \nthe canyon rim or 100 feet above ground level 365 days out of the year. \nWith this proposal that is before the Senate, in this legislation that \nchanges. For 3 months out of the year--April, May and June--those \naircraft, instead of flying at 100 feet above the canyon rim, if they \nfly parallel to the canyon, would be at 5,000 feet, and that is 1 mile \nfrom the canyon either side. If they fly perpendicular, across the \ncanyon, they would be at 1,000 feet--significant improvements. Also, \nduring those months they would only fly Tuesday, Wednesday and \nThursday--not 7 days a week. So for recreationalists, this is a real \nadvantage that is gained by them.\n  Now, when we talk about 12,000 acres, is it this same sort of \nbeautiful landscape as we see here? Let me show you.\n  This is a picture of the 12,000 acres. As you can see, it is sparse. \nIt is flat. This is where for 100 years they have been grazing cattle. \nFolks out there work hard to make a living on this land. But this is \nthe picture of the 12,000 acres that are out there now.\n  Also, when I mentioned the Shoshone-Paiute tribes, one of the things \nthat was asked of our Native Americans--and this is the Duck Valley \nReservation, which is in this southwest corner of the State of Idaho, \nand also in Nevada--but we asked them what areas of concern they would \nhave, what geographic areas of concern that they would have for some of \ntheir sacred areas. They drew this line and said, anything in here we \nwould certainly prefer that you not have this training facility in. \nAnd, therefore, Juniper Butte, which is the land in question, is right \nhere. As you can see, it is a great deal outside the area of concern of \nthe Native Americans.\n\n  The funds for the improvements and for land acquisition for this \nproject have been provided by President Clinton in his defense bill \nthat is before us. It is included in the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, so it is very logical and consistent for us to deal \nwith this project in the same legislation that has the funding for this \nproject. That is what is before us at this point.\n  The result of this is that there will be: A new, no-live-ordnance, \n12,000-acre training range using land that has been grazed for over 100 \nyears; the most extensive mitigation program in the history of the Air \nForce; new seasonal overflight restrictions of the canyons for \nrecreationalists and sheep; an Air Force commitment to provide $430,000 \nover 4 years to monitor impacts on bighorn sheep and sage grouse; \navoidance of the entire sacred site area identified by the Shoshone-\nPaiute Tribes at the start of the process and protection of\n\n[[Page S6964]]\n\nexisting sacred sites; Air Force agreement with ranching operation \nimpacted by land withdrawal. The Juniper Butte Range is supported by \nletters from Defense Secretary Bill Cohen, Interior Secretary Bruce \nBabbitt, and Air Force Secretary--Acting Secretary Whitten Peters, and \nIdaho Governor Batt.\n  The Air Force, from the outset, said if, in the area that they \nultimately chose as the approved site for this training range, there \nwere people who might be adversely impacted, that the Air Force would \ncompensate. This agreement would allow for compensation to be a result \nof the agreement negotiated between the Air Force and, in this case, a \nranching family. We have a rancher who, for years, has been grazing his \ncattle on these 12,000 acres and has made a great many improvements \nwith regard to the water lines and fencing. So as he moved those water \nlines and the fencing to a different location, again, he would be \ncompensated for this and he would have those grazing areas realigned in \na different location. So, again he would be leaving that area.\n  The language that we have before the Senate is language that was \ngiven to us by the Department of the Interior, by BLM, and by the U.S. \nAir Force.\n  I will tell you, Madam President, that there are a couple of items \nwhich have been added to the Kempthorne-Craig amendment which are a \nsubstitute for the language in the bill. Again, the language comes from \nthe Department of the Interior and the Air Force, and there are four \nadditional changes.\n  No. 1, the impacted rancher may continue to graze the withdrawn land \nuntil his agreement with the Air Force is fully implemented; that is, \nuntil rights-of-way are granted and new fences and water pipes are \nbuilt.\n  We cleared this with Katie McGinty, who is the President's counsel on \nenvironmental quality. The White House is very comfortable with this \nlanguage.\n  No. 2, to the maximum extent possible, Interior should use maps \nalready bought and paid for in development of the EIS, just trying to \navoid further costs of the project.\n  No. 3, we add Owyhee County to the development of the resource \nmanagement plan for withdrawn lands and monitoring activities.\n  No. 4, we change water right language from the Air Force ``may'' not \nseek water rights to the Air Force ``shall'' not seek water rights.\n  The substitute amendment will result in development of the Juniper \nButte Range. I think this is an important distinction. That is, that \nparticular site was recommended by the Bureau of Land Management after \na lengthy process, which I have outlined; the Air Force then concluded \nthat was the best site. It was not a situation where the rancher came \nforward and said, is there any way that the Federal Government could \nsomehow come and utilize this land? This was something that was driven \nby, No. 1, the Air Force wanting to have this enhanced training for the \nComposite Wing at the Air Force base, the Bureau of Land Management \nchoosing the Juniper Butte site, the Air Force ultimately agreeing to \nit, and then a whole series of mitigations have been put in place.\n  The amendment sets no precedent on grazing rights, as is acknowledged \nby the Bureau of Land Management. I think that is an important \ndistinction.\n  So this is perfecting language. It, again, is a process that has \ntaken 2\\1/2\\ years, three volumes that are contained in the \nenvironmental impact statement following NEPA. It has the strong \nsupport of the President of the United States, the Acting Secretary of \nthe Air Force, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, the \nDirector of the Bureau of Land Management, the Governor of the State of \nIdaho, the Idaho delegation.\n  Again, I appreciate all the cooperation we have had and the strong \nsupport from the administration on bringing this project, finally, to \nclosure.\n  With that, I know the senior Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, has \nsome comments he would like to make on this amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, first of all, I thank my colleague, \nSenator Kempthorne, for the tremendous diligence with which he has \napproached this issue for national defense and for the citizens of the \nState of Idaho. What we are talking about this evening in the amendment \nthat we bring before you is an issue of national defense and the \nappropriate allocation of natural resources, natural public resources \nin our country.\n  There is no question that it has been determined by the Air Force \nthat Mountain Home Air Force Base needs additional capacity to train, \nto train the 366th Wing, the Composite Wing that my colleague has just \nspoken about--not only current training but future training. And of \ncourse out West, where the skies are blue and the horizons seem to be \nendless, you would think this would be an easy process. There is all of \nthis public land. In fact, 63 percent of the State of Idaho is owned by \nthe Federal Government. And you can just go anywhere and fly anywhere \nand train anywhere. That is not the case. We know that is not the case. \nAnd it should not be the case, because that public land is a valuable \nnatural resources allocated for a variety of uses.\n  It is most important that where the Air Force should train, that \ntraining should be specific, well defined, and that is exactly what we \nare attempting to do. The Senator has outlined the process--well over \n2\\1/2\\ years, 16 public hearings, thousands of inputs from the citizens \nof our State and from around the country for and against the expansion \nor the development of a new training range. We are now here, doing the \nnecessary thing, and that is to reallocate public land, to take land \nwhich was once grazing land and wildlife habitat, but primarily used \nfor grazing--it had been for well over 100 years --and saying no longer \nwill this land be used for grazing, it will be used for training \noverflights.\n  But for the person who grazed that land, the family who has had the \nright to graze that land under BLM permit for nearly 100 years, we are \nsaying, ``You will no longer be able to graze there. We are going to \ntake that land away from your use. We are going to allocate a new area, \nand you are going to be able to gain a permit to graze in the new area \nunder the standard prescriptions of the BLM and the range management \nset forth by the Secretary of the Interior and the appropriate rules \nand regulations of the National Environmental Policy Act.'' As the \nSenator has just spoken, ``You will be able to graze on your own range \nuntil such time as this agreement is worked out.''\n\n  There is no special treatment. There is a recognition that in this \nprocess, we have two demands, and we ought to be able to meet both of \nthem. We have the demand for expanded training range capability of the \n366th, and we have what I think is a reasonable approach toward land \nuse, and that is grazing. If we did not grant this rancher an \nopportunity to graze in other areas, we would destroy a 100-year-old \nfamily business and put them out of business. It is that plain, and it \nis that simple.\n  The Air Force understood that, BLM understood that, the President \nunderstands that, and through this give-and-take and negotiations, we \nhave arrived at a settlement. Not everybody agrees with that \nsettlement, but everybody has been treated fairly.\n  The Duck Valley Indian Reservation, Shoshone Paiute Tribe, Native \nAmericans with substantial rights in that area have been treated \nfairly, have been allowed to be at the table to negotiate, as we should \nhave treated them, and all considerations have been made--overflight \nlevels not to disturb their solitude and the character of their lands, \nall the corridors of flight, all of those have been considered, because \nthose pictures that the Senator just showed us show huge expanses of \npublic lands and no fences and no lines and no roads. You would think, \nwell, my goodness, fly anywhere. Not the case. There are land rights \nout there. There is private land, there is Indian land, and that is \nprivate by character of a separate nation, and there are private \ninholdings of citizens, and then, of course, there is the public land.\n  There is a criticism launched that somehow this particular rancher \nthat we are dislodging from an area where he and his father and his \ngrandfather grazed for over 100 years is getting special treatment. \nThat is not the case. What we are saying to him as we take away from \nhim the land under which\n\n[[Page S6965]]\n\nhe grazed, therefore, if we didn't offer new land to graze, under the \nstandards of the current law, somehow we would be denying him his \nlivelihood. We are saying there will be costs involved in bringing the \nnew range into quality--quality grazing, availability of water, fences \nfor rest rotation grazing, and that rancher should not have to sustain \nthose costs. So there are costs in transition.\n  There are mitigating costs, and that is why we have worked hard; that \nis why Senator Kempthorne has worked especially hard on his committee \nto make all of these things happen.\n  He twice--at least twice, maybe three times--has hosted meetings in \nhis office that I have attended with all of the parties at the table to \nassure that everybody was talking and the fullest public process was \nmet; that every ``i'' was dotted and every ``t'' was crossed under the \nNational Environmental Policy Act to make sure that no stakeholder was \nleft out.\n  There are some California sheep, wild sheep in the area of concern. \nThere is money in here for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game to \nmonitor the character of that herd so that in no way do we damage the \nenvironment or the wildlife at hand.\n  I think as a country, I hope that we as a Congress, have the ability \nto allocate resource and balance natural resource use and environmental \nneeds along with our national defense. That is what this amendment \ndoes. It not only expands training range capability for Mountain Home \nAir Force Base and this new concept we call ``composite wing,'' but it \nassures long-term ability to do that kind of training.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, you have just received a ``Dear Colleague'' \nletter from Senator Kempthorne and myself outlining the pros and cons \nof this. I must tell you that this is not without opposition. There are \nsome who still prefer that nothing be done. But a majority of Idahoans \nbelieve something should be done, and certainly as those who are \ncaretakers of the national defense--and that is what we as Senators \nare--it is important that we assure the long-term capability for our \nnational defense and optimum training conditions for the men and women \nwho fly the aircraft of our country. That is what we believe we are \ndoing here. At the same time, we are assuring that the traditional and \nlegally prescribed uses of our public lands for grazing purposes can \ncontinue to go on.\n  I believe, Madam President, that what Senator Kempthorne and I offer \ntonight is a win-win proposition. The Air Force wins; American citizens \nwin because of enhanced capability for national defense training; and \nour public land users and the environment win, because we are now \nexpanding the capability of grazing by improving its conditions, and \nthose grazing conditions also improve the conditions for wildlife \nbecause of additional water in areas where there may not currently be \nwater and will be in the future.\n  That is what we bring before you tonight. We appreciate your \nconsideration of it. We hope you can agree with us, because, as Senator \nKempthorne has said, the Idaho delegation stands united, along with the \nGovernor of our State and our State legislature. We appreciate having a \nmilitary presence in our State. We appreciate Mountain Home Air Force \nBase for what it does for the country, but also what it does for the \nState of Idaho. We also appreciate the beauty of the great expanse of \nour Federal lands.\n  We also understand the importance of balanced and multiple uses. We \nthink we bring all of those to the table in the amendment that we have \noffered, that the Senator has authored, and we hope that the Senate \nwill concur with us in that amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, the land withdrawal for enhanced \nmilitary training in Idaho is a necessary element for varied, realistic \ntraining that is essential to enable the 366th Wing at Mountain Home \nAir Force Base to sustain combat readiness to meet the complex threats \nexpected in the 21st century. The proponents of this provision have \nworked long and hard to resolve all of the stakeholders' interest \nrelated to this military land withdrawal and have put together a good \nprovision.\n  I strongly support Senator Kempthorne's substitute amendment to title \nXXIX of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999 and \nthe continued efforts to secure enhanced military training in Idaho.\n  Madam President, we have both Senators from Idaho in accord on this \nmatter. The Governor of Idaho is in accord on this matter. It appears \nto be highly desirable that the Senate adopt this amendment and \naccommodate the two Senators, the Governor and the people of Idaho. \nThank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Senator from Idaho, Senator \nKempthorne, has done what he indicated in committee that he intended to \ndo, which was to offer a modification of his previous language when \nthis bill got to the floor. That is being carried out with the support \nof his good colleague from Idaho.\n  We have no objection to the modification in the language. My \nunderstanding is there is further discussion or debate relative to this \nsubject which will be forthcoming at a later time, but I have no \nobjection to this amendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Thurmond, for his comments and his strong \nsupport. I also thank Senator Levin for his comments. I enjoy greatly \nworking with the ranking member.\n  We have fulfilled what we said we would do. Also, I point out to our \nranking member that this language is the language provided to us by the \nadministration.\n  And so I feel very comfortable with this.\n  I also, Madam President, would like to make part of the Record the \nletter from the Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen; the letter from the \nSecretary of the Air Force, Acting Secretary Whitten Peters; and the \nletter is also signed by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, in \nsupport of the project with the language, the news release by the \nBureau of Land Management, which goes into details, and also the letter \nfrom Whitten Peters, Acting Secretary of the Air Force, where he \naffirms that the Air Force will provide $430,000 to monitor the impact \non bighorn sheep and sage grouse over 4 years. I ask unanimous consent \nthat those be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Secretary of Defense,\n\n\n                                        1000 Defense Pentagon,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dirk: Thank you for your letter of September 8, 1997. \n     I want to assure you nothing has changed regarding my \n     enthusiasm for the Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI) \n     initiative.\n       The 366th Wing as Mountain Home Air Force Base (AFB) is an \n     important component of our military capability. As one of the \n     first units to deploy to a problem area, it has the \n     responsibility to neutralize enemy forces. It must maintain \n     peak readiness to respond rapidly and effectively to diverse \n     situation and conflicts.\n       ETI balances realistic local training with careful \n     consideration of environmental, cultural, and economic \n     concerns. The elements of the ETI proposal, though designed \n     to minimize environmental impacts, will simulate real world \n     scenarios and allow the aircrews to plan and practice complex \n     missions. In addition to providing realistic training, ETI's \n     close proximity to Mountain Home AFB also will enable the Air \n     Force to convert time currently spent in transit into actual \n     training time. Thus, the ETI proposal allows Air Force crews \n     to use limited flight training hours more efficiently.\n       I continue to give the ETI process my full support. It will \n     provide our commanders with realistic training opportunities \n     locally, while ensuring potential impacts to natural, \n     cultural, social, and economic resources are identified, and \n     where possible, cooperatively resolved. Your strong support \n     for the ETI initiative is very important to us, and you may \n     rely upon my continued interest and commitment.\n       I trust this information is useful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William S. Cohen,\n                                             Secretary of Defense.\n\n[[Page S6966]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                   Secretary of the Air Force,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1998.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: We are pleased to provide you with \n     the attached legislation for the withdrawal of lands for the \n     Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI) project. As you know, this \n     legislation represents three years of extensive work by the \n     Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Air Force, you and other \n     representatives of the people of Idaho, and many others who \n     care about the welfare of Idaho's environment and the \n     effectiveness of the 366th Wing at Mountain Home Air Force \n     Base.\n       ETI will increase the realism, flexibility, and quality of \n     the Air Force's training. It permits the 366th Wing to train \n     more efficiently and effectively for its important missions, \n     thereby improving the aircrews' safety and mission \n     performance. Implementation of ETI will substantially \n     strengthen the 366th Wing's ability to ensure readiness to \n     perform its assigned missions.\n       Importantly, however, the Air Force and BLM also worked \n     very hard so that ETI would balance training needs with the \n     concerns of the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes, the environment, and \n     other public land uses. The Air Force and BLM actively \n     solicited public and agency involvement throughout the \n     development of the project. Participants in the process \n     included the State of Idaho, environmental organizations, the \n     Shoshone-Paiute Tribes, ranchers, recreational organizations, \n     and other users of the public lands in Idaho.\n       The Air Force incorporated numerous mitigations in the \n     design of the project to address public concerns and \n     relocated facility sites during preparation of the \n     environmental impact statement (EIS) to avoid various \n     environmental concerns expressed by the Shoshone-Paiute \n     Tribes and others. Following completion of the EIS and \n     consideration of public comment the Air Force adopted further \n     mitigation measures, including altitude and seasonal \n     overflight restrictions that further address concerns of \n     recreational users and protect the habitat of bighorn sheep. \n     The NEPA process was a valuable tool in helping to identify \n     these mitigations and resolve concerns.\n       We believe the attached legislation accommodates many \n     issues that you and other representatives of the people of \n     Idaho have raised throughout the process and is an important \n     step forward for national security, for the environment, and \n     for significant tribal interests.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program there is no \n     objection to the presentation of this report to Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bruce Babbit,\n                                        Secretary of the Interior.\n                                                F.

The Air Force will provide advance public notification \n     of when these composite wing exercises will occur.\n\n\n                          owyhee river system\n\n       In general, for all major canyons in the Owyhee River \n     System, low-altitude training flights would be limited to \n     1,000 feet AGL and would cross only perpendicular to the \n     canyons. Additionally, parallel flights within one mile of \n     the canyon rims would be limited to 5,000 feet AGL.\n       Along the South Fork of the Owyhee River from the 45 Ranch \n     to the confluence with the East Fork of the Owyhee River, no \n     low-level overflights will occur within one mile of the \n     canyon rim below 5,000 feet AGL from April 1 through June 30, \n     subject to two composite wing training exercises per month.\n       Along the East Fork of the Owyhee River from the confluence \n     of Dickshooter Creek to the confluence of the South Fork, no \n     low-level overflights will occur within one mile of the \n     canyon rim below 5,000 feet AGL from April 1 through June 30, \n     subject to two composite wing training exercises per month.\n       Along the East Fork of the Owyhee River from the confluence \n     of Battle Creek to the confluence of Dickshooter Creek, no \n     low-level overflights will occur within one mile of the \n     canyon rim below 5,000 feet AGL from April 1 through June 30 \n     on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays.\n\n\n               airspace expansion over little jacks creek\n\n       There will be no military training overflights below 5,000 \n     feet AGL in the airspace over the Little Jacks Creek area \n     during April, May, and June.\n\n\n                            recreation study\n\n       The BLM and Air Force will jointly fund a study on \n     recreation use in the Little Jacks Creek area and the \n     canyonlands of the Bruneau-Jarbidge and Owyhee River Systems.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Bureau of Land Management,\n\n\n                                     Office of Public Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1998.\n\n    BLM, Air Force Reach Agreement on Idaho Training Range Expansion\n\n       The Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Air Force have \n     reached an agreement that would accommodate military flights \n     over public land in southwest Idaho while subjecting those \n     flights to altitude and seasonal restrictions over key \n     portions of the Owyhee and Bruneau river canyons, BLM \n     Director Pat Shea announced today.\n       Under the agreement, which would withdraw 12,000 acres of \n     BLM-managed public land for expanded military training, the \n     Air Force would extend its airspace training over Little \n     Jacks Creek, but its additional flights would be subject to \n     altitude and seasonal restrictions. Under the agreement, the \n     Air Force would continue its current use of about 7.5 million \n     acres of airspace over BLM-managed land.\n       ``This agreement reflects extensive public input on issues \n     surrounding Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI), and protects \n     public land resources while accommodating vital U.S. military \n     training,'' said Shea. ``the agreement ensures that military \n     flights would be limited to 5,000 feet above ground level in \n     the airspace above Little Jacks Creek during April, May, and \n     June, which addresses concerns raised by recreationists who \n     hike in the area and raft down the Owyhee and Bruneau rivers. \n     The altitude restriction is also aimed at protecting the \n     habitat of bighorn sheep.''\n       Shea said the agreement took into account public input from \n     eight ``scoping'' meetings held by the Air Force and BLM in \n     1996 and seven public hearings held last year on the Air \n     Force's Draft Environmental Impact Statement relating to \n     expanded airspace training.\n       Below are the particulars of the BLM-Air Force agreement:\n\n\n                 seasonal low-level flight restrictions\n\n       The Air Force will institute seasonal low-level flight \n     restrictions for all military users in the Jarbidge and \n     Owyhee military operating areas to minimize conflicts with \n     public land resources and uses.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Secretary of the Air Force,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: Thank you for your recent inquiry \n     concerning Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI). You have asked \n     if the Air Force intends to monitor bighorn sheep and sage \n     grouse populations further in conjunction with the ETI \n     proposal.\n       The Air Force provided $100K in FY 1998 to determine the \n     baseline populations of the two species in areas where ETI \n     would cause surface and airspace changes with the \n     implementation of ETI. Headquarters Air Combat Command has \n     indicated that it intends to fully fund monitoring activities \n     in subsequent years, assuming ETI is approved. They would \n     then provide the State of Idaho $110K per year for the next \n     three years for monitoring activities.\n       ETI will be a great asset for the composite wing based at \n     Mountain Home AFB and will reflect our commitment to \n     environmental stewardship. We appreciate your commitment to \n     this important project.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                F. Whitten Peters,\n                                Acting Secretary of the Air Force.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I want to report that there are some \nmembers who believe the proposed substitute amendment #2892 sets a new \nstandard for environmental remediation before the Air Force can \nrelinquish the withdrawn lands back to the Bureau of Land Management. \nLike I did with the Department of Interior, the BLM and the Air Force \nregarding the new overflight restrictions of the canyons, I will \nconvene a meeting with all of the interested parties and committees to \ntry to reach a consensus on this issue before completion of the \nconference on this bill.\n  Madam President, I would just like to say, after months and months of \ndue process, I think we are doing what is right by the environment, \nwhat is good for recreation, and certainly what is right for the \npilots.\n  When we think of those pilots who have to climb into those aircraft, \nif we do have to send them into harm's way, let us make sure we provide \nthem with not only the best aircraft in the world but the best training \nopportunities, so that when they go into harm's way,\n\n[[Page S6967]]\n\nthey can come back to their loved ones in good shape.\n  So I want to thank Senator Craig for his partnership. He has been a \ntremendous partner, as has Congresswoman Chenoweth, Congressman Crapo, \nGovernor Batt. And, again, there are folks who do not like this--didn't \nlike it from the outset, don't like the conclusion, don't like the \nanswer. But the process has been fulfilled, and the conclusion, I \nbelieve, is right.\n  I just want to say to the family of the Bracketts, the ranchers who \nhave been working with us on this, I appreciate their willingness to go \nthrough this process. Again, they did not come forward; they did not \nstep up and say, ``Boy, why don't you use this land.'' I think out of \ntheir belief in Idaho and their belief in the country, they are willing \nto go along with this. But in this very public process, unfortunately, \nsome people lodge charges that bring into question the integrity of \nsome individuals. I think that is just very unfortunate. That happens \nin the political process. Perhaps we get used to it a little more, but \nI hate to see it when it is leveled at a good family like this. So I \nappreciate the Brackett family.\n  Again, I appreciate the chairman and the ranking member's comments. \nAnd I believe, unless there is further debate, we are ready for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Idaho.\n  The amendment (No. 2892) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that a fellow in my office, \nTerry Bare, be able to sit in on the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2978\n\n    (Purpose: To require separate housing for male and female basic \n    trainees, and to ensure after-hours privacy for basic trainees)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2978.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As I understood, I was putting forward an amendment to be \nconsidered and had the floor to speak concerning that amendment. Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator lost the floor when he offered the \namendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would note that we would like to have and will get a \ndebate on this issue at some point in time about separate barracks for \nthe genders. And I had that as my understanding, that that was the \ndebate that we were going to at the present time.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, he can go ahead and debate on \nhis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is entitled to go ahead with his amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent for two \nstaffs' presence on the floor?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Only for that, and I am not yielding the floor. The \nunderstanding is, I am not yielding the floor. Yes, I will, if I \nreceive it back to consider my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of my colleagues, Senator \nBingaman, and Senator Domenici, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprivileges of the floor be granted to Peter Lyons of his office during \nthe pendency of S. 2057 and any votes thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, for the \nperiod of time the Department of Defense authorization bill is under \nconsideration, Mark Tauber, a State Department Pearson Fellow on the \nForeign Relations Committee staff, be granted floor access.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to discuss today the amendment I \nhave offered that I put forward at the desk and will, at the \nappropriate time, be calling for the yeas and nays on that.\n  I have discussed my amendment with the distinguished chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Personnel of the Armed Services Committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne. And after my \nstaff had briefings with the Pentagon, I decided the privacy of our new \nrecruits, by mandating separate barracks, was extremely important and \nthat this debate was necessary and needed at this point in time.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is common sense. It simply requires \nseparate barracks for male and female recruits during basic training. \nFurther, the amendment protects the privacy of recruits by limiting \naccess to barracks after hours to those of the same gender.\n  I might note for the Senators that the House has considered much \nstronger language, and actually enacted in their bill, in the DOD \nauthorization, the separation of genders during basic training. But we \nfall far short of that. This is just about barracks and housing during \nbasic training.\n  I believe this is a sensible step in restoring privacy and dignity to \nthe military basic training experience and will allow our young \nrecruits to focus on the serious tasks before them.\n  This amendment helps to uphold the military standards of behavior and \nimproves the quality of life for military members and spouses left at \nhome while a loved one completes basic training.\n  The amendment will help train instructors to instill the basic core \nvalues of discipline, teamwork, unit cohesion, and values that will \nultimately benefit the individual, the family, and the military. By \nadopting this amendment, we codify a unanimous recommendation of the \nbipartisan Kassebaum-Baker commission.\n  The Kassebaum-Baker Commission interviewed 2,000 recruits, 2,000 \nrecruits, and their supervisors and found serious problems. Let me just \narticulate a few of them. The commission recognized that sexual \nrelations take place inside of barracks where young men and women live \ntogether. Moral and unit cohesion were negatively affected. Thus, the \ncommission recommended that male and female recruits sleep in separate \nbarracks. Talk about common sense, that seems to be it.\n  To avoid cries that the cost is prohibitive, the Kassebaum Commission \ncompleted an analysis of the current structures at training \ninstallations which showed that the cost of this amendment is marginal. \nMr. President, I will read the section of the Kassebaum Commission that \nsays just that, quoting from page 15 of the study of the Kassebaum \nCommission:\n\n       The committee has reviewed the layout and surge numbers of \n     the training installation and believes this change can be \n     accomplished at marginal cost, if any.\n\n  Available barracks exist and have already been converted to \naccommodate both male recruits. Thus, there are no physical constraints \nto having men and women recruits housed separately during basic \ntraining. Existing structures can be used. The Kassebaum panel was \nstunned to discover--and this is a direct quote--``high frequency'' of \nsexual relations during basic training between male and female recruits \nin all branches of the services. High frequency.\n  Now, if you think about this, if you put young male and female \nrecruits around the age of 18 in close proximity, in the same quarters, \nI think there is a possibility that a high frequency of this may \nhappen. The amendment that I put forward simply says we should have \nseparate barracks. It doesn't even go to wanting separate training. It \nsays separate ``barracks,'' to maybe reduce some of these incidents.\n  The same report said ``some drill sergeants complained to the panel \nabout the large amount of time they were spending investigating or \ndisciplining male and female misconduct. It was found that the problem \nis exacerbated in mixed-gender barracks. This is after interviewing \n2,000 recruits and sergeants. It is exacerbated in mixed-gender \nbarracks, especially where men and women live on the same floor.\n  Just think about it again, in common-sense terms. Doesn't this just \nmake sense that you will have more problems if you have mixed genders \non same floor in the same barracks, and that you will then have to deal \nwith that in basic training?\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n\n  Listen to this. At one location at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, the panel \nwas told that male and female fraternization was so frequent that drill \ninstructors had to take the doors off of the barracks rooms so they \ncould maintain order inside. It was that frequent. They had to take the \ndoors off.\n  Secretary Cohen gave the services an opportunity to respond to the \nKassebaum recommendations. Other than the marines, God bless 'em, they \nall came back and disagreed with the recommendation to establish \nseparate living barracks. Despite this, I believe that there is no \nreason why male and female recruits should be sleeping on the same \nfloors. This makes no sense.\n  I put it in personal terms, if I could, for my colleagues. Think \nabout their daughters, if they are going into the military. I have two \nyoung daughters. What if they were going in. Would you feel safer and \nbetter about their security and about this issue of fraternization if, \nduring basic training, they are in separate facilities, or would you \nfeel better and safer about it if they are on the same floor with \ndifferent genders? Just think about that for half a second. Wouldn't \nyou feel a lot better about it if they are in separate barracks so that \npeople can watch a little closer than if they are on the same floor \nwith other recruits and you already have these instances taking place?\n\n  This is a common-sense proposal with minimal, if any, cost. This is \nabout national security and ensuring our recruits make up the best, \nmost disciplined force in the world. Just last month, we learned that \nfive instructors at the Navy's boot camp have been accused of sexual \nmisconduct and improper relations with women recruits. This is the \nNavy, not the Army; this is the Navy. One of the instructors at the \nGreat Lakes Naval Training Center, a 30-year-old, was arrested on April \n30 on charges of having an improper sexual relationship with an 18-\nyear-old female recruit.\n  I want to read some of the press account that is out of this, from \nthe Chicago Sun Times, June 6, 1998.\n\n       A Navy petty officer was found guilty of sexual misconduct \n     with female recruits and making false statements to Navy \n     officers in a court-martial Friday at the Great Lakes Naval \n     Base.\n       After deliberating about 90 minutes, [90 minutes, not \n     long.] a three-member jury made up of two male Navy officers \n     and one female enlisted sailor found Machinists Mate 1st \n     Class Gregg Peterson guilty of eight of nine charges against \n     him.\n\n  They quoted in this article several of the sailors, some of the women \nsailors. One--and I will not give her name because I don't think that \nis appropriate--said she cried as the jury presided and read its \ndecision of guilty. She said ``I feel like I can breathe again now.'' \nShe walked out of the Navy headquarters building where the court-\nmarital was held. She stated-- this is sad--``I didn't join the Navy to \nbe laughed at.'' She had stated that this particular officer that was \nfound guilty had stated lewd things towards her. Another recruit had \nsaid this person that was found guilty intimated to her he wanted to \nhave sex with her, and she stated, ``I'll feel better when he is \npunished. He was in charge of the way he made us feel.''\n  Two other recruits testified they had sex with the same person that \nwas found guilty after he threw a mattress on the floor in the barracks \nand told them to undress. This is a superior position telling these \nrecruits to do this. This is one of the recruits who said, ``The Navy \nis trying to cover up the fact that they let this guy wander through \nthe barracks, intimidating recruits into having sex with them.'' That \nis a horror story for them. And another who had sex with this \nparticular person found guilty said she couldn't have fought him off if \nshe tried.\n  What is that about? This is terrible. This is disgusting that this \ntook place at the Navy basic training facility, and you have several \nrecruits testifying of what this person in a senior position forced \nthem to do.\n  Our amendment is aimed at trying to get just at that, separate \nbarracks. You cannot have a person of the other gender in the facility \nwhere the people of the opposite gender are except on emergency cases. \nWhat are we letting them do, just parade around and throw mattresses on \nthe floor? He was court-martialled for this and found guilty of eight \nof nine charges. This is the press account from June 6th after the \ncourt-martial report came back. My goodness.\n\n  Now, what sort of solace, if you are an 18-year-old and your family \nis considering letting you go into the military service and you want to \ngo into the military service and you are a female, and you are reading \nthese sort of stories, what goes through your mind at that time? Do you \nwant to go into the military then? Is this going to be an inhibition if \nyou think you want to be a part of the Navy, of the proud tradition of \nthe Navy, of the Army? You want to be part of that unit, but then you \nread this stuff about guys parading around in barracks and throwing \nmattresses on the floor. What does that do? And what does it do to the \nfamily? What does the family think about in that case?\n  A study of female recruits out last November found them particularly \nsusceptible to unwanted pregnancies and assaults. The study found that \n``to many young female recruits, the basic training experience can be \nuniquely stressful with individuals often experiencing feelings of \nloneliness and isolation and the possibility that some individuals \nwould turn to sexual relationships as a means of coping with the stress \nis great.''\n  Let's go to another case we are all familiar with. We all remember \nwhat went on at the Aberdeen Proving Ground between instructor and \ntrainee last year--rape and sex between drill instructors and trainees. \nAberdeen is an example of what can happen in the pressurized training \nenvironment without proper supervision. Remember, basic trainees are \neven more susceptible, even more susceptible.\n  We must do what we can to remove these pressures. Again, I plead with \nmy colleagues, think of your own 18-year-old daughters going into the \nmilitary, or others that would be considering this. Is this really the \nsort of situation we want to put them in, that we are forcing them to \ngo into, that we force them, if they want to be a part of the military. \nThat is what they have to do; this is where they have to sleep.\n  I recognize that the services are already taking steps to ensure \nsecurity and privacy of the current male and female living arrangements \nand I applaud the services for taking these steps. My amendment allows \ntime for the services to accomplish the transition to separate \nbarracks, which is where they have to get. It really is where they have \nto get. It sets October 1, 2001, as the effective date. If an \ninstallation has insufficient facilities, the amendment allows recruits \nto be housed in separate barrack floors with the proper access \nrestrictions until 2001.\n  We are giving the military some lead time to build into this, to deal \nwith this situation, and they are trying to deal with it. The bottom \nline is this: The primary function of the basic training is to properly \ninduce young trainees into the Armed Forces, with minimal \ndistractions. They are there to learn the skills that spell success or \nfailure on the battlefield. I urge you to support Secretary Cohen's \ngoal of ``a basic training system which provides gender privacy and \ndignity and safe, secure living conditions.'' Safe, secure, and \nseparate barracks is the best way to ensure a well-trained and \ndisciplined force. At a minimum, I believe that we owe that to these \nrecruits and their families.\n\n  Mr. President, I just ask you to think about this for a little while, \nbecause this really makes sense. I know the military is trying to get \naccomplish what we have mandated them to do on the mixed-gender \ntraining, and they are trying to do it in the close quarters that we \nhave, and these have been the ways they have received pressure.\n  My goodness, I say to Senators, we have to look at the facts and what \nis taking place, ask ourselves a bit of common sense. These young 18-\nyear-old men and women are in close quarters, in a pressurized \nsituation at basic training. What do you think is going to happen in \nthis situation if you provide a situation where they are in the same \nbarracks and you have a common area for them to go into, or you have \ninstructors that are superior in age and position and they are able to \ngo into the same facilities?\n  The military is saying, ``Look, we are trying to divide and partition \nthe buildings, so that on the same floor\n\n[[Page S6970]]\n\nyou are going to have a plywood petition, and hopefully we will get to \na permanent petition between the two genders on the floor.'' But you \nare still going to have common areas where the two can mix. Plus, you \ncan still have and will still have your instructors going into the area \nof the opposite sex and being there. You are going to have, \nunfortunately, that situation like just happened up in the Navy basic \ntraining facility, if that occurs. If we leave the situation the way it \nis today, that is going to occur. Plus, you are still mixing a \nsituation that just doesn't apply to us in common sense, if we think \nabout it. This is going to lead to the problems we have.\n  I also want to add a personal Kansas story into this. My office in \nKansas--I have not been a Senator a long time, but we regularly get \nrequests from female recruits who get pregnant while in basic training, \nand they ask for discharges. One lady who contacted my office had a \nnervous breakdown. She has since separated from the Navy. I will not \nsay her name; that would be inappropriate. But my note to colleagues is \nthat everybody loses in this deal. Everybody loses in this deal. The \nNavy loses a highly qualified, motivated recruit, who falls into a \npressurized environment and then gets demoralized and has a nervous \nbreakdown.\n  This is a Kansas example I have, and only one. I have multiple ones \nthat come into my office in Kansas. I am sure others have them, too. \nCheck your records, check your services, and what you are being \ncontacted about in your State. How many of you have the same \nsituation--being contacted by female recruits who want out of the \nmilitary because they have unwarranted sexual advances? My goodness, \nthe Navy loses, we lose, and this particular recruit was demoralized \nand loses as well. This makes no sense.\n  I want to go through the report, if I may, of the Kassebaum \ncommission. This is something I respect, coming from Nancy Kassebaum \nBaker from my home State of Kansas, who is as level-headed a person as \nyou will ever find anywhere in the world. She is a wonderful lady. She \nis very thoughtful, and she doesn't go around tilting at different \nthings and doesn't follow wildly different philosophies. She looks at \nthings and applies a good Kansas common sense to it. I think she \nepitomizes that sense of common sense. A lot of my colleagues will \nremember her, and they know what I am saying is true. This is her \ncommission's report:\n\n       The committee observed that integrated housing is \n     contributing to a higher rate of disciplinary problems. Both \n     recruits and trainers, consequently, are distracted from \n     their training objectives . . ..\n\n  What is our objective in basic training but to train? They are being \ndistracted because of disciplinary problems they are having. This is a \nquote from the commission report on December 16, 1997. I want to show \nyou a chart of this commission in a little bit. It was appointed by the \nSecretary of Defense, Secretary Cohen, and from the President, and they \ncame out with these unanimous recommendations. It was bipartisan, and \nthere were a number of people in this commission who served in the \nmilitary themselves. This is a group that has considered it. Here is \nanother quote from congressional testimony:\n\n       We have reviewed the barracks structure at the training \n     installations and believe that this can be achieved at \n     minimal cost.\n\n  I am sensitive to the cost issue because we are not funding the \nmilitary sufficiently. I have military bases in my State that are \nimportant and are not being funded sufficiently. They have studied this \nthoroughly. They said we can do this at minimal, if any, cost.\n  In my amendment, we do authorize money to be able to be used to do \nthis. I think even if you are talking about recruits coming in, you \nhave to provide some solace to the families that we are going to \nseparate and do everything we can--and right now we are not--to prevent \nthis sort of situation from happening. We still provide an \nauthorization in the amendment that I have, and we can deal with the \nappropriation on another day.\n  This is the Army inspector general's special inspection from July 22, \n1997:\n\n       Many of the first sergeants interviewed indicated that \n     trainee-trainee consensual sex occurred quite often, but felt \n     the chain of command was reluctant to enforce the \n     installation regulation.\n\n  To back up this even with my staff's investigation, the military \nrequested--and they want to try to make this situation work--and they \nhave been pushing our office and saying, ``Don't do this.'' They said, \n``Send a couple of your staff members to Fort Jackson to look at the \nsituation.'' We did. I had two staff members go there. They went and \ntalked with some of the recruits, who told them about instances of \nsexual activity happening in the telephone booth and in the same \nbarracks where you have mixed genders involved, and they told them how \nthis was done, how the pressure is and the environment and how this \noccurs.\n  So rather than allaying my fears, which is what I hoped would happen, \nit just heightened them. Here we had my staff members being told by \nrecruits, ``Well, yes, this goes on. Here is how it happens in separate \nfacilities.'' And we were shown how the barrier is built between the \nmale and female genders on the same floor, with a piece of plywood put \nup and a Radio Shack alarm. Well, you are still putting males and \nfemales in close proximity, in common areas. My staff was supposed to \nbe there being assured this was not going on, but we got just the \nopposite report of what was taking place.\n  This is the CRS issue brief of May 14, 1998. It is the third \ndifferent study looking at this particular issue:\n\n       At a number of Army facilities, investigations and court \n     marshals are underway, or have been completed, concerning \n     harassment, fraternization, assault and rape.\n\n  So I have the Kassebaum commission, the Army inspector general, and \nnow the CRS issue brief. This isn't just one study; this is the third \none. It is the same point that it makes.\n  Some of the people who have supported the military for a long time, \nthe American Legion, submitted a report to the House Subcommittee on \nMilitary Personnel on March 17. It said:\n\n       The American Legion advocates separate barracks for male \n     and female recruits at basic training facilities.\n\n  This is also an American Legion statement:\n\n       The mission in combat is to close with and destroy the \n     enemy by fire and maneuver and/or close combat. Separate \n     gender living conditions will better prepare the Armed Forces \n     to fulfill this mission.\n\n  That is what the military is about, Mr. President. This is the \noverall commission's unanimous recommendation for separate barracks. \nMr. President, I hope we can have a direct vote on this. I think we \nshould have separate training for male and female, like what the House \npassed. I know a number of my colleagues actually support that as \nwell--separate training altogether. We decided, let's take a narrower \napproach. Let's go on this narrower issue here, because this one I \ndon't see how you disagree with.\n\n  Some of my colleagues will argue, and say, ``Well, let's wait for \nanother commission report. We have a congressional commission.'' Yes; \nwe have a congressional commission. It has been appointed. It has a \nmuch broader requirement than just the issue of separate gender \nrelations. Plus, I would point out again to you, now we are another \nyear into the future. We are going to be on a second commission. We \nalready have one conducted and led by a Member of this body, a highly \nrespected Member of this body, who unanimously reported back. Now we \nare going to wait another year.\n  How many more of these situations like we had take place in the Navy \nare we going to have in the interim? How many more letters or contacts \nam I going to get by constituents in Kansas saying they had nervous \nbreakdowns because of this situation? How many more of these will it \ntake when we will not respond to common sense? This is just common \nsense.\n  I have deep respect for my colleagues who view this differently. \nSenator Kempthorne and his committee has looked at this. But I don't \nthink this makes any sense of where we are. I think this is a very \nnarrow approach. It isn't about basic training; it is just about \nbarracks. We can do it at minimal cost. If not, we have the \nauthorization here to deal with this.\n  I plead with my colleagues that we do it. I hope we take a different \ntack on this.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator a question? I \nlistened very carefully. I am supportive of his amendment.\n\n[[Page S6971]]\n\n  Did the Senator from Kansas mention the Marine Corps?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Only briefly.\n  Mr. WARNER. Their experience has been considerably freer of the \nproblems that the other two services have incurred as a consequence of \nthat. Am I correct?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The Senator is absolutely correct. They, as a service, \nagree with what the Kassebaum Commission put forth. The other services \nhave not.\n  Mr. WARNER. For those who may be following this debate outside of the \nSenate, so to speak, basic training is just 9 weeks in each of the \nservices. So it is a relatively short period of time. It is a brief \nperiod from when they leave the home environment, school environment, \nand other structured environments in their communities across America \nto come and undertake this important first phase of their training of a \nmilitary career.\n  It seems to me that what the Senator is asking is just the \nopportunity for the different sectors to go into this very intense \nperiod where the objective is to really transform them in many ways, as \nthe Senator pointed out. First of all, it is a patriotic duty to be a \nmember of the team. And all of the other important goals are in the \nfirst 9 weeks. To simply, at the end of the training, give them a \nlittle respite from all of the pressures which they are being \nsubjected, give them a chance to kick back and rest on their own, among \nthemselves, and then as soon as reveille the following morning, \nbeginning with the mess facility, beginning the fallout, the grinder \nformation, as they march off to the rifle range, they are together, and \nit is joint in every respect. Am I not correct?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct. The Senator from Virginia is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to address further the issue of \ncost on this, because some will allege that is the reason we should \nblock this, because it puts a cost figure of $166 million, $190 \nmillion. I am very sensitive to the cost issue, so I provide for the \nauthorization.\n  But I also challenge my colleagues on this very point to think about \nthis. Basic training for 9 weeks, pressurized environment. It is where \nyou teach, train, build, and mold--9 weeks of a focused, intense time \nperiod that is taking place. You are putting somebody 18 years old, \nmale and female, into that pressurized environment. Is this a place for \nus to cut costs in the military, saying because of that cost we have to \nforce them onto the same floor and the same common area because we \ncannot afford the $166 million?\n  Mind you, the Kassebaum Commission says we can do this at zero to \nminimal cost. We can do this with minimal, if any, cost.\n  Let's say it does have some cost with it. I don't think it does. I \ndon't support that notion. Anyway, if you are 18 years old looking at \ngoing into the military, isn't this a pretty minimal amount of cost? If \nyou are the family of that 18-year-old considering going into the \nmilitary, is that a cost that you want the Government to be putting \nforth and being a part of? My goodness, we have to make some sense out \nof this.\n  This is a very narrow amendment that we are asking for. I hope we \nhave a direct vote on this. I hope we will be able to get to it. I will \nlearn my lessons quickly. So I hope we can get to a vote on this \nparticular issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes; I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the Senator and commend him on his \nfine statement. I support the recommendations of the Kassebaum \nCommission. I think it is the right recommendation. I wonder if the \nSenator would add my name as a cosponsor of his amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am pleased to do so.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor of the \nBrownback amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will be asking for the yeas and nays \nat the appropriate time on this. I plead with my colleagues to really \nconsider this.\n  I ask them really just one small, simple favor: Will they call their \nconstituent services' offices to see how many recruits they have been \ncontacted by back home during this past year asking for relief from \nmilitary duty because they were sexually assaulted, got pregnant at \nbasic training or at training, and see what the numbers are in their \nparticular office? One is too many. But I would be interested to see \nhow many of them have had multiple contacts in their office.\n  We shouldn't ignore this anymore. We should deal with it. This is a \nminor request we should be making.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will ask for the yeas and nays at the \nproper time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to address this body on the subject of \nan important issue and what it means, I believe, to the future of our \nArmed Forces.\n  The participation of women in the armed services today is very \nimportant. As the Secretary of Defense said recently in reaffirming his \nsupport for gender-integrated training, and the recommendations of the \nservices with respect to gender-integrated training, he said clearly \nthat the military depends upon women.\n  Women now represent 14 percent of our armed services. So their role \nand their well-being is an essential ingredient to upholding the \nimportance of certain standards with respect to our national security \nand performance of our Armed Forces and personnel.\n  I offered a second-degree amendment to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Kansas, because it will reaffirm the judgment that was \nmade first in the Armed Services Committee last year to the DOD 1998 \nauthorization. The amendment that was offered created a congressional \ncommission to examine many of the issues that were raised by the \nSenator from Kansas. Obviously, they are not new issues. They are ones \nin which we have been wrestling with time and time again, not only here \nin Congress but, of course, within the Defense Department.\n  There are no simple solutions. But what I find amazing in hearing the \ndiscussion with respect to women in the military and the gender-\nintegrated training and the problems that have resulted from gender-\nintegrated training, no one seems to raise the issue as to what about \nthe responsibilities and the moral authority of those people who are in \npositions of leadership within our military?\n  I have had the opportunity to visit many installations, including \nFort Jackson, the one which the Senator from Kansas referred to and \nthat his staff visited. I also visited that facility. I well remember \nthe facilities that are there that separate men and women. Men and \nwomen are separated within the Army, within the Air Force, within the \nNavy. They have separate entrances. They have separate wings, separate \nbays, separate bathrooms, separate alarms. They have security guards, \nsecurity cameras. So there are certain security measures that are \nalready in place. Now the question has arisen as to whether or not we \nshould have separate barracks.\n  With all the misconduct and sexual harassment that has occurred that \nwe have heard so much about over the last few years, much of it, \ninterestingly enough, has occurred in advanced integrated training \nprograms, not with basic training. But nevertheless, one of the \ncritical areas that we must focus on is developing standards and \nupholding and enforcing those standards that are consistent with the \nwell-being of both men and women who serve in our Armed Forces, the \nbasic rights of all human beings, whether they are in the military or \nin the private sector.\n  And these questions have to be considered as proposed by the Senator \nfrom Kansas through a simple disposition of an amendment? We in the \ncommittee last year said no, and, frankly, I was prepared to debate and \nfight this issue in the Chamber with respect to gender-integrated \ntraining, whether or not to have separate barracks, and so\n\n[[Page S6972]]\n\non and so forth. But in the good judgment and the wisdom of the \ncommittee, we decided to create a consensus-based amendment that was \noffered by the chairman of the Subcommittee on Personnel, Senator \nKempthorne, Senator Byrd from West Virginia, and myself. We knew that \nthe Department of Defense had already created its own commission to \nevaluate these questions and many more. We decided that it was also \nimportant to create a commission that was independent to evaluate these \nissues as well.\n  Now we have to decide in this Chamber whether or not we should \nsubjugate the recommendations of the commission that will be coming \nforward next spring to the amendment that is offered by the Senator \nfrom Kansas. I say not. This is a major and fundamental issue. How we \nproceed is important, and that is why the Committee on Armed Services \napproved an amendment that was included in the 1998 authorization to \ncreate this commission that is now part of law, and it was approved in \nthe Senate and approved by Congress. So now we have to decide whether \nor not we are going to allow the Senator from Kansas to override the \njudgment of the members of this commission that will come forward with \nrecommendations next spring. There will be 10 members of this \ncommission that are appointed by the chairman and ranking member of the \nHouse National Security Committee and the ranking member and the \nchairman of this Committee on Armed Services in the Senate with \nconsultation with the majority and minority leaders in both bodies.\n  They represent a cross-section of experience, expertise on some of \nthese critical issues--that is what we are welcoming--that is \nindependent of the kind of decision that we can make here in an \namendment that is offered by the Senator from Kansas without the \nexamination and the evaluation of these issues.\n  We have represented on the commission a Marine Corps general who \ncommanded a division during Operation Desert Storm; we have a former \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management; a former Assistant \nSecretary of the Navy for Manpower; a board member of the Virginia \nMilitary Institute; the Provost of the University of Michigan, two \nmilitary sociologists, a former Marine Corps Deputy Chief of Staff for \nManpower and Reserve Affairs and a retired sergeant major from the \nTraining and Doctrine Command. The men and women in our commission have \nheld these positions or are currently holding them. We should give them \nthe opportunity to meet their responsibilities under law.\n  The proponents of the amendment that is offered by the Senator from \nKansas would require by the year 2001 the construction of separate \nbarracks. It basically will not allow any flexibility by the service \nchiefs with respect to the construction of those facilities; that, yes, \nwill cost more than $167 million to construct. It will not permit \ntrainees, instructors, commanders, to offer their own assessments of \nwhether the way the recruits live supports the process for developing a \nsoldier.\n\n  They should be in a position of making those decisions--in fact, have \nhad the ability to accept the decision that was recommended by the \nKassebaum-Baker Commission. In fact, the Secretary of Defense gave the \nservice chiefs the opportunity to respond within 90 days to that \nrecommendation as to how they wanted to proceed and to develop criteria \non the basis on which they decide they would advance or implement those \nrecommendations. The service chiefs responded. They all upheld their \ncurrent status because they have made adjustments in the living \nquarters. They are separate. They are not in separate facilities, but \nthey are in separate wings and bays, as I mentioned earlier, and they \nbelieve that the current process is working. They support gender-\nintegrated training because they feel that this is the way in which you \nbuild a cohesive unit.\n  We have thousands and thousands of women who are currently serving in \nBosnia without complaint. We have had thousands and thousands of women \nserving in the Persian Gulf without complaint. We have had more than \n1,000 women who participated in our operations in Somalia, and we have \nhad no complaints.\n  Are we now not saying that it is possible for men and women, on the \nday in which they begin their basic training, cannot work and train \ntogether as they will be required to do after their basic training, as \nthey are required to do right now in Bosnia? We have over 5,000 women \ncurrently serving in Bosnia. In fact, the Washington Post had an in-\ndepth story last year that described the circumstances under which both \nmen and women were serving, and they were doing an extraordinary job \nwithout hindrance, without barriers, without complications under some \nmost arduous of conditions. We had 41,000 women in the Persian Gulf. \nDid we hear of complaints? No. It is because they trained together. \nThey understood the professionalism of their responsibilities, and they \ncarried them out as we could expect them to do. They upheld the highest \nmoral standards.\n  The amendment that I offer here today reinforces the recommendation \nthat was made by the Armed Services Committee last year by the creation \nof this commission to examine many of the questions that have been \nraised. Frankly, I had my doubts as to whether or not it was necessary \nto create another commission, but I also personally had to recognize \nthat, in fact, many here in this Chamber and elsewhere had concerns \nabout basic training and about gender-integrated training, and that \nperhaps the best way to proceed was to create another commission that \nwould represent a breadth of experience and professionalism and \nqualifications and skills that are necessary to make the kinds of \ndecisions that we would expect of them.\n  Their mandate is substantial. We have more than 10 different areas \nwith respect to gender-integrated training and all of the other \ndimensions to the question--the living conditions, the impact on \nreadiness, on morale, on fitness standards, the rationale for the \nestablishment or the disestablishment of gender-integrated or gender-\nsegregated basic training, the rationale that was used at the time in \nwhich these decisions were made by the services to integrate training \nor to segregate in the case of the Marines, or assess whether or not \nthe concept of training as you will fight is a valid rationale for \ngender-integrated basic training; identify the requirements that are \nunique to each of the services that could affect a decision by the \nSecretary considering adopting a gender-integrated or gender-segregated \nformat for basic training; to examine all the facilities for \nfeasibility or the implications of requiring drill inspectors to be of \nthe same sex.\n\n  There are a number of issues that are embodied in this statute that \nwas approved by the Congress last year to the authorization that will \nbe examined by the men and women who are serving on this commission. So \nthe question is, Should we adopt the amendment by the Senator from \nKansas or should we adopt the amendment that I have offered as a \nsecond-degree to the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas that \nwill give this commission the opportunity to evaluate these questions \nso that we can make a reasoned, informed decision as to what approach \nshould be taken by the military?\n  This amendment that I have offered is supported by the civilian, the \nofficer, and the enlisted leadership of the Pentagon to retain the \ncurrent training programs at each of the armed services until this \nCommission on Military Training and Gender-Related Issues files its \nfinal report in March of 1999. It reaffirms this decision. It reaffirms \nthe bipartisanship and the consensus that was produced last year in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and in the Congress on these difficult \nissues of obtaining the most comprehensive use of professionals and \nmilitary leaders outside of Congress. And the charter stipulates very \nclearly the aspects that will be examined of the training practices and \nthe policy directives and the regulations that enumerate the \nprofessional relationships between men and women in uniform. It also \nassigns the commission the obligation and responsibility to evaluate \nthe findings of the Kassebaum-Baker panel on gender-integrated training \nand the Pentagon's rules regarding fraternization as well as adultery.\n  So we have to decide here whether we are going to approve my \namendment that is supported by the Secretary of Defense and the service \nchiefs and many of the Members here in this\n\n[[Page S6973]]\n\nbody, or are we going to support the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Kansas that presumes to answer this in three pages this afternoon \nwith a new regulation imposing a $167 million military construction \ncost on the Defense Department. I think we have an obligation to give \nthe commission the opportunity to work its will as we have asked them \nto do.\n  I would like to read to you, Mr. President, some excerpts from the \nvarious letters and statements that have been made by the service \nchiefs and by the Secretary of Defense about the issues concerning \ngender-integrated training and separate barracks. The Secretary of \nDefense wrote to the chairman of our committee, Senator Thurmond:\n\n       Training in the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps is a \n     complex matter given each Service's unique mission, \n     traditions and conditions of service. Each Service has their \n     own approach in how they conduct basic training. This \n     training must not be characterized by any one issue such as \n     billeting or any one policy such as the extent of gender \n     integrated training. We must, however, identify the right set \n     of standards to produce a safe and secure environment for the \n     rigorous training our young men and women need for military \n     service.\n       This is exactly what the Department is doing. We are making \n     sure that we have the very best personnel to staff our \n     training establishments and to serve as role models for our \n     new recruits. . . .\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S6935-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6973-S6991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I urge you not to tie the Department's hands by enacting \n     legislative provisions that address one or two components of \n     a far more complex force management issue.\n\n  I should remind Members of the Senate, there are about 30 \nrecommendations that were made by the Kassebaum-Baker Commission back \nin December; 28 of those 30 recommendations were implemented by the \nSecretary of Defense--28 of the 30 recommendations. But let's hear from \nthe United States Army, again, in a letter to the chairman of the \ncommittee, Chief of Staff, General Reimer. He says in his letter:\n\n       Segregating their units into gender unique platoons for \n     training and billeting the soldiers by gender in separate \n     buildings will degrade the commander's ability to command and \n     control his or her unit.\n\n  Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations, said in a letter to the \nchairman:\n\n       During basic training, Navy's gender-integrated divisions \n     perform at least as well as their all-male counterparts.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We agree wholeheartedly that Sailors in basic training must \n     have safe, secure housing and living arrangements that \n     promote effective training. But Sailors should also learn to \n     live and work together from the first day of training. This \n     is how they will serve at sea, as part of a gender-integrated \n     unit.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I ask that you continue to allow Navy to build our gender-\n     integrated team from the first day of basic training.\n  Admiral Pilling, who is the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, in his \nletter to the chairman of the committee:\n\n       This experience builds effective teamwork and establishes \n     Navy standards during the crucial transformation from \n     civilian to Sailor. Roughly a third of all recruits and 40 \n     percent of women report to the Fleet without follow-on \n     advanced training. For these men and women, preparation for \n     shipboard life is limited to boot camp and less than three \n     weeks of Apprentice Training.\n\n                               * * * * *\n\n       Learning about security, privacy, dignity and personal \n     responsibility should not be a lesson left for the Fleet to \n     teach. I ask that you continue to allow Navy to build our \n     gender-integrated team from the first day of basic training.\n\n  And General Ryan of the Air Force. He said in his letter to the \nchairman:\n\n       The training process in the Air Force has developed over \n     the years, with changes along the way, to best support our \n     mission. To place artificial barriers between men and women \n     in basic training, such as those proposed in the current \n     House bill [and basically embodied in some of the legislation \n     offered by the Senator from Kansas], is counterproductive to \n     our training philosophy and sends the wrong signal to our new \n     recruits.\n\n                               * * * * *\n\n       I respectfully request your support to allow the Air Force \n     to keep training as we operate--together from the start.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Maine could \njust yield for a unanimous consent request. I believe it has been \ncleared. I want to make sure it is cleared with her staff.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, because Members are trying to get a fix on schedules \nfor this evening, in consultation with the managers and the leaders, I \nwould like to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour of debate--an additional \nhour from this point forward--on the pending second-degree amendment, \nequally divided and controlled by Senator Brownback and Senator Snowe, \nwith a vote to occur on the second-degree amendment not later than 8 \np.m.\n  The reason for that is that many Senators had been told that there \nwould be a vote at 8. They have planned their schedules accordingly. If \nwe can agree to this now with an additional hour of debate equally \ncontrolled by the two Senators, we can then schedule that vote for 8 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for yielding and ask her pardon for \nthe interruption.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I appreciate the Senator's unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to also quote a letter from \nthe Senior Noncommissioned Officers of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates, representing the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. They said:\n\n       As the Senior Noncommissioned Officers of the Armed Forces \n     of the United States, we feel compelled to state our \n     disagreement with a proposed amendment on recruit training \n     that might be considered during the Senate's debate of the \n     FY99 Defense Bill. A mandatory requirement to house recruits \n     in completely separate barracks is unnecessary.\n       Based on our experience, each Service is different and \n     therefore has different needs in training its recruits to \n     join operational units. The determination as to how to train \n     recruits is best determined by the individual Services based \n     on the specific needs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and \n     Marines. Any attempt to make a training policy that applies \n     across all Services is not in the best interests of the \n     nation and will impact the readiness of the total force.\n       Their many successes in our gender-integrated all-volunteer \n     force is a direct result of the training the Services \n     currently provide.\n       We are grateful for Secretary Cohen's support of the \n     Services in determining how best to conduct recruit training. \n     We respectfully request the same vote of confidence from you \n     as the Senate considers the fiscal year 1999 defense \n     authorization bill.\n\n  We also had a quote from the Army Research Institute study, and I \nthink it is interesting to note, about the standards that have also \nbeen developed in this environment of basic training, so that there is \nno misunderstanding, unless there is any concern about the role that \nwomen are playing and their ability to perform during the course of \nbasic training. I quote:\n\n       Females trained in a gender-integrated environment improved \n     their performance in all measures of physical fitness (push-\n     ups, sit-ups, 2-mile run) and the males in gender-integrated \n     training improved in two of three events. This has occurred \n     without the Army fitness standards being changed or adjusted \n     for gender-integrated training.\n\n  In the December report of the Federal Advisory Committee, which is, \nof course, the Kassebaum-Baker commission, it said:\n\n       The committee believes that the increasing number of women \n     in expanded roles is an important reason why the United \n     States is able to maintain an effective and efficient \n     volunteer military force.\n\n  Another letter, from the Secretary of the Army in 1997 to Congress. \nHe said:\n\n       Turning the clock back to gender segregated training will \n     result in unrealistic training which degrades readiness.\n\n  I mention these quotes, Mr. President, because I think it is \nimportant that we remind ourselves of the role that women do play in \nour military and will play in our military, and as they have in the \nlast 100 years. They represent 14 percent of armed services, and the \narmed services cannot perform without them.\n  I just believe it is important to make sure that we can ensure the \nstature and the well-being of all those who serve our country. That is \nwhy I believe we should follow the wisdom and the judgment of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee--indeed, the Congress last\n\n[[Page S6974]]\n\nyear, when we enacted a provision to create a congressional commission \nto examine all of these issues and to report back to the Congress next \nMarch.\n  I hope the Senate will not adopt the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Kansas that basically presumes to substitute for the operational \nconclusions thus far of the Secretary of Defense; the chiefs of the \nArmy, Air Force, the Navy; the training commanders of the Army, the Air \nForce, and the Navy; the senior noncommissioned officers of the Army, \nthe Air Force and the Navy; the president of the Association of the \nUnited States Army; and the tens of thousands of recruits who train and \nlive in security on a daily basis.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that the Senate will adopt the amendment that \nhas been offered by the Senator from Michigan, the ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, the Senator from Georgia, Senator \nCleland, and myself to reaffirm the judgment that has been rendered by \nthe Congress last year in creating this commission.\n  The amendment that is offered by the Senator from Kansas mismatches a \nproblem and a cure. Professional relationships and effective \nperformance throughout the Armed Forces flow from a training world that \noverlaps with the real and the uncertain ones in which men and women \nwill ultimately be deployed as we have seen in Bosnia, as we have seen \nin the Persian Gulf, as we have seen in Somalia over and over again.\n\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment that has been offered by myself, \nSenator Cleland, and Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield 5 minutes--and there are several of my \ncolleagues who want to speak on this, but Senator Coats has been a \nleading voice on this, serving on the committee--I yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I \nappreciate the opportunity to speak now. I have been off the floor, and \nI have another commitment, but I wanted to come and offer my support to \nhis amendment.\n  I struggled with this issue when I was, first, ranking member and \nthen chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee. I visited most of the \ntraining facilities for the various services around the country. I \ntalked to those in charge. We held hearings on the issue. We heard from \nthe experts. We talked to those who lived with the situation in their \nbasic training. It is my inescapable conclusion that the Kassebaum \ncommission did a good job in sorting this out and producing a report \nwhich called for separate facilities.\n  I, frankly, was surprised with the conclusion of the commission. I \ndidn't think when it was constituted that the commission would come to \nthat conclusion. It was something that I was strongly leaning toward, \nand all the visits that I made and the people I discussed this issue \nwith seemed to indicate that separate barracks was the direction to go.\n  When the commission came forth with this recommendation after a more \nthorough look than I was able to give, I thought this added a lot of \nweight to the question. There is no doubt in my mind that effective \ntraining and effective gender integration of the armed services can be \naccomplished without the necessity of forcing the issue through gender \nintegration within the living facilities.\n  Obviously, they are going to train together. Obviously, they are \ngoing to go to class together, they are going to go to the range \ntogether, they are going to train together. The essential functions \nthat are attempting to be accomplished in basic training are going to \nbe accomplished. The real question here is when the training day is \ndone and you return to the barracks to unwind, to shower, to prepare in \nthe evening for the next day and to sleep, is it best to do that in \ngender separate facilities? I believe it is. This where the issue is.\n  I have talked to a lot of drill sergeants, men and women; I have \ntalked to a lot of men and women soldiers, trainees; and the \ninescapable conclusion that I have reached, and I think most of them \nhave reached, is that it would be much more comfortable without \ndegrading the training, and it would eliminate a lot of the supervisory \nproblems, management problems, and, frankly, the social problems that \nexist with living at too close quarters.\n  For that reason, I think the conclusions of the Kassebaum commission \nare correct. I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas \nis the right way to go.\n  I was concerned about the costs. That is a legitimate question, as to \nwhether or not separate facilities or separate barracks--in other \nwords, taking a single entity and dividing it and controlling access, \nand so forth, to separate the sexes, versus separate buildings.\n  And I was really persuaded. I knew ultimately, based on my visit to \nParris Island with the Marines who already do this, that separate \nhousing was the right policy. At Parris Island, the women live in a \nseparate compound. And virtually, to a person, they told me--including \ntheir drill instructors and their supervisors--they told me they \nstrongly preferred that. They are able to identify with each other. And \nto identify with their female drill instructors was very important to \nthem.\n  Many of them come from backgrounds where self-esteem is the casualty \nof their upbringing. They find that bonding with each other, the \nbonding that takes place with the drill instructors and their \nsupervisors in those off-hours, the social interaction that takes place \nin those off-hours, is a very, very important part of their \ndevelopment, the character development, and a whole number of other \nareas.\n  And so I think this makes sense. I am convinced we have looked at the \nsituation. I am convinced we can do this in a financially feasible way.\n  I see my time has expired. And I am happy to support the amendment of \nthe Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine.\n  For those who are entering into this discussion, Mr. President, \nnowhere, as far as I can tell as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, in recruit training, in any service, do male and female \nrecruits live in the same room or in the same squad bay. These \nconditions do not exist now and they did not exist when the incidents \nin Aberdeen took place.\n\n  Male and female recruits do live in the same buildings. In some cases \nmale and female recruits live in separate wings or on separate floors, \nand in some cases they live on the same floors but are separated by \nfire-safe barrier walls. In every case, the male and female recruits \nhave controlled entrances and exits to their sleeping areas and have \nsegregated toilet and shower facilities. The services are in the \nprocess of alarming all doors, exits and walls.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that in every case, in every \nservice, although they might not live in separate buildings, male and \nfemale recruits live in physically safe, physically secure, and \nphysically segregated living conditions.\n  But, Mr. President, in the wake of the terrible incidents of sexual \nmisconduct and sexual harassment that took place in Advanced Training \nat Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the National Defense Authorization Act of \nthe last year established a congressional Commission on Military \nTraining and Gender-Related Issues to review the requirements regarding \ncross-gender relationships of members of the Armed Forces and to review \nthe basic training programs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine \nCorps, and to make improvements on the programs.\n  The idea for the commission came from the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who noted at the time:\n\n       * * * there must be ways to thoroughly examine, review, and \n     evaluate the reasons for\n\n[[Page S6975]]\n\n     the recent spate of scandals regarding sexual relations in \n     training commands. Such a study should be made by an \n     independent blue-ribbon body with unquestioned credentials--\n     with no social agenda, but geared solely to the effect of \n     gender integration at all levels of the military.\n\n  Earlier this year, the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee appointed five distinguished Americans to that \ncommission. Their counterparts on the House National Security Committee \nalso appointed five outstanding individuals.\n  The commissioners include two retired Marine Corps lieutenant \ngenerals, a retired Army command sergeant major, a former Assistant \nSecretary of Defense, a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, three \ndistinguished academics, a military historian/national security \nanalyst, and an expert on legal issues concerning women in the \nmilitary.\n  I have personally met with these commissioners and am convinced they \nunderstand the magnitude of the awesome task we have laid before them, \nand that they are eminently qualified and motivated to do the job.\n  Because of our commitment to doing the right thing--as opposed to \ndoing something quickly--the Armed Services Committee in the Senate \nincluded in its markup a provision to provide for a moratorium on \nchanges to policies or practices regarding segregation on the basis of \ngender.\n  The second-degree amendment Senator Snowe and I have offered retains \nthe moratorium on changes to policies or practices regarding \nsegregation on the basis of gender. I believe this is a very reasonable \napproach. It does not seek to prejudge the outcome of the commission's \nwork.\n  Additionally, it permits the commission to retain its independence. I \nbelieve this is an unwise course of action if we preempt the work of \nthe commission. I know how I would feel if I responded to the call to \nserve on such a commission and was willing to dedicate my time for, \nsay, a year of my life to study these complicated issues, only to find \nthe same people--in this case, the Congress--who asked me to take on \nthe issue, told me before I ever really got started in my work how they \nfelt already.\n\n  I would wonder if they really wanted a thoughtful, professional \nanalysis or if they only wanted the appearance of a study to support \npreconceived ideas and predetermined agendas. I do not believe this was \nthe Senate's intention when it supported the bill authorizing the \nDefense Act last year.\n  We have established a process to review gender-related matters in \ntheir entirety. It does not make sense, to me, for us to separate out \none or two aspects of this incredibly complex issue and to provide some \npiecemeal solution with little or no thought of the consequences our \nactions could have on the rest of the military--recruiting as well as \ntraining and retention.\n  I am aware that the recommendation for separate barracks for male and \nfemale recruits came from the Kassebaum committee appointed by the \nSecretary of Defense. I am also aware that the Secretary of Defense has \ndecided not to implement that recommendation. And the uniformed \nleadership--the most senior officers and enlisted members of the Army, \nNavy, and Air Force--also oppose the recommendation.\n  For example, Mr. President, our committee received a letter from \nGeneral Reimer, Chief of Staff of the Army, who said:\n\n       Segregating their units into gender unique platoons for \n     training and billeting the solders by gender in separate \n     buildings will degrade the commander's ability to command and \n     control his or her unit.\n\n  Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations:\n\n       Sailors should learn to live and work together from the \n     first day of training.\n\n  Admiral Pilling, Vice Chief of Naval Operations:\n\n       Learning about security, privacy, dignity and personal \n     responsibility should not be a lesson left for the fleet to \n     teach.\n\n  General Ryan, Chief of Staff of the Air Force:\n\n       The saying ``train as we operate'' is more than a catch \n     phrase, it is an absolute necessity to ensure that team \n     building begins on the first day our recruits report to basic \n     training.\n\n  Senior enlisted members also commented on this issue as well.\n\n       Any attempt [they said] to make a training policy that \n     applies across all Services is not in the best interest of \n     the nation and will impact the readiness of the total force.\n\n  Mr. President, in terms of the readiness of the force, I was recently \nin Bosnia a few weeks ago. And I did see on a fire base there women \nactively engaged in work on the fire base. But I noticed that their \nliving quarters were separate, safe, and secure. It was an incredible \ndemonstration to me that women and men can serve in this Nation's \ninterests in foreign lands and do so extremely well.\n  I would also like to note that the Kassebaum report itself has \nactually been criticized by the GAO because of flawed methodology. \nAccording to GAO, the value of the Kassebaum committee's methodology is \nlimited for making conclusions and recommendations, and the extent to \nwhich the committee's work supports its conclusions and recommendations \ncannot be determined.\n  When the Secretary of Defense, a former Member of this body, and the \nuniformed leadership of the military, officers and enlisted, oppose \nsomething, I certainly take time to listen.\n  Today, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to listen to the \nleadership of the military and give the Senate a chance to listen to \nthe commission which we actually created and appointed to help us make \ndecisions to guide us in these complex matters.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I support the Snowe amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to adopt it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield to the Senator from Alabama 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I had 13 years in the Army Reserve and went through a \nbasic training program. It was a very worthwhile experience for me. I \nplayed football. I have been to basic training, and basic training is \nworse and tougher. Anybody that survives that has my admiration.\n  I have had the opportunity through the years to serve with some \noutstanding women soldiers, the kind of soldiers that you respect and \nare capable and have great ability to contribute to the mission of the \nunit. It is something that I think is a major part of American military \nlife and we should not be changing.\n  I understand there is a lot of talk about separation and use of the \nword ``segregation'' based on gender. But it seems to me that Senator \nBrownback's amendment simply says that in basic training these \nsoldiers, men and women, shouldn't be housed together. I think that is \na reasonable approach and something that comports with my sense of what \nmakes sense, my sense of what I understand the Senator to be saying, \nand I think it is the right idea.\n  Some might say it is the responsibility of the NCOs and the officers \nto maintain moral control over the soldiers. When they are in such a \nmixed environment, the officers and NCOs can't maintain control over \nthese young people. They are in a circumstance that is a different \nworld; it is a whole different environment they are in. Things that \nthey would have thought to do under other circumstances may not be done \nunder these circumstances.\n  I say we have separate barracks. It seems to me if we are going to \nseparate the 14 percent of the soldiers that are women within existing \nbarracks, it seems to me you are converting whole floors that would \notherwise be half used. For example, most of the barracks I was in had \n20 people on one floor and 20 on the next. So I suppose a few people \nwould be on the second floor and the bottom floor would be full. That \nis the way they were traditionally done.\n  I don't see how it would be any cost to have separate housing for \nwomen in which women could have the support of their NCOs under those \ncircumstances and men could have separate housing. I think both parties \nwould benefit from that.\n  The commission did a lot of work. We have been talking about a new \ncommission. I point out that we had one. Senator Nancy Kassebaum-Baker \nand others did a thorough job. They talked to\n\n[[Page S6976]]\n\nover 1,000 trainees, 500 instructors, 300 first-term service members, \nand 275 supervisors. I don't know who the chiefs of staff and Secretary \nof Army is talking to. I don't know, maybe they are talking to too many \npeople in the Pentagon. But those commissioned, the ones in power to \nmake a decision, went out and talked to soldiers, trainees, 1,000, 500 \ninstructors--the drill instructors out there with these men and women \non a daily basis, and this commission unanimously reached a conclusion \nthat separate housing would be preferable. They also concluded that \nseparate training would be preferable.\n  As a matter of fact, I tend to agree with that based on my \nexperience. But that is not before the Senate today. That is not what \nSenator Brownback is calling on us to do today.\n  Senator Brownback is suggesting that what we ought to do is have \nseparate housing, a readily achievable thing, I suggest.\n  I agree with the commission based on my experience and the study I \nhave done, that separate housing will decrease disciplinary problems, \nit will reduce distractions during the training process, and as the \ncommission found, will be of marginal cost to the Department of \nDefense.\n  I am pleased to support this amendment. I think it is time that this \nbody raised our concerns. There are many problems that are occurring. \nSenator Brownback has eloquently discussed those. We hate to talk about \nthe problems that are occurring, but they need to be discussed. I think \nit is the right thing.\n  I yield back my time to the Senator from Kansas, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I want to thank the able Senator from Maine for the \nexcellent remarks she made on this subject.\n  Mr. President, I am sympathetic to the Brownback amendment, however, \nlast year, the Congress established a commission to review the conduct \nof military training and gender-related issues, we should await the \noutcome of its findings. That commission is constituted and working. \nOne of the areas which the commission must specifically address in its \nfinal report is a recommendation as to how to provide for a safe and \nsecure living environment for young men and women in basic training. \nThis amendment would preempt the work of the commission by establishing \na statutory requirement that basic trainees be housed in separate \nbarracks.\n  I join Senator Brownback and others in insisting that the military \nservices provide a safe and secure environment for all military \npersonnel, but especially those in basic training who may be the most \nvulnerable.\n  On June 8, 1998, Secretary Cohen asked us not to legislate a specific \nsolution as Senator Brownback's amendment does. Secretary Cohen urged \nthat we give the Service Chiefs the flexibility to house and train \ntheir personnel in the manner determined to be most effective for that \nservice. We all recognize that each of the four services is unique. \nEach service has its own culture, history and traditions. I agree with \nSecretary Cohen that we should not legislate how they must house and \ntrain their personnel.\n  Mr. President, I could support an amendment that would require the \nService Secretaries to provide for a safe and secure environment \nwithout specifically requiring a standard solution for three of the \nfour services. Senator Brownback's amendment goes beyond requiring a \nsafe and secure environment and will require millions of dollars in \nmilitary construction and renovation projects to make their barracks \nconform to the requirements in the amendment.\n  I prefer to allow the Congressional Commission to do its work and \nmake its recommendations next March before we act. I urge my colleagues \nto oppose this amendment.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I ask unanimous consent Mr. \nDavid Landfair, a military fellow in the Office of Senator Mike DeWine, \nbe granted privilege of the floor during the pendency of S. 2057, the \nfiscal year 1999 Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if Senator Snowe would yield 10 minutes to me?\n  How much time does the Senator from Maine have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield 8 minutes to me?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I was going to yield to the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Personnel for 5 minutes, so the remainder of the time I yield to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask that the Senator from Maine, then, yield 8 minutes \nto me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First of all, Mr. President, we have all read about some \nterrible incidents that occurred at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds that \ngave rise to much of the concern about recruit training. Those \nincidents did not occur in recruit training. They did not occur in \nrecruit sleeping areas. They did not involve sexual misconduct among \nrecruits. They took place in advanced individual training, which is a \nphase of training which takes place after an individual graduates from \nrecruit training. The incidents that give rise to so much of this \nunderstandable concern did not occur in the recruit training area or \nphase which this first-degree amendment would address.\n  I want to emphasize something on which the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee has just spoken. We appointed a committee or a \ncommission, 10 citizens. These are distinguished citizens that were \nselected by the chairman, by me, by the chairman of our counterpart \ncommittee in the House, and by the ranking member in the House. This \ncommission is underway. We picked 10 distinguished citizens.\n  We asked them to look at a particular agenda, a list of items. We set \nforth their duties and they are now fulfilling those duties.\n  This is what our law said, and this is something which had broad \nsupport in this body. The law said:\n\n       The commission shall consider issues relating to personal \n     relationships of members of the Armed Forces as follows: \n     Review the laws, regulations, policies, directives and \n     practices that govern personal relationships between men and \n     women in the Armed Forces and personal relationships between \n     members of the Armed Forces and nonmilitary personnel of the \n     opposite sex. Assess the extent to which the laws, \n     regulations, policies, directives and practices have been \n     applied consistently throughout the Armed Forces, without \n     regard to the Armed Forces, grade, rank or gender of the \n     individuals involved.\n\n  Then comes the third thing we ask them to do. This was a knowing, \nconscious request--a statement to this commission, saying this is your \nduty:\n\n       Duty No. 3: Assess the reports of the independent panel, \n     the Department of Defense task force, and the review of \n     existing guidance on fraternization and adultery that have \n     been required by the Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Our good friend from Kansas has said that common sense dictates that \nsince the Kassebaum Commission made this recommendation, we ought to \nfollow it. No. Common sense dictates that when we appoint a commission \nwith the explicit duty of assessing the Kassebaum Commission report--\nwhen we do that knowingly and openly, when we ask 10 distinguished \ncitizens to give up part of their life to come here and assess the \nKassebaum report, which is what we did in last year's law, that we not \nsimply say, whoops, some of us liked the Kassebaum report and we are \nnow going to adopt that and bypass the very commission that we created. \nI mean, what is the point of the Senate of the United States and the \nHouse of Representatives unanimously tasking a group of citizens to \nlook at the Kassebaum Commission report, among other things, and now \nonce that report is issued, because some of us like the recommendation, \nwe take that piece of the report and say that we are now going to put \nthat into law and bypass our own commission? I think it makes a mockery \nof the process that we ourselves set into motion. We should not do \nthat.\n  Now, since I have a couple more minutes, I want to state what some of \nthe underlying facts are about the way in which the males and females \nlive.\n  First, nowhere in recruit training in any service do male and female \nrecruits live in the same room or in the\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\nsame squad bay. These conditions do not exist now, and they did not \nexist when the incidents at Aberdeen took place. Male and female \nrecruits do live in the same buildings, and in some cases, they live in \nseparate wings or on separate floors. In some cases, they live on the \nsame floors, but are separated by fire-safe barrier walls. But in every \ncase, male and female recruits have controlled entrances and exits to \ntheir sleeping areas, and have segregated toilet and shower facilities.\n  Now, what have the services told us about this? The heads of the \nservices have told us, ``Do not change this now.'' The heads of the \nservices have told us this. The chief professionals have told us this. \nThe senior enlisted members of the Army, Navy and Air Force, have \nwritten to the committee opposing the amendment. These are the \nprofessionals that we rely on. When it comes to the matters affecting \nthe safety, welfare, and well-being of the men and women in our \nmilitary, these are the people we rely on. These are the professionals. \nThey have asked us, ``Do not enact this legislation.'' So on both \ncounts--that our top military officials, uniform and civilian, have \nasked us to not enact this legislation, and the fact that we have \nappointed a commission that is going to give us a recommendation, which \nwe put in place, in part, to review the Kassebaum Commission report--we \nshould not take this action tonight.\n  Finally, the sergeant major of the Army, the master chief petty \nofficer of the Navy, and the chief master sergeant of the Air Force \nhave written us a letter, which was referred to by a number of my \ncolleagues. I will not repeat the portions that they read. But I am \ngoing to quote one paragraph that I believe has not been read. This \nsummarizes, to me, what the really critical point is, which was so well \nstated by the Senators from Maine and Georgia, and others. This is what \nthey say:\n\n       Each time our Nation has asked the Army, Navy, Air Force or \n     Marines to do a job, it has been done. Men and women \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines accomplish the tasks \n     asked of them every day in places like Bosnia, Haiti, \n     Southwest Asia, and the Far East. Their many successes in our \n     gender-integrated All-Volunteer force is a direct result of \n     the training the services currently provide.\n\n  I hope that we will listen to these professionals.\n  These are the individuals who went to boot camp and have come up \nthrough the ranks to the highest position possible for an enlisted \nmember. When it comes to matters affecting the safety, welfare, and \nwell-being of the men and women in our military, these are the experts! \nAnd, they have asked us not to enact this legislation.\n  That leaves us with the question: Who wants this legislation and why? \nWhat problem will it solve?\n  Neither the military nor civilian leadership of the Department of \nDefense or of the Military Departments want it.\n  The senior enlisted members of the Army, Navy and Air Force see it as \nunnecessary.\n  Finally, it short-circuits the work of a Congressional Commission of \ndistinguished citizens that this body voted into law less than one year \nago.\n  The Armed Services Committee included in its mark-up a provision to \nprovide for a moratorium on changes to policies or practices regarding \nsegregation of integration on the basis of gender that is within the \nresponsibility of the Commission appointed by the Congress, until that \nCommission terminates in March 1999.\n  I believe that it would be both short-sighted and very unfortunate \nfor the Senate to adopt the Brownback amendment and to cause the \nDepartment of Defense to expend in excess of $150 million against the \ncollective judgment--military and civilian--of DOD and before we have \nhad the opportunity to benefit from the advice of our own Commission.\n  The second degree amendment Senators Cleland and Snowe have offered \nretains the moratorium on changes to policies or practices regarding \nsegregation of integration on the basis of gender that is within the \nresponsibility of the Commission appointed by the Congress, until that \nCommission terminates in March 1999.\n  I believe that this is a very reasonable approach. It would permit \nthe Army, Navy, and Air Force to continue to conduct recruit training \nin the manner best suited to producing soldiers, sailors, and airmen \nready to meet the challenges of our military. Uniformed Leadership of \nour military--leaders to whose appointments we have given our advice \nand consent--say it best:\n  General Reimer (Chief of Staff of the Army): ``Segregating their \nunits into gender unique platoons for training and billeting the \nsoldiers by gender in separate buildings will degrade the commander's \nability to command and control his or her unit.''\n  Admiral Johnson (Chief of Naval Operations): ``Sailors should learn \nto live and work together from the first day of training.''\n  Admiral Pilling (Vice Chief of Naval Operations): ``Learning about \nsecurity, privacy, dignity and personal responsibility should not be a \nlesson left for the fleet to teach.''\n  General Ryan (Chief of Staff of the Air Force) ``The saying `train as \nwe operate' is more than a catch phrase, it is an absolute necessity to \nensure that team building begins on the first day our recruits report \nto basic training.''\n  Senior Enlisted Members ``Any attempt to make a training policy that \napplies across all Services is not in the best interest of the nation \nand will impact the readiness of the total force.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support the 2nd degree amendment and permit \nour Commission to complete the work we assigned to it and to report \nback to us before we direct any changes to recruit training.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was listening to the debate when the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama was relating to us his experiences \nin basic training, and I was thinking of my experiences in basic \ntraining. Quite frankly, I think I would have been for integration of \nthe sexes when I was in basic training, but I am looking at it \ndifferently now than I did at that time.\n  I would like to respond to something that the Senator from Michigan \nsaid. I have so much respect for him, but I disagree with him in this \nrespect. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nSubcommittee on Readiness, I spend a lot of time talking to officers in \nthe field, talking to enlisted people in the field, as does the ranking \nmember, the Senator from Virginia. I find a discrepancy in what you \nhear in the field and what you hear from the chiefs.\n  I am not saying this critically of the current chiefs, but I think \nthe chiefs have always reflected the philosophy of the President. The \nPresident is the Commander in Chief. He is the guy responsible for \ntheir careers. So we hear different things from the chiefs here in \nWashington than I hear when I go out to the National Training Center, \nor to 29 Palms, or Fort Bragg, or to Camp Lejeune. They are very \nemphatic and supportive of that portion of the recommendations of the \nKassebaum-Baker report having to do with housing.\n  Thirdly, three different Members, while I have been sitting here, \nhave gone into detail as to the makeup of the committee that we have \nasked for from our committee, and it is a very distinguished panel. But \nI think that we have kind of lost sight of the fact that the committee \nthat we refer to as the Kassebaum-Baker committee was actually \nappointed under the supervision of Secretary of Defense William Cohen. \nHe put together a committee and, frankly, I probably would not have put \ntogether the same committee. I would want it stacked a little bit the \nother way. Real briefly, I will go over the committee.\n  They are: Richard Allen, retired vice admiral of the U.S. Navy; \nRobert Forman, retired lieutenant general, U.S. Army; Marcelite Harris, \nmajor general, retired, from the Air Force; Condoleezza Rice, a \nStanford professor; Don Gardner, a retired major general from the \nMarine Corps; Deval Patrick, who was the Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights, appointed by President Clinton. I mean, if there is \nanybody who would have a bias toward the administration, it would be \nthis individual. Ginger Lee Simpson, retired U.S. Navy, and others.\n  I suggest to my fellow Senators that this committee of 11 had a \nmajority of women. On this committee of 11, 5 of\n\n[[Page S6978]]\n\nthem were either retired generals or admirals.\n  I would hold up this committee to be certainly comparable to the \ncommittee that had been discussed on this floor. I think any time you \nhave a committee like this reaching a unanimous decision--all of these \nretired women from all the services, along with the former Assistant \nAttorney General in charge of civil rights appointed by President \nClinton--and it was unanimous; they all agreed. I think when you have \nthis unanimity, I can't imagine that any other committee is going to \ncome up with a different result.\n  What would happen is, it would delay the implementation of this by a \nyear. If it is good now, and it is good a year from now, I think one \nyear should make a tremendous difference in the morale of the services, \nwhich is certainly suffering at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of my time to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Personnel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, would you please notify me when I have consumed 4 \nminutes?\n  Mr. President, when you spoke so eloquently here, you said that \nSenator Brownback's amendment could be summarized in that the men and \nwomen should not be housed together. I totally agree, 100 percent; men \nand women should not be housed together. I think that the Senator from \nMaine agrees with me. There is no argument here.\n  But when we talk about separate housing, I don't know that \nnecessarily has to mean separate buildings, because when you look at \nthe configuration of many of our structures out there--I agree with \nwhat Senator Brownback said, which was very effective. This idea that \nsomehow you are going to use a plywood partition to separate, that is \nwrong. It ought to be permanent. You ought to have separate entrances. \nYou ought to have separate common areas. You ought to have that. We \nshould have that.\n  But I believe that it is not necessary to go as far as Senator \nBrownback at this point. I think that can be created with existing \nstructures. If not, then let's go ahead with the separate. But, you \nsee, we are presupposing here.\n  When we talk about the terrible incidents that have happened--and \nthey are absolutely deplorable, deplorable. But I think in one of the \ncases that was referenced, a Navy drill instructor committed sexual \nmisconduct with some of these individuals. But in none of those cases \ndid the incidents take place in the sleeping bay of the barracks. It \ntook place in the office of the drill instructor. It took place in the \nmotel down the road. It is not in the bays.\n  The idea that we cannot allow a drill instructor--I don't know how \nfar that goes. Can the commanding officer enter the drill bay to have a \nmeeting with the recruits, if he is escorted by someone of the same \nsex, who are in the barracks? I think that should be allowed. But I \ndon't know that it is allowed here.\n  I am just concerned that perhaps we have gone a little far.\n  We have talked about the Kassebaum-Baker Commission. Do you know that \nthey did not look at the advanced training? They looked strictly at \nbasic.\n\n  Why do I make that point? It is because it was at the advanced \ntraining at Aberdeen. That is where all of these incidents take place--\nadvanced training.\n  We have put together a very effective group of commission members. It \nwas a Kempthorne-Byrd amendment that created the commission. So I can't \nturn my back on that commission. That would be wrong. I am not going to \nturn my back on the Senator from Maine or the Senator from Georgia. \nThat would be wrong. We created a commission in the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  You may have seen, Mr. President, a few weeks ago the commission was \nabout ready to split. Four were going to walk. Congressman Buyer and I \nmet with them and said, ``Don't do this. Don't rule yourselves \nirrelevant. There is such a critical reason for this commission to \nexist. Stay together. Give us the answers.'' Now I am supposed to say \nto that commission, ``Oh, by the way, thanks for staying together, but \nwe don't need your conclusions, because we are going to go ahead with \nall of this legislation, because I believe there is an amendment ready \nto come forward that is going to be removing integrated training.''\n  Mr. President, I am going to repeat what you said. Men and women \nshould not be housed together. No argument. No argument. But I believe \nwe can accomplish that in the existing structure.\n  I also think we have to support a commission that was put in place.\n  Again, I want to compliment the Senator from Kansas. He has brought a \nmeaningful issue before us. He has been articulate about it. Senator \nBrownback does a good job, but I think he has gone just a little far in \nthis. Does separate housing mean you have to have separate housing and \nthe cost that goes with that?\n  I know the Senator from Virginia, Senator Robb, a member of the \nsubcommittee, also would like to speak. I would like to turn my time \nover to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 seconds.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, in 25 seconds let me thank the Senator from \nIdaho. I agree with the points he has made.\n  I have visited the training in Fort Jackson and Parris Island and \nexamined these specific issues. I have asked for some reports from the \nGAO. That is coming in. But we established the commission to give us \nspecific information to help make these decisions.\n  I think the Senator from Maine has adopted the approach that makes \nsense. Let's wait for the commission to make its report and act on the \nbasis of that information.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas controls the remaining \ntime, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to strongly endorse the amendment of my \nfriend, the Senior Senator from Kansas. This amendment would simply \nrequire the housing of male and female recruits in separate barracks \nduring recruit training.\n  It amazes me that this amendment is even necessary. Every attempt to \nreturn common sense to our military's recruit training policies has \nbeen obstructed by this administration--even those attempts initiated \nby the administration itself. Didn't the Secretary of Defense already \nconvene a panel of distinguished military and civil rights experts to \nstudy this serious problem? Didn't this commission--the Kassebaum \nCommission--unanimously point out the critical importance of--among \nother things--giving each gender its own recruit housing? Hasn't the \nadministration had over five years to make their misguided gender \nneutral policies work without success? Sadly and inexplicably, the \nanswer to all these questions is yes.\n  Now we have another commission. Are we going to continue to appoint \nand pay for commissions until we reach an answer that we like? Are we \ngoing to find it easier to appoint a commission than to make a \ndecision? I believe this tactic is called paralysis by analysis. I also \nbelieve that the appropriate time to criticize a commission is before \nthey report, not after.\n  A few days of orientation for new recruits before they are kicked \ninto the hormonal situation that we are putting them in would be \nhelpful.\n  Mr. President, the administration's arguments in favor of their \nsocial engineering are misleading, contradictory and quite \nunprecedented. How are they misleading? The Secretary of Defense has \ntried to garner support for his gender neutral training policies on the \ngrounds that the military simply cannot do without women. The fact, \nhowever, is that no one on any side of this debate is advocating that \nwomen be purged from our military, and it is patently offensive to me \nthat he would indicate that we are. We fully understand\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\nthe importance of women to the functioning of our military. All we are \ntrying to do with this amendment is to give both genders a training \nenvironment in which they can realize their fullest potential.\n  How are the administration's arguments contradictory? They argue that \nthe military must train as it fights. They argue that since men and \nwomen serve together, they must train together, and be housed together. \nYet one of the things discovered by the Kassebaum commission is that \nwhile male recruits are required to throw a hand grenade 35 meters, \nfemale recruits are only required to throw it 25 meters. Is the \nSecretary of Defense implying that our military intends to make sure \nour female soldiers are always 10 meters closer to the enemy than our \nmale soldiers? Though this amendment would not address issues of \ntraining such as this, this type of thinking is indicative of the \ncontradictory quality which pervades all aspects of this \nadministration's recruit training policies--to include housing.\n  How are the administration's arguments unprecedented? It is surely \nunprecedented to place a political agenda of social engineering above \nthe simple requirements of national security. Five years of gender \nneutral training barracks have resulted only in lowered morale, one sex \nscandal after another, recruiting shortfalls for every branch but the \nMarine Corps which does not engage in this incredible practice, and a \nrefusal of this administration to face these problems. It is noteworthy \nthat eighteen months after the sex scandals at Aberdeen, the Kassebaum \nCommission found that the policies which precipitated them had still \nnot been corrected. The Army, like the Navy and Air Force, have proven \nsingularly unsuccessful in solving the problems associated with these \nmisguided policies--policies which deny the existence of any emotional \ndynamics between young men and young women. This is less a reflection \non the earnestness with which our military leaders have tried to \nimplement these policies, than it is an indictment of these unworkable \ngender neutral policies themselves. Mr. President, this amendment \nrepresents a common sense step in the right direction. It is sorely \nneeded and I encourage all members to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. May I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to respond to a few things that have been stated here \nabout what we are talking about and what we are not talking about in \nthe final minutes that I have in this debate.\n  No. 1 is, what we are talking about is separate barracks during basic \ntraining--separate barracks during basic training. We are not talking \nabout further training; we are not talking about deployment, any of \nthose issues that are being raised as a smokescreen by others. We are \nnot talking about separation. We are talking about the 9 weeks of basic \ntraining, separate barracks.\n  All right, that is No. 1. No. 2 is we are also talking about limited \naccess by trainers of the opposite sex after hours. We have had \ninstances--we have had court-martials. Even this month we have had a \ncourt-martial take place in the Navy involving that type of situation.\n  So what we are saying is if you are of the opposite gender, you can't \ngo into the facility where the other gender is staying after hours \nother than in emergency cases.\n  Those are the two things we are talking about. Those are intimate \nissues and they have eminent common sense about them, plus I might add \nbeing backed up by the Kassebaum-Baker commission, the Army survey that \nI showed, the CRS study that I also cited earlier.\n  So I have three studies on this point as well as making what \nbasically most people would say is pretty much common sense about this \nissue. We are not talking about separate training. Senator Byrd was \ngoing to have an amendment along that line, and I think he has some \nwisdom with it, but we are not talking about that sort of issue.\n  Some are saying, look, we don't have a problem. Well, I cited to you \nthe court-martial that has taken place at the Great Lakes Navy basic \ntraining facility, and I read the quotes from some of the people \ninvolved in that horrible instance as to what took place there.\n  I would also cite to you some other problem areas. We did some \nsurveying of the military on these issues. We asked them about official \nreprimands in instances in the last 12 months involving trainers and \ntrainees. The Army gave us 53 that were involved in article 15s over \nthe last 2 years involving trainers and trainees. That is a lot that \nwere involved in this type of situation.\n  Also I want to cite--and there was one thing the Senator from \nMichigan cited saying that this isn't a particular problem. We have got \nthose in that particular case, and the services do not want to do this. \nWell, the Army and Navy and the Air Force may not. The Marines think \nthat separate training and separate barracks is the way to go and they \nare having fewer instances that they are reporting.\n  I want to cite another study. This is the Department of Defense 1995 \nsexual harassment study. This one is amazing if you look at it. They \nare talking about the progress taking place. In 1995, they surveyed \ntheir personnel and 55 percent of the women in the Army, 55 percent of \nthe women surveyed in this Department of Defense study said they had \nsome type of sexual harassment taking place within the last year. \nListen to how this breaks down. Actual or attempted rape or assault, 4 \npercent of the women surveyed said that this had happened to them; \npressure for sexual favors, 11 percent; touching or cornering, 29 \npercent.\n\n  This is the 1995 Department of Defense sexual harassment study. We \ndon't have a problem? We have a significant problem taking place.\n  I have other studies to cite here, but what I want to get to with \nthis is to say that we have a current and present problem and danger \ninvolved in this situation. We are talking about an amendment of very \nlimited scope.\n  We can do studies until we find one that comes out the way we want it \nto come out, and I suppose if we keep appointing people that may \nhappen. The commission that has been appointed has a much broader \npurview than this narrow issue of the barracks.\n  It says the duties of the commission shall be to:\n\n       Review the current practices of the Armed Forces, relevant \n     studies, and private sector training concepts pertaining to \n     gender-integrated training.\n\n  OK, but it also says:\n\n       Review the laws, regulations, policies, directives, and \n     practices that govern personal relationships between men and \n     women in the Armed Forces and personal relationships between \n     members of the Armed Forces and nonmilitary personnel of the \n     opposite sex.\n\n  That is broader than just the barracks during basic training we are \ntalking about.\n\n       Assess the extent to which the laws, regulations, policies, \n     and directives have been applied consistently throughout the \n     Armed Forces without regard to the Armed Force, grade, or \n     rank of the individuals involved.\n\n  Whether or not everybody is being reviewed similarly:\n\n       Examine the experiences, policies, and practices of the \n     Armed Forces of other industrialized nations regarding \n     gender-integrated training.\n\n  Training: We are not talking about training here. We are just talking \nabout barracks during basic training.\n  My point is that some would say we have appointed this commission and \nto not let it go on through; by doing this, that we are overruling the \ncommission. This is a very broad-based commission. We have a clear and \npresent problem in basic training that just earlier this month on June \n5 we have a court-martial taking place at the Navy training grounds, \nand we have got 53 instances being reported in the last 2 years by the \nArmy--53 official reprimands.\n  I get calls to my office by people asking to be released from the \nmilitary because of sexual harassment that has happened to them in \nbasic training.\n  Do we need another year to study this? Do we need another year to \ncontemplate this?\n  My own staff then goes down to Fort Jackson to look at the situation \nbecause there is an issue regarding the\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\ncommon area that is involved here: Let's just put them in the same \nfacility, but we will put them on different floors or separate, \ndifferent wings out here, but then we have a common area together.\n  My own staff was told about, well, there was sexual activities taking \nplace, on the fire escape and in the telephone booth. Where there is a \nwill there is a way, I guess. But my point is, if you are going to put \nyoung 18-year-old recruits in the same place in a pressurized \nenvironment and you are going to provide some chances, this is going to \nhappen.\n  What we are saying is let's just put them in separate facilities by \n2001. Let's give it some time, common sense, so we can get this put \ninto place, and that is specifically and only what we are talking \nabout. And let's limit the supervisors, the trainers being able to go \ninto the trainees' facilities of the opposite sex after hours other \nthan for emergency cases because we have had some really horrible \ninstances taking place there.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I think if you look at the preponderance of \nevidence that is here with all the studies that have been done, we can \ndo yet another one, and if this one doesn't come out the way we want, I \nsuppose we may do yet another one, but we have enough. We have a real \nproblem today--and this is going to really catch up with us--of \nrecruits coming into the military.\n  This is a simple proposal, a simple matter. We don't need to put it \noff for another commission to study this. The evidence is overwhelming \nand the findings have been overwhelming to date.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I would ask my colleagues to vote \nagainst the Snowe amendment. Let us have a vote on this very simple \nissue of separate barracks and not having members of the opposite sex \nin the quarters after hours other than for emergency cases. That is all \nthat we are asking for in this particular amendment.\n  So please vote no on the Snowe amendment so we can put the Kassebaum \ncommission into place.\n  With that, Mr. President, I inquire how much time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two-and-a-half minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to be very magnanimous and \nyield 2 minutes to somebody who absolutely disagrees with me on this \namendment, who I think is absolutely wrong, but I want to be collegial \nwith my colleagues and recognize and yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  I would like 30 seconds at the end in case I need to say something.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the Senator has used the 2 minutes, but I \nappreciate it. I will return the favor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank our colleague from Kansas, and I yield the 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \nand the Senator from Kansas 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the most important issues \ninvolving training in the military is the issue of gender integrated \ntraining.\n  Women have been serving with distinction in our military forces for \ndecades, but their opportunities have grown immensely in the past \ndecade. Unfortunately, the recent sexual harassment scandals in the \nmilitary have been used by some to oppose the integrated training of \nmen and women in the military and to urge a return to separate \ntraining. This approach would be a serious mistake.\n  In light of the expanded roles for women in the military it makes \nsense to continue to integrate all aspects of training except for \ndirect combat training. The Services often cite ``train as you fight'' \nas one of their guidelines in preparation for war. Each service trains \nas it will fight. The Marines and Army direct ground combat units \nconduct gender segregated basic training. For all other non-direct \nground combat roles, the services conduct gender integrated training. \nThis is how they will fight.\n  Some ask, why should basic training be any different? But basic \ntraining is where new recruits learn basic military values. Integrated \ninitial training makes sense. They will train and fight as an \nintegrated force for their entire military careers. There is no reason \nwhy they should not begin to do so as early as possible. Doing so \nincreases the readiness of all our military forces.\n  Opponents also argue for separate barracks for men and women during \ntraining. But, as anyone who has served in the military knows, military \ntraining does not end on the drill field or in the classroom. A great \ndeal of unit cohesion is built during time spent in the barracks \nstudying or preparing for the next day's training. Separate barracks \nwould further complicate the commanders' task and make it more \ndifficult to exercise the leadership that guarantees the readiness of \nthe military unit.\n  The barracks now used in basic training by the services all have \nindependent sleeping areas and restrooms for men and women. Each of \nthese areas has separate entrances. There are alarms on doors and walls \naround living areas, which are locked at night. Moreover, there is \naround-the-clock supervision by the chain of command. There is no doubt \nthat we have safe and secure barracks. Wasting over $150 million in new \nconstruction for separate barracks that are not needed and are no more \nsecure makes no sense.\n  The critics of gender integrated training cite recent cases of sexual \nharassment as a demonstration of the need to segregate men and women \nduring basic training. But almost none of the instances of sexual \nharassment or sexual misconduct were committed by recruits on recruits, \nbut by drill instructors on recruits.\n  That kind of sexual harassment indicates poor leadership, not a \ngender integration problem in training. All of the Services acknowledge \nthe importance of improving the quality of recruit training. Commanders \nand drill instructors will exercise closer supervision over all \nrecruits. That is the best way to eliminate these abuses and ensure the \nhigh level of readiness required for our national defense.\n  We have come a long way toward full acceptance of women in the \nmilitary. But more needs to be done to ensure that the progress goes \nforward in the coming years. Women will not continue to serve in a \nmilitary which discriminates against them. I look forward to a day when \nmore policies and programs affecting service members are implemented \nwithout regard to gender. Women in the military deserve no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Kansas has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I wish to simply respond to the statements of the \nSenator from Michigan and the Senator from Massachusetts. They are \nsimply not true. We have the June 5 case taking place at the Navy train \nfacility, a court-martial because of fraternization, harassment, sexual \nactivity by the trainer with trainees involved in this.\n  Separate barracks: Keep the trainers out afterhours. This makes \nsense, and I would ask my colleagues to vote against the Snowe \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on the second-degree amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment offered by the Senator from Maine.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) and the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller), and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 37, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6981]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 172 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--37\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Glenn\n     Helms\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Specter\n  The amendment (No. 2979) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2978, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Is there further debate on the \nfirst-degree Brownback amendment numbered 2978, as amended? If not, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2978), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \nChairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond.\n  The report accompanying this legislation states that the committee \nhas included $191.4 million for three ``standard'' C-130J aircraft (in \naddition to funding for two other C-130J variants). The \nAdministration's budget request included funding for one standard C-\n130J for the active Air Force. Thus, the committee added two standard \nC-130Js to the budget.\n  The report further states that these two standard C-130J aircraft \nadded by this bill are designated for Reserve Component Modernization. \nHowever, the report appears not to include a designation for the \nrequested C-130J. I would like to ask the Chairman, does the committee \nintend that all three of the standard C-130J aircraft in this bill--not \nsimply the two added to the request--are designated for the Air \nNational Guard?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to compliment the Chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee on his very skillful handling of this \nimportant legislation and for his statesmanlike approach to some \nserious and troubling budget issues in this year's defense budget.\n  This year the defense budget is once again confronted with a serious \nmismatch between the DoD/OMB and the CBO estimates of the outlays \nneeded to execute the programs in the budget. CBO's estimate was $3.7 \nbillion higher than OMB and DoD's estimate.\n  Becuase the President's proposed defense budget was right up against \nthe discretionary spending caps adopted in the Bipartisan Budget \nAgreement, compensating for CBO scoring would require large reductions \nin manpower, procurement, or readiness, or all three. Cuts like that \nare simply not acceptable.\n  Thanks in large part to the cooperation we received from the Chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee and of the Appropriations Committee, \nfrom CBO and from OMB, we were able to devise a solution to much of the \nproblem. The solution has three parts:\n  First, Congress would legislate policies recommended by the \nAdministration to better manage cash in DoD's Working Capital Funds. \nThis would lower fiscal year 1999 outlays by $1.3 billion.\n  Second, Congress would agree to changes in two classified accounts in \nthe Air Force budget that would lower 1999 outlays by $700 million.\n  Third, Congress would enact asset sales amounting to roughly $700 \nmillion.\n  The Chairmen of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee have assured me that taken together these actions reduce the \n1999 outlay shortage to manageable dimensions and help avoid the \nnegative effect on readiness or modernization that was feared.\n  Mr. President, I have reviewed the text of the 1999 Defense \nAuthorization bill, and I believe we are within reach of the solution. \nHowever, I have a concern.\n  The cash management provisions of DoD's Working Capital Funds \ncontains a waiver clause for the Secretary of Defense that is very \nbroad. I am concerned that some in the Department may find this waiver \nauthority too tempting to resist and will use up the outlays intended \nto be left in the cash reserves of the Working Capital Funds. Unless \nthere are truly extraordinary and compelling reasons that are not now \napparent to us, I believe it would be a very serious mistake to use the \navailable waiver authority. Doing so would certainly destroy the \ncooperation and trust that has been built up this year with the Defense \nDepartment and OMB as we worked together to address this outlay \nproblem.\n  Assuming there is no unwarranted use of the waiver authority granted \nin the amendment, I believe we can say we have bridged this problem \nthis year. Next year, I very strongly hope we will receive more \naccurate outlay estimates from those who have in the past tended to \nunderestimate them. It is unacceptable to receive such miscounts of \noutlays and then to be told that for Congress to adopt more accurate \nestimates, the readiness and modernization of our Armed Forces must be \nreduced. I hope this is the last time we are forced to address this \nissue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Momentarily, as acting leader, I will address the Senate.\n  On behalf of Senator Lott, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nInhofe now be recognized to offer an amendment relative to BRAC and \nthere be 30 minutes equally divided for debate tonight. Following that \ndebate, the amendment be laid aside. I further ask that Senator Harkin \nthen be recognized to offer an amendment relative to VA health care, \nand there be 1 hour of debate equally divided for debate tonight, and \nthe amendment then be laid aside.\n  I further ask that, at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, Senator Wellstone be \nrecognized to offer an amendment relative to DOD schools and there be \n30 minutes equally divided; following the conclusion or yielding back \nof time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the amendment, \nwith no amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  I further ask that, following the disposition of the Wellstone \namendment, the Senate resume the Inhofe amendment for 10 minutes of \nclosing remarks, to be equally divided, and the vote then occur on or \nin relation to the Inhofe amendment, with no amendments in order prior \nto the vote.\n  I further ask that, following the vote on or in relation to the \nInhofe amendment, there be 10 minutes of debate on the Harkin \namendment, and the vote then occur on or in relation to the Harkin \namendment, with no amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  Is there any objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I didn't quite hear all \nthat, but there has always been sort of a comity in the Senate where we \nalternate from side to side on amendments. It seems to me the last \ncouple of amendments have been on the other side. It would seem to be \nonly logical that the next amendment be on this side.\n  I ask the Senator if we couldn't do that. I only need about 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the Senator to at least consider that the amendment \nI have to offer is not a Republican\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\namendment. We have just as many Democrats as Republicans. I have been \nwaiting for 6\\1/2\\ hours to take it up. It will be very short. We have \nagreed to a time agreement, and we will not even take that much time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a time agreement also, and I have been waiting all \nday. I will take only about 15 minutes on mine.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have been on the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We usually go back and forth on these things.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if at this point the two Senators could sort \nthis out in such a way that we could proceed tonight. I understand the \nSenator from Arizona also desires some time, 5 minutes on the Inhofe \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we reduce both debates tonight to 20 minutes, that \nmight resolve this problem.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If I can go first, I am agreeable to that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That would put you on until just before 9 o'clock. That \nwould put me up about 9 o'clock. I still don't know why we can't go \nback and forth like we have always done in the past.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have to say to the Senator, I was not in the chair as \nthe manager at the time the agreement was drawn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I want to ask one \nclarification. I understand this unanimous consent would preclude \nsecond-degree amendments at any time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Prior to the vote, that is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. At any time prior to?\n  Mr. WARNER. Any time prior to the vote.\n  Mr. President, I repeat the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have a further announcement for \nSenators. For the information of all Senators, there will be no further \nvotes tonight. Several Members have agreed to remain tonight to debate \nother amendments, and there will be three votes occurring at 10 a.m., \nwith a few minutes debate between the second and third votes.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2981\n\n (Purpose: To modify the restrictions on the general authority of the \nDepartment of Defense regarding the closure and realignment of military \n installations, to express the sense of the Congress on further rounds \n       of such closures and realignments, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself and Mr. \n     Dorgan, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lott, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n     Smith of New Hampshire, Ms. Collins, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n     Sessions, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Conrad and Mr. \n     Cleland, proposes an amendment numbered 2981.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

[W]e are awaiting some supporting documentation from the \n     military services to help us finish assessing the report's \n     information.'';\n       (B) The Congressional Budget Office stated on May 1 that \n     its review is ongoing, and that ``it is important that CBO \n     take the time necessary to provide a thoughtful and accurate \n     evaluation of DoD's report, rather than issue a preliminary \n     and potentially inaccurate assessment.'';\n       (4) The Congressional Budget Office recommended that ``The \n     Congress could consider authorizing an additional round of \n     base closures if the Department of Defense believes that \n     there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of \n     BRAC have been carried out. That consideration, however, \n     should follow an interval during which DoD and independent \n     analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have \n     been taken thus far.''\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that:\n       (1) Congress should not authorize further rounds of base \n     closures and realignments until all actions authorized by the \n     Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 are \n     completed; and\n       (2) The Department of Defense should submit forthwith to \n     the Congress the report required by Section 2815 of Public \n     Law 103-337, analyzing the effects of base closures and \n     realignments on the ability of the Armed Forces to \n     remobilize, describing the military construction projects \n     needed to facilitate such remobilization, and discussing the \n     assets, such as air space, that would be difficult to \n     reacquire in the event of such remobilization.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that the time \non both amendments has now been reduced to 20 minutes.\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I did not agree to that. I am sorry, that \nhad to do with something else. I still reserve the amount of time that \nwas requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the original order, the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, gets 30 minutes, equally divided, and the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin, gets 1 hour, equally divided. That is the \noriginal order.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think I probably will voluntarily cut this down. It \ndepends on who shows up and wants to be heard.\n  Mr. President, as I have said in response to the comment by the \nSenator from Iowa, this is not really a Republican amendment. We have, \ncertainly, Senator Daschle, Senator Dorgan, Senator Cleland, Senator \nConrad, and many Democrats who are supporting this amendment.\n  The need for this amendment came up when several comments were made \nby members of the administration, primarily Acting Secretary Peters of \nthe Air Force, making statements that, ``We don't care whether or not \nwe are authorized to have further BRAC rounds, we are going to go ahead \nand close bases anyway.''\n  Later in this discussion, I will actually offer some of the quotes \nthat were made. Right now, I will merely explain what this amendment \ndoes. It does essentially five things.\n  First of all, the current language, in order for a military facility \nto be closed without Congress' consent, has a threshold of 300 civilian \nemployees. Let me stress, that is civilian employees, not military \nemployees. This bill will reduce that number to 225.\n  Now, my original bill would have reduced it to 150. I still like that \nbetter. However, I was willing to accommodate the concerns of several \nDemocrats and other people who wanted to have 225. The effect of this \nwould mean that if they tried to close a military base, they could not \ndo it without our consent unless that base had more than 225 civilian \nemployees.\n  No. 2, in the event that realignment became the desire of the \nservices--Department of Defense--that they could not do it if there \nwere as many as 750 civilian positions or 40 percent of the total \ncivilians authorized to be employed.\n  The current language has a threshold of 1,000 civilian employees at \n50 percent of the total civilians authorized to be employed. So this \nagain is dropping that down a modest amount, by approximately 25 \npercent.\n  No. 3, we clarify the definition of closure. The reason we feel this \nis necessary is that there have been statements made like, ``We will \njust transfer it to a caretaker status, or a state of inaction or \nabandonment.'' What we are doing is expanding the definition in the law \nof closure to include these statements, so that someone cannot do this \nand circumvent the closure requirements by saying we are not closing, \nwe are just abandoning or putting it into a state of inaction.\n  On this, I pause at this point and say, if you stop and think about \nevery community in America that might have some type of a facility, \nthey would not know, they would not be prepared in advance as to \nwhether or not somebody is going to try to make it inactive or put it \ninto caretaker status. We want to be straightforward and say if you are \ngoing to close it, you are going to close it--using those terms.\n  No. 4, we will add a provision that requires a waiting period of 4 \nyears after a realignment before a base could be closed, if that \nrealignment drops the civilian workforce below the new threshold of 225 \ncivilians. Our concern here is that this can be circumvented and we \ncould be left out of the loop as the U.S. Senate if they were able to \ntake it one step at a time and say, fine, we are going to go ahead and \nrealign, and next week we will come and realign some more and have the \neffect of closing a base entirely, regardless of the number of \nemployees, if they are willing to do that. This would preclude that.\n  Lastly, it is the sense of the Senate that there is no need to \nreauthorize for the year 2001 in this 1998 authorization bill. There is \nno reason in the world that we can't have more time to consider this \nand to see how current law works and maybe address this again in the \n1999 authorization bill. It would not make any difference at all; it \nwould still be the year 2001.\n  These are essentially the changes in the current law that this \namendment would offer.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't have any requests for time on my side.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment sends the wrong message to \nevery single person in the Defense Department. That message is: Do as I \nsay, not as I do. We are telling the Department of Defense to be more \nefficient, to adopt better business practices, to do more with less, to \ngo faster in reshaping the military for the threats of the 21st \ncentury.\n  We are pushing the DOD to have their inventory maintained more \nefficiently, to cut acquisition personnel, cut headquarters personnel, \ncut the number of ships and aircraft and combat troops. But, \napparently, the military forces of the future that some colleagues have \nin mind will cut equipment, people, and supplies, but leave all the \nempty buildings standing to impress people.\n  This amendment tells our soldiers that despite what we say, our real \npriority would be to protect our turf back home, instead of protecting \nthe well-being of our future soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. \nEvery single top uniformed military and civilian military have told us \nthat the reality is that the money we spend maintaining more bases than \nwe need is money that we can't spend buying our troops the things that \nthey do need.\n  You know, it is one thing not to authorize some more BRAC rounds, and \nit is something altogether different to make even an alignment that is \ncurrently possible without BRAC, to make that more difficult. This \namendment takes us in exactly the wrong direction. It will make \nreductions more difficult than they are now.\n  I happen to support BRAC rounds, but that is not the issue here. The \nissue here isn't whether we add a round or two rounds of BRAC, as much \nas that may be necessary in the judgment of some of us; the issue here \nis whether or not we make it more difficult to realign facilities that \nare currently realignable without BRAC. This amendment will make it \nmore difficult.\n  If this amendment is adopted, it is either going to kill this bill, \nor if the President does sign a bill that includes this provision--\nwhich is a very uncertain prospect--it is going to put a very large \nwrench into the Defense Department's gears and bring the Defense \nDepartment's efforts to make its base structure more rational and \nefficient to a grinding halt.\n  The Secretary and Deputy Secretary are trying to move the Defense \nDepartment into the 21st century. This amendment is trying to set the \nDefense Department in concrete.\n  This is what Secretary Cohen wrote to Chairman Thurmond and me on \nJune 22:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the Department \n     of Defense's strong opposition to an amendment to the fiscal \n     year 1999 Defense Authorization Bill that has been proposed \n     by Senators Inhofe and Dorgan. If enacted, this amendment \n     would further restrict the Department's already limited \n     ability to adjust the size and composition of its base \n     structure. The Department will have views on other provisions \n     in the Authorization Bill as well, but I want to draw your \n     attention to this particular amendment before the Senate \n     completes consideration of your bill.\n       The Department can undertake closures and realignments only \n     after first complying with the requirements of 10 USC 2687. \n     As a practical matter, section 2687 greatly restricts the \n     Department for taking any action to reduce base capacity at \n     installations with more than 300 civilians authorized. The \n     amendment being proposed would extend the application of \n     section 2687 to an even greater number of installations.\n       This proposal would seriously undermine my capacity to \n     manage the Department of Defense. Even after eight years of \n     serious attention to the problem, we still have more \n     infrastructure than we need to support our forces. Operating \n     and maintaining a base structure that is larger than \n     necessary has broad, adverse consequences for our military \n     forces. It diverts resources that are critical\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\n     to maintaining readiness and funding a robust modernization \n     program. It spreads a limited amount of operation and \n     maintenance funding too thinly across DoD's facilities, \n     degrading the quality of life and operational support on \n     which readiness depends. It prevents us from adapting our \n     infrastructure to keep pace with the operational and \n     technical innovations that are at the cornerstone of our \n     strategy for the 21st century. In short, this amendment would \n     be a step backward that would harm our long-term security by \n     protecting unnecessary infrastructure.\n       I urge you to oppose the Inhofe/Dorgan amendment during \n     floor consideration of the Authorization Bill. Its passage \n     would put the entire bill at risk. Congress has given me the \n     responsibility to organize and manage the Department's \n     operations efficiently. I need to preserve my existing \n     authority to fulfill that responsibility.\n\n  Mr. President, I think all of us who are on the Armed Services \nCommittee--including my friend who is proposing this amendment--are \nvery sensitive to that question. We want an authorization bill, we want \nto get an authorization bill to the President, and we want him to sign \nan authorization bill. The Secretary of Defense is telling us in this \nletter, in his words, that passage of this amendment would ``put the \nentire bill at risk.''\n  There are many ways in which this amendment would make it more \ndifficult for the Defense Department to realign bases that are \ncurrently realignable. It does that by changing, reducing the number of \ncivilians at a base that would require notification to Congress, or \nwould require realignment action by a base closing commission. This \namendment lowers the threshold for any base with 300 people to a base \nwith 225 civilians. Even though the current definition of 300 captures \nall of our major installations, this amendment would go deeper. This \namendment would make it more difficult for the Secretary of Defense to \nmake the kind of efficiencies that we are demanding everywhere else in \nthe defense budget.\n  So I hope this amendment will be rejected. It is a step in the wrong \ndirection. If we don't have what, in my judgment, is the courage to \nadopt an additional round or two rounds of BRAC--of Base Closing \nCommission--with the power to make a recommendation to us and the \nPresident, and a certainty that that would be voted on--if we don't \nhave the courage to do that because it will put at risk facilities in \neach of our States, for heaven's sake, we should not go backwards, dig \nourselves into a deeper hole, require lesser efficiencies instead of \ngreater efficiencies. We should not set the Department of Defense in \ndeeper concrete, thicker concrete than it already is in. So I hope that \nthis amendment will be rejected.\n  I thank our colleague, Senator Inhofe, for a number of things.\n  One is his willingness to raise this amendment tonight, even though \nit means there will be less time tomorrow for us to debate this \namendment. His willingness to offer this amendment tonight is very \ncourteous to all of us who are trying to move this bill. I thank him \nfor that courtesy, and many other courtesies which he has extended.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from Michigan. It has been a very \nhelpful step to enable us to keep moving here tonight.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee \nexpressed its views regarding base closure when it voted 10 to 8 \nagainst an amendment that would have authorized additional base closure \nrounds. I fully support that decision although I have an open mind on \nfuture legislation, especially if the Administration makes a better \ncase for additional rounds and the rounds are scheduled after the \ncurrent base closure activities are completed.\n  In regard to the amendment before us, I believe it will have little \nif any impact on whether or not we will close additional bases. The \namendment is in reaction to the Department's threat to close bases by \nattriting personnel below the 300 threshold set by section 2687 of \ntitle 10. While I do not believe that this is an idle threat, reducing \nthe threshold to 225 personnel will have little or no impact.\n  To close or realign bases under section 2687, the Department of \nDefense must notify Congress as part of its request for authorization \nof appropriations and must provide the Congress an evaluation of \nfiscal, local economic, budgetary, environmental, strategic, and \noperational consequences of proposed closures and realignments. One of \nthe most important drawbacks to the section 2687 process is the \nrequirement to complete a full environmental study under the provisions \nof the National Environmental Policy Act before a closure or \nrealignment decision is made and sent to Congress. While such studies \nare under way, usually for a period of 12 to 18 months, litigation is \nlikely to arise, effectively derailing the proposed closure and \nrealignment. Additionally, individual actions can be thwarted by \nwithholding the appropriation of funds to execute a closure or \nrealignment. Section 2687 has effectively prevented DoD from reducing \nits infrastructure through closures or realignments at any of its \nsignificant facilities.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is unnecessary and I urge the Senate \nto reject the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the BENS Tail-to-Tooth Commission, and a letter from \nTaxpayers for Common Sense.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Bens Tail-To-Tooth Commission,\n\n                                                    June 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thurmond: We are writing to express our strong \n     opposition to the Dorgan-Inhofe Amendment to the FY1999 \n     Defense Authorization bill. This amendment severely hampers \n     the Pentagon's ability to rationally manage its military \n     bases and personnel.\n       As members of the BENS Tail-to-Tooth Commission, we all \n     share a commitment to reforming the Department of Defense so \n     that we can invest savings in new procurement and enhancing \n     the readiness of our military forces. the Senate is on record \n     in support of these goals; yet, the Dorgan-Inhofe amendment \n     moves us in the opposite direction. By locking in the status \n     quo, this proposal prevents the Pentagon from making rational \n     business decision that will save money, and most importantly, \n     improve the support provided to service members.\n       Under this plan, the Pentagon is required to prepare costly \n     and time consuming impact statements when it proposes to move \n     as few as ten civilian employees. It also provides unfair \n     protection to numerous facilities that would be declared off \n     limits should be the Base Closure and Realignment Commission \n     be authorized in the future.\n       Passage of the Dorgan-Inhofe amendment would be a major \n     blow to the cause of smart management. the cost to taxpayers, \n     and most important, to the troops will be significant. We \n     urge you to oppose this ill-conceived proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n         Admiral Stanley R. Arthur, USN (Ret.); Mr. Raphael \n           Benaroya; Mr. Denis A. Bovin; the Honorable Howard H. \n           Callaway; the Honorable Frank C. Carlucci; Ms. Maryles \n           V. Casto; Mr. Michael S. Fields; the Honorable Sidney \n           Harman; Dr. Anita K. Jones; the Honorable James R. \n           Jones; Mr. James V. Kimsey; Admiral Wesley McDonald, \n           USN (Ret.); Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, USAF (Ret.); Ms. \n           Ann McLaughlin; General Merrill A. McPeak, USAF (Ret.); \n           General Thomas Moorman, USAF (Ret.); Mr. John P. \n           Morgridge; Mr. William F. Murdy; Admiral William A. \n           Owens, USN (Ret.); the Honorable William J. Perry; Mr. \n           William J. Rouhana, Jr.; Admiral William D. Smith, USN \n           (Ret.); General Gordon R. Sullivan, USA (Ret.) and Mr. \n           Josh S. Weston.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n   oppose dorgan/inhofe amendment to make it harder to realign small \n                             military bases\n\n       Dear Senator: When the Senate considers S. 2057, the Fiscal \n     Year 1999 Defense Authorization Bill, we urge you to vote \n     against the Dorgan/Inhofe Amendment, which would make it more \n     difficult to realign and consolidate small military \n     installations. The amendment would require Department of \n     Defense (DoD) to waste money that could otherwise be used to \n     reduce overall defense spending or pay for improved readiness \n     or weapons procurement. The amendment would be a disservice \n     to both taxpayers and soldiers.\n       Currently, the law restricts DoD's ability to close bases \n     that have authorizations for 300 or more civilians. The law \n     also restricts realignments at installations with over 300 \n     civilians authorized when the realignment involves the \n     reduction or relocation of more than fifty percent of \n     civilians authorized. The amendment expands the scope of the \n     restrictions by decreasing the 300 person threshold to 225 \n     and restricting realignments\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\n     at all installations if such action affects 40 percent or \n     more of the civilians authorized.\n       To illustrate, an installation as few as ten civilians \n     could not realign more than three employee positions without: \n     (1) notifying Congress of the proposed action as part of \n     DoD's request for defense authorizations; (2) providing \n     Congress with an evaluation of the fiscal, local economic, \n     budgetary and environmental impact, strategic, and \n     operational consequences of proposed closures and \n     realignments; (3) conducting a full environmental study \n     before the proposal is sent to Congress; and (4) then waiting \n     30 legislative days or 60 calendar after notifying Congress \n     before executing the realignment.\n       There is no need to compel the DoD to maintain Cold War \n     infrastructures now that the Cold War has ended. The proposed \n     amendment would make it all but impossible for the DoD to \n     reorganize, consolidate, or close unnecessary small bases. \n     Every excessive base, airfield, depot and station undermines \n     U.S. national security and wastes taxpayer money. We urge you \n     to allow DoD to retain one of the tools it needs to provide \n     the American people with the best possible defense our tax \n     dollars can buy. Vote ``NO'' to the Dorgan/Inhofe Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ralph DeGennaro,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have a few comments.\n  Ironically, I was the author of the last base closure legislation. I \nsaw right here just a day or so ago Senator Dixon of Illinois. He was \nmy other principal author of that resolution.\n  I think it is absolutely essential that the United States reduce its \ninfrastructure and enable the Secretary today and the Secretaries of \nDefense thereafter to husband those funds from the reduction as best \nthey can and channel those needed dollars into readiness and \nmodernization, and all types of things that have a much, much higher \npriority than so much of the excess that we now have in the military \nstructure.\n  The last time we considered this BRAC concept in the committee, I \nvoted against it simply because I was so disheartened by some of the \nprocedures with regard to certain bases in California, and then \nsubsequent revelation of letters from an individual in the Secretary of \nDefense's Office which clearly indicated to me a certain bias.\n  We just have to get politics out of this process someday. I am not \nsure when that will be. But as soon as we can come up with some system \nwhich guarantees elimination of politics, then you can count on the \nSenator from Virginia supporting the BRAC process going forward. In the \nmeantime, I register my opposition against my good friend and fellow \nMember.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to clarify the time of the minority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan controls 5 minutes \n45 seconds. The Senator from Oklahoma has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield that 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was looking at the amendment. I find it \nto be very interesting.\n  First of all, there is a very strongly worded letter from the \nSecretary of Defense:\n\n       Congress has given me the responsibility to organize and \n     manage the Department's operations efficiently. I need to \n     preserve my existing authority to fulfill that \n     responsibility.\n\n  I think Secretary Cohen's words are very important. We should keep \nthem in mind.\n  Mr. President, I was looking at this amendment. There is a \nprohibition, and there is a sense-of-the-Senate part of the prohibition \nwhich says, ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no action may \nbe taken, and no funds appropriated, or otherwise available to the \nDepartment of Defense, may be obligated or expended to effect, or \nimplement, the closure of a military installation within 4 years after \nthe completion of a realignment of the installation.''\n  That alone--``. . . or with other causes, reduce the number of \ncivilian personnel employed at that installation below 225.''\n  I find that an astonishing clause. First of all, civilian employment \nseems to be the case here. Second of all, 4 years?\n  Suppose you had an installation--I ask the Senator from Oklahoma--\nthat had 230 civilian employees, and a contract at the base at the \nPentagon was canceled, therefore negating the need for the civilian \nworkers, and reduce them by 6, down from 230, down to 224. Nothing can \nbe done by the Secretary of Defense for 4 years? This is a very unusual \nrestraint that we are attempting to impart on the Secretary of Defense.\n  Second of all, on the sort of findings here, there is one finding \nthat should be leading of all in this; that is, base closures save \nmoney. That is something that we seem to avoid in this debate--that \nfact. If base closures didn't save money, Mr. President, we made a \nhorrible mistake at the end of World War II. Do you know? We made a \nterrible mistake at the end of World War II, because there were \nthousands of bases around America. Do you know what? We closed them. I \ncan't imagine how much that must have cost the taxpayer in order to \nclose those thousands of bases.\n  I sit here and listen to arguments that closing bases costs money. Of \ncourse it costs money in the short term. You are cleaning up an \ninstallation. But everybody knows that in the long term it saves money. \nAnd, unless we do so, you cannot hope to fund the modernization of the \nforce and all of the other requirements that we need to meet the \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Defense estimates that they need to \nclose about 50 major facilities and realign 25 others. That is so they \ncan match infrastructure to force size and structure.\n  I hear many, many hours of debate on the base closing issue, but I \ndon't hear the debate that I think is necessary on the floor of the \nSenate in order to maintain our national defense capability--the \noverall question. We are spending less and less on defense. We are \nputting more money into pork barrel projects, and we are allowing a \nbase to close. The ultimate result is that you reduce the capability of \nthe military force.\n\n  Not only did we turn back in committee. I was sorry that the Senator \nfrom Virginia chose to vote against the amendment in committee. Not \nonly did we vote in committee against any base closing round anytime in \nthe near future, but now we are going to restrict even the ability of \nthe Secretary of Defense to move people around from one base to another \nin keeping with the changing mission.\n  I, frankly, first of all, don't understand the argument that somehow \nclosing bases doesn't save money. As I say, if we did, we made a \nterrible mistake after World War II and after the Korean war and after \nthe Vietnam war.\n  The other thing I don't understand is how we can worry about the \nCongressional Budget Office. The May 1 review is ongoing, and it is for \nthe Congressional Budget Office to take the time necessary to provide a \nthoughtful and accurate evaluation of DOD's report rather than issue a \npreliminary and potentially inaccurate assessment.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, in a remarkable act of courage, says \nthe Congressional Budget Office recommended the Congress could consider \nauthorizing an additional round of base closing if the Department of \nDefense believes there is a surplus of military capacity.\n  Is there anybody who thinks that the Department of Defense doesn't \nbelieve there is a surplus of military capacity? After all, BRAC rounds \nhave been carried out. This consideration, however, should follow an \ninterval during which DOD and independent analysts examine the actual \nimpact of the measures that have been taken thus far.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the amendment.\n  I ask for an additional minute from the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is out of time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope someday that we will address the \nissues on this floor--like 11,100 military families on food stamps, \nlike men and women who are leaving the military in droves because they \ndo not have the equipment to fight with and operate with, like the \nincredible long deployments that we are sending these\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nmen and women on, like the fact that we are not prepared to meet the \npost-cold-war challenges in any reasonable and responsible way. \nInstead, we seem to spend our time arguing and fighting over a base \nclosing. I think, frankly, it is something we ought to get resolved and \nbehind us. If we never want to close a base, let's do that. But let's \nnot go through this every single year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I have so much respect for \nboth the Senator from Arizona and the Senators from Michigan and \nVirginia. I have to say, I am sure the Senator from Arizona would agree \nthat there is no stronger proponent for a strong national defense than \nI am. We work hard.\n  One of the big problems I have is that we need to look at the overall \npicture. All this talk about base closings is important. I support base \nclosures. I made it very clear that we have time on this. If we do not \nhave base closures until the year 2001, there is no reason to be \naddressing base closures in this bill.\n  Certainly--I also respond to the Senator from Arizona--what he \nreferred to was a sense-of-the-Senate portion of this bill. It says, \n``Notwithstanding any other provision of the law,'' no action would be \ntaken, and no funds appropriated, and so forth, as you read.\n  However, if we should authorize another BRAC process, that would have \nprecedence over this and this would not be in effect.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from Washington has a request \nfor a couple, 3 minutes and I would like to yield to him, and then I \nwill respond to the rest of the comments that have been made.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do not believe that there has been any \nmore successful and imaginative policy with respect to our military \npreparedness than the three base-closing rounds that were created by a \nlaw imagined by the now majority leader of the House of \nRepresentatives, a major contribution to a rational system--at least, \nMr. President, a rational system until the last base closure round \nwhen, in spite of the fact that everyone felt that this issue had been \ntaken out of politics, the President of the United States poisoned the \nwell by totally politicizing the base-closure process.\n  The Senator from Virginia, I think, wisely voted against another \nbase-closure process presided over by this President. I agreed with \nthat proposition on the basis that once again it would become a part of \nthe Presidential campaign in the year 2000, and I will not vote for \nanother such process until we can be guaranteed that we will take it \nout of politics.\n  I am going to vote for the amendment from the Senator from Oklahoma \nperhaps for the same reason that the Senator from Virginia is going to \nvote against it. I am going to vote to emphasize even more forcefully \nthat he has my bitter disappointment in the way in which this important \nprocess was politicized. And I think we need to send a message, yes, \neven to the Department of Defense that we will not permit that kind of \nthing to happen in the future. And this, it seems to me, is a pretty \ngood way to send that message.\n  I wish I could have voted this year for another base-closing round. I \ncannot because of what happened during the course of the last \nPresidential election, and I will support the Senator from Oklahoma \nbecause I think he makes that point even more forcefully.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Washington. I would like to \ninquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma controls 6 minutes \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me clarify something. I \ndo support the process. It happens that I was elected to the other body \nin 1986, and that is when Representative Dick Armey from the State of \nTexas came out with the whole idea that we have got to close down some \nof the infrastructure that is no longer needed. We understand that. But \nwe can't do it because of the politics that are there.\n  So he devised a system, and that system was devised to take the \npolitics out of it, and it worked. If there were time, I would read the \nstatement he made on the floor of the House of Representatives when he \nfound out he had to do something that was bad for his State of Texas, \nand he was willing to do it to save the system, the integrity of the \nsystem that was designed to take politics out of it.\n  Now, as the Senator from Washington said, politics were reinserted, \nand when that happened I think several of us felt we had to ensure that \ndid not happen again. And so some of the people, wisely perhaps, said \nthat, well, we can do that by waiting until after this President is no \nlonger in office, 2001.\n\n  My concern there is I don't know who is going to be the Republican \nnominee or who is going to be the Democratic nominee or who will \nultimately be the next President of the United States. But if that \nPresident should be inclined to do so, it would be a tremendous \ntemptation for him to use the same politics that President Clinton \nused, because if he doesn't do it, he is not using the full force of \nhis office. That is a precedent that has been set. We are trying to \nstop that now.\n  I would like to respond to the distinguished Senator from Michigan. \nHe made the statement about money being saved. I have supported every \neffort to increase our defense spending. For 15 consecutive years now \nwe have actually reduced defense spending when many people a lot \nsmarter than I am agreed with the statement that I have made when I \nsaid that I feel the threat that is facing America is greater today \nthan it was even during the cold war because of the nonpredictability, \nthe unpredictability of the threat that is out there, the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction, the fact there are missiles out there \nright now that can reach all the way to any city in the United States \nof America. And it has been recently disclosed by some newspapers that \nthere are, in fact, some missiles, some CSS-4 missiles in China that \nare targeted at the United States.\n  Now, I anticipate the President will come back and say, I \naccomplished the retargeting of these things. However, if you remember \nthe Anthony Lake hearings, we documented the fact that retargeting can \ntake place in as short as 3 minutes.\n  So anyway, I would say this as far as money being saved by base \nclosures. It is bleeding right now. We need to have as much money right \nnow in order to try to help our defense system survive. Modernization, \nforce strength, quality of life, all of these we are having very \nserious problems with. We have the lowest retention rate right now we \nhave had in the history of some of the services, including the Air \nForce. It costs $6 million to put someone in the seat of an F-16 and \nyet we are losing the pilots. I heard an unofficial report today it is \nnot a retention of 25 percent. It is now down below 20 percent. That is \nvery serious.\n  But let's look at where we can really fund the services. The first \nthing I would do, if I were responding to the Senator from Michigan, is \nget us out of Bosnia. Right now, that was supposed to cost us some $1.2 \nbillion. Now it is over $9 billion direct, and I suggest about twice \nthat much money in reality.\n  I would also comment that as far as Senator Cohen's statement that \nthis might draw a veto, I find it very difficult to believe that a bill \nthat is supported by the number of Democrats that are supporting this \nbill, including the minority leader, Tom Daschle, is going to draw a \nveto. This is a threat that is always there. And I would also comment \nthat Secretary Cohen, when he was Senator Cohen, would have been right \nup here with me supporting this amendment. And if anyone questions \nthat, I can document that.\n  Thirdly, when you talk about the courage to do a BRAC, yes, we need \nto do it. We have to first protect the integrity of the system. That is \nwhat the Senator from Washington is saying, and that is exactly what I \nwant to do. I want to reduce more infrastructure. I made that \nstatement. I have said that we need to do it professionally and it \nneeds to be done out of politics.\n  Lastly, when the Senator from Virginia talked about taking politics \nout of the process, I really think the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia gave a pretty good argument for my amendment. So I understand \nthat tomorrow\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\nwe are going to have--my time has expired, but we are going to have 10 \nminutes equally divided. Senator Dorgan and some other Senators who are \nnot here tonight have asked to have that time, which I will yield to \nthem tomorrow.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that concludes the number of \nspeakers who desire to address this amendment. I would simply close by \nsaying that I take very seriously the letter by our distinguished \nformer colleague, the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, and I put my \nbottom dollar on his integrity to see that this process would work \nwithout politics. I really do. I feel strongly about that. So for that \nreason I strongly oppose the amendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think we go to our distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Inhofe amendment \n2981 is set aside until tomorrow.\n  Mr. WARNER. Set aside pursuant to the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the order.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And the Senator from Iowa is recognized to \npresent an amendment upon which there is 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2982\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize a transfer of funds from the Department of \n    Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs for health care.)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk. I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 2982.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . TRANSFER TO DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) Transfer Required.--The Secretary of Defense is \n     authorized to transfer to the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     $329,000,000 of the amounts appropriated for the Department \n     of Defense pursuant to the authorizations of appropriations \n     in this Act. In the case of any such transfer, the Secretary \n     shall select the funds for transfer, and shall transfer the \n     funds, in a manner that causes the least significant harm to \n     the readiness of the Armed Forces and the quality of life of \n     military personnel and their families.\n       (b) Use of Transferred Funds.--Funds transferred pursuant \n     to subsection (a) shall be available for health care programs \n     of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of colleagues, I do not \nintend to take anywhere near a half hour on this on my side, and \nhopefully will yield back a lot of time so we can get out of here at an \nearly hour.\n  This amendment, pure and simple, is to take some money from the \nDepartment of Defense and put it into the medical account of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. This amendment would transfer $329 \nmillion specifically from the Department of Defense budget to the \nmedical accounts of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Let me be clear \nthat what this amendment will do will not increase the amount of money, \nreally, going to veterans' medical accounts. It will just keep it level \nin accordance with medical inflation.\n  Budgets are about priorities. Tight restrictions on discretionary \nspending over the past several years, and spending caps created last \nyear to balance the budget, have forced some tough choices to be made. \nBut I ask my colleagues, what greater priority can there be than to \ntake care of those who have defended the very right of our country to \nexist? Our veterans have fulfilled the duty they had to serve their \ncountry. Now it is up to this Congress to fulfill our duty, our \nobligation, our solemn promise to provide for our veterans.\n  The needs of our veterans are clear. The aging veteran population, \nrising personnel costs and medical inflation, means that each dollar \nprovided for veterans' health care benefits cannot be stretched as far \nas it used to be. The 5-year budget plan assumed no increases for the \ndiscretionary spending of Veterans Affairs. Let me say that again. The \n5-year budget plan assumed no increases for VA discretionary spending; \nin other words, no taking into account the cost of inflation, and \nespecially medical inflation. The well-being of our veterans must not \nbe subject to second-class status. Veterans' funding deserves to be \nconsidered as more than just an afterthought.\n  My amendment is supported by many veterans and veterans groups. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters of support for my amendment from the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, Incorporated; the Blinded Veterans Association and the \nParalyzed Veterans of America.\n\n\n                            Vietnam Veterans of America, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1998.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of Vietnam Veterans of \n     America (VVA) I want to convey our appreciation and support \n     for your proposed amendment to S. 1812, the FY 1999 National \n     Defense Authorization Act, aiming to transfer resources from \n     the Department of Defense (DOD) to the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) to supplement the medical care budget. VVA has \n     long held the principle belief that the health care and \n     benefits needs of veterans are an ongoing cost of our \n     nation's defense. Your amendment will carry forward with \n     assurance of the Nation's commitment to veterans military \n     service related health care needs.\n       VA medical care, as you know, has been plagued by resource \n     limitations for many years and is currently facing flatline \n     budgets for the next several years. The financial wringer has \n     already squeezed out any opportunities to achieve greater \n     efficiencies. Despite promises from Congress and the \n     Administration to the contrary, the ultimate effect is more \n     restrictive access to medical care because of fewer \n     appropriated dollars. Fewer dollars means fewer veterans will \n     be served, pure and simple. The amendment you are offering \n     would help to counter the effects of increasing medical \n     inflation and personnel costs. Without these additional \n     funds, the only possible effect is denial of services to \n     veterans, many of whom are disabled due to their military \n     service.\n       Some of your colleagues have argued that attrition of the \n     veterans population through deaths of World War II veterans \n     is an indication that VA needs less money to operate. \n     However, this narrow perspective fails to take into account \n     the rising costs of medical care and more importantly the \n     current demographics of the veteran populations; VA health \n     care users are older and sicker than the overall American \n     public. Vietnam veterans now represent the largest group \n     within the veterans population. Many of the Vietnam veterans \n     and a growing population of Persian Gulf War veterans have \n     complex problems relating to herbicide, chemical and other \n     environmental exposures.\n       VVA strongly believes that Congress must commit an adequate \n     annual appropriations to VA medical care programs. Your \n     amendment is a very positive recognition of the current \n     circumstances and needs of America's veterans. Thank you for \n     your initiative to attempt redistributing some DOD funds \n     toward VA medical care.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Kelli Willard West,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Blinded Veterans Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the Blinded Veterans \n     Association (BVA) I am writing to support your proposed \n     amendment to S. 1812, the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1999. This amendment would transfer resources \n     from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) for medical care for veterans.\n       VA medical care is facing a crisis, resulting from the \n     provision of inadequate resources. Appropriations for VA \n     medical care are proposed to be frozen. The Administration's \n     FY 1999 budget for VA medical care requests fewer \n     appropriated dollars, and fewer resources. The amendment that \n     you are offering, along with Senator Wellstone, would provide \n     much needed additional resources, to help counter increases \n     attributable to rising personnel costs and medical inflation. \n     Without these additional dollars, these increases would have \n     to be made up from dollars targeted for the health care needs \n     of veterans.\n       The VA Health Care System has already been peared to the \n     bone and we doubt there are any more efficiencies that can be \n     realized to offset inadequate resources. VA Under Secretary \n     for Health, Dr. Kenneth Kizer has recently acknowledged that \n     without additional resources the VA Health Care System could \n     soon ``hit the wall.'' We must maintain this Nation's \n     commitment to veterans, and your amendment is an important \n     step forward in keeping this commitment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Elizabeth R. Carr,\n                                           BVA National President.\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                Paralyzed Veterans of America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 1998.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America (PVA) I am writing to support your proposed amendment \n     to S. 1812, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1999, which would transfer resources from the Department \n     of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for \n     medical care for veterans.\n       VA medical care is facing a crisis, a crisis resulting from \n     the provision of inadequate resources. Appropriations for VA \n     medical care are proposed to be frozen. Indeed, the \n     Administration's FY 1999 budget for VA medical care requests \n     fewer appropriated dollars, and fewer resources. The \n     amendment that you are offering, along with Senator \n     Wellstone, would provide much-needed additional resources, \n     resources to help counter increases attributable to rising \n     personnel costs and medical inflation. Without these \n     additional dollars, these increases would have to be made up \n     from dollars targeted for the health care needs of veterans.\n       The VA health care system has already been pared to the \n     bone and we doubt there are any more efficiencies that can be \n     realized to offset inadequate resources. VA Under Secretary \n     for Health Dr. Kenneth Kizer has recently acknowledged that \n     without additional resources the VA health care system could \n     soon ``hit the wall.'' Unfortunately, when the system does \n     hit the wall sick and disabled veterans will feel the effect \n     of the collision. We must maintain this Nation's commitment \n     to veterans, and your amendment is a step forward in keeping \n     this commitment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth C. Huber,\n                                               National President.\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I might just quote here from the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica:\n\n       VVA has long held the principle belief that the health care \n     and benefits needs of veterans are an ongoing cost of our \n     Nation's defense.\n\n  I think that is the problem around here. We have a defense budget, \nthen we have a veterans' affairs budget--as if somehow they are \nseparate and distinct and have no connection with one another. I think \nthis sentence really says it clearly:\n\n       . . .the benefits needs of veterans are an ongoing cost of \n     our nation's defense.\n\n  We cannot separate the two.\n\n       Your amendment will carry forward with assurance of the \n     Nation's commitment to veterans' military service-related \n     health care needs.\n\n  The letter from the Vietnam Veterans of America, Incorporated, goes \non and says:\n\n       Some of your colleagues have argued that attrition of the \n     veterans population through deaths of World War II veterans \n     is an indication that VA needs less money to operate. \n     However, this narrow perspective fails to take into account \n     the rising costs of medical care, and more importantly, the \n     current demographics of the veterans population. VA health \n     care users are older and sicker than the overall American \n     public. Vietnam veterans now represent the largest group \n     within the veterans population. Many of the Vietnam veterans \n     and a growing population of Persian Gulf war veterans have \n     complex problems relating to herbicide, chemical and other \n     environmental exposures.\n       VVA strongly believes that Congress must commit an adequate \n     annual appropriations to VA medical care programs. Your \n     amendment is a very positive recognition of the current \n     circumstances and needs of America's veterans. Thank you for \n     your initiative to attempt redistributing some DOD funds \n     towards VA medical care.\n       Sincerely, Kelly Willard West, Director of Government \n     Relations.\n\n  The same thing basically follows through on the Blinded Veterans \nAssociation and the Paralyzed Veterans Association of America. The \nBlinded Veterans Association says:\n\n       The VA health care system has already been pared to the \n     bone, and we doubt there are any more efficiencies that can \n     be realized to offset inadequate resources.\n\n  Fewer dollars means fewer veterans will be served, pure and simple, \nand that is the truth. Fewer dollars means fewer veterans will be \nserved.\n  Let me just, right now, refer to this chart for those who think that \nmay be taking $329 million out of a $271 billion defense budget--think \nabout that, $271 billion, and all we are asking for is $329 million, \njust to get veterans' health care benefits up to meet inflationary \nneeds. If you look at this chart, it shows you how much we are spending \non military of our discretionary budget. If you look at our \ndiscretionary spending, military consumes half of it. Half of all that \nwe spend in this Congress goes to military spending--half, 50 cents out \nof every dollar. Out of the other 50 cents, we take agriculture and \nenergy and Social Security, economic development, transportation, \nscience and space, housing, foreign affairs, foreign aid, health, \njustice, education. We hear all this debate that we are spending too \nmuch on education--6 cents out of every dollar; 6 cents for education, \n50 cents for military spending.\n  We are not talking about all these, we are talking about veterans' \nbenefits. Out of this $1 that we spend here every year, how much goes \nfor veterans' benefits? 3\\1/2\\ pennies--3\\1/2\\ pennies, to meet the \nmedical needs of those who risked life and limb to preserve and protect \nand defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  I think that we can do a little bit better than 3\\1/2\\ pennies. I \nthink the amendment we are offering brings that to just a little under \n4 pennies, if I am not mistaken. Is that too much to ask? It is not too \nmuch to ask when we are taking 50 cents out for defense. I think the \nVietnam Veterans of America had it right. We should not separate \nveterans' benefits out of defense. It is part of the ongoing costs of \nthe defense of this country, and we should not separate the two out.\n  I believe we are meeting our commitments globally. I take a back seat \nto no one in saying that we are the world's most powerful nation, that \nwe have a lot of commitments globally, that we have to meet those \ncommitments. We are meeting those commitments and we will continue to \nmeet them. And taking $329 million out of the defense budget is not \ngoing to harm that one little bit. But what will harm us, if we do not \nmeet this commitment, is that many of our veterans, our Vietnam \nveterans, now today many of our Korean war veterans and even some of \nour World War II veterans, they are getting older--they are living \nlonger, just as the demographics of our country are--they are living \nlonger; they are sicker. There are leftover problems that they have \nthat maybe were not indicated when they were in the military, such as \nherbicide and chemical poisoning and things like that, that now later \non they are suffering from.\n  What happens if we do not meet their medical needs? Aside from the \npersonal suffering and the personal hardship that they and their \nfamilies have to undergo, what happens is that younger people in their \nfamilies and their friends look upon them and they say, ``Wait a \nminute. Here is someone who went to the Persian Gulf. Here is a veteran \nwho fought in Vietnam. Maybe here is someone who was in Korea, and yet \nthey are not being cared for? A lot of the funding has to come out of \ntheir own pockets to meet their medical needs?''\n  I would imagine a lot of younger people would say: Why would I ever \nwant to go in the military? If we promised to meet their health care \nneeds and later on we don't live up to that obligation, what does that \nsay to our younger people who we want to enlist and become active duty \nmembers of our armed services?\n  I think our lack of spending adequate resources to keep up with at \nleast inflation in veterans' health care benefits has a deleterious \neffect on the security of our Nation. I see this amendment as not just \nsomething helping the veterans and meeting the obligation that we have \nto our present-day veterans, but I see this amendment as really meeting \nthe future security needs of our country by saying to those who come \nalong next, who may be asked to go to some other place in the world to \ndefend this country, to defend our vital national interest, it says to \nthem, ``When you are in that position, we're going to meet your \nobligations, too.''\n  I just feel very strongly that this is something that we have to do \nas a society. I am not trying to goldplate anything. I am not trying to \nboost veterans' medical benefits' spending way pie high in the sky. I \nam simply saying at least we ought to keep up with inflation. We do \nthat here. We kept up with inflation in energy and agriculture, \nnational affairs, justice, education--we keep up basically with \ninflation. Why shouldn't we do this for our veterans, also?\n  As the Independent Budget Project of the veterans' groups have \npointed out, tens of thousands of Americans who now stand in harm's way \nin Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, and other troubled spots\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\naround the world will be the veterans of tomorrow. It is worth noting \nthat the veterans suffering from the complicated gulf war illnesses may \nend up being a greater financial strain on the system in the future. \nWhat are we going to say to them? Tough luck?\n  In other words, Mr. President, the demand for VA health care will not \ndiminish in the foreseeable future. Just because there are fewer people \ndoesn't mean we can spend fewer dollars. They are living longer, they \nare getting older, and they are sicker, and a lot of the illnesses they \ncontracted haven't shown up. We can't just wish it away.\n  All we are asking is to provide the resources to meet the demand that \nis there. That is what this amendment does. I urge its adoption as the \nfair and equitable and the right thing for our country to do for the \nveterans who fought in World War II, Korea, the Persian Gulf, Vietnam \nand, yes, in Bosnia, too, and for those younger people who are going to \nbe the veterans of tomorrow, we have to meet this obligation.\n  I will point out, I offered this amendment last year, and I didn't \nhave all of the figures down--we do this year--keeping up with \ninflation. This amendment received 41 votes last year on a bipartisan \nbasis. It is less money this year. We are actually asking for less \nmoney this year just to keep up with inflation. I am hopeful Senators \non both sides can see fit to meet the obligation to our veterans.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is not easy to get up and first say to \nmy good friend, who is a veteran, a naval aviator--he achieved \ndistinction in the Navy which I never achieved. I was a simple \nradioman, but anyway, I sat in the backseat of some of those planes you \nflew around in on occasion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, you were my boss at one time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I realize that. I am very humble about my small \ncontribution to national security at the tail end of World War II and \nin Korea. But I was privileged, like so many others, to serve. My \ncontribution was modest. The military did far more good for me than I \nwas able to do in return. Therefore, throughout my career in the \nSenate, I have tried to look after the men and women in the Armed \nForces and, indeed, the veterans, because I find as we grow a little \nolder, we have friends who depart on a regular basis.\n\n  There are some 300,000 men and women who served in World War II who \nconsistently die every month now. It is an alarming fact, considering. \nI would like to ask my good friend a question or two. I studied the \namendment. Your first version of the amendment says:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall transfer to the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs $329 million.\n\n  The one that is before the Senate at this time appears to have been \nchanged:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense is authorized to transfer to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs $329 million.\n\n  I am curious as to one of the reasons the Senator changed from a \nclear statement that it would be shifted as a budget matter, to where \nit now----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was informed--if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. By using that former language, a point of order would \nhave laid against the amendment. To avoid the point of order and, quite \nfrankly, in all legitimacy, since this is an authorizing bill, it \nreally ought to be authorizing language, too.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I read the amendment which is now before the Senate, \nand again I will read--``* * * the Secretary of Defense is authorized \nto transfer * * *''--you are leaving it entirely a discretionary matter \nwith the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is a colloquy. I am delighted to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right. It would be to the Secretary. \nHowever, I think the Secretary would look at how the Senate spoke and \nhow the Congress spoke on this to decide what to do. Obviously, if the \nSenate voted to do this and it was a strong vote, then I think he would \npay attention to it, he or she would pay attention to this.\n  Mr. WARNER. We place the Secretary, one of our very own for whom we \nhave the absolute highest respect, in an awkward position that now \nthese groups will petition him, and he is faced with the tough choice \nof deciding between those who once served with great honor and \ndistinction should receive moneys which he feels very strongly today \nshould go--every penny, every penny--to the quality of life, the \nmodernization of weapons, the operational costs of those who are \ncurrently in uniform today. It puts the Secretary in a very difficult \nposition. This concerns me.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There are priorities to be met and, quite frankly, in \nthis $271 billion defense budget, it is my feeling--and I looked at it, \nI am on Defense Appropriations, I have looked at it and I, quite \nfrankly, believe that the Secretary could find $329 million out of \nthat. I don't think it would do any damage to our readiness, our \ncapabilities overseas or anything else.\n  Quite frankly, I have some comments I was going to talk about--but I \ndecided not to because the hour is late--in terms of what some of the \nIG offices found in terms of waste and inefficiencies in procurement, \nin warehousing and things within the Department of Defense. With a \nlittle bit more oversight and control on those, I think they can yield \ngreat dividends and can be used on this.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in my 19 years, I have heard that argument \nof inefficiency and waste in the Department of Defense. All of us \nrecognize that, and I am sure our Secretary, our former colleague, Bill \nCohen, is doing his very best to try to bring about every kind of \nefficiency he can to generate funds.\n  Frankly, I say to my good friend, Secretary Cohen is desperate for \nmoney. So much of the funding that we have authorized for programs in \nthe past has been diverted to take care of the fulfillment of military \ncommitments as directed by President Clinton. Our military today has \nbeen deployed more times throughout the world than any other President \nhas ever deployed them beyond our shores. The Bosnia commitment alone \nhas absorbed some $9 billion.\n  I ask my friend, I listened very carefully to your statement, and I \nam deeply moved by it. I really think this problem should be addressed, \nand you are saying that we haven't even covered for the modest increase \nin inflation the various costs associated with the care of our \nveterans?\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is my understanding, I say to my very good friend--I \nwant to make this clear at the outset that I have the highest regard \nand respect for the Senator from Virginia and his devotion to this \ncountry and his devotion to the readiness of our military and also his \ndevotion to our veterans. I would not want anyone to misconstrue that I \nam saying the Senator from Michigan or the Senator from Virginia have \nshortchanged it.\n  I understand the obligations that you are under in terms of meeting \nour military commitments. I understand that. This amendment is meant \nonly in good faith to try to meet, I think, another commitment that we \nhave. And in some ways I hope to shed some light, hopefully, on one \naspect of military spending that could be used for our veterans' \naffairs.\n  I say to the Senator that 2 years ago the comptroller general of the \nPentagon concluded that the DOD could not account for over $13 billion \nin spending--just disappeared--$13 billion. Nobody knows where it went. \nWell, I have more examples of that. But if it is just $1 billion, only \none-thirteenth of that, then $329 million is not that much, when you \ntake into account that kind of waste.\n  Quite frankly, I must tell you that I think Secretary Cohen is doing \na great job over there. And they are getting a better handle on this \nall the time. But there is still a long way to go. I think within the \nnext year they could find some of that money and put that in veterans' \nbenefits.\n  Now, lastly, I say to the Senator, I would say that the question had \nto do with, are we not meeting the obligations? And I am saying, when \nyou take into account medical inflation, which is higher than CPI, no, \nwe are not meeting them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I intend to study further the amendment\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\nby my distinguished friend. But I certainly agree with one thing you \nsaid, and that is, the manner in which the United States treats its \nveterans has a direct impact on whether successive generations will \noffer themselves to serve proudly in the uniform of our country. I know \nyou are absolutely right about that. There are many, many cases where \nit is grandfather to father, father to son or daughter, as the case may \nbe, that induces the current generation to proudly come forth and \nvolunteer. That has really been the success of the All Volunteer Force.\n  And what you point out tonight is a very serious situation. And it \nimpacts directly on that argument. I would have to say to my friend, \nbeing a member of the Appropriations Committee, and knowing the \nchairman of the committee himself is a very distinguished veteran of \nWorld War II, an air corps pilot, has my distinguished colleague \nbrought this to his attention? In other words, within the \nappropriations could this sum of money be found?\n  My concern is that I am entrusted, and tonight representing the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, to manage this bill in such a \nway as we do not open up the opportunity for Senators to come in and \ntake pieces of our authorized amount by the Budget Committee to spend \nand put it toward other accounts, because if we begin to do that--for \ninstance, if we would accede here tonight to your request, I could \nanticipate a dozen colleagues coming to the floor tomorrow with \nrequests which they conscientiously feel just as seriously about as you \ndo about yours; and the next thing you know, it would be one after \nanother, to take a piece here and a piece there, and suddenly it would \nbecome very significant--not that this isn't a significant sum of \nmoney.\n\n  We will have to look at this. But I would have to say that I am \nconcerned that we could start a raid on the defense budget here \ntonight. But I hope that this matter can be addressed here in the \nSenate somewhere, be it the Appropriations Committee or the Veterans \nCommittee. I commit to you that if you bring this up in another piece \nof legislation, I will conscientiously see whether or not I can support \nit.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I feel for the position of my friend. And, you \nknow, a lot of us, when we establish friendships, we do not like to put \npeople in difficult positions. I do not like to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not find the position difficult. I feel very \nstrongly about the defense budget. I support the budget process. Your \ncommittee, the Veterans Committee, went through the budget process. Our \ncommittee went through the budget process. We have our allocated funds. \nAnd I am entrusted by the chairman and other members of the committee \nto steadfastly defend that allocation given to us by the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand the responsibility that the Senator has. I \nunderstand that responsibility. And I appreciate that. But, again, as \nthe Senator knows, others of us feel that we also have other \nobligations to try to change some things here and to change some of \nthese budget priorities.\n  In my opening comments, I said that our budget priorities are not \nallowing for this. I am trying to correct it. So I agree with the \nSenator. I do not like the way the budget priorities shortchange our \nveterans' medical benefits. But, again, I also say to my friend, I \nreally believe in what the Vietnam Veterans of America said in their \nletter, that veterans' medical benefits ought to be considered an \nongoing cost of military spending. They are not today.\n  I have always thought that was odd. I have always thought that was an \nodd approach we had on that. And they ought to be considered as part \nand parcel of our military budget. That is why I have offered this \namendment, to transfer a small amount of money out of the total--small \ncompared to the total--at least to keep up with medical inflation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will conclude just with this observation \nof our very able staff director, Les Brownlee, who just handed me a \nnote which indicates that the VA increase in the Senate budget \nprocess--that is, the account for the committee on veterans here in the \nSenate--for the fiscal year 1997 to 1998 was a 12.2 percent increase in \nyour budget, and the DOD increase was less than 2.2 percent. So that is \na fairly significant increase that this communication indicates to me \nand that your committee got.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment \noffered by Senators Harkin and Wellstone to reduce defense spending, \nand any amendment which lowers defense spending below the levels set in \nthe budget agreement. When the Congress approved the budget agreement, \nthe spending limits for each function were set. The Armed Services \nCommittee's challenge was to develop a defense program, within the \nlimits of the budget agreement, that not only supports the national \nsecurity strategy, but balances the needs of short-term readiness with \nthat of the modernization of our forces--all within the context of a \nforeign policy that drives an unprecedented frequency of military \ndeployments.\n  The gap between our military capability and our commitments around \nthe world continues to increase. The unprecedented frequency of \ndeployments places hardships on our young service members and their \nfamilies, producing serious retention and readiness problems. \nContingency and ongoing operations, such as those in Bosnia and Iraq, \ncontinue to drain needed resources for future force modernization and \nthe current readiness of our forces. Since 1996, the Department of \nDefense has been forced to offset almost $9.0 billion for such \noperations. The costs of these ongoing operations, in this fiscal year \nalone, are expected to exceed more than $4.1 billion. Therefore, I \nstrongly believe--and I have stated this previously--that funding for \nBosnia and Southwest Asia operations, and other emerging contingencies, \nmust come from sources other than the defense budget. The funding of \nsuch activities should not be allowed to adversely affect modernization \nefforts or current force readiness.\n  In the past three years, the Congress has added more than $21 billion \nto defense budget requests. Even with these increases, defense spending \nhas continued to decline in real terms. This fiscal year the defense \nrequest again represents, in real terms, a 1.1 percent decline. Defense \nspending as a percentage of GDP in fiscal year 1998 is expected to be \n3.2 percent falling to 2.8 percent by fiscal year 2003--the lowest \nfigures since 1940. The resource levels, as stated in the Budget \nResolution, continue this decline in defense spending. While I continue \nto support the balanced budget agreement, I am concerned about our \nability to modernize our forces and the effects of unbudgeted \ncontingencies and ongoing operations on current readiness.\n  Testimony and recent visits to our units by both members and staff of \nthe Armed Services Committee have revealed disturbing trends: personnel \nshortages, lack of spare parts, extremely high unit operating and \npersonnel tempos, and retention problems--especially with our pilots. \nGeneral Crouch, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, testified to the \nCommittee;\n\n     In recent years, we have maintained readiness at the expense \n     of our modernization accounts. That is no longer a viable \n     strategy.\n\n  Mr. President, we have an obligation to adequately fund for our \nnational security and ensure we provide our servicemen and women with \nthe best equipment available. I grow increasingly concerned when the \nArmed Services Committee receives testimony from one of our Service \nChiefs stating that his funding is inadequate. General Krulak, \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, has told the Committee:\n\n     I state for the third year running that our budget request is \n     not adequate to meet our needs.\n\nHe further stated in a letter to the Committee:\n\n     . . . we are quite literally mortgaging today's health at the \n     expense of tomorrow's wellness--and have been for at least \n     the last eight years--in spite of the critically important \n     congressionally mandated adds to our accounts in the last two \n     years.\n\n  Mr. President, there is a price for freedom. There is the price for \nworld leadership. As Secretary Cohen stated:\n\n     Having highly ready forces that can go anywhere at any time \n     really spells the difference between victory and defeat and \n     it also spells the difference between being a superpower and \n     not being one.\n\n  Mr. President, as a result of the budget agreement reached last year, \nnon defense discretionary spending received significant increases while \ndefense continued its downward spending\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\ntrends--not even keeping pace with inflation. During the fiscal year \n1998 appropriations process, the national security appropriations bill \nhad the lowest percentage increase from fiscal year 1997 funding level \nthan any other of the appropriations bills. In fact, military \nconstruction appropriations had a negative change over the fiscal year \n1997 funding levels, making funding for national defense grow at one-\nfifth the rate of domestic spending increases.\n  Mr. President, I am not opposed to increasing the funding for \nVeterans' health care, but not at the cost of our national security, \nand I strongly urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment and \nnot further aggravate a serious underfunding of our defense.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think it is important that the Chair state the pending \nUC order for the purpose of the Record here for those listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I understand it, does the Senator from \nWashington desire some time on this amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Washington would like about 3 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  Mr. WARNER. On this amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. Not on this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. At the conclusion of this amendment, and all time \nhaving been yielded back, I ask the Chair to recognize the Senator from \nWashington so that he might speak for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The Senator from Washington will be recognized for 3 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, my \ndistinguished colleague, the ranking member of the committee, and I \nwill clear some 20 amendments on behalf of the members of the Armed \nServices Committee and others, and then we will go into the routine \nwrapup on behalf of the majority leader and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S6973-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6973-S6991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I urge you not to tie the Department's hands by enacting \n     legislative provisions that address one or two components of \n     a far more complex force management issue.\n\n  I should remind Members of the Senate, there are about 30 \nrecommendations that were made by the Kassebaum-Baker Commission back \nin December; 28 of those 30 recommendations were implemented by the \nSecretary of Defense--28 of the 30 recommendations. But let's hear from \nthe United States Army, again, in a letter to the chairman of the \ncommittee, Chief of Staff, General Reimer. He says in his letter:\n\n       Segregating their units into gender unique platoons for \n     training and billeting the soldiers by gender in separate \n     buildings will degrade the commander's ability to command and \n     control his or her unit.\n\n  Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations, said in a letter to the \nchairman:\n\n       During basic training, Navy's gender-integrated divisions \n     perform at least as well as their all-male counterparts.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We agree wholeheartedly that Sailors in basic training must \n     have safe, secure housing and living arrangements that \n     promote effective training. But Sailors should also learn to \n     live and work together from the first day of training. This \n     is how they will serve at sea, as part of a gender-integrated \n     unit.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I ask that you continue to allow Navy to build our gender-\n     integrated team from the first day of basic training.\n  Admiral Pilling, who is the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, in his \nletter to the chairman of the committee:\n\n       This experience builds effective teamwork and establishes \n     Navy standards during the crucial transformation from \n     civilian to Sailor. Roughly a third of all recruits and 40 \n     percent of women report to the Fleet without follow-on \n     advanced training. For these men and women, preparation for \n     shipboard life is limited to boot camp and less than three \n     weeks of Apprentice Training.\n\n                               * * * * *\n\n       Learning about security, privacy, dignity and personal \n     responsibility should not be a lesson left for the Fleet to \n     teach. I ask that you continue to allow Navy to build our \n     gender-integrated team from the first day of basic training.\n\n  And General Ryan of the Air Force. He said in his letter to the \nchairman:\n\n       The training process in the Air Force has developed over \n     the years, with changes along the way, to best support our \n     mission. To place artificial barriers between men and women \n     in basic training, such as those proposed in the current \n     House bill [and basically embodied in some of the legislation \n     offered by the Senator from Kansas], is counterproductive to \n     our training philosophy and sends the wrong signal to our new \n     recruits.\n\n                               * * * * *\n\n       I respectfully request your support to allow the Air Force \n     to keep training as we operate--together from the start.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Maine could \njust yield for a unanimous consent request. I believe it has been \ncleared. I want to make sure it is cleared with her staff.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, because Members are trying to get a fix on schedules \nfor this evening, in consultation with the managers and the leaders, I \nwould like to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour of debate--an additional \nhour from this point forward--on the pending second-degree amendment, \nequally divided and controlled by Senator Brownback and Senator Snowe, \nwith a vote to occur on the second-degree amendment not later than 8 \np.m.\n  The reason for that is that many Senators had been told that there \nwould be a vote at 8. They have planned their schedules accordingly. If \nwe can agree to this now with an additional hour of debate equally \ncontrolled by the two Senators, we can then schedule that vote for 8 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for yielding and ask her pardon for \nthe interruption.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I appreciate the Senator's unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to also quote a letter from \nthe Senior Noncommissioned Officers of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates, representing the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. They said:\n\n       As the Senior Noncommissioned Officers of the Armed Forces \n     of the United States, we feel compelled to state our \n     disagreement with a proposed amendment on recruit training \n     that might be considered during the Senate's debate of the \n     FY99 Defense Bill. A mandatory requirement to house recruits \n     in completely separate barracks is unnecessary.\n       Based on our experience, each Service is different and \n     therefore has different needs in training its recruits to \n     join operational units. The determination as to how to train \n     recruits is best determined by the individual Services based \n     on the specific needs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and \n     Marines. Any attempt to make a training policy that applies \n     across all Services is not in the best interests of the \n     nation and will impact the readiness of the total force.\n       Their many successes in our gender-integrated all-volunteer \n     force is a direct result of the training the Services \n     currently provide.\n       We are grateful for Secretary Cohen's support of the \n     Services in determining how best to conduct recruit training. \n     We respectfully request the same vote of confidence from you \n     as the Senate considers the fiscal year 1999 defense \n     authorization bill.\n\n  We also had a quote from the Army Research Institute study, and I \nthink it is interesting to note, about the standards that have also \nbeen developed in this environment of basic training, so that there is \nno misunderstanding, unless there is any concern about the role that \nwomen are playing and their ability to perform during the course of \nbasic training. I quote:\n\n       Females trained in a gender-integrated environment improved \n     their performance in all measures of physical fitness (push-\n     ups, sit-ups, 2-mile run) and the males in gender-integrated \n     training improved in two of three events. This has occurred \n     without the Army fitness standards being changed or adjusted \n     for gender-integrated training.\n\n  In the December report of the Federal Advisory Committee, which is, \nof course, the Kassebaum-Baker commission, it said:\n\n       The committee believes that the increasing number of women \n     in expanded roles is an important reason why the United \n     States is able to maintain an effective and efficient \n     volunteer military force.\n\n  Another letter, from the Secretary of the Army in 1997 to Congress. \nHe said:\n\n       Turning the clock back to gender segregated training will \n     result in unrealistic training which degrades readiness.\n\n  I mention these quotes, Mr. President, because I think it is \nimportant that we remind ourselves of the role that women do play in \nour military and will play in our military, and as they have in the \nlast 100 years. They represent 14 percent of armed services, and the \narmed services cannot perform without them.\n  I just believe it is important to make sure that we can ensure the \nstature and the well-being of all those who serve our country. That is \nwhy I believe we should follow the wisdom and the judgment of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee--indeed, the Congress last\n\n[[Page S6974]]\n\nyear, when we enacted a provision to create a congressional commission \nto examine all of these issues and to report back to the Congress next \nMarch.\n  I hope the Senate will not adopt the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Kansas that basically presumes to substitute for the operational \nconclusions thus far of the Secretary of Defense; the chiefs of the \nArmy, Air Force, the Navy; the training commanders of the Army, the Air \nForce, and the Navy; the senior noncommissioned officers of the Army, \nthe Air Force and the Navy; the president of the Association of the \nUnited States Army; and the tens of thousands of recruits who train and \nlive in security on a daily basis.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that the Senate will adopt the amendment that \nhas been offered by the Senator from Michigan, the ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, the Senator from Georgia, Senator \nCleland, and myself to reaffirm the judgment that has been rendered by \nthe Congress last year in creating this commission.\n  The amendment that is offered by the Senator from Kansas mismatches a \nproblem and a cure. Professional relationships and effective \nperformance throughout the Armed Forces flow from a training world that \noverlaps with the real and the uncertain ones in which men and women \nwill ultimately be deployed as we have seen in Bosnia, as we have seen \nin the Persian Gulf, as we have seen in Somalia over and over again.\n\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment that has been offered by myself, \nSenator Cleland, and Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield 5 minutes--and there are several of my \ncolleagues who want to speak on this, but Senator Coats has been a \nleading voice on this, serving on the committee--I yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I \nappreciate the opportunity to speak now. I have been off the floor, and \nI have another commitment, but I wanted to come and offer my support to \nhis amendment.\n  I struggled with this issue when I was, first, ranking member and \nthen chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee. I visited most of the \ntraining facilities for the various services around the country. I \ntalked to those in charge. We held hearings on the issue. We heard from \nthe experts. We talked to those who lived with the situation in their \nbasic training. It is my inescapable conclusion that the Kassebaum \ncommission did a good job in sorting this out and producing a report \nwhich called for separate facilities.\n  I, frankly, was surprised with the conclusion of the commission. I \ndidn't think when it was constituted that the commission would come to \nthat conclusion. It was something that I was strongly leaning toward, \nand all the visits that I made and the people I discussed this issue \nwith seemed to indicate that separate barracks was the direction to go.\n  When the commission came forth with this recommendation after a more \nthorough look than I was able to give, I thought this added a lot of \nweight to the question. There is no doubt in my mind that effective \ntraining and effective gender integration of the armed services can be \naccomplished without the necessity of forcing the issue through gender \nintegration within the living facilities.\n  Obviously, they are going to train together. Obviously, they are \ngoing to go to class together, they are going to go to the range \ntogether, they are going to train together. The essential functions \nthat are attempting to be accomplished in basic training are going to \nbe accomplished. The real question here is when the training day is \ndone and you return to the barracks to unwind, to shower, to prepare in \nthe evening for the next day and to sleep, is it best to do that in \ngender separate facilities? I believe it is. This where the issue is.\n  I have talked to a lot of drill sergeants, men and women; I have \ntalked to a lot of men and women soldiers, trainees; and the \ninescapable conclusion that I have reached, and I think most of them \nhave reached, is that it would be much more comfortable without \ndegrading the training, and it would eliminate a lot of the supervisory \nproblems, management problems, and, frankly, the social problems that \nexist with living at too close quarters.\n  For that reason, I think the conclusions of the Kassebaum commission \nare correct. I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas \nis the right way to go.\n  I was concerned about the costs. That is a legitimate question, as to \nwhether or not separate facilities or separate barracks--in other \nwords, taking a single entity and dividing it and controlling access, \nand so forth, to separate the sexes, versus separate buildings.\n  And I was really persuaded. I knew ultimately, based on my visit to \nParris Island with the Marines who already do this, that separate \nhousing was the right policy. At Parris Island, the women live in a \nseparate compound. And virtually, to a person, they told me--including \ntheir drill instructors and their supervisors--they told me they \nstrongly preferred that. They are able to identify with each other. And \nto identify with their female drill instructors was very important to \nthem.\n  Many of them come from backgrounds where self-esteem is the casualty \nof their upbringing. They find that bonding with each other, the \nbonding that takes place with the drill instructors and their \nsupervisors in those off-hours, the social interaction that takes place \nin those off-hours, is a very, very important part of their \ndevelopment, the character development, and a whole number of other \nareas.\n  And so I think this makes sense. I am convinced we have looked at the \nsituation. I am convinced we can do this in a financially feasible way.\n  I see my time has expired. And I am happy to support the amendment of \nthe Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine.\n  For those who are entering into this discussion, Mr. President, \nnowhere, as far as I can tell as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, in recruit training, in any service, do male and female \nrecruits live in the same room or in the same squad bay. These \nconditions do not exist now and they did not exist when the incidents \nin Aberdeen took place.\n\n  Male and female recruits do live in the same buildings. In some cases \nmale and female recruits live in separate wings or on separate floors, \nand in some cases they live on the same floors but are separated by \nfire-safe barrier walls. In every case, the male and female recruits \nhave controlled entrances and exits to their sleeping areas and have \nsegregated toilet and shower facilities. The services are in the \nprocess of alarming all doors, exits and walls.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that in every case, in every \nservice, although they might not live in separate buildings, male and \nfemale recruits live in physically safe, physically secure, and \nphysically segregated living conditions.\n  But, Mr. President, in the wake of the terrible incidents of sexual \nmisconduct and sexual harassment that took place in Advanced Training \nat Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the National Defense Authorization Act of \nthe last year established a congressional Commission on Military \nTraining and Gender-Related Issues to review the requirements regarding \ncross-gender relationships of members of the Armed Forces and to review \nthe basic training programs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine \nCorps, and to make improvements on the programs.\n  The idea for the commission came from the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who noted at the time:\n\n       * * * there must be ways to thoroughly examine, review, and \n     evaluate the reasons for\n\n[[Page S6975]]\n\n     the recent spate of scandals regarding sexual relations in \n     training commands. Such a study should be made by an \n     independent blue-ribbon body with unquestioned credentials--\n     with no social agenda, but geared solely to the effect of \n     gender integration at all levels of the military.\n\n  Earlier this year, the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee appointed five distinguished Americans to that \ncommission. Their counterparts on the House National Security Committee \nalso appointed five outstanding individuals.\n  The commissioners include two retired Marine Corps lieutenant \ngenerals, a retired Army command sergeant major, a former Assistant \nSecretary of Defense, a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, three \ndistinguished academics, a military historian/national security \nanalyst, and an expert on legal issues concerning women in the \nmilitary.\n  I have personally met with these commissioners and am convinced they \nunderstand the magnitude of the awesome task we have laid before them, \nand that they are eminently qualified and motivated to do the job.\n  Because of our commitment to doing the right thing--as opposed to \ndoing something quickly--the Armed Services Committee in the Senate \nincluded in its markup a provision to provide for a moratorium on \nchanges to policies or practices regarding segregation on the basis of \ngender.\n  The second-degree amendment Senator Snowe and I have offered retains \nthe moratorium on changes to policies or practices regarding \nsegregation on the basis of gender. I believe this is a very reasonable \napproach. It does not seek to prejudge the outcome of the commission's \nwork.\n  Additionally, it permits the commission to retain its independence. I \nbelieve this is an unwise course of action if we preempt the work of \nthe commission. I know how I would feel if I responded to the call to \nserve on such a commission and was willing to dedicate my time for, \nsay, a year of my life to study these complicated issues, only to find \nthe same people--in this case, the Congress--who asked me to take on \nthe issue, told me before I ever really got started in my work how they \nfelt already.\n\n  I would wonder if they really wanted a thoughtful, professional \nanalysis or if they only wanted the appearance of a study to support \npreconceived ideas and predetermined agendas. I do not believe this was \nthe Senate's intention when it supported the bill authorizing the \nDefense Act last year.\n  We have established a process to review gender-related matters in \ntheir entirety. It does not make sense, to me, for us to separate out \none or two aspects of this incredibly complex issue and to provide some \npiecemeal solution with little or no thought of the consequences our \nactions could have on the rest of the military--recruiting as well as \ntraining and retention.\n  I am aware that the recommendation for separate barracks for male and \nfemale recruits came from the Kassebaum committee appointed by the \nSecretary of Defense. I am also aware that the Secretary of Defense has \ndecided not to implement that recommendation. And the uniformed \nleadership--the most senior officers and enlisted members of the Army, \nNavy, and Air Force--also oppose the recommendation.\n  For example, Mr. President, our committee received a letter from \nGeneral Reimer, Chief of Staff of the Army, who said:\n\n       Segregating their units into gender unique platoons for \n     training and billeting the solders by gender in separate \n     buildings will degrade the commander's ability to command and \n     control his or her unit.\n\n  Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations:\n\n       Sailors should learn to live and work together from the \n     first day of training.\n\n  Admiral Pilling, Vice Chief of Naval Operations:\n\n       Learning about security, privacy, dignity and personal \n     responsibility should not be a lesson left for the fleet to \n     teach.\n\n  General Ryan, Chief of Staff of the Air Force:\n\n       The saying ``train as we operate'' is more than a catch \n     phrase, it is an absolute necessity to ensure that team \n     building begins on the first day our recruits report to basic \n     training.\n\n  Senior enlisted members also commented on this issue as well.\n\n       Any attempt [they said] to make a training policy that \n     applies across all Services is not in the best interest of \n     the nation and will impact the readiness of the total force.\n\n  Mr. President, in terms of the readiness of the force, I was recently \nin Bosnia a few weeks ago. And I did see on a fire base there women \nactively engaged in work on the fire base. But I noticed that their \nliving quarters were separate, safe, and secure. It was an incredible \ndemonstration to me that women and men can serve in this Nation's \ninterests in foreign lands and do so extremely well.\n  I would also like to note that the Kassebaum report itself has \nactually been criticized by the GAO because of flawed methodology. \nAccording to GAO, the value of the Kassebaum committee's methodology is \nlimited for making conclusions and recommendations, and the extent to \nwhich the committee's work supports its conclusions and recommendations \ncannot be determined.\n  When the Secretary of Defense, a former Member of this body, and the \nuniformed leadership of the military, officers and enlisted, oppose \nsomething, I certainly take time to listen.\n  Today, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to listen to the \nleadership of the military and give the Senate a chance to listen to \nthe commission which we actually created and appointed to help us make \ndecisions to guide us in these complex matters.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I support the Snowe amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to adopt it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield to the Senator from Alabama 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I had 13 years in the Army Reserve and went through a \nbasic training program. It was a very worthwhile experience for me. I \nplayed football. I have been to basic training, and basic training is \nworse and tougher. Anybody that survives that has my admiration.\n  I have had the opportunity through the years to serve with some \noutstanding women soldiers, the kind of soldiers that you respect and \nare capable and have great ability to contribute to the mission of the \nunit. It is something that I think is a major part of American military \nlife and we should not be changing.\n  I understand there is a lot of talk about separation and use of the \nword ``segregation'' based on gender. But it seems to me that Senator \nBrownback's amendment simply says that in basic training these \nsoldiers, men and women, shouldn't be housed together. I think that is \na reasonable approach and something that comports with my sense of what \nmakes sense, my sense of what I understand the Senator to be saying, \nand I think it is the right idea.\n  Some might say it is the responsibility of the NCOs and the officers \nto maintain moral control over the soldiers. When they are in such a \nmixed environment, the officers and NCOs can't maintain control over \nthese young people. They are in a circumstance that is a different \nworld; it is a whole different environment they are in. Things that \nthey would have thought to do under other circumstances may not be done \nunder these circumstances.\n  I say we have separate barracks. It seems to me if we are going to \nseparate the 14 percent of the soldiers that are women within existing \nbarracks, it seems to me you are converting whole floors that would \notherwise be half used. For example, most of the barracks I was in had \n20 people on one floor and 20 on the next. So I suppose a few people \nwould be on the second floor and the bottom floor would be full. That \nis the way they were traditionally done.\n  I don't see how it would be any cost to have separate housing for \nwomen in which women could have the support of their NCOs under those \ncircumstances and men could have separate housing. I think both parties \nwould benefit from that.\n  The commission did a lot of work. We have been talking about a new \ncommission. I point out that we had one. Senator Nancy Kassebaum-Baker \nand others did a thorough job. They talked to\n\n[[Page S6976]]\n\nover 1,000 trainees, 500 instructors, 300 first-term service members, \nand 275 supervisors. I don't know who the chiefs of staff and Secretary \nof Army is talking to. I don't know, maybe they are talking to too many \npeople in the Pentagon. But those commissioned, the ones in power to \nmake a decision, went out and talked to soldiers, trainees, 1,000, 500 \ninstructors--the drill instructors out there with these men and women \non a daily basis, and this commission unanimously reached a conclusion \nthat separate housing would be preferable. They also concluded that \nseparate training would be preferable.\n  As a matter of fact, I tend to agree with that based on my \nexperience. But that is not before the Senate today. That is not what \nSenator Brownback is calling on us to do today.\n  Senator Brownback is suggesting that what we ought to do is have \nseparate housing, a readily achievable thing, I suggest.\n  I agree with the commission based on my experience and the study I \nhave done, that separate housing will decrease disciplinary problems, \nit will reduce distractions during the training process, and as the \ncommission found, will be of marginal cost to the Department of \nDefense.\n  I am pleased to support this amendment. I think it is time that this \nbody raised our concerns. There are many problems that are occurring. \nSenator Brownback has eloquently discussed those. We hate to talk about \nthe problems that are occurring, but they need to be discussed. I think \nit is the right thing.\n  I yield back my time to the Senator from Kansas, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I want to thank the able Senator from Maine for the \nexcellent remarks she made on this subject.\n  Mr. President, I am sympathetic to the Brownback amendment, however, \nlast year, the Congress established a commission to review the conduct \nof military training and gender-related issues, we should await the \noutcome of its findings. That commission is constituted and working. \nOne of the areas which the commission must specifically address in its \nfinal report is a recommendation as to how to provide for a safe and \nsecure living environment for young men and women in basic training. \nThis amendment would preempt the work of the commission by establishing \na statutory requirement that basic trainees be housed in separate \nbarracks.\n  I join Senator Brownback and others in insisting that the military \nservices provide a safe and secure environment for all military \npersonnel, but especially those in basic training who may be the most \nvulnerable.\n  On June 8, 1998, Secretary Cohen asked us not to legislate a specific \nsolution as Senator Brownback's amendment does. Secretary Cohen urged \nthat we give the Service Chiefs the flexibility to house and train \ntheir personnel in the manner determined to be most effective for that \nservice. We all recognize that each of the four services is unique. \nEach service has its own culture, history and traditions. I agree with \nSecretary Cohen that we should not legislate how they must house and \ntrain their personnel.\n  Mr. President, I could support an amendment that would require the \nService Secretaries to provide for a safe and secure environment \nwithout specifically requiring a standard solution for three of the \nfour services. Senator Brownback's amendment goes beyond requiring a \nsafe and secure environment and will require millions of dollars in \nmilitary construction and renovation projects to make their barracks \nconform to the requirements in the amendment.\n  I prefer to allow the Congressional Commission to do its work and \nmake its recommendations next March before we act. I urge my colleagues \nto oppose this amendment.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I ask unanimous consent Mr. \nDavid Landfair, a military fellow in the Office of Senator Mike DeWine, \nbe granted privilege of the floor during the pendency of S. 2057, the \nfiscal year 1999 Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if Senator Snowe would yield 10 minutes to me?\n  How much time does the Senator from Maine have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield 8 minutes to me?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I was going to yield to the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Personnel for 5 minutes, so the remainder of the time I yield to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask that the Senator from Maine, then, yield 8 minutes \nto me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First of all, Mr. President, we have all read about some \nterrible incidents that occurred at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds that \ngave rise to much of the concern about recruit training. Those \nincidents did not occur in recruit training. They did not occur in \nrecruit sleeping areas. They did not involve sexual misconduct among \nrecruits. They took place in advanced individual training, which is a \nphase of training which takes place after an individual graduates from \nrecruit training. The incidents that give rise to so much of this \nunderstandable concern did not occur in the recruit training area or \nphase which this first-degree amendment would address.\n  I want to emphasize something on which the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee has just spoken. We appointed a committee or a \ncommission, 10 citizens. These are distinguished citizens that were \nselected by the chairman, by me, by the chairman of our counterpart \ncommittee in the House, and by the ranking member in the House. This \ncommission is underway. We picked 10 distinguished citizens.\n  We asked them to look at a particular agenda, a list of items. We set \nforth their duties and they are now fulfilling those duties.\n  This is what our law said, and this is something which had broad \nsupport in this body. The law said:\n\n       The commission shall consider issues relating to personal \n     relationships of members of the Armed Forces as follows: \n     Review the laws, regulations, policies, directives and \n     practices that govern personal relationships between men and \n     women in the Armed Forces and personal relationships between \n     members of the Armed Forces and nonmilitary personnel of the \n     opposite sex. Assess the extent to which the laws, \n     regulations, policies, directives and practices have been \n     applied consistently throughout the Armed Forces, without \n     regard to the Armed Forces, grade, rank or gender of the \n     individuals involved.\n\n  Then comes the third thing we ask them to do. This was a knowing, \nconscious request--a statement to this commission, saying this is your \nduty:\n\n       Duty No. 3: Assess the reports of the independent panel, \n     the Department of Defense task force, and the review of \n     existing guidance on fraternization and adultery that have \n     been required by the Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Our good friend from Kansas has said that common sense dictates that \nsince the Kassebaum Commission made this recommendation, we ought to \nfollow it. No. Common sense dictates that when we appoint a commission \nwith the explicit duty of assessing the Kassebaum Commission report--\nwhen we do that knowingly and openly, when we ask 10 distinguished \ncitizens to give up part of their life to come here and assess the \nKassebaum report, which is what we did in last year's law, that we not \nsimply say, whoops, some of us liked the Kassebaum report and we are \nnow going to adopt that and bypass the very commission that we created. \nI mean, what is the point of the Senate of the United States and the \nHouse of Representatives unanimously tasking a group of citizens to \nlook at the Kassebaum Commission report, among other things, and now \nonce that report is issued, because some of us like the recommendation, \nwe take that piece of the report and say that we are now going to put \nthat into law and bypass our own commission? I think it makes a mockery \nof the process that we ourselves set into motion. We should not do \nthat.\n  Now, since I have a couple more minutes, I want to state what some of \nthe underlying facts are about the way in which the males and females \nlive.\n  First, nowhere in recruit training in any service do male and female \nrecruits live in the same room or in the\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\nsame squad bay. These conditions do not exist now, and they did not \nexist when the incidents at Aberdeen took place. Male and female \nrecruits do live in the same buildings, and in some cases, they live in \nseparate wings or on separate floors. In some cases, they live on the \nsame floors, but are separated by fire-safe barrier walls. But in every \ncase, male and female recruits have controlled entrances and exits to \ntheir sleeping areas, and have segregated toilet and shower facilities.\n  Now, what have the services told us about this? The heads of the \nservices have told us, ``Do not change this now.'' The heads of the \nservices have told us this. The chief professionals have told us this. \nThe senior enlisted members of the Army, Navy and Air Force, have \nwritten to the committee opposing the amendment. These are the \nprofessionals that we rely on. When it comes to the matters affecting \nthe safety, welfare, and well-being of the men and women in our \nmilitary, these are the people we rely on. These are the professionals. \nThey have asked us, ``Do not enact this legislation.'' So on both \ncounts--that our top military officials, uniform and civilian, have \nasked us to not enact this legislation, and the fact that we have \nappointed a commission that is going to give us a recommendation, which \nwe put in place, in part, to review the Kassebaum Commission report--we \nshould not take this action tonight.\n  Finally, the sergeant major of the Army, the master chief petty \nofficer of the Navy, and the chief master sergeant of the Air Force \nhave written us a letter, which was referred to by a number of my \ncolleagues. I will not repeat the portions that they read. But I am \ngoing to quote one paragraph that I believe has not been read. This \nsummarizes, to me, what the really critical point is, which was so well \nstated by the Senators from Maine and Georgia, and others. This is what \nthey say:\n\n       Each time our Nation has asked the Army, Navy, Air Force or \n     Marines to do a job, it has been done. Men and women \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines accomplish the tasks \n     asked of them every day in places like Bosnia, Haiti, \n     Southwest Asia, and the Far East. Their many successes in our \n     gender-integrated All-Volunteer force is a direct result of \n     the training the services currently provide.\n\n  I hope that we will listen to these professionals.\n  These are the individuals who went to boot camp and have come up \nthrough the ranks to the highest position possible for an enlisted \nmember. When it comes to matters affecting the safety, welfare, and \nwell-being of the men and women in our military, these are the experts! \nAnd, they have asked us not to enact this legislation.\n  That leaves us with the question: Who wants this legislation and why? \nWhat problem will it solve?\n  Neither the military nor civilian leadership of the Department of \nDefense or of the Military Departments want it.\n  The senior enlisted members of the Army, Navy and Air Force see it as \nunnecessary.\n  Finally, it short-circuits the work of a Congressional Commission of \ndistinguished citizens that this body voted into law less than one year \nago.\n  The Armed Services Committee included in its mark-up a provision to \nprovide for a moratorium on changes to policies or practices regarding \nsegregation of integration on the basis of gender that is within the \nresponsibility of the Commission appointed by the Congress, until that \nCommission terminates in March 1999.\n  I believe that it would be both short-sighted and very unfortunate \nfor the Senate to adopt the Brownback amendment and to cause the \nDepartment of Defense to expend in excess of $150 million against the \ncollective judgment--military and civilian--of DOD and before we have \nhad the opportunity to benefit from the advice of our own Commission.\n  The second degree amendment Senators Cleland and Snowe have offered \nretains the moratorium on changes to policies or practices regarding \nsegregation of integration on the basis of gender that is within the \nresponsibility of the Commission appointed by the Congress, until that \nCommission terminates in March 1999.\n  I believe that this is a very reasonable approach. It would permit \nthe Army, Navy, and Air Force to continue to conduct recruit training \nin the manner best suited to producing soldiers, sailors, and airmen \nready to meet the challenges of our military. Uniformed Leadership of \nour military--leaders to whose appointments we have given our advice \nand consent--say it best:\n  General Reimer (Chief of Staff of the Army): ``Segregating their \nunits into gender unique platoons for training and billeting the \nsoldiers by gender in separate buildings will degrade the commander's \nability to command and control his or her unit.''\n  Admiral Johnson (Chief of Naval Operations): ``Sailors should learn \nto live and work together from the first day of training.''\n  Admiral Pilling (Vice Chief of Naval Operations): ``Learning about \nsecurity, privacy, dignity and personal responsibility should not be a \nlesson left for the fleet to teach.''\n  General Ryan (Chief of Staff of the Air Force) ``The saying `train as \nwe operate' is more than a catch phrase, it is an absolute necessity to \nensure that team building begins on the first day our recruits report \nto basic training.''\n  Senior Enlisted Members ``Any attempt to make a training policy that \napplies across all Services is not in the best interest of the nation \nand will impact the readiness of the total force.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support the 2nd degree amendment and permit \nour Commission to complete the work we assigned to it and to report \nback to us before we direct any changes to recruit training.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was listening to the debate when the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama was relating to us his experiences \nin basic training, and I was thinking of my experiences in basic \ntraining. Quite frankly, I think I would have been for integration of \nthe sexes when I was in basic training, but I am looking at it \ndifferently now than I did at that time.\n  I would like to respond to something that the Senator from Michigan \nsaid. I have so much respect for him, but I disagree with him in this \nrespect. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nSubcommittee on Readiness, I spend a lot of time talking to officers in \nthe field, talking to enlisted people in the field, as does the ranking \nmember, the Senator from Virginia. I find a discrepancy in what you \nhear in the field and what you hear from the chiefs.\n  I am not saying this critically of the current chiefs, but I think \nthe chiefs have always reflected the philosophy of the President. The \nPresident is the Commander in Chief. He is the guy responsible for \ntheir careers. So we hear different things from the chiefs here in \nWashington than I hear when I go out to the National Training Center, \nor to 29 Palms, or Fort Bragg, or to Camp Lejeune. They are very \nemphatic and supportive of that portion of the recommendations of the \nKassebaum-Baker report having to do with housing.\n  Thirdly, three different Members, while I have been sitting here, \nhave gone into detail as to the makeup of the committee that we have \nasked for from our committee, and it is a very distinguished panel. But \nI think that we have kind of lost sight of the fact that the committee \nthat we refer to as the Kassebaum-Baker committee was actually \nappointed under the supervision of Secretary of Defense William Cohen. \nHe put together a committee and, frankly, I probably would not have put \ntogether the same committee. I would want it stacked a little bit the \nother way. Real briefly, I will go over the committee.\n  They are: Richard Allen, retired vice admiral of the U.S. Navy; \nRobert Forman, retired lieutenant general, U.S. Army; Marcelite Harris, \nmajor general, retired, from the Air Force; Condoleezza Rice, a \nStanford professor; Don Gardner, a retired major general from the \nMarine Corps; Deval Patrick, who was the Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights, appointed by President Clinton. I mean, if there is \nanybody who would have a bias toward the administration, it would be \nthis individual. Ginger Lee Simpson, retired U.S. Navy, and others.\n  I suggest to my fellow Senators that this committee of 11 had a \nmajority of women. On this committee of 11, 5 of\n\n[[Page S6978]]\n\nthem were either retired generals or admirals.\n  I would hold up this committee to be certainly comparable to the \ncommittee that had been discussed on this floor. I think any time you \nhave a committee like this reaching a unanimous decision--all of these \nretired women from all the services, along with the former Assistant \nAttorney General in charge of civil rights appointed by President \nClinton--and it was unanimous; they all agreed. I think when you have \nthis unanimity, I can't imagine that any other committee is going to \ncome up with a different result.\n  What would happen is, it would delay the implementation of this by a \nyear. If it is good now, and it is good a year from now, I think one \nyear should make a tremendous difference in the morale of the services, \nwhich is certainly suffering at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of my time to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Personnel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, would you please notify me when I have consumed 4 \nminutes?\n  Mr. President, when you spoke so eloquently here, you said that \nSenator Brownback's amendment could be summarized in that the men and \nwomen should not be housed together. I totally agree, 100 percent; men \nand women should not be housed together. I think that the Senator from \nMaine agrees with me. There is no argument here.\n  But when we talk about separate housing, I don't know that \nnecessarily has to mean separate buildings, because when you look at \nthe configuration of many of our structures out there--I agree with \nwhat Senator Brownback said, which was very effective. This idea that \nsomehow you are going to use a plywood partition to separate, that is \nwrong. It ought to be permanent. You ought to have separate entrances. \nYou ought to have separate common areas. You ought to have that. We \nshould have that.\n  But I believe that it is not necessary to go as far as Senator \nBrownback at this point. I think that can be created with existing \nstructures. If not, then let's go ahead with the separate. But, you \nsee, we are presupposing here.\n  When we talk about the terrible incidents that have happened--and \nthey are absolutely deplorable, deplorable. But I think in one of the \ncases that was referenced, a Navy drill instructor committed sexual \nmisconduct with some of these individuals. But in none of those cases \ndid the incidents take place in the sleeping bay of the barracks. It \ntook place in the office of the drill instructor. It took place in the \nmotel down the road. It is not in the bays.\n  The idea that we cannot allow a drill instructor--I don't know how \nfar that goes. Can the commanding officer enter the drill bay to have a \nmeeting with the recruits, if he is escorted by someone of the same \nsex, who are in the barracks? I think that should be allowed. But I \ndon't know that it is allowed here.\n  I am just concerned that perhaps we have gone a little far.\n  We have talked about the Kassebaum-Baker Commission. Do you know that \nthey did not look at the advanced training? They looked strictly at \nbasic.\n\n  Why do I make that point? It is because it was at the advanced \ntraining at Aberdeen. That is where all of these incidents take place--\nadvanced training.\n  We have put together a very effective group of commission members. It \nwas a Kempthorne-Byrd amendment that created the commission. So I can't \nturn my back on that commission. That would be wrong. I am not going to \nturn my back on the Senator from Maine or the Senator from Georgia. \nThat would be wrong. We created a commission in the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  You may have seen, Mr. President, a few weeks ago the commission was \nabout ready to split. Four were going to walk. Congressman Buyer and I \nmet with them and said, ``Don't do this. Don't rule yourselves \nirrelevant. There is such a critical reason for this commission to \nexist. Stay together. Give us the answers.'' Now I am supposed to say \nto that commission, ``Oh, by the way, thanks for staying together, but \nwe don't need your conclusions, because we are going to go ahead with \nall of this legislation, because I believe there is an amendment ready \nto come forward that is going to be removing integrated training.''\n  Mr. President, I am going to repeat what you said. Men and women \nshould not be housed together. No argument. No argument. But I believe \nwe can accomplish that in the existing structure.\n  I also think we have to support a commission that was put in place.\n  Again, I want to compliment the Senator from Kansas. He has brought a \nmeaningful issue before us. He has been articulate about it. Senator \nBrownback does a good job, but I think he has gone just a little far in \nthis. Does separate housing mean you have to have separate housing and \nthe cost that goes with that?\n  I know the Senator from Virginia, Senator Robb, a member of the \nsubcommittee, also would like to speak. I would like to turn my time \nover to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 seconds.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, in 25 seconds let me thank the Senator from \nIdaho. I agree with the points he has made.\n  I have visited the training in Fort Jackson and Parris Island and \nexamined these specific issues. I have asked for some reports from the \nGAO. That is coming in. But we established the commission to give us \nspecific information to help make these decisions.\n  I think the Senator from Maine has adopted the approach that makes \nsense. Let's wait for the commission to make its report and act on the \nbasis of that information.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas controls the remaining \ntime, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to strongly endorse the amendment of my \nfriend, the Senior Senator from Kansas. This amendment would simply \nrequire the housing of male and female recruits in separate barracks \nduring recruit training.\n  It amazes me that this amendment is even necessary. Every attempt to \nreturn common sense to our military's recruit training policies has \nbeen obstructed by this administration--even those attempts initiated \nby the administration itself. Didn't the Secretary of Defense already \nconvene a panel of distinguished military and civil rights experts to \nstudy this serious problem? Didn't this commission--the Kassebaum \nCommission--unanimously point out the critical importance of--among \nother things--giving each gender its own recruit housing? Hasn't the \nadministration had over five years to make their misguided gender \nneutral policies work without success? Sadly and inexplicably, the \nanswer to all these questions is yes.\n  Now we have another commission. Are we going to continue to appoint \nand pay for commissions until we reach an answer that we like? Are we \ngoing to find it easier to appoint a commission than to make a \ndecision? I believe this tactic is called paralysis by analysis. I also \nbelieve that the appropriate time to criticize a commission is before \nthey report, not after.\n  A few days of orientation for new recruits before they are kicked \ninto the hormonal situation that we are putting them in would be \nhelpful.\n  Mr. President, the administration's arguments in favor of their \nsocial engineering are misleading, contradictory and quite \nunprecedented. How are they misleading? The Secretary of Defense has \ntried to garner support for his gender neutral training policies on the \ngrounds that the military simply cannot do without women. The fact, \nhowever, is that no one on any side of this debate is advocating that \nwomen be purged from our military, and it is patently offensive to me \nthat he would indicate that we are. We fully understand\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\nthe importance of women to the functioning of our military. All we are \ntrying to do with this amendment is to give both genders a training \nenvironment in which they can realize their fullest potential.\n  How are the administration's arguments contradictory? They argue that \nthe military must train as it fights. They argue that since men and \nwomen serve together, they must train together, and be housed together. \nYet one of the things discovered by the Kassebaum commission is that \nwhile male recruits are required to throw a hand grenade 35 meters, \nfemale recruits are only required to throw it 25 meters. Is the \nSecretary of Defense implying that our military intends to make sure \nour female soldiers are always 10 meters closer to the enemy than our \nmale soldiers? Though this amendment would not address issues of \ntraining such as this, this type of thinking is indicative of the \ncontradictory quality which pervades all aspects of this \nadministration's recruit training policies--to include housing.\n  How are the administration's arguments unprecedented? It is surely \nunprecedented to place a political agenda of social engineering above \nthe simple requirements of national security. Five years of gender \nneutral training barracks have resulted only in lowered morale, one sex \nscandal after another, recruiting shortfalls for every branch but the \nMarine Corps which does not engage in this incredible practice, and a \nrefusal of this administration to face these problems. It is noteworthy \nthat eighteen months after the sex scandals at Aberdeen, the Kassebaum \nCommission found that the policies which precipitated them had still \nnot been corrected. The Army, like the Navy and Air Force, have proven \nsingularly unsuccessful in solving the problems associated with these \nmisguided policies--policies which deny the existence of any emotional \ndynamics between young men and young women. This is less a reflection \non the earnestness with which our military leaders have tried to \nimplement these policies, than it is an indictment of these unworkable \ngender neutral policies themselves. Mr. President, this amendment \nrepresents a common sense step in the right direction. It is sorely \nneeded and I encourage all members to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. May I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to respond to a few things that have been stated here \nabout what we are talking about and what we are not talking about in \nthe final minutes that I have in this debate.\n  No. 1 is, what we are talking about is separate barracks during basic \ntraining--separate barracks during basic training. We are not talking \nabout further training; we are not talking about deployment, any of \nthose issues that are being raised as a smokescreen by others. We are \nnot talking about separation. We are talking about the 9 weeks of basic \ntraining, separate barracks.\n  All right, that is No. 1. No. 2 is we are also talking about limited \naccess by trainers of the opposite sex after hours. We have had \ninstances--we have had court-martials. Even this month we have had a \ncourt-martial take place in the Navy involving that type of situation.\n  So what we are saying is if you are of the opposite gender, you can't \ngo into the facility where the other gender is staying after hours \nother than in emergency cases.\n  Those are the two things we are talking about. Those are intimate \nissues and they have eminent common sense about them, plus I might add \nbeing backed up by the Kassebaum-Baker commission, the Army survey that \nI showed, the CRS study that I also cited earlier.\n  So I have three studies on this point as well as making what \nbasically most people would say is pretty much common sense about this \nissue. We are not talking about separate training. Senator Byrd was \ngoing to have an amendment along that line, and I think he has some \nwisdom with it, but we are not talking about that sort of issue.\n  Some are saying, look, we don't have a problem. Well, I cited to you \nthe court-martial that has taken place at the Great Lakes Navy basic \ntraining facility, and I read the quotes from some of the people \ninvolved in that horrible instance as to what took place there.\n  I would also cite to you some other problem areas. We did some \nsurveying of the military on these issues. We asked them about official \nreprimands in instances in the last 12 months involving trainers and \ntrainees. The Army gave us 53 that were involved in article 15s over \nthe last 2 years involving trainers and trainees. That is a lot that \nwere involved in this type of situation.\n  Also I want to cite--and there was one thing the Senator from \nMichigan cited saying that this isn't a particular problem. We have got \nthose in that particular case, and the services do not want to do this. \nWell, the Army and Navy and the Air Force may not. The Marines think \nthat separate training and separate barracks is the way to go and they \nare having fewer instances that they are reporting.\n  I want to cite another study. This is the Department of Defense 1995 \nsexual harassment study. This one is amazing if you look at it. They \nare talking about the progress taking place. In 1995, they surveyed \ntheir personnel and 55 percent of the women in the Army, 55 percent of \nthe women surveyed in this Department of Defense study said they had \nsome type of sexual harassment taking place within the last year. \nListen to how this breaks down. Actual or attempted rape or assault, 4 \npercent of the women surveyed said that this had happened to them; \npressure for sexual favors, 11 percent; touching or cornering, 29 \npercent.\n\n  This is the 1995 Department of Defense sexual harassment study. We \ndon't have a problem? We have a significant problem taking place.\n  I have other studies to cite here, but what I want to get to with \nthis is to say that we have a current and present problem and danger \ninvolved in this situation. We are talking about an amendment of very \nlimited scope.\n  We can do studies until we find one that comes out the way we want it \nto come out, and I suppose if we keep appointing people that may \nhappen. The commission that has been appointed has a much broader \npurview than this narrow issue of the barracks.\n  It says the duties of the commission shall be to:\n\n       Review the current practices of the Armed Forces, relevant \n     studies, and private sector training concepts pertaining to \n     gender-integrated training.\n\n  OK, but it also says:\n\n       Review the laws, regulations, policies, directives, and \n     practices that govern personal relationships between men and \n     women in the Armed Forces and personal relationships between \n     members of the Armed Forces and nonmilitary personnel of the \n     opposite sex.\n\n  That is broader than just the barracks during basic training we are \ntalking about.\n\n       Assess the extent to which the laws, regulations, policies, \n     and directives have been applied consistently throughout the \n     Armed Forces without regard to the Armed Force, grade, or \n     rank of the individuals involved.\n\n  Whether or not everybody is being reviewed similarly:\n\n       Examine the experiences, policies, and practices of the \n     Armed Forces of other industrialized nations regarding \n     gender-integrated training.\n\n  Training: We are not talking about training here. We are just talking \nabout barracks during basic training.\n  My point is that some would say we have appointed this commission and \nto not let it go on through; by doing this, that we are overruling the \ncommission. This is a very broad-based commission. We have a clear and \npresent problem in basic training that just earlier this month on June \n5 we have a court-martial taking place at the Navy training grounds, \nand we have got 53 instances being reported in the last 2 years by the \nArmy--53 official reprimands.\n  I get calls to my office by people asking to be released from the \nmilitary because of sexual harassment that has happened to them in \nbasic training.\n  Do we need another year to study this? Do we need another year to \ncontemplate this?\n  My own staff then goes down to Fort Jackson to look at the situation \nbecause there is an issue regarding the\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\ncommon area that is involved here: Let's just put them in the same \nfacility, but we will put them on different floors or separate, \ndifferent wings out here, but then we have a common area together.\n  My own staff was told about, well, there was sexual activities taking \nplace, on the fire escape and in the telephone booth. Where there is a \nwill there is a way, I guess. But my point is, if you are going to put \nyoung 18-year-old recruits in the same place in a pressurized \nenvironment and you are going to provide some chances, this is going to \nhappen.\n  What we are saying is let's just put them in separate facilities by \n2001. Let's give it some time, common sense, so we can get this put \ninto place, and that is specifically and only what we are talking \nabout. And let's limit the supervisors, the trainers being able to go \ninto the trainees' facilities of the opposite sex after hours other \nthan for emergency cases because we have had some really horrible \ninstances taking place there.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I think if you look at the preponderance of \nevidence that is here with all the studies that have been done, we can \ndo yet another one, and if this one doesn't come out the way we want, I \nsuppose we may do yet another one, but we have enough. We have a real \nproblem today--and this is going to really catch up with us--of \nrecruits coming into the military.\n  This is a simple proposal, a simple matter. We don't need to put it \noff for another commission to study this. The evidence is overwhelming \nand the findings have been overwhelming to date.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I would ask my colleagues to vote \nagainst the Snowe amendment. Let us have a vote on this very simple \nissue of separate barracks and not having members of the opposite sex \nin the quarters after hours other than for emergency cases. That is all \nthat we are asking for in this particular amendment.\n  So please vote no on the Snowe amendment so we can put the Kassebaum \ncommission into place.\n  With that, Mr. President, I inquire how much time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two-and-a-half minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to be very magnanimous and \nyield 2 minutes to somebody who absolutely disagrees with me on this \namendment, who I think is absolutely wrong, but I want to be collegial \nwith my colleagues and recognize and yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  I would like 30 seconds at the end in case I need to say something.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the Senator has used the 2 minutes, but I \nappreciate it. I will return the favor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank our colleague from Kansas, and I yield the 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \nand the Senator from Kansas 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the most important issues \ninvolving training in the military is the issue of gender integrated \ntraining.\n  Women have been serving with distinction in our military forces for \ndecades, but their opportunities have grown immensely in the past \ndecade. Unfortunately, the recent sexual harassment scandals in the \nmilitary have been used by some to oppose the integrated training of \nmen and women in the military and to urge a return to separate \ntraining. This approach would be a serious mistake.\n  In light of the expanded roles for women in the military it makes \nsense to continue to integrate all aspects of training except for \ndirect combat training. The Services often cite ``train as you fight'' \nas one of their guidelines in preparation for war. Each service trains \nas it will fight. The Marines and Army direct ground combat units \nconduct gender segregated basic training. For all other non-direct \nground combat roles, the services conduct gender integrated training. \nThis is how they will fight.\n  Some ask, why should basic training be any different? But basic \ntraining is where new recruits learn basic military values. Integrated \ninitial training makes sense. They will train and fight as an \nintegrated force for their entire military careers. There is no reason \nwhy they should not begin to do so as early as possible. Doing so \nincreases the readiness of all our military forces.\n  Opponents also argue for separate barracks for men and women during \ntraining. But, as anyone who has served in the military knows, military \ntraining does not end on the drill field or in the classroom. A great \ndeal of unit cohesion is built during time spent in the barracks \nstudying or preparing for the next day's training. Separate barracks \nwould further complicate the commanders' task and make it more \ndifficult to exercise the leadership that guarantees the readiness of \nthe military unit.\n  The barracks now used in basic training by the services all have \nindependent sleeping areas and restrooms for men and women. Each of \nthese areas has separate entrances. There are alarms on doors and walls \naround living areas, which are locked at night. Moreover, there is \naround-the-clock supervision by the chain of command. There is no doubt \nthat we have safe and secure barracks. Wasting over $150 million in new \nconstruction for separate barracks that are not needed and are no more \nsecure makes no sense.\n  The critics of gender integrated training cite recent cases of sexual \nharassment as a demonstration of the need to segregate men and women \nduring basic training. But almost none of the instances of sexual \nharassment or sexual misconduct were committed by recruits on recruits, \nbut by drill instructors on recruits.\n  That kind of sexual harassment indicates poor leadership, not a \ngender integration problem in training. All of the Services acknowledge \nthe importance of improving the quality of recruit training. Commanders \nand drill instructors will exercise closer supervision over all \nrecruits. That is the best way to eliminate these abuses and ensure the \nhigh level of readiness required for our national defense.\n  We have come a long way toward full acceptance of women in the \nmilitary. But more needs to be done to ensure that the progress goes \nforward in the coming years. Women will not continue to serve in a \nmilitary which discriminates against them. I look forward to a day when \nmore policies and programs affecting service members are implemented \nwithout regard to gender. Women in the military deserve no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Kansas has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I wish to simply respond to the statements of the \nSenator from Michigan and the Senator from Massachusetts. They are \nsimply not true. We have the June 5 case taking place at the Navy train \nfacility, a court-martial because of fraternization, harassment, sexual \nactivity by the trainer with trainees involved in this.\n  Separate barracks: Keep the trainers out afterhours. This makes \nsense, and I would ask my colleagues to vote against the Snowe \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on the second-degree amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment offered by the Senator from Maine.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) and the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller), and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 37, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6981]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 172 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--37\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Glenn\n     Helms\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Specter\n  The amendment (No. 2979) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2978, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Is there further debate on the \nfirst-degree Brownback amendment numbered 2978, as amended? If not, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2978), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \nChairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond.\n  The report accompanying this legislation states that the committee \nhas included $191.4 million for three ``standard'' C-130J aircraft (in \naddition to funding for two other C-130J variants). The \nAdministration's budget request included funding for one standard C-\n130J for the active Air Force. Thus, the committee added two standard \nC-130Js to the budget.\n  The report further states that these two standard C-130J aircraft \nadded by this bill are designated for Reserve Component Modernization. \nHowever, the report appears not to include a designation for the \nrequested C-130J. I would like to ask the Chairman, does the committee \nintend that all three of the standard C-130J aircraft in this bill--not \nsimply the two added to the request--are designated for the Air \nNational Guard?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to compliment the Chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee on his very skillful handling of this \nimportant legislation and for his statesmanlike approach to some \nserious and troubling budget issues in this year's defense budget.\n  This year the defense budget is once again confronted with a serious \nmismatch between the DoD/OMB and the CBO estimates of the outlays \nneeded to execute the programs in the budget. CBO's estimate was $3.7 \nbillion higher than OMB and DoD's estimate.\n  Becuase the President's proposed defense budget was right up against \nthe discretionary spending caps adopted in the Bipartisan Budget \nAgreement, compensating for CBO scoring would require large reductions \nin manpower, procurement, or readiness, or all three. Cuts like that \nare simply not acceptable.\n  Thanks in large part to the cooperation we received from the Chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee and of the Appropriations Committee, \nfrom CBO and from OMB, we were able to devise a solution to much of the \nproblem. The solution has three parts:\n  First, Congress would legislate policies recommended by the \nAdministration to better manage cash in DoD's Working Capital Funds. \nThis would lower fiscal year 1999 outlays by $1.3 billion.\n  Second, Congress would agree to changes in two classified accounts in \nthe Air Force budget that would lower 1999 outlays by $700 million.\n  Third, Congress would enact asset sales amounting to roughly $700 \nmillion.\n  The Chairmen of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee have assured me that taken together these actions reduce the \n1999 outlay shortage to manageable dimensions and help avoid the \nnegative effect on readiness or modernization that was feared.\n  Mr. President, I have reviewed the text of the 1999 Defense \nAuthorization bill, and I believe we are within reach of the solution. \nHowever, I have a concern.\n  The cash management provisions of DoD's Working Capital Funds \ncontains a waiver clause for the Secretary of Defense that is very \nbroad. I am concerned that some in the Department may find this waiver \nauthority too tempting to resist and will use up the outlays intended \nto be left in the cash reserves of the Working Capital Funds. Unless \nthere are truly extraordinary and compelling reasons that are not now \napparent to us, I believe it would be a very serious mistake to use the \navailable waiver authority. Doing so would certainly destroy the \ncooperation and trust that has been built up this year with the Defense \nDepartment and OMB as we worked together to address this outlay \nproblem.\n  Assuming there is no unwarranted use of the waiver authority granted \nin the amendment, I believe we can say we have bridged this problem \nthis year. Next year, I very strongly hope we will receive more \naccurate outlay estimates from those who have in the past tended to \nunderestimate them. It is unacceptable to receive such miscounts of \noutlays and then to be told that for Congress to adopt more accurate \nestimates, the readiness and modernization of our Armed Forces must be \nreduced. I hope this is the last time we are forced to address this \nissue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Momentarily, as acting leader, I will address the Senate.\n  On behalf of Senator Lott, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nInhofe now be recognized to offer an amendment relative to BRAC and \nthere be 30 minutes equally divided for debate tonight. Following that \ndebate, the amendment be laid aside. I further ask that Senator Harkin \nthen be recognized to offer an amendment relative to VA health care, \nand there be 1 hour of debate equally divided for debate tonight, and \nthe amendment then be laid aside.\n  I further ask that, at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, Senator Wellstone be \nrecognized to offer an amendment relative to DOD schools and there be \n30 minutes equally divided; following the conclusion or yielding back \nof time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the amendment, \nwith no amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  I further ask that, following the disposition of the Wellstone \namendment, the Senate resume the Inhofe amendment for 10 minutes of \nclosing remarks, to be equally divided, and the vote then occur on or \nin relation to the Inhofe amendment, with no amendments in order prior \nto the vote.\n  I further ask that, following the vote on or in relation to the \nInhofe amendment, there be 10 minutes of debate on the Harkin \namendment, and the vote then occur on or in relation to the Harkin \namendment, with no amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  Is there any objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I didn't quite hear all \nthat, but there has always been sort of a comity in the Senate where we \nalternate from side to side on amendments. It seems to me the last \ncouple of amendments have been on the other side. It would seem to be \nonly logical that the next amendment be on this side.\n  I ask the Senator if we couldn't do that. I only need about 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the Senator to at least consider that the amendment \nI have to offer is not a Republican\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\namendment. We have just as many Democrats as Republicans. I have been \nwaiting for 6\\1/2\\ hours to take it up. It will be very short. We have \nagreed to a time agreement, and we will not even take that much time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a time agreement also, and I have been waiting all \nday. I will take only about 15 minutes on mine.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have been on the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We usually go back and forth on these things.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if at this point the two Senators could sort \nthis out in such a way that we could proceed tonight. I understand the \nSenator from Arizona also desires some time, 5 minutes on the Inhofe \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we reduce both debates tonight to 20 minutes, that \nmight resolve this problem.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If I can go first, I am agreeable to that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That would put you on until just before 9 o'clock. That \nwould put me up about 9 o'clock. I still don't know why we can't go \nback and forth like we have always done in the past.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have to say to the Senator, I was not in the chair as \nthe manager at the time the agreement was drawn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I want to ask one \nclarification. I understand this unanimous consent would preclude \nsecond-degree amendments at any time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Prior to the vote, that is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. At any time prior to?\n  Mr. WARNER. Any time prior to the vote.\n  Mr. President, I repeat the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have a further announcement for \nSenators. For the information of all Senators, there will be no further \nvotes tonight. Several Members have agreed to remain tonight to debate \nother amendments, and there will be three votes occurring at 10 a.m., \nwith a few minutes debate between the second and third votes.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2981\n\n (Purpose: To modify the restrictions on the general authority of the \nDepartment of Defense regarding the closure and realignment of military \n installations, to express the sense of the Congress on further rounds \n       of such closures and realignments, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself and Mr. \n     Dorgan, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lott, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n     Smith of New Hampshire, Ms. Collins, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n     Sessions, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Conrad and Mr. \n     Cleland, proposes an amendment numbered 2981.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FURTHER ROUNDS OF BASE \n                   CLOSURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) While the Department of Defense has proposed further \n     rounds of base closures, there is no need to authorize in \n     1998 a new base closure commission that would not begin its \n     work until three years from now, in 2001;\n       (2) While the Department of Defense has submitted a report \n     to the Congress in response to Section 2824 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, that report--\n       (A) based its estimates of the costs and savings of \n     previous base closure rounds on data that the General \n     Accounting Office has described as ``inconsistent'', \n     ``unreliable'' and ``incomplete'';\n       (B) failed to demonstrate that the Defense Department is \n     working effectively to improve its ability to track base \n     closure costs and savings resulting from the 1993 and 1995 \n     base closure rounds, which are ongoing;\n       (C) modeled the savings to be achieved as a result of \n     further base closure rounds on the 1993 and 1995 rounds, \n     which are as yet incomplete and on which the Department's \n     information is faulty; and\n       (D) projected that base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005 \n     would not produce substantial savings until 2008, a decade \n     after the federal government will have achieved unified \n     budget balance, and 5 years beyond the planning period for \n     the current congressional budget and Future Years Defense \n     Plan;\n       (3) Section 2824 required that the Congressional Budget \n     Office and the General Accounting Office review the Defense \n     Department's report, and--\n       (A) The General Accounting Office stated on May 1 that ``we \n     are now conducting our analysis to be able to report any \n     limitations that may exist in the required level of detail. . \n     . . [W]e are awaiting some supporting documentation from the \n     military services to help us finish assessing the report's \n     information.'';\n       (B) The Congressional Budget Office stated on May 1 that \n     its review is ongoing, and that ``it is important that CBO \n     take the time necessary to provide a thoughtful and accurate \n     evaluation of DoD's report, rather than issue a preliminary \n     and potentially inaccurate assessment.'';\n       (4) The Congressional Budget Office recommended that ``The \n     Congress could consider authorizing an additional round of \n     base closures if the Department of Defense believes that \n     there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of \n     BRAC have been carried out. That consideration, however, \n     should follow an interval during which DoD and independent \n     analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have \n     been taken thus far.''\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that:\n       (1) Congress should not authorize further rounds of base \n     closures and realignments until all actions authorized by the \n     Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 are \n     completed; and\n       (2) The Department of Defense should submit forthwith to \n     the Congress the report required by Section 2815 of Public \n     Law 103-337, analyzing the effects of base closures and \n     realignments on the ability of the Armed Forces to \n     remobilize, describing the military construction projects \n     needed to facilitate such remobilization, and discussing the \n     assets, such as air space, that would be difficult to \n     reacquire in the event of such remobilization.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that the time \non both amendments has now been reduced to 20 minutes.\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I did not agree to that. I am sorry, that \nhad to do with something else. I still reserve the amount of time that \nwas requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the original order, the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, gets 30 minutes, equally divided, and the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin, gets 1 hour, equally divided. That is the \noriginal order.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think I probably will voluntarily cut this down. It \ndepends on who shows up and wants to be heard.\n  Mr. President, as I have said in response to the comment by the \nSenator from Iowa, this is not really a Republican amendment. We have, \ncertainly, Senator Daschle, Senator Dorgan, Senator Cleland, Senator \nConrad, and many Democrats who are supporting this amendment.\n  The need for this amendment came up when several comments were made \nby members of the administration, primarily Acting Secretary Peters of \nthe Air Force, making statements that, ``We don't care whether or not \nwe are authorized to have further BRAC rounds, we are going to go ahead \nand close bases anyway.''\n  Later in this discussion, I will actually offer some of the quotes \nthat were made. Right now, I will merely explain what this amendment \ndoes. It does essentially five things.\n  First of all, the current language, in order for a military facility \nto be closed without Congress' consent, has a threshold of 300 civilian \nemployees. Let me stress, that is civilian employees, not military \nemployees. This bill will reduce that number to 225.\n  Now, my original bill would have reduced it to 150. I still like that \nbetter. However, I was willing to accommodate the concerns of several \nDemocrats and other people who wanted to have 225. The effect of this \nwould mean that if they tried to close a military base, they could not \ndo it without our consent unless that base had more than 225 civilian \nemployees.\n  No. 2, in the event that realignment became the desire of the \nservices--Department of Defense--that they could not do it if there \nwere as many as 750 civilian positions or 40 percent of the total \ncivilians authorized to be employed.\n  The current language has a threshold of 1,000 civilian employees at \n50 percent of the total civilians authorized to be employed. So this \nagain is dropping that down a modest amount, by approximately 25 \npercent.\n  No. 3, we clarify the definition of closure. The reason we feel this \nis necessary is that there have been statements made like, ``We will \njust transfer it to a caretaker status, or a state of inaction or \nabandonment.'' What we are doing is expanding the definition in the law \nof closure to include these statements, so that someone cannot do this \nand circumvent the closure requirements by saying we are not closing, \nwe are just abandoning or putting it into a state of inaction.\n  On this, I pause at this point and say, if you stop and think about \nevery community in America that might have some type of a facility, \nthey would not know, they would not be prepared in advance as to \nwhether or not somebody is going to try to make it inactive or put it \ninto caretaker status. We want to be straightforward and say if you are \ngoing to close it, you are going to close it--using those terms.\n  No. 4, we will add a provision that requires a waiting period of 4 \nyears after a realignment before a base could be closed, if that \nrealignment drops the civilian workforce below the new threshold of 225 \ncivilians. Our concern here is that this can be circumvented and we \ncould be left out of the loop as the U.S. Senate if they were able to \ntake it one step at a time and say, fine, we are going to go ahead and \nrealign, and next week we will come and realign some more and have the \neffect of closing a base entirely, regardless of the number of \nemployees, if they are willing to do that. This would preclude that.\n  Lastly, it is the sense of the Senate that there is no need to \nreauthorize for the year 2001 in this 1998 authorization bill. There is \nno reason in the world that we can't have more time to consider this \nand to see how current law works and maybe address this again in the \n1999 authorization bill. It would not make any difference at all; it \nwould still be the year 2001.\n  These are essentially the changes in the current law that this \namendment would offer.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't have any requests for time on my side.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment sends the wrong message to \nevery single person in the Defense Department. That message is: Do as I \nsay, not as I do. We are telling the Department of Defense to be more \nefficient, to adopt better business practices, to do more with less, to \ngo faster in reshaping the military for the threats of the 21st \ncentury.\n  We are pushing the DOD to have their inventory maintained more \nefficiently, to cut acquisition personnel, cut headquarters personnel, \ncut the number of ships and aircraft and combat troops. But, \napparently, the military forces of the future that some colleagues have \nin mind will cut equipment, people, and supplies, but leave all the \nempty buildings standing to impress people.\n  This amendment tells our soldiers that despite what we say, our real \npriority would be to protect our turf back home, instead of protecting \nthe well-being of our future soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. \nEvery single top uniformed military and civilian military have told us \nthat the reality is that the money we spend maintaining more bases than \nwe need is money that we can't spend buying our troops the things that \nthey do need.\n  You know, it is one thing not to authorize some more BRAC rounds, and \nit is something altogether different to make even an alignment that is \ncurrently possible without BRAC, to make that more difficult. This \namendment takes us in exactly the wrong direction. It will make \nreductions more difficult than they are now.\n  I happen to support BRAC rounds, but that is not the issue here. The \nissue here isn't whether we add a round or two rounds of BRAC, as much \nas that may be necessary in the judgment of some of us; the issue here \nis whether or not we make it more difficult to realign facilities that \nare currently realignable without BRAC. This amendment will make it \nmore difficult.\n  If this amendment is adopted, it is either going to kill this bill, \nor if the President does sign a bill that includes this provision--\nwhich is a very uncertain prospect--it is going to put a very large \nwrench into the Defense Department's gears and bring the Defense \nDepartment's efforts to make its base structure more rational and \nefficient to a grinding halt.\n  The Secretary and Deputy Secretary are trying to move the Defense \nDepartment into the 21st century. This amendment is trying to set the \nDefense Department in concrete.\n  This is what Secretary Cohen wrote to Chairman Thurmond and me on \nJune 22:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the Department \n     of Defense's strong opposition to an amendment to the fiscal \n     year 1999 Defense Authorization Bill that has been proposed \n     by Senators Inhofe and Dorgan. If enacted, this amendment \n     would further restrict the Department's already limited \n     ability to adjust the size and composition of its base \n     structure. The Department will have views on other provisions \n     in the Authorization Bill as well, but I want to draw your \n     attention to this particular amendment before the Senate \n     completes consideration of your bill.\n       The Department can undertake closures and realignments only \n     after first complying with the requirements of 10 USC 2687. \n     As a practical matter, section 2687 greatly restricts the \n     Department for taking any action to reduce base capacity at \n     installations with more than 300 civilians authorized. The \n     amendment being proposed would extend the application of \n     section 2687 to an even greater number of installations.\n       This proposal would seriously undermine my capacity to \n     manage the Department of Defense. Even after eight years of \n     serious attention to the problem, we still have more \n     infrastructure than we need to support our forces. Operating \n     and maintaining a base structure that is larger than \n     necessary has broad, adverse consequences for our military \n     forces. It diverts resources that are critical\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\n     to maintaining readiness and funding a robust modernization \n     program. It spreads a limited amount of operation and \n     maintenance funding too thinly across DoD's facilities, \n     degrading the quality of life and operational support on \n     which readiness depends. It prevents us from adapting our \n     infrastructure to keep pace with the operational and \n     technical innovations that are at the cornerstone of our \n     strategy for the 21st century. In short, this amendment would \n     be a step backward that would harm our long-term security by \n     protecting unnecessary infrastructure.\n       I urge you to oppose the Inhofe/Dorgan amendment during \n     floor consideration of the Authorization Bill. Its passage \n     would put the entire bill at risk. Congress has given me the \n     responsibility to organize and manage the Department's \n     operations efficiently. I need to preserve my existing \n     authority to fulfill that responsibility.\n\n  Mr. President, I think all of us who are on the Armed Services \nCommittee--including my friend who is proposing this amendment--are \nvery sensitive to that question. We want an authorization bill, we want \nto get an authorization bill to the President, and we want him to sign \nan authorization bill. The Secretary of Defense is telling us in this \nletter, in his words, that passage of this amendment would ``put the \nentire bill at risk.''\n  There are many ways in which this amendment would make it more \ndifficult for the Defense Department to realign bases that are \ncurrently realignable. It does that by changing, reducing the number of \ncivilians at a base that would require notification to Congress, or \nwould require realignment action by a base closing commission. This \namendment lowers the threshold for any base with 300 people to a base \nwith 225 civilians. Even though the current definition of 300 captures \nall of our major installations, this amendment would go deeper. This \namendment would make it more difficult for the Secretary of Defense to \nmake the kind of efficiencies that we are demanding everywhere else in \nthe defense budget.\n  So I hope this amendment will be rejected. It is a step in the wrong \ndirection. If we don't have what, in my judgment, is the courage to \nadopt an additional round or two rounds of BRAC--of Base Closing \nCommission--with the power to make a recommendation to us and the \nPresident, and a certainty that that would be voted on--if we don't \nhave the courage to do that because it will put at risk facilities in \neach of our States, for heaven's sake, we should not go backwards, dig \nourselves into a deeper hole, require lesser efficiencies instead of \ngreater efficiencies. We should not set the Department of Defense in \ndeeper concrete, thicker concrete than it already is in. So I hope that \nthis amendment will be rejected.\n  I thank our colleague, Senator Inhofe, for a number of things.\n  One is his willingness to raise this amendment tonight, even though \nit means there will be less time tomorrow for us to debate this \namendment. His willingness to offer this amendment tonight is very \ncourteous to all of us who are trying to move this bill. I thank him \nfor that courtesy, and many other courtesies which he has extended.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from Michigan. It has been a very \nhelpful step to enable us to keep moving here tonight.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee \nexpressed its views regarding base closure when it voted 10 to 8 \nagainst an amendment that would have authorized additional base closure \nrounds. I fully support that decision although I have an open mind on \nfuture legislation, especially if the Administration makes a better \ncase for additional rounds and the rounds are scheduled after the \ncurrent base closure activities are completed.\n  In regard to the amendment before us, I believe it will have little \nif any impact on whether or not we will close additional bases. The \namendment is in reaction to the Department's threat to close bases by \nattriting personnel below the 300 threshold set by section 2687 of \ntitle 10. While I do not believe that this is an idle threat, reducing \nthe threshold to 225 personnel will have little or no impact.\n  To close or realign bases under section 2687, the Department of \nDefense must notify Congress as part of its request for authorization \nof appropriations and must provide the Congress an evaluation of \nfiscal, local economic, budgetary, environmental, strategic, and \noperational consequences of proposed closures and realignments. One of \nthe most important drawbacks to the section 2687 process is the \nrequirement to complete a full environmental study under the provisions \nof the National Environmental Policy Act before a closure or \nrealignment decision is made and sent to Congress. While such studies \nare under way, usually for a period of 12 to 18 months, litigation is \nlikely to arise, effectively derailing the proposed closure and \nrealignment. Additionally, individual actions can be thwarted by \nwithholding the appropriation of funds to execute a closure or \nrealignment. Section 2687 has effectively prevented DoD from reducing \nits infrastructure through closures or realignments at any of its \nsignificant facilities.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is unnecessary and I urge the Senate \nto reject the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the BENS Tail-to-Tooth Commission, and a letter from \nTaxpayers for Common Sense.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Bens Tail-To-Tooth Commission,\n\n                                                    June 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thurmond: We are writing to express our strong \n     opposition to the Dorgan-Inhofe Amendment to the FY1999 \n     Defense Authorization bill. This amendment severely hampers \n     the Pentagon's ability to rationally manage its military \n     bases and personnel.\n       As members of the BENS Tail-to-Tooth Commission, we all \n     share a commitment to reforming the Department of Defense so \n     that we can invest savings in new procurement and enhancing \n     the readiness of our military forces. the Senate is on record \n     in support of these goals; yet, the Dorgan-Inhofe amendment \n     moves us in the opposite direction. By locking in the status \n     quo, this proposal prevents the Pentagon from making rational \n     business decision that will save money, and most importantly, \n     improve the support provided to service members.\n       Under this plan, the Pentagon is required to prepare costly \n     and time consuming impact statements when it proposes to move \n     as few as ten civilian employees. It also provides unfair \n     protection to numerous facilities that would be declared off \n     limits should be the Base Closure and Realignment Commission \n     be authorized in the future.\n       Passage of the Dorgan-Inhofe amendment would be a major \n     blow to the cause of smart management. the cost to taxpayers, \n     and most important, to the troops will be significant. We \n     urge you to oppose this ill-conceived proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n         Admiral Stanley R. Arthur, USN (Ret.); Mr. Raphael \n           Benaroya; Mr. Denis A.

Weston.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n   oppose dorgan/inhofe amendment to make it harder to realign small \n                             military bases\n\n       Dear Senator: When the Senate considers S. 2057, the Fiscal \n     Year 1999 Defense Authorization Bill, we urge you to vote \n     against the Dorgan/Inhofe Amendment, which would make it more \n     difficult to realign and consolidate small military \n     installations. The amendment would require Department of \n     Defense (DoD) to waste money that could otherwise be used to \n     reduce overall defense spending or pay for improved readiness \n     or weapons procurement. The amendment would be a disservice \n     to both taxpayers and soldiers.\n       Currently, the law restricts DoD's ability to close bases \n     that have authorizations for 300 or more civilians. The law \n     also restricts realignments at installations with over 300 \n     civilians authorized when the realignment involves the \n     reduction or relocation of more than fifty percent of \n     civilians authorized. The amendment expands the scope of the \n     restrictions by decreasing the 300 person threshold to 225 \n     and restricting realignments\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\n     at all installations if such action affects 40 percent or \n     more of the civilians authorized.\n       To illustrate, an installation as few as ten civilians \n     could not realign more than three employee positions without: \n     (1) notifying Congress of the proposed action as part of \n     DoD's request for defense authorizations; (2) providing \n     Congress with an evaluation of the fiscal, local economic, \n     budgetary and environmental impact, strategic, and \n     operational consequences of proposed closures and \n     realignments; (3) conducting a full environmental study \n     before the proposal is sent to Congress; and (4) then waiting \n     30 legislative days or 60 calendar after notifying Congress \n     before executing the realignment.\n       There is no need to compel the DoD to maintain Cold War \n     infrastructures now that the Cold War has ended. The proposed \n     amendment would make it all but impossible for the DoD to \n     reorganize, consolidate, or close unnecessary small bases. \n     Every excessive base, airfield, depot and station undermines \n     U.S. national security and wastes taxpayer money. We urge you \n     to allow DoD to retain one of the tools it needs to provide \n     the American people with the best possible defense our tax \n     dollars can buy. Vote ``NO'' to the Dorgan/Inhofe Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ralph DeGennaro,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have a few comments.\n  Ironically, I was the author of the last base closure legislation. I \nsaw right here just a day or so ago Senator Dixon of Illinois. He was \nmy other principal author of that resolution.\n  I think it is absolutely essential that the United States reduce its \ninfrastructure and enable the Secretary today and the Secretaries of \nDefense thereafter to husband those funds from the reduction as best \nthey can and channel those needed dollars into readiness and \nmodernization, and all types of things that have a much, much higher \npriority than so much of the excess that we now have in the military \nstructure.\n  The last time we considered this BRAC concept in the committee, I \nvoted against it simply because I was so disheartened by some of the \nprocedures with regard to certain bases in California, and then \nsubsequent revelation of letters from an individual in the Secretary of \nDefense's Office which clearly indicated to me a certain bias.\n  We just have to get politics out of this process someday. I am not \nsure when that will be. But as soon as we can come up with some system \nwhich guarantees elimination of politics, then you can count on the \nSenator from Virginia supporting the BRAC process going forward. In the \nmeantime, I register my opposition against my good friend and fellow \nMember.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to clarify the time of the minority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan controls 5 minutes \n45 seconds. The Senator from Oklahoma has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield that 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was looking at the amendment. I find it \nto be very interesting.\n  First of all, there is a very strongly worded letter from the \nSecretary of Defense:\n\n       Congress has given me the responsibility to organize and \n     manage the Department's operations efficiently. I need to \n     preserve my existing authority to fulfill that \n     responsibility.\n\n  I think Secretary Cohen's words are very important. We should keep \nthem in mind.\n  Mr. President, I was looking at this amendment. There is a \nprohibition, and there is a sense-of-the-Senate part of the prohibition \nwhich says, ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no action may \nbe taken, and no funds appropriated, or otherwise available to the \nDepartment of Defense, may be obligated or expended to effect, or \nimplement, the closure of a military installation within 4 years after \nthe completion of a realignment of the installation.''\n  That alone--``. . . or with other causes, reduce the number of \ncivilian personnel employed at that installation below 225.''\n  I find that an astonishing clause. First of all, civilian employment \nseems to be the case here. Second of all, 4 years?\n  Suppose you had an installation--I ask the Senator from Oklahoma--\nthat had 230 civilian employees, and a contract at the base at the \nPentagon was canceled, therefore negating the need for the civilian \nworkers, and reduce them by 6, down from 230, down to 224. Nothing can \nbe done by the Secretary of Defense for 4 years? This is a very unusual \nrestraint that we are attempting to impart on the Secretary of Defense.\n  Second of all, on the sort of findings here, there is one finding \nthat should be leading of all in this; that is, base closures save \nmoney. That is something that we seem to avoid in this debate--that \nfact. If base closures didn't save money, Mr. President, we made a \nhorrible mistake at the end of World War II. Do you know? We made a \nterrible mistake at the end of World War II, because there were \nthousands of bases around America. Do you know what? We closed them. I \ncan't imagine how much that must have cost the taxpayer in order to \nclose those thousands of bases.\n  I sit here and listen to arguments that closing bases costs money. Of \ncourse it costs money in the short term. You are cleaning up an \ninstallation. But everybody knows that in the long term it saves money. \nAnd, unless we do so, you cannot hope to fund the modernization of the \nforce and all of the other requirements that we need to meet the \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Defense estimates that they need to \nclose about 50 major facilities and realign 25 others. That is so they \ncan match infrastructure to force size and structure.\n  I hear many, many hours of debate on the base closing issue, but I \ndon't hear the debate that I think is necessary on the floor of the \nSenate in order to maintain our national defense capability--the \noverall question. We are spending less and less on defense. We are \nputting more money into pork barrel projects, and we are allowing a \nbase to close. The ultimate result is that you reduce the capability of \nthe military force.\n\n  Not only did we turn back in committee. I was sorry that the Senator \nfrom Virginia chose to vote against the amendment in committee. Not \nonly did we vote in committee against any base closing round anytime in \nthe near future, but now we are going to restrict even the ability of \nthe Secretary of Defense to move people around from one base to another \nin keeping with the changing mission.\n  I, frankly, first of all, don't understand the argument that somehow \nclosing bases doesn't save money. As I say, if we did, we made a \nterrible mistake after World War II and after the Korean war and after \nthe Vietnam war.\n  The other thing I don't understand is how we can worry about the \nCongressional Budget Office. The May 1 review is ongoing, and it is for \nthe Congressional Budget Office to take the time necessary to provide a \nthoughtful and accurate evaluation of DOD's report rather than issue a \npreliminary and potentially inaccurate assessment.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, in a remarkable act of courage, says \nthe Congressional Budget Office recommended the Congress could consider \nauthorizing an additional round of base closing if the Department of \nDefense believes there is a surplus of military capacity.\n  Is there anybody who thinks that the Department of Defense doesn't \nbelieve there is a surplus of military capacity? After all, BRAC rounds \nhave been carried out. This consideration, however, should follow an \ninterval during which DOD and independent analysts examine the actual \nimpact of the measures that have been taken thus far.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the amendment.\n  I ask for an additional minute from the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is out of time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope someday that we will address the \nissues on this floor--like 11,100 military families on food stamps, \nlike men and women who are leaving the military in droves because they \ndo not have the equipment to fight with and operate with, like the \nincredible long deployments that we are sending these\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nmen and women on, like the fact that we are not prepared to meet the \npost-cold-war challenges in any reasonable and responsible way. \nInstead, we seem to spend our time arguing and fighting over a base \nclosing. I think, frankly, it is something we ought to get resolved and \nbehind us. If we never want to close a base, let's do that. But let's \nnot go through this every single year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I have so much respect for \nboth the Senator from Arizona and the Senators from Michigan and \nVirginia. I have to say, I am sure the Senator from Arizona would agree \nthat there is no stronger proponent for a strong national defense than \nI am. We work hard.\n  One of the big problems I have is that we need to look at the overall \npicture. All this talk about base closings is important. I support base \nclosures. I made it very clear that we have time on this. If we do not \nhave base closures until the year 2001, there is no reason to be \naddressing base closures in this bill.\n  Certainly--I also respond to the Senator from Arizona--what he \nreferred to was a sense-of-the-Senate portion of this bill. It says, \n``Notwithstanding any other provision of the law,'' no action would be \ntaken, and no funds appropriated, and so forth, as you read.\n  However, if we should authorize another BRAC process, that would have \nprecedence over this and this would not be in effect.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from Washington has a request \nfor a couple, 3 minutes and I would like to yield to him, and then I \nwill respond to the rest of the comments that have been made.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do not believe that there has been any \nmore successful and imaginative policy with respect to our military \npreparedness than the three base-closing rounds that were created by a \nlaw imagined by the now majority leader of the House of \nRepresentatives, a major contribution to a rational system--at least, \nMr. President, a rational system until the last base closure round \nwhen, in spite of the fact that everyone felt that this issue had been \ntaken out of politics, the President of the United States poisoned the \nwell by totally politicizing the base-closure process.\n  The Senator from Virginia, I think, wisely voted against another \nbase-closure process presided over by this President. I agreed with \nthat proposition on the basis that once again it would become a part of \nthe Presidential campaign in the year 2000, and I will not vote for \nanother such process until we can be guaranteed that we will take it \nout of politics.\n  I am going to vote for the amendment from the Senator from Oklahoma \nperhaps for the same reason that the Senator from Virginia is going to \nvote against it. I am going to vote to emphasize even more forcefully \nthat he has my bitter disappointment in the way in which this important \nprocess was politicized. And I think we need to send a message, yes, \neven to the Department of Defense that we will not permit that kind of \nthing to happen in the future. And this, it seems to me, is a pretty \ngood way to send that message.\n  I wish I could have voted this year for another base-closing round. I \ncannot because of what happened during the course of the last \nPresidential election, and I will support the Senator from Oklahoma \nbecause I think he makes that point even more forcefully.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Washington. I would like to \ninquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma controls 6 minutes \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me clarify something. I \ndo support the process. It happens that I was elected to the other body \nin 1986, and that is when Representative Dick Armey from the State of \nTexas came out with the whole idea that we have got to close down some \nof the infrastructure that is no longer needed. We understand that. But \nwe can't do it because of the politics that are there.\n  So he devised a system, and that system was devised to take the \npolitics out of it, and it worked. If there were time, I would read the \nstatement he made on the floor of the House of Representatives when he \nfound out he had to do something that was bad for his State of Texas, \nand he was willing to do it to save the system, the integrity of the \nsystem that was designed to take politics out of it.\n  Now, as the Senator from Washington said, politics were reinserted, \nand when that happened I think several of us felt we had to ensure that \ndid not happen again. And so some of the people, wisely perhaps, said \nthat, well, we can do that by waiting until after this President is no \nlonger in office, 2001.\n\n  My concern there is I don't know who is going to be the Republican \nnominee or who is going to be the Democratic nominee or who will \nultimately be the next President of the United States. But if that \nPresident should be inclined to do so, it would be a tremendous \ntemptation for him to use the same politics that President Clinton \nused, because if he doesn't do it, he is not using the full force of \nhis office. That is a precedent that has been set. We are trying to \nstop that now.\n  I would like to respond to the distinguished Senator from Michigan. \nHe made the statement about money being saved. I have supported every \neffort to increase our defense spending. For 15 consecutive years now \nwe have actually reduced defense spending when many people a lot \nsmarter than I am agreed with the statement that I have made when I \nsaid that I feel the threat that is facing America is greater today \nthan it was even during the cold war because of the nonpredictability, \nthe unpredictability of the threat that is out there, the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction, the fact there are missiles out there \nright now that can reach all the way to any city in the United States \nof America. And it has been recently disclosed by some newspapers that \nthere are, in fact, some missiles, some CSS-4 missiles in China that \nare targeted at the United States.\n  Now, I anticipate the President will come back and say, I \naccomplished the retargeting of these things. However, if you remember \nthe Anthony Lake hearings, we documented the fact that retargeting can \ntake place in as short as 3 minutes.\n  So anyway, I would say this as far as money being saved by base \nclosures. It is bleeding right now. We need to have as much money right \nnow in order to try to help our defense system survive. Modernization, \nforce strength, quality of life, all of these we are having very \nserious problems with. We have the lowest retention rate right now we \nhave had in the history of some of the services, including the Air \nForce. It costs $6 million to put someone in the seat of an F-16 and \nyet we are losing the pilots. I heard an unofficial report today it is \nnot a retention of 25 percent. It is now down below 20 percent. That is \nvery serious.\n  But let's look at where we can really fund the services. The first \nthing I would do, if I were responding to the Senator from Michigan, is \nget us out of Bosnia. Right now, that was supposed to cost us some $1.2 \nbillion. Now it is over $9 billion direct, and I suggest about twice \nthat much money in reality.\n  I would also comment that as far as Senator Cohen's statement that \nthis might draw a veto, I find it very difficult to believe that a bill \nthat is supported by the number of Democrats that are supporting this \nbill, including the minority leader, Tom Daschle, is going to draw a \nveto. This is a threat that is always there. And I would also comment \nthat Secretary Cohen, when he was Senator Cohen, would have been right \nup here with me supporting this amendment. And if anyone questions \nthat, I can document that.\n  Thirdly, when you talk about the courage to do a BRAC, yes, we need \nto do it. We have to first protect the integrity of the system. That is \nwhat the Senator from Washington is saying, and that is exactly what I \nwant to do. I want to reduce more infrastructure. I made that \nstatement. I have said that we need to do it professionally and it \nneeds to be done out of politics.\n  Lastly, when the Senator from Virginia talked about taking politics \nout of the process, I really think the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia gave a pretty good argument for my amendment. So I understand \nthat tomorrow\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\nwe are going to have--my time has expired, but we are going to have 10 \nminutes equally divided. Senator Dorgan and some other Senators who are \nnot here tonight have asked to have that time, which I will yield to \nthem tomorrow.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that concludes the number of \nspeakers who desire to address this amendment. I would simply close by \nsaying that I take very seriously the letter by our distinguished \nformer colleague, the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, and I put my \nbottom dollar on his integrity to see that this process would work \nwithout politics. I really do. I feel strongly about that. So for that \nreason I strongly oppose the amendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think we go to our distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Inhofe amendment \n2981 is set aside until tomorrow.\n  Mr. WARNER. Set aside pursuant to the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the order.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And the Senator from Iowa is recognized to \npresent an amendment upon which there is 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2982\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize a transfer of funds from the Department of \n    Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs for health care.)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk. I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 2982.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . TRANSFER TO DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) Transfer Required.--The Secretary of Defense is \n     authorized to transfer to the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     $329,000,000 of the amounts appropriated for the Department \n     of Defense pursuant to the authorizations of appropriations \n     in this Act. In the case of any such transfer, the Secretary \n     shall select the funds for transfer, and shall transfer the \n     funds, in a manner that causes the least significant harm to \n     the readiness of the Armed Forces and the quality of life of \n     military personnel and their families.\n       (b) Use of Transferred Funds.--Funds transferred pursuant \n     to subsection (a) shall be available for health care programs \n     of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of colleagues, I do not \nintend to take anywhere near a half hour on this on my side, and \nhopefully will yield back a lot of time so we can get out of here at an \nearly hour.\n  This amendment, pure and simple, is to take some money from the \nDepartment of Defense and put it into the medical account of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. This amendment would transfer $329 \nmillion specifically from the Department of Defense budget to the \nmedical accounts of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Let me be clear \nthat what this amendment will do will not increase the amount of money, \nreally, going to veterans' medical accounts. It will just keep it level \nin accordance with medical inflation.\n  Budgets are about priorities. Tight restrictions on discretionary \nspending over the past several years, and spending caps created last \nyear to balance the budget, have forced some tough choices to be made. \nBut I ask my colleagues, what greater priority can there be than to \ntake care of those who have defended the very right of our country to \nexist? Our veterans have fulfilled the duty they had to serve their \ncountry. Now it is up to this Congress to fulfill our duty, our \nobligation, our solemn promise to provide for our veterans.\n  The needs of our veterans are clear. The aging veteran population, \nrising personnel costs and medical inflation, means that each dollar \nprovided for veterans' health care benefits cannot be stretched as far \nas it used to be. The 5-year budget plan assumed no increases for the \ndiscretionary spending of Veterans Affairs. Let me say that again. The \n5-year budget plan assumed no increases for VA discretionary spending; \nin other words, no taking into account the cost of inflation, and \nespecially medical inflation. The well-being of our veterans must not \nbe subject to second-class status. Veterans' funding deserves to be \nconsidered as more than just an afterthought.\n  My amendment is supported by many veterans and veterans groups. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters of support for my amendment from the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, Incorporated; the Blinded Veterans Association and the \nParalyzed Veterans of America.\n\n\n                            Vietnam Veterans of America, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1998.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of Vietnam Veterans of \n     America (VVA) I want to convey our appreciation and support \n     for your proposed amendment to S. 1812, the FY 1999 National \n     Defense Authorization Act, aiming to transfer resources from \n     the Department of Defense (DOD) to the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) to supplement the medical care budget. VVA has \n     long held the principle belief that the health care and \n     benefits needs of veterans are an ongoing cost of our \n     nation's defense. Your amendment will carry forward with \n     assurance of the Nation's commitment to veterans military \n     service related health care needs.\n       VA medical care, as you know, has been plagued by resource \n     limitations for many years and is currently facing flatline \n     budgets for the next several years. The financial wringer has \n     already squeezed out any opportunities to achieve greater \n     efficiencies. Despite promises from Congress and the \n     Administration to the contrary, the ultimate effect is more \n     restrictive access to medical care because of fewer \n     appropriated dollars. Fewer dollars means fewer veterans will \n     be served, pure and simple. The amendment you are offering \n     would help to counter the effects of increasing medical \n     inflation and personnel costs. Without these additional \n     funds, the only possible effect is denial of services to \n     veterans, many of whom are disabled due to their military \n     service.\n       Some of your colleagues have argued that attrition of the \n     veterans population through deaths of World War II veterans \n     is an indication that VA needs less money to operate. \n     However, this narrow perspective fails to take into account \n     the rising costs of medical care and more importantly the \n     current demographics of the veteran populations; VA health \n     care users are older and sicker than the overall American \n     public. Vietnam veterans now represent the largest group \n     within the veterans population. Many of the Vietnam veterans \n     and a growing population of Persian Gulf War veterans have \n     complex problems relating to herbicide, chemical and other \n     environmental exposures.\n       VVA strongly believes that Congress must commit an adequate \n     annual appropriations to VA medical care programs. Your \n     amendment is a very positive recognition of the current \n     circumstances and needs of America's veterans. Thank you for \n     your initiative to attempt redistributing some DOD funds \n     toward VA medical care.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Kelli Willard West,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Blinded Veterans Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the Blinded Veterans \n     Association (BVA) I am writing to support your proposed \n     amendment to S. 1812, the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1999.

Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America (PVA) I am writing to support your proposed amendment \n     to S. 1812, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1999, which would transfer resources from the Department \n     of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for \n     medical care for veterans.\n       VA medical care is facing a crisis, a crisis resulting from \n     the provision of inadequate resources. Appropriations for VA \n     medical care are proposed to be frozen. Indeed, the \n     Administration's FY 1999 budget for VA medical care requests \n     fewer appropriated dollars, and fewer resources. The \n     amendment that you are offering, along with Senator \n     Wellstone, would provide much-needed additional resources, \n     resources to help counter increases attributable to rising \n     personnel costs and medical inflation. Without these \n     additional dollars, these increases would have to be made up \n     from dollars targeted for the health care needs of veterans.\n       The VA health care system has already been pared to the \n     bone and we doubt there are any more efficiencies that can be \n     realized to offset inadequate resources. VA Under Secretary \n     for Health Dr. Kenneth Kizer has recently acknowledged that \n     without additional resources the VA health care system could \n     soon ``hit the wall.'' Unfortunately, when the system does \n     hit the wall sick and disabled veterans will feel the effect \n     of the collision. We must maintain this Nation's commitment \n     to veterans, and your amendment is a step forward in keeping \n     this commitment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth C. Huber,\n                                               National President.\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I might just quote here from the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica:\n\n       VVA has long held the principle belief that the health care \n     and benefits needs of veterans are an ongoing cost of our \n     Nation's defense.\n\n  I think that is the problem around here. We have a defense budget, \nthen we have a veterans' affairs budget--as if somehow they are \nseparate and distinct and have no connection with one another. I think \nthis sentence really says it clearly:\n\n       . . .the benefits needs of veterans are an ongoing cost of \n     our nation's defense.\n\n  We cannot separate the two.\n\n       Your amendment will carry forward with assurance of the \n     Nation's commitment to veterans' military service-related \n     health care needs.\n\n  The letter from the Vietnam Veterans of America, Incorporated, goes \non and says:\n\n       Some of your colleagues have argued that attrition of the \n     veterans population through deaths of World War II veterans \n     is an indication that VA needs less money to operate. \n     However, this narrow perspective fails to take into account \n     the rising costs of medical care, and more importantly, the \n     current demographics of the veterans population. VA health \n     care users are older and sicker than the overall American \n     public. Vietnam veterans now represent the largest group \n     within the veterans population. Many of the Vietnam veterans \n     and a growing population of Persian Gulf war veterans have \n     complex problems relating to herbicide, chemical and other \n     environmental exposures.\n       VVA strongly believes that Congress must commit an adequate \n     annual appropriations to VA medical care programs. Your \n     amendment is a very positive recognition of the current \n     circumstances and needs of America's veterans. Thank you for \n     your initiative to attempt redistributing some DOD funds \n     towards VA medical care.\n       Sincerely, Kelly Willard West, Director of Government \n     Relations.\n\n  The same thing basically follows through on the Blinded Veterans \nAssociation and the Paralyzed Veterans Association of America. The \nBlinded Veterans Association says:\n\n       The VA health care system has already been pared to the \n     bone, and we doubt there are any more efficiencies that can \n     be realized to offset inadequate resources.\n\n  Fewer dollars means fewer veterans will be served, pure and simple, \nand that is the truth. Fewer dollars means fewer veterans will be \nserved.\n  Let me just, right now, refer to this chart for those who think that \nmay be taking $329 million out of a $271 billion defense budget--think \nabout that, $271 billion, and all we are asking for is $329 million, \njust to get veterans' health care benefits up to meet inflationary \nneeds. If you look at this chart, it shows you how much we are spending \non military of our discretionary budget. If you look at our \ndiscretionary spending, military consumes half of it. Half of all that \nwe spend in this Congress goes to military spending--half, 50 cents out \nof every dollar. Out of the other 50 cents, we take agriculture and \nenergy and Social Security, economic development, transportation, \nscience and space, housing, foreign affairs, foreign aid, health, \njustice, education. We hear all this debate that we are spending too \nmuch on education--6 cents out of every dollar; 6 cents for education, \n50 cents for military spending.\n  We are not talking about all these, we are talking about veterans' \nbenefits. Out of this $1 that we spend here every year, how much goes \nfor veterans' benefits? 3\\1/2\\ pennies--3\\1/2\\ pennies, to meet the \nmedical needs of those who risked life and limb to preserve and protect \nand defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  I think that we can do a little bit better than 3\\1/2\\ pennies. I \nthink the amendment we are offering brings that to just a little under \n4 pennies, if I am not mistaken. Is that too much to ask? It is not too \nmuch to ask when we are taking 50 cents out for defense. I think the \nVietnam Veterans of America had it right. We should not separate \nveterans' benefits out of defense. It is part of the ongoing costs of \nthe defense of this country, and we should not separate the two out.\n  I believe we are meeting our commitments globally. I take a back seat \nto no one in saying that we are the world's most powerful nation, that \nwe have a lot of commitments globally, that we have to meet those \ncommitments. We are meeting those commitments and we will continue to \nmeet them. And taking $329 million out of the defense budget is not \ngoing to harm that one little bit. But what will harm us, if we do not \nmeet this commitment, is that many of our veterans, our Vietnam \nveterans, now today many of our Korean war veterans and even some of \nour World War II veterans, they are getting older--they are living \nlonger, just as the demographics of our country are--they are living \nlonger; they are sicker. There are leftover problems that they have \nthat maybe were not indicated when they were in the military, such as \nherbicide and chemical poisoning and things like that, that now later \non they are suffering from.\n  What happens if we do not meet their medical needs? Aside from the \npersonal suffering and the personal hardship that they and their \nfamilies have to undergo, what happens is that younger people in their \nfamilies and their friends look upon them and they say, ``Wait a \nminute. Here is someone who went to the Persian Gulf. Here is a veteran \nwho fought in Vietnam. Maybe here is someone who was in Korea, and yet \nthey are not being cared for? A lot of the funding has to come out of \ntheir own pockets to meet their medical needs?''\n  I would imagine a lot of younger people would say: Why would I ever \nwant to go in the military? If we promised to meet their health care \nneeds and later on we don't live up to that obligation, what does that \nsay to our younger people who we want to enlist and become active duty \nmembers of our armed services?\n  I think our lack of spending adequate resources to keep up with at \nleast inflation in veterans' health care benefits has a deleterious \neffect on the security of our Nation. I see this amendment as not just \nsomething helping the veterans and meeting the obligation that we have \nto our present-day veterans, but I see this amendment as really meeting \nthe future security needs of our country by saying to those who come \nalong next, who may be asked to go to some other place in the world to \ndefend this country, to defend our vital national interest, it says to \nthem, ``When you are in that position, we're going to meet your \nobligations, too.''\n  I just feel very strongly that this is something that we have to do \nas a society. I am not trying to goldplate anything. I am not trying to \nboost veterans' medical benefits' spending way pie high in the sky. I \nam simply saying at least we ought to keep up with inflation. We do \nthat here. We kept up with inflation in energy and agriculture, \nnational affairs, justice, education--we keep up basically with \ninflation. Why shouldn't we do this for our veterans, also?\n  As the Independent Budget Project of the veterans' groups have \npointed out, tens of thousands of Americans who now stand in harm's way \nin Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, and other troubled spots\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\naround the world will be the veterans of tomorrow. It is worth noting \nthat the veterans suffering from the complicated gulf war illnesses may \nend up being a greater financial strain on the system in the future. \nWhat are we going to say to them? Tough luck?\n  In other words, Mr. President, the demand for VA health care will not \ndiminish in the foreseeable future. Just because there are fewer people \ndoesn't mean we can spend fewer dollars. They are living longer, they \nare getting older, and they are sicker, and a lot of the illnesses they \ncontracted haven't shown up. We can't just wish it away.\n  All we are asking is to provide the resources to meet the demand that \nis there. That is what this amendment does. I urge its adoption as the \nfair and equitable and the right thing for our country to do for the \nveterans who fought in World War II, Korea, the Persian Gulf, Vietnam \nand, yes, in Bosnia, too, and for those younger people who are going to \nbe the veterans of tomorrow, we have to meet this obligation.\n  I will point out, I offered this amendment last year, and I didn't \nhave all of the figures down--we do this year--keeping up with \ninflation. This amendment received 41 votes last year on a bipartisan \nbasis. It is less money this year. We are actually asking for less \nmoney this year just to keep up with inflation. I am hopeful Senators \non both sides can see fit to meet the obligation to our veterans.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is not easy to get up and first say to \nmy good friend, who is a veteran, a naval aviator--he achieved \ndistinction in the Navy which I never achieved. I was a simple \nradioman, but anyway, I sat in the backseat of some of those planes you \nflew around in on occasion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, you were my boss at one time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I realize that. I am very humble about my small \ncontribution to national security at the tail end of World War II and \nin Korea. But I was privileged, like so many others, to serve. My \ncontribution was modest. The military did far more good for me than I \nwas able to do in return. Therefore, throughout my career in the \nSenate, I have tried to look after the men and women in the Armed \nForces and, indeed, the veterans, because I find as we grow a little \nolder, we have friends who depart on a regular basis.\n\n  There are some 300,000 men and women who served in World War II who \nconsistently die every month now. It is an alarming fact, considering. \nI would like to ask my good friend a question or two. I studied the \namendment. Your first version of the amendment says:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall transfer to the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs $329 million.\n\n  The one that is before the Senate at this time appears to have been \nchanged:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense is authorized to transfer to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs $329 million.\n\n  I am curious as to one of the reasons the Senator changed from a \nclear statement that it would be shifted as a budget matter, to where \nit now----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was informed--if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. By using that former language, a point of order would \nhave laid against the amendment. To avoid the point of order and, quite \nfrankly, in all legitimacy, since this is an authorizing bill, it \nreally ought to be authorizing language, too.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I read the amendment which is now before the Senate, \nand again I will read--``* * * the Secretary of Defense is authorized \nto transfer * * *''--you are leaving it entirely a discretionary matter \nwith the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is a colloquy. I am delighted to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right. It would be to the Secretary. \nHowever, I think the Secretary would look at how the Senate spoke and \nhow the Congress spoke on this to decide what to do. Obviously, if the \nSenate voted to do this and it was a strong vote, then I think he would \npay attention to it, he or she would pay attention to this.\n  Mr. WARNER. We place the Secretary, one of our very own for whom we \nhave the absolute highest respect, in an awkward position that now \nthese groups will petition him, and he is faced with the tough choice \nof deciding between those who once served with great honor and \ndistinction should receive moneys which he feels very strongly today \nshould go--every penny, every penny--to the quality of life, the \nmodernization of weapons, the operational costs of those who are \ncurrently in uniform today. It puts the Secretary in a very difficult \nposition. This concerns me.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There are priorities to be met and, quite frankly, in \nthis $271 billion defense budget, it is my feeling--and I looked at it, \nI am on Defense Appropriations, I have looked at it and I, quite \nfrankly, believe that the Secretary could find $329 million out of \nthat. I don't think it would do any damage to our readiness, our \ncapabilities overseas or anything else.\n  Quite frankly, I have some comments I was going to talk about--but I \ndecided not to because the hour is late--in terms of what some of the \nIG offices found in terms of waste and inefficiencies in procurement, \nin warehousing and things within the Department of Defense. With a \nlittle bit more oversight and control on those, I think they can yield \ngreat dividends and can be used on this.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in my 19 years, I have heard that argument \nof inefficiency and waste in the Department of Defense. All of us \nrecognize that, and I am sure our Secretary, our former colleague, Bill \nCohen, is doing his very best to try to bring about every kind of \nefficiency he can to generate funds.\n  Frankly, I say to my good friend, Secretary Cohen is desperate for \nmoney. So much of the funding that we have authorized for programs in \nthe past has been diverted to take care of the fulfillment of military \ncommitments as directed by President Clinton. Our military today has \nbeen deployed more times throughout the world than any other President \nhas ever deployed them beyond our shores. The Bosnia commitment alone \nhas absorbed some $9 billion.\n  I ask my friend, I listened very carefully to your statement, and I \nam deeply moved by it. I really think this problem should be addressed, \nand you are saying that we haven't even covered for the modest increase \nin inflation the various costs associated with the care of our \nveterans?\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is my understanding, I say to my very good friend--I \nwant to make this clear at the outset that I have the highest regard \nand respect for the Senator from Virginia and his devotion to this \ncountry and his devotion to the readiness of our military and also his \ndevotion to our veterans. I would not want anyone to misconstrue that I \nam saying the Senator from Michigan or the Senator from Virginia have \nshortchanged it.\n  I understand the obligations that you are under in terms of meeting \nour military commitments. I understand that. This amendment is meant \nonly in good faith to try to meet, I think, another commitment that we \nhave. And in some ways I hope to shed some light, hopefully, on one \naspect of military spending that could be used for our veterans' \naffairs.\n  I say to the Senator that 2 years ago the comptroller general of the \nPentagon concluded that the DOD could not account for over $13 billion \nin spending--just disappeared--$13 billion. Nobody knows where it went. \nWell, I have more examples of that. But if it is just $1 billion, only \none-thirteenth of that, then $329 million is not that much, when you \ntake into account that kind of waste.\n  Quite frankly, I must tell you that I think Secretary Cohen is doing \na great job over there. And they are getting a better handle on this \nall the time. But there is still a long way to go. I think within the \nnext year they could find some of that money and put that in veterans' \nbenefits.\n  Now, lastly, I say to the Senator, I would say that the question had \nto do with, are we not meeting the obligations? And I am saying, when \nyou take into account medical inflation, which is higher than CPI, no, \nwe are not meeting them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I intend to study further the amendment\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\nby my distinguished friend. But I certainly agree with one thing you \nsaid, and that is, the manner in which the United States treats its \nveterans has a direct impact on whether successive generations will \noffer themselves to serve proudly in the uniform of our country. I know \nyou are absolutely right about that. There are many, many cases where \nit is grandfather to father, father to son or daughter, as the case may \nbe, that induces the current generation to proudly come forth and \nvolunteer. That has really been the success of the All Volunteer Force.\n  And what you point out tonight is a very serious situation. And it \nimpacts directly on that argument. I would have to say to my friend, \nbeing a member of the Appropriations Committee, and knowing the \nchairman of the committee himself is a very distinguished veteran of \nWorld War II, an air corps pilot, has my distinguished colleague \nbrought this to his attention? In other words, within the \nappropriations could this sum of money be found?\n  My concern is that I am entrusted, and tonight representing the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, to manage this bill in such a \nway as we do not open up the opportunity for Senators to come in and \ntake pieces of our authorized amount by the Budget Committee to spend \nand put it toward other accounts, because if we begin to do that--for \ninstance, if we would accede here tonight to your request, I could \nanticipate a dozen colleagues coming to the floor tomorrow with \nrequests which they conscientiously feel just as seriously about as you \ndo about yours; and the next thing you know, it would be one after \nanother, to take a piece here and a piece there, and suddenly it would \nbecome very significant--not that this isn't a significant sum of \nmoney.\n\n  We will have to look at this. But I would have to say that I am \nconcerned that we could start a raid on the defense budget here \ntonight. But I hope that this matter can be addressed here in the \nSenate somewhere, be it the Appropriations Committee or the Veterans \nCommittee. I commit to you that if you bring this up in another piece \nof legislation, I will conscientiously see whether or not I can support \nit.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I feel for the position of my friend. And, you \nknow, a lot of us, when we establish friendships, we do not like to put \npeople in difficult positions. I do not like to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not find the position difficult. I feel very \nstrongly about the defense budget. I support the budget process. Your \ncommittee, the Veterans Committee, went through the budget process. Our \ncommittee went through the budget process. We have our allocated funds. \nAnd I am entrusted by the chairman and other members of the committee \nto steadfastly defend that allocation given to us by the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand the responsibility that the Senator has. I \nunderstand that responsibility. And I appreciate that. But, again, as \nthe Senator knows, others of us feel that we also have other \nobligations to try to change some things here and to change some of \nthese budget priorities.\n  In my opening comments, I said that our budget priorities are not \nallowing for this. I am trying to correct it. So I agree with the \nSenator. I do not like the way the budget priorities shortchange our \nveterans' medical benefits. But, again, I also say to my friend, I \nreally believe in what the Vietnam Veterans of America said in their \nletter, that veterans' medical benefits ought to be considered an \nongoing cost of military spending. They are not today.\n  I have always thought that was odd. I have always thought that was an \nodd approach we had on that. And they ought to be considered as part \nand parcel of our military budget. That is why I have offered this \namendment, to transfer a small amount of money out of the total--small \ncompared to the total--at least to keep up with medical inflation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will conclude just with this observation \nof our very able staff director, Les Brownlee, who just handed me a \nnote which indicates that the VA increase in the Senate budget \nprocess--that is, the account for the committee on veterans here in the \nSenate--for the fiscal year 1997 to 1998 was a 12.2 percent increase in \nyour budget, and the DOD increase was less than 2.2 percent. So that is \na fairly significant increase that this communication indicates to me \nand that your committee got.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment \noffered by Senators Harkin and Wellstone to reduce defense spending, \nand any amendment which lowers defense spending below the levels set in \nthe budget agreement. When the Congress approved the budget agreement, \nthe spending limits for each function were set. The Armed Services \nCommittee's challenge was to develop a defense program, within the \nlimits of the budget agreement, that not only supports the national \nsecurity strategy, but balances the needs of short-term readiness with \nthat of the modernization of our forces--all within the context of a \nforeign policy that drives an unprecedented frequency of military \ndeployments.\n  The gap between our military capability and our commitments around \nthe world continues to increase. The unprecedented frequency of \ndeployments places hardships on our young service members and their \nfamilies, producing serious retention and readiness problems. \nContingency and ongoing operations, such as those in Bosnia and Iraq, \ncontinue to drain needed resources for future force modernization and \nthe current readiness of our forces. Since 1996, the Department of \nDefense has been forced to offset almost $9.0 billion for such \noperations. The costs of these ongoing operations, in this fiscal year \nalone, are expected to exceed more than $4.1 billion. Therefore, I \nstrongly believe--and I have stated this previously--that funding for \nBosnia and Southwest Asia operations, and other emerging contingencies, \nmust come from sources other than the defense budget. The funding of \nsuch activities should not be allowed to adversely affect modernization \nefforts or current force readiness.\n  In the past three years, the Congress has added more than $21 billion \nto defense budget requests. Even with these increases, defense spending \nhas continued to decline in real terms. This fiscal year the defense \nrequest again represents, in real terms, a 1.1 percent decline. Defense \nspending as a percentage of GDP in fiscal year 1998 is expected to be \n3.2 percent falling to 2.8 percent by fiscal year 2003--the lowest \nfigures since 1940. The resource levels, as stated in the Budget \nResolution, continue this decline in defense spending. While I continue \nto support the balanced budget agreement, I am concerned about our \nability to modernize our forces and the effects of unbudgeted \ncontingencies and ongoing operations on current readiness.\n  Testimony and recent visits to our units by both members and staff of \nthe Armed Services Committee have revealed disturbing trends: personnel \nshortages, lack of spare parts, extremely high unit operating and \npersonnel tempos, and retention problems--especially with our pilots. \nGeneral Crouch, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, testified to the \nCommittee;\n\n     In recent years, we have maintained readiness at the expense \n     of our modernization accounts. That is no longer a viable \n     strategy.\n\n  Mr. President, we have an obligation to adequately fund for our \nnational security and ensure we provide our servicemen and women with \nthe best equipment available. I grow increasingly concerned when the \nArmed Services Committee receives testimony from one of our Service \nChiefs stating that his funding is inadequate. General Krulak, \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, has told the Committee:\n\n     I state for the third year running that our budget request is \n     not adequate to meet our needs.\n\nHe further stated in a letter to the Committee:\n\n     . . . we are quite literally mortgaging today's health at the \n     expense of tomorrow's wellness--and have been for at least \n     the last eight years--in spite of the critically important \n     congressionally mandated adds to our accounts in the last two \n     years.\n\n  Mr. President, there is a price for freedom. There is the price for \nworld leadership. As Secretary Cohen stated:\n\n     Having highly ready forces that can go anywhere at any time \n     really spells the difference between victory and defeat and \n     it also spells the difference between being a superpower and \n     not being one.\n\n  Mr. President, as a result of the budget agreement reached last year, \nnon defense discretionary spending received significant increases while \ndefense continued its downward spending\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\ntrends--not even keeping pace with inflation. During the fiscal year \n1998 appropriations process, the national security appropriations bill \nhad the lowest percentage increase from fiscal year 1997 funding level \nthan any other of the appropriations bills. In fact, military \nconstruction appropriations had a negative change over the fiscal year \n1997 funding levels, making funding for national defense grow at one-\nfifth the rate of domestic spending increases.\n  Mr. President, I am not opposed to increasing the funding for \nVeterans' health care, but not at the cost of our national security, \nand I strongly urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment and \nnot further aggravate a serious underfunding of our defense.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think it is important that the Chair state the pending \nUC order for the purpose of the Record here for those listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I understand it, does the Senator from \nWashington desire some time on this amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Washington would like about 3 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  Mr. WARNER. On this amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. Not on this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. At the conclusion of this amendment, and all time \nhaving been yielded back, I ask the Chair to recognize the Senator from \nWashington so that he might speak for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday a three judge United States \nAppeals Court panel overturned the preliminary injunction issued \nagainst Microsoft last December by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas \nPenfield Jackson. This ruling by the Appeals Court is a major victory \nfor Microsoft and its supporters. In fact, in my opinion, it is so \nsignificant as to make the Department of Justice's current case against \nMicrosoft even more dubious than it was at the time of filing.\n  The basic question before the panel was whether or not Microsoft \nviolated antitrust law and a 1995 consent decree by integrating its web \nbrowser, Internet Explorer, into its Windows 95 operating system. The \npanel ruled that Microsoft's actions did not violate the consent decree \nand that Microsoft should indeed be allowed to integrate new and \nimproved features into Windows because such integration benefits \nconsumers.\n  The Department of Justice has just suffered a major defeat.\n  The ruling comes only a few weeks after the Antitrust Division of the \nDepartment of Justice filed a new case against Microsoft alleging \nanticompetitive behavior. The central point of the new case is \nMicrosoft's integration of the Internet Explorer into Windows 98.\n  In the new case, the Department of Justice wants Microsoft either to \nremove Internet Explorer from Windows 98 or add a competing browser \nfrom rival Netscape into that Windows 98 program. Department of Justice \nlawyers claim that Internet Explorer is a separate product and that its \nintegration into Windows 98 is a violation of antitrust law. \nInterestingly enough, there are other browser manufacturers, smaller \nthan Netscape, who don't seem to have Department of Justice's ear or \nsponsorship.\n  But in the opinion issued yesterday by the Appeals Court panel, the \njudges ruled that Microsoft's product integration meets the court's \nrequirement that product innovation bring benefits to consumers. The \npanel calls Microsoft's software design ``genuine integration'' and \nrules that the inclusion of Internet Explorer in Window's 95 is not a \nviolation of the consent decree.\n  Further, the panel wrote that, ``Antitrust scholars have long \nrecognized the undesirability of having courts oversee product design, \nand any dampening of technological innovation would be at cross-\npurposes with antitrust law.''\n  It is quite clear from this ruling that the U.S. Appeals Court for \nthe District of Columbia believes that Microsoft is not violating the \nlaw by integrating Internet Explorer into its operating system \nsoftware. That integration is beneficial to consumers and any attempt \nto stifle such innovations is harmful to consumers.\n  I see very little difference between the new case and the case just \nrejected by the Appeals Court. It is time for the Department of Justice \nto pick up its marbles and go home, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S6991-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6991-S7008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment that \nwould require the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the \nDepartment of Defense's use of the authority provided by section 2667 \nof title 10, United States Code.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Cohen has recommended additional base \nclosures citing 23 percent excess base capacity and the need to achieve \nsavings that could be used for modernization. However, both the House \nand Senate, for various reasons, have not supported the request, \nalthough both acknowledge that there is excess capacity. My amendment \nsuggests that the Department of Defense use its existing authority \nunder section 2667 of title 10, United States Code, to put the excess \ncapacity to beneficial use. Section 2667 permits the lease on non-\nexcess real or personal property to the private sector for financial or \nin-kind compensation.\n  Since the Department does have the authority to close or eliminate \nits excess capacity, the leases authorized by section 2667 would use \nthis capacity while providing some revenue and savings to the \nDepartment and the military installations. Additionally, since the \nproperty would be under a long-term lease, the services would have it \navailable for future expansion or surge capacity.\n  Under section 2667, a service secretary may lease property to a \nlessee under such terms as he considers will promote the national \ndefense or be in the public interest. Additionally, the funds collected \nfrom these leases are deposited in a special account in the Treasury. \nSums deposited in this account will be available to the military \ndepartment, as provided in appropriation Act, as follows:--50 percent \nof such amounts will be available for facility maintenance and repair \nor environmental restoration at the military installation where the \nleased property is located. 50 percent of such amounts will be \navailable for facility maintenance and repair and environmental \nrestoration by the military departments concerned.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would ask the Secretary to report on the \nfollowing issues regarding the use of section 2667:\n  The number and purpose of leases entered under 2667; the types and \namounts of payment received; the cost, if any, foregone as a result of \nthe leases; the positive and negative aspects of leasing; the efforts \nto promote these type leases to the private sector; any legislative \nproposal to enhance the Department's capability to lease to the private \nsector; an estimate of income that could potentially be accrued because \nof enhanced leasing capability; and a discussion on retaining any \nincome from these leases at the installation.\n  Mr. President, I believe the authority provided the service \nsecretaries by section 2667 does not eliminate the need for base \nclosure. It does provide the opportunity to use this property for the \nbenefit of the military installations. I will carefully review the \nSecretary's report and, if required, include legislation in next year's \ndefense authorization bill to maximize the use of this authority.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. WARNER. This amendment has been cleared. I urge passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I have an especially strong interest in \nthe history of illnesses and health concerns that follow military \ndeployments. We have all observed the effects of post-conflict \nillnesses among our Gulf War veterans who returned with poorly \nunderstood, undiagnosed illnesses, and our Vietnam veterans with health \nproblems related to exposure to Agent Orange. This legacy is not just a \nproblem of our most recent conflicts; our Atomic-era veterans are still \nfighting for recognition of health conditions related to radiation \nexposures they experienced in service to their country 50 years ago.\n  If there is any single lesson to be learned from this history, it is \nthat the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs \nhave not always been aggressive enough in pursuing the immediate health \nconsequences of military conflicts. Too many times our veterans have \nhad to wait years before post-conflict illnesses are recognized as real \nproblems that require firm commitments of research and treatment \nprograms. These delays have come at a cost to the veterans who have had \nto fight for this recognition, and they have come at a cost to the \ngovernment's credibility on this important issue.\n  I believe it is time to consider establishing an independent entity \nwith the capacity to evaluate government efforts to monitor the health \nof servicemembers following military conflicts, and to evaluate whether \nservicemembers are being effectively treated for illnesses that occur \nfollowing such deployments. There have been suggestions for the need \nfor such an entity within DoD and VA, but I believe that important \nhealth expertise outside these agencies is required as well. Indeed, it \nmay be that the best approach is one that pulls together expertise from \nVA, DoD, and health care professionals and researchers from centers of \nmedical excellence in fields such as toxicology, occupational medicine, \nand other disciplines.\n  Therefore, I would like to propose an amendment to the Department of \nDefense Authorization to require the Secretary to enter into an \nagreement with the National Academy of Sciences to assess the \nfeasibility of establishing, as an independent entity, a National \nCenter for the Study of Military Health.\n  The proposed Center for the Study of Military Health would evaluate \nand monitor interagency coordination on issues relating to post-\ndeployment health concerns of members of the Armed Forces, including \noutreach and risk communication, recordkeeping, research, utilization \nof new technologies, international cooperation and\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\nresearch, health surveillance, and other health-related activities.\n  In addition, this center would evaluate the health care provided to \nmembers of the Armed Services both before and after their deployment on \nmilitary operations. The proposed center would monitor and direct \ngovernment efforts to evaluate the health of servicemembers upon their \nreturn from military deployments, for purposes of ensuring the rapid \nidentification of any trends in diseases or injuries that result from \nsuch operations. Such an independent health center could also serve an \nimportant role in providing training of health care professionals in \nDoD and VA in the evaluation and treatment of post-conflict diseases \nand health conditions, including nonspecific and unexplained illnesses.\n  While some have argued that it is time to take some of these \nresponsibilities away from existing agencies, I would suggest that this \nis a matter for careful study and thoughtful deliberation. Therefore, \nthis amendment would require the National Academy of Sciences to assess \nthe feasibility of such an independent health entity. In their report \nto the Secretary of Defense, the Academy should provide a \nrecommendation of the feasibility of such an entity and justification \nfor such a recommendation. If such a center is recommended by the \nAcademy, their report should also provide recommendations regarding the \norganizational placement of the entity; the health and science \nexpertise that would be necessary; the scope and nature of the \nactivities and responsibilities of the entity; and mechanisms for \nensuring that the recommendations of the entity are carried out by DoD \nand VA.\n  Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, there have been too many times when I have heard agency \nofficials testify that poorly understood, unexplained illnesses are a \ncommon, inevitable occurrence of every military conflict. With the \ntremendous advances achieved elsewhere in medical and military \ntechnologies, I find the acceptance of these illnesses as an \ninevitability to be unacceptable. I hope that this amendment will offer \nan initial step to better prevention and treatment of these post-\nconflict illnesses.\n  Mr. WARNER. The amendment is cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2987) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Wyden and Senator \nSmith of Oregon, I call up amendment numbered 2796 which would express \nthe sense of the Senate that the State of Oregon should continue to \nhave access to appropriate information and cleanup activities at the \nHanford site located in the State of Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 398, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3144. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING MEMORANDA OF \n                   UNDERSTANDING WITH THE STATE OF OREGON RELATING \n                   TO HANFORD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Energy and the State of Washington \n     have entered into memoranda of understanding with the State \n     of Oregon to provide the State of Oregon greater involvement \n     in decisions regarding the Hanford Reservation.\n       (2) Hanford has an impact on the State of Oregon, and the \n     State of Oregon has an interest in the decisions made \n     regarding Hanford.\n       (3) The Department of Energy and the State of Washington \n     are to be congratulated for entering into the memoranda of \n     understanding with the State of Oregon regarding Hanford.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to--\n       (1) encourage the Department of Energy and the State of \n     Washington to implement the memoranda of understanding \n     regarding Hanford in ways that result in continued \n     involvement by the State of Oregon in decisions of concern to \n     the State of Oregon regarding Hanford; and\n       (2) encourage the Department of Energy and the State of \n     Washington to continue similar efforts to permit ongoing \n     participation by the State of Oregon in the decisions \n     regarding Hanford that may affect the environment or public \n     health or safety of the citizens of the State of Oregon.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have an amendment to encourage the \nDepartment of Energy to involve the State of Oregon in decisions about \nthe cleanup of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. This amendment is \nneeded to protect Oregonians from the unusual and highly dangerous \nhazards that the Hanford Nuclear Reservation poses for the people of \nOregon.\n  This amendment should be familiar to many members of the Senate \nbecause a version of this legislation previously passed the Senate as \nan amendment to the FY97 Defense Authorization Bill.\n  Mr. President, there is no other contaminated Federal property in the \ncountry that has caused the serious injuries to residents of another \nState that Hanford has already caused to citizens of Oregon. And no \nother Federal site currently poses anywhere near as serious a threat to \nthe health and safety of citizens of another State as Hanford does to \nour citizens.\n  Because of this special situation, the State of Oregon needs to be \ninvolved in decisions about how DOE proposes to clean up the Hanford \nsite.\n  I want to make clear that recognizing the unique conditions present \nat Hanford and the immediate danger they pose for Oregonians does not \nset a precedent for other Federal facilities besides Hanford. It will \nnot turn every military base with a leaking gasoline tank into a multi-\nstate cleanup issue.\n  Let me put to rest any concern that this amendment will be \nmisconstrued in that way. First, there is simply no facility in this \ncountry--Federal or non-Federal--that compares to Hanford. In fact, \nHanford is generally considered to be the most contaminated site in the \nWestern hemisphere. You would have to go to the former Soviet Union to \nfind a site as polluted as Hanford.\n  The extent of the environmental problems are mind boggling:\n  Over the years, 200 billion gallons of toxic and radioactive liquids \nfrom nuclear weapons production were dumped at the site. That's enough \nto cover Manhattan to a depth of 40 feet.\n  The Hanford site currently contains 56 million gallons of high-level \nradioactive wastes in 177 tanks. Some of these tanks are as big as the \nCapitol Dome. At least 54 of these tanks are known or suspected to be \nleaking or pose risks of explosion.\n  The site also is currently storing 2,300 metric tons of high-level \nnuclear fuel rods in leaking basins located only a quarter mile from \nthe Columbia River.\n  And these are just a few of the problems that we know about.\n  Second, there is also no other site in the country that has affected \nthe health and safety of residents in another state the way Hanford has \naffected the citizens of Oregon.\n  Oregonians living downwind from Hanford have suffered from thyroid \ncancers and other medical problems caused by airborne releases of \nradioactive iodine. Starting in the late 1940s and continuing through \nthe 1950s, these releases average between 100 and 2,000 curies per \nmonth. To put that into perspective, the residents around Harrisburg, \nPennsylvania were evacuated in 1979 when the Three Mile Island accident \nreleased 15-24 curies into the Pennsylvania countryside.\n  The airborne releases from Hanford were 10 to 100 times what were \nreleased from Three Mile Island, and these releases were occurring \nevery month! Ongoing epidemiological studies have linked these releases \nto increased cases of thyroid cancer and other adverse health effects \non Oregonians living near the site. Children drinking milk from farms \nin the area were the ones most harmed by these releases.\n  Hanford also poses a serious health threat to the more than 1 million \nOregonians who live downstream from the site. Radioactive materials \nhave been released into the Columbia River when water from the River \nwas pumped through the sites nuclear reactors to cool them. Other \nhazardous and radioactive materials that were dumped at the site have \nand are continuing to seep into the River. A General Accounting Office \nreport I released earlier this year documents that 900,000 gallons of \nradioactive wastes have leaked out of the Hanford tanks, contaminated \nthe groundwater and this contaminated water is now heading toward the \nColumbia River.\n  The bottom line is many Oregonians are suffering adverse health \neffects from living near Hanford. And many more are at risk of future \nharm because of conditions at the site.\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\n  Finally, my amendment does not set a precedent for Federal facilities \nnationwide because it only encourages the Energy Department to continue \nexisting efforts to involve Oregon in cleanup decisions. There is \nalready in effect a Memorandum of Agreement between the State of Oregon \nand the Department of Energy concerning Oregon's participation in \ndecisions about Hanford cleanup. The linkage to this agreement puts the \nsite into a special category of Federal facility cleanups. It draws a \nbright line that divide Hanford from the hundreds of other contaminated \nFederal facilities around the country.\n  The unique factors involved in the Hanford cleanup justify granting \nthe State of Oregon a greater role in decisions about clean up of the \nHanford site.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize how Hanford has harmed and continue \nto pose a serious hazard to the people of Oregon by giving our State \nthe opportunity to play a greater role in cleanup decisions at the \nsite.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf \nof Amendment No. 2796 to the Defense Authorization bill, a Sense of the \nSenate Resolution which was introduced by myself and Senator Wyden. I \nwant to thank the managers of the Defense Authorization bill for \nallowing us to bring this important amendment to the floor for \nconsideration. This Sense of the Senate speaks to an issue that is a \nsource of great concern to all Oregonians. But not only should it be of \nimportance to citizens of my state, this Sense of the Senate should \nalso be important to any American concerned about having a say in how \nthe federal government handles nuclear waste and other environmental \nproblems partially overseen by the Department of Energy. Simply put, \nradioactive waste seeping through the soil or being discharged into the \nair recognizes no state boundary.\n  Although such situations can be found in other parts of the country, \nthe amendment before us today speaks specifically to the Hanford \nnuclear reservation, located in the southeastern part of Washington \nstate. Hanford was operated by the federal government as a plutonium \ndevelopment facility for four decades. Today, this site is the worst \nDepartment of Energy environmental hazard in the country. Millions of \ngallons of radioactive waste sits at the Hanford facility, much of it \nstored in underground tanks that are leaking an unknown amount of \nmaterial into the soil as I speak.\n  Currently, there are cleanup efforts underway, jointly operated by \nthe Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the \nstate of Washington. Every year the Congress appropriates money for \nthis cleanup effort, and I am a strong supporter of this funding. \nHowever, as an Oregonian, I believe that my state should also be a part \nof this ongoing process. Although the Hanford site is in Washington \nstate, it is just 35 miles north of Oregon, and it lies next to the \nmighty Columbia River, which forms much of the border between the two \nstates. Any failure to clean up this facility adequately will be felt \nnot only in Washington but in my state as well. Thousands of Oregonians \nlive within 50 miles of this site. Thousands more live down the \nColumbia River, which is not only home to countless species of \nwildlife, but also a key transportation and recreation resource as \nwell.\n  For these reasons, I am pleased that the Department of Energy and the \nstate of Washington and Oregon entered into memoranda of understanding \nconcerning Hanford last August. With the implementation of this \nagreement, Oregon will be a participant in the major decisions \nregarding Hanford that have potential repercussions for the health and \nsafety of Oregonians. The amendment Senator Wyden and I have introduced \nsimply encourages the continuation of this kind of cooperative \ndecisionmaking regarding the future of the Hanford site. As \nacknowledged by the Department of Energy and the state of Washington by \nthe memoranda of agreement, Oregon has a huge stake in this process. It \nis a point worth reiterating, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important Sense of the Senate resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2796) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay it on the table.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2812\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress concerning the naming of an \n LPD-17 class amphibious vessel in honor of Lieutenant General Clifton \n           B. Cates, the 19th Commandant of the Marine Corps)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator \nFrist, numbered 2812 which would express the sense of the Congress that \nthe Secretary of the Navy should remain an LPD-17 class amphibious ship \nin honor of the 19th Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Clifton B. \nCates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Frist, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2812.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE NAMING OF AN LPD-\n                   17 VESSEL.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that, consistent with section \n     1018 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1996 (Public Law 104-106; 110 Stat. 425), the next \n     unnamed vessel of the LPD-17 class of amphibious vessels \n     should be named the U.S.S. Clifton B. Cates, in honor of \n     Marine General Clifton B. Cates (1893-1970), a native of \n     Tennessee whose distinguished career of service in the Marine \n     Corps included combat service in World War I so heroic that \n     he became the most decorated Marine Corps officer of World \n     War I, included exemplary combat leadership from Guadalcanal \n     to Tinian and Iwo Jima and beyond in the Pacific Theater \n     during World War II, and culminated in Lieutenant General \n     Cates being appointed the 19th Commandant of the Marine \n     Corps, a position in which he led the Marine Corps' efficient \n     and alacritous response to the invasion of the Republic of \n     South Korea by Communist North Korea.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2812) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, this past March, General Tilelli, \nCommander, of U.S. Forces in Korea, testified before the Committee on \nissues faced by his Command. One of the foremost concerns he expressed \nwas the impact of the antipersonnel landmine\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\nmoratorium that would be imposed on February 12, 1999. General Tilelli \nprevailed upon the Committee to provide legislative relief from this \nrequirement.\n  On May 1, Secretary of Defense Cohen and General Shelton, Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs, wrote asking the Committee to include a provision in \nthe defense authorization bill that would allow the Secretary to waive \nthe moratorium for national security interests.\n  Today, I offer an amendment that would provide the President \nauthority to waive the moratorium on antipersonnel landmines that would \ngo into effect on February 12, 1999.\n  The potential negative effect of this legislation on the ability of \nU.S. forces to fight and win battles and to defend U.S. forces and \nallies, if necessary, is unacceptable, and would not be in the national \nsecurity interest of the United States.\n  I am concerned about the impact of this moratorium on the ability to \nundertake missions, such as the kind of mission that may have been \nnecessary, had Iraq chosen to invade one of our allies in the Gulf, \nduring the most recent standoff with Iraq over the arms control \ninspections.\n  I believe it is in the national security interests for U.S. forces to \nbe able to employ self-destructing anti-personnel landmines and self-\ndestructing mixed anti-tank systems to defend themselves and our \nallies, if necessary. It is for this reason, that I believe the \nPresident should have authority to waive the moratorium for national \nsecurity reasons.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment will provide the President \nthe authority to waive the one-year moratorium on the use of \nantipersonnel landmines by U.S. forces, which goes into effect February \n12, 1999. It is my understanding that this amendment has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2988) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER.

LANDMINES.\n\n       (a) Availability of Funds.--(1) Of the amounts authorized \n     to be appropriated in section 201, $17,200,000 shall be \n     available for activities relating to the identification, \n     adaptation, modification, research, and development of \n     existing and new tactics, technologies, and operational \n     concepts that--\n       (A) would provide a combat capability that is comparable to \n     the combat capability provided by anti-personnel landmines, \n     including anti-personnel landmines used in mixed mine \n     systems; and\n       (B) comply with the Convention on the Prohibition of the \n     Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel \n     Mines and on Their Destruction.\n       (2) The amount available under paragraph (1) shall be \n     derived as follows:\n       (A) $12,500,000 shall be available from amounts authorized \n     to be appropriated by section 201(1).\n       (B) $4,700,000 shall be available from amounts authorized \n     to be appropriated by section 201(4).\n       (b) Studies.--(1) Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall enter \n     into a contract with each of two appropriate scientific \n     organizations for purposes of identifying existing and new \n     tactics, technologies, and concepts referred to in subsection \n     (a).\n       (2) Each contract shall require the organization concerned \n     to submit a report to the Secretary and to Congress, not \n     later than one year after the execution of such contract, \n     describing the activities under such contract and including \n     recommendations with respect to the adaptation, modification, \n     and research and development of existing and new tactics, \n     technologies, and concepts identified under such contract.\n       (3) Amounts available under subsection (a) shall be \n     available for purposes of the contracts under this \n     subsection.\n       (c) Reports.--Not later than April 1 of each of 1999 \n     through 2001, the Secretary shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report describing the progress made in \n     identifying and deploying tactics, technologies, and concepts \n     referred to in subsection (a).\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Anti-personnel landmine.--The term ``anti-personnel \n     landmine'' has the meaning given the term ``anti-personnel \n     mine'' in Article 2 of the Convention on the Prohibition of \n     the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\n     Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.\n       (2) Mixed mine system.--The term ``mixed mine system'' \n     includes any system in which an anti-vehicle landmine or \n     other munition is constructed with or used with one or more \n     anti-personnel landmines, but does not include an anti-\n     handling device as that term is defined in Article 2 of the \n     Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, \n     Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their \n     Destruction.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment would provide legislative \nauthority for the committee's recommendation to fully fund the budget \nrequest for alternatives to antipersonnel landmines, which would \nprovide the Secretary of Defense authority to contract with scientific \norganizations to provide recommendations on research and development of \ntactics, technologies and concepts as alternatives to antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2989) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my amendment, which has been accepted by \nboth sides, would authorize funding for the identification and \ndevelopment of atlernatives to anti-personnel landmines, including \nthose used in mixed mine systems. I want to thank Chairman Thurmond and \nSenator Levin for their invaluable assistance, patience and support in \ngetting this amendment adopted.\n  This is a modest but important amendment. Contrary to what some \nmisinformed people have suggested, it does not ban anti-personnel \nlandmines. There is an international Convention that has been signed by \n126 nations, including every one of our NATO allies except Turkey, \nwhich bans the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-\npersonnel mines, but that is not this amendment. I mention it, though, \nbecause the White House recently committed the United States Government \nto sign that Convention when alternatives to anti-personnel mines are \navailable, and to search aggressively for alternatives. They set a \ntarget date of 2006 for signing the Convention, and last September \nPresident Clinton announced that the United States will stop using \nanti-personnel mines outside Korea by 2003. It is my hope and \nexpectation that by working together and with the resources to do the \njob, we can join the Convention by 2003. That is also about the same \ntime that signatories to the Convention must have destroyed their \nstockpiles of anti-personnel mines, and when our NATO allies have said \nthey want our mines removed from their territory. It is a logical \ndeadline.\n  As I have said, when the White House announced that the United States \nwill sign the Convention when alternatives are available, they also \ncommitted to ``search aggressively'' for alternative tactics, \ntechnologies and/or operational concepts to anti-personnel mines that \nare compliant with the Convention. This amendment simply authorizes the \nnext year of funds to do that--a total of $17,200,000 for fiscal year \n1999, and it calls for two separate studies to be done by independent \nscientific organizations. Although they are not named in the amendment, \nit is our intention and expectation that the Pentagon will initiate \ncontracts with the National Academy of Sciences and the Rand \nCorporation to do the studies. Both are widely respected organizations \nthat have done similar types of studies in the past. The National \nAcademy estimates that such a study would take a year to complete and \ncost approximately $750,000. It is our hope that these studies will \nassist in steering the Pentagon in the right direction so rapid \nprogress can be made in finding and deploying alternatives.\n  Mr. President, there are respected, retired military officers who \nbelieve\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\nthat suitable alternatives already exist. They have done considerable \nresearch on existing weapons systems and are convinced that, since an \neffective minefield must be kept under constant observation, a \ncombination of sensors and smart munitions that can destroy moving \narmored vehicles can provide a comparable combat capability to our \nmixed mine systems. Therefore, it may not be necessary to develop new \ntechnologies, because tactics, technologies and/or operational concepts \nmay already exist that can be adapted, modified, or otherwise utilized \nwith comparable effect. That is why the amendment refers explicitly to \nthe ``adaptation, modification, and research and development,'' of both \n``existing and new tactics, technologies, and operational concepts.'' \nIt is important that the search for alternatives explore all possible \noptions.\n\n  It is no secret that I had hoped that the United States would be \namong the first to sign the Convention when it was opened for signature \nin Ottawa last December. However, that was not to be, and since then I \nhave sought to find a common approach so the United States could signal \nto the world our clear intention to join the Convention as soon as \npracticable. Over a period of months, General Ralston, the Vice \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Advisory Sandy \nBerger and I discussed a number of issues including a way for the \nUnited States to join the Convention in a manner that is acceptable to \nthe Pentagon. We now have that commitment, and while it may be some \nyears before the United States signs, there are interim steps we can \ntake to support the Convention.\n  We should urge other governments that have not yet signed, including \nRussia and China, to declare their intention to do so as soon as \npracticable, as we have. They too should undertake to remove whatever \nobstacles are in the way. We can also use the framework of the \nConvention to share technology, disclose mine stockpiles, identify \nmined areas, and support demining and assistance for mine victims.\n  Mr. President, this has been a long time in coming. President Clinton \nfirst called on the Pentagon to search for alternatives to anti-\npersonnel mines back in 1994, and then for two years nothing happened. \nThen in May 1996 and again last September, he directed the Pentagon to \ndo so. A few million dollars have been spent, but there has not been \nanything resembling a serious program. The prevailing attitude at the \nPentagon has been that there are better uses of time and money, so \nlet's do as little as possible and say we tried.\n  Obviously, if the Pentagon wants to avoid finding alternatives to \nlandmines they know how to do that. They can try to hold back the money \nfor research, they can say they cannot find alternatives that do \nabsolutely everything landmines do, and they can continue to overstate \ntheir need for landmines. This will be a test of their good faith. I \nwould urge them to approach this with the kind of ``can-do'' attitude \nthey like to be known for, and to look closely at the technologies they \nalready have. As I have said before, if we can drive a rover on Mars \nfrom a laptop on Earth, we can do this. I am convinced that it is a \nmatter of will and resources.\n  General Ralston and Sandy Berger have pledged to make every effort to \nget the job done. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nDavid Jones, accepted President Clinton's offer to monitor the \nPentagon's progress in finding alternatives. These are men of their \nword and I have no doubt that they will do everything possible to see \nthis through. I will support them in every way possible.\n  Again, I want to thank the managers of the bill, Chairman Thurmond \nand Senator Levin and their staffs.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2990\n\n  (Purpose: To re-establish the initiative relating to fair trade in \n                           automotive parts)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2990.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new title:\n                TITLE ____FAIR TRADE IN AUTOMOTIVE PARTS\n\n     SEC. ____01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Fair Trade in Automotive \n     Parts Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Japanese markets.--The term ``Japanese markets'' refers \n     to markets, including markets in the United States and Japan, \n     where automotive parts and accessories, both original \n     equipment and aftermarket, are purchased for use in the \n     manufacture or repair of Japanese automobiles.\n       (2) Japanese and other asian markets.--The term ``Japanese \n     and other Asian markets'' refers to markets, including \n     markets in the United States, Japan, and other Asian \n     countries, where automotive parts and accessories, both \n     original equipment and aftermarket, are purchased for use in \n     the manufacture or repair of Japanese, American, or other \n     Asian automobiles.\n\n     SEC. ____03.

ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON \n                   AUTOMOTIVE PARTS SALES IN JAPANESE AND OTHER \n                   ASIAN MARKETS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce shall seek the \n     advice of the United States automotive parts industry in \n     carrying out this title.\n       (b) Establishment of Committee.--The Secretary of Commerce \n     shall establish a Special Advisory Committee for purposes of \n     carrying out this title.\n       (c) Functions.--The Special Advisory Committee established \n     under subsection (b) shall--\n       (1) report to the Secretary of Commerce on barriers to \n     sales of United States-made automotive parts and accessories \n     in Japanese and other Asian markets;\n       (2) review and consider data collected on sales of United \n     States-made automotive parts and accessories in Japanese and \n     other Asian markets;\n       (3) advise the Secretary of Commerce during consultations \n     with other governments on issues concerning sales of United \n     States-made automotive parts in Japanese and other Asian \n     markets;\n       (4) assist in establishing priorities for the initiative \n     established under section ____03, and otherwise provide \n     assistance and direction to the Secretary of Commerce in \n     carrying out the intent of that section; and\n       (5) assist the Secretary in reporting to Congress by \n     submitting an annual written report to the Secretary on the \n     sale of United States-made automotive parts in Japanese and \n     other Asian markets, as well as any other issues with respect \n     to which the Committee provides advice pursuant to this \n     title.\n       (d) Authority.--The Secretary of Commerce shall draw on \n     existing budget authority in carrying out this title.\n\n     SEC. ____05. EXPIRATION DATE.\n\n       The authority under this title shall expire on December 31, \n     2003.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment would reauthorize a special \nadvisory committee on U.S. trade.\n  The Auto Parts Advisory Committee (APAC) is an important private \nsector industry advisory group made up of American auto parts companies \nthat advise the Commerce Department on auto parts trade negotiations \nwith Japan and Asia.\n  APAC was established by the Fair Trade in Auto Parts Act included in \nthe Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. It was reauthorized \nin 1995. APAC's authorization will expire at the end of this year.\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\n  At a time of soaring U.S. trade deficits with Japan and the rest of \nAsia, continued market opening negotiations are critical to removing \nbarriers and achieving deregulation in these automotive markets. The \noverall U.S. trade deficit with Japan can only be reduced if the \nautomotive portion of that deficit--on average 60 percent of the \ntotal--is reduced. We must have the tools at our disposal to do this, \nincluding the cooperation and resolve of the private sector to present \nour trading partners with a united front to advance the U.S. \nnegotiating position. Because of the unfair trade barriers U.S. \nautomotive exports face in a number of Asian markets, this \nreauthorization language will expand APAC's parameters to allow it to \nadvise the Administration on trade consultations in Japan and other \nAsian markets.\n  APAC has done much to focus the attention and will of the U.S. \ngovernment on finding a results-oriented solution to the auto parts \nproblem with Japan. It has also played an important role in organizing \nan industry that is made up of thousands of diverse companies, many of \nthem small businesses, to speak more with one voice with regard to the \ntrade debate. This industry directly employs over 700,000. If we can \nopen up foreign markets to U.S. auto parts exports we can create more \nhigh paying American manufacturing jobs in the auto parts industry. \nThis is good for American workers, its good for U.S.-based auto parts \ncompanies and its good for our economy.\n  APAC is able to provide our trade negotiators with insight on the \nU.S. auto parts industry and the specific barriers they confront in \nJapan and elsewhere in Asia. Often individual U.S. auto parts companies \nthat are trying to enter these markets do not want to speak out \nindividually about protectionist foreign trade barriers that they have \nencountered for fear that doing so could jeopardize potential business \nopportunities in the countries in question. That is an understandable \nconcern and that is why the U.S. Government, with input from APAC \nadvising the government as an industry, can and should speak up on \nbehalf of American companies trying to break into foreign markets.\n  In addition to its advisory role to the Commerce Department, APAC has \nalso issued a number of useful studies and reports on the \ncompetitiveness of the United States auto parts industry and on the \nbarriers to trade faced in selling to Japan. It has also issued reports \nand recommendations to the Commerce Department and the U.S. Congress on \nwhat steps must be taken to open Japan's markets to U.S. auto parts.\n  The U.S. auto parts industry and the Administration support the \nextension of APAC so that it can continue its contribution to market \nopening efforts for the sale of U.S. auto parts in Japan and elsewhere \nin Asia.\n  We should reauthorize APAC without delay so that its members can \ncontinue their good work advising our trade negotiators on auto parts \ntrade in Japan and Asia.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on the other side, I \nbelieve.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2990) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2991\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for accountability of the Director and Deputy \n                      Director of the Naval Home)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on July 17, 1996, President Clinton \nsupported legislative language establishing a two-year ``pilot \nprogram'' to identify and demonstrate a safe and cost-effective \ntechnology for the destruction of chemical weapon munitions stockpiles.\n  The language signed into law by the President directed the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology to designate a \nprogram and appoint an executive officer to carry out the pilot program \nwho was not, nor had been, in direct or immediate control of the Army \nBaseline Chemical Incineration Demilitarization program.\n  The legislation further prohibited the obligation of funds at two \nchemical weapons stockpile sites--Lexington Blue Grass Army Depot in \nKentucky and the Pueblo Depot in Colorado--pending the outcome of the \ntwo-year research program.\n  It is Senator McConnell's and my understanding that the Assembled \nChemical Weapons Assessment (ACWA) program has been a success in its \ninitial stages. The management team for ACWA has just completed \nselecting seven technology teams who will conduct further evaluations \ntoward a possible demonstration phase later this year. Based on \ninformation received, I am encouraged that at least two of the non-\nincineration technologies will be available for full scale testing by \nfiscal year 2000.\n  I am also very impressed with the very effective ``dialogue'' process \nincluding local citizens, state regulators, environmental \norganizations, tribal representatives, and many others in building a \nconsensus in the ACWA program. I'm hopeful this open exchange will help \nin the eventual deployment and operation of a non-incineration \nfacility, ensuring the days of delay and distraction that have plagued \nthe chemical demilitarization program will soon be over.\n  Because of this success, I believe the ACWA ``dialogue'' will \ncontinue as a central part of the decision-making and consensus \nbuilding in the Chemical Weapons Destruction program.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we introduce today does many things in \nthe area of chemical demilitarization. It directs that the ACWA program \nmust continue its independence from the baseline incinerator program \nthrough the next phase of pilot and full scale development. This will \nprevent any break or pause in the ACWA program by disallowing any \ntransfer of responsibility for the program while making sure it meets \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty (CWC) deadlines.\n  The program will stay under the direct supervision of the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology. The ACWA program \nmanager will continue to act independently of the program manager for \nthe Baseline Chemical Demilitarization Program.\n  This amendment also provides $18 million additional dollars so the \nProgram manager of ACWA can move forward to meet the CWC deadline of \n2007, which can be expanded until the year 2012. The additional funds \nauthorized for chemical demilitarization for fiscal year 1999 will not \ncome from the funds for the alternative technologies ``Bulk Pilot \nProgram.''\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the leadership of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee for accepting this amendment. I would also like to \nthank Ms. Monica Chavez and Mr. Richard Fieldhouse of the committee \nstaff for working with my staff in developing this amendment. Also, Mr. \nBilly Piper, Senator  McConnell's military legislative assistant, \nshould be commended for a job well done.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nKentucky in support of an amendment to the Department of Defense \nAuthorization Bill. I would like to thank the Senator for his support \nand assistance on this important initiative. In addition, I would like \nto thank the distinguished managers of the bill for their assistance.\n  In 1996, I offered and the Senate accepted an amendment to the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations bill which created the Alternative \nTechnology Program. The mission of the program is to study alternative \nto incineration for destruction of our chemical weapons stockpiles.\n  The amendment Senator Ford and I offer today continues this program, \nand ensures that it will remain independent and fully capable of \ncarrying out its intended mission.\n  Typically, when Senators offer amendments they rise to inform the \nbody what their intentions are--what will their proposals do. I would \nlike to take the opposite tack today, and tell the Senate what our \namendment will not do.\n  The Ford-McConnell amendment is not designed to delay or prevent the \ndestruction of chemical weapons. The Senate ratified, and I supported, \nthe chemical weapons convention which established a deadline by which \nall weapons must be destroyed. This amendment would not alter that \nagreement.\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\nIn fact, the amendment says that alternative technologies must be able \nto complete the destruction in the same timeframe as incineration.\n  The Ford-McConnell amendment is not designed to scuttle the \nincineration program. Consistent with the legislation Congress passed \nin 1996, this measure continues the study and implementation of \nalternative technologies. At sites where incinerators are under \nconstruction or operating, that work will continue.\n  What, then, does this amendment accomplish?\n  First, it ensures that the Program Manager for the Assembled Chemical \nWeapons Assessment (ACWA) continues to operate independently of the \nincineration program, reporting directly to the Under Secretary of \nDefense for Acquisition and Technology. This is important in order to \nmaintain the integrity of the program and protect the Program Manager's \nability to make decisions in an efficient manner. To date, all involved \nhave reported to both Senator Ford and me that ACWA has been \nsuccessfully run. There has been a tremendous amount of citizen \ninvolvement. The result has been consensus not only on the direction \nthe program is headed, but the methods it has employed.\n  Equally important, the amendment makes it clear that the Program \nManager for ACWA can move toward implementation of technology which \nmeets several clearly defined criteria. These criteria include that the \ntechnology selected is at least as safe and cost-effective as \nincineration. We have included a reporting requirement for both the \nUnder Secretary for Technology and Acquisition as well as the Cost \nAnalysis Improvement Group of the Department of Defense, to report to \nCongress on the cost and schedule of potential implementation.\n  As for the timing of the amendment, it clearly states that no \nalternative technology may be implemented unless it can be determined \nthat it will lead to the destruction of stockpiles no later than the \ndate by which incineration could do so. This is an important point, Mr. \nPresident. Senator Ford and I have no desire to prolong the schedule \nfor destruction of our stockpiles, we merely ask that any alternatives \nto incineration be held to the same standards as are currently in \nplace.\n  Mr. President, why have Senator Ford and I taken the Senate's time \nwith this amendment? Quite simply, I remain disappointed with the \nArmy's incineration program. It is grossly over budget and behind \nschedule. If it is possible to develop an alternative to incineration \nwhich is safe, and can accomplish the goals of our current program, \nthen I believe Congress should support that endeavor.\n  Finally, and most importantly, Senator Ford and I rise on behalf of \nour constituents in central Kentucky. They live every day with the \nknowledge that thousands of rockets containing lethal nerve agents are \nstored just minutes from their homes. We owe it to these Kentuckians to \nexhaust every option in order to eliminate these weapons in the safest \nmanner possible.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment would maintain the current \nprogram manager for the assembled chemical weapons assessment program, \nas well as provide authority for the ACWA program manager to undertake \nthe necessary activities to conduct demonstrations and pilot-scale \ntesting of alternative technologies for destruction of lethal chemical \nmunitions. The amendment would also provide for valuations of the \nalternative technologies by nongovernmental organizations and would \nmake available $18 million from funds authorized to the chemical \ndemilitarization program.\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2992) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2993\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the President to advance Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., \n     to the grade of general on the retired list of the Air Force)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators McCain and \nLieberman, I offer an amendment that would authorize the President to \npromote Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., to the rank of general on the retired \nlist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. McCain, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2993.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 531 ADVANCEMENT OF BENJAMIN O. DAVIS, JUNIOR, TO GRADE \n                   OF GENERAL.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The President is authorized to advance \n     Benjamin O. Davis, Junior, to the grade of general on the \n     retired list of the Air Force.\n       (b) Additional Benefits Not To Accrue.--An advancement of \n     Benjamin O. Davis, Junior, to the grade of general on the \n     retired list of the Air Force under subsection (a) shall not \n     increase or change the compensation or benefits from the \n     United States to which any person is now or may in the future \n     be entitled based upon the military service of the said \n     Benjamin O. Davis, Junior.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, we have a historic opportunity to \nhonor one of America's truly heroic pioneers. Lieutenant General \nBenjamin O. Davis, Jr., United States Air Force (ret), has earned a \nhallowed place in the history of our armed forces, the history of our \ngreat nation, and arguably, the history of mankind.\n  Today, in order to pay a just and fitting tribute to the exceptional \ncontributions of Lt. General Davis, I offer this amendment that would \nauthorize the President of the United States to promote Benjamin O. \nDavis, Jr., to the rank of General on the retired list of the United \nStates Air Force. This promotion would not entail any additional pay or \nbenefits for General Davis or his family.\n  Lt. General Benjamin Davis's life has epitomized sustained superior \nperformance in the face of singularly distinctive challenges. Though \ngiven the ``silent treatment,'' he graduated 35th in a class of 276 as \nthe first African American graduate of the 20th century from the United \nStates Military Academy at West Point. He was the first African \nAmerican officer in the Army Air Forces, and was a member of the first \nAfrican American pilot training class held at Tuskegee Army Airfield, \nAlabama. He led the 99th Pursuit Squadron and 332nd Fighter Group--\nknown as the Tuskegee Airmen--into air combat over many locations in \nthe European Theater of Operations.\n  Following the integration of the Air Force, Colonel Davis held \nseveral significant commands. He was Commander of the 51st Fighter \nInterceptor Wing, Suwon, Korea. After promotion to Brigadier General in \n1954, he served as director of operations and training at headquarters, \nFar East Air Forces, Tokyo, Japan. Brigadier General Davis was the \nfirst and only African American General Officer from 1954 through the \n1970s.\n  General Davis was promoted to Major General in 1959 and Lieutenant \nGeneral in 1965. Lt. General Davis retired from the active Air Force in \n1970. He later served as Assistant Secretary of Transportation from \n1971 to 1975.\n  Lt. General Davis holds five honorary doctorate degrees, has served \non numerous public and private panels, and has been the deserving \nrecipient of numerous other distinguished honors.\n  Though Lt. General Benjamin Davis's record is replete with laudable \naccomplishments, those accomplishments are all the more inspiring and \nsignificant when viewed against the backdrop of the time in America's \nhistory in which they occurred.\n  His perseverance against the prejudices of his day showed his great \ndepth of character. His unqualified successes in the face of those \nprejudices not only were a credit to himself, but they served as \ncatalysts for societal change--change that not only has directly \nimpacted the life of every American, but change that has arguably \naffected the world. America owes him a great debt of gratitude.\n  Mr. President, the singularly distinctive accomplishments of Benjamin \nO. Davis Jr., make him uniquely qualified to receive this tremendous \nhonor, an honor I do not propose lightly. I ask my colleagues' \nunanimous support for this amendment. There is no one more deserving, \nand no better way to express the gratitude of a grateful nation.\n\n[[Page S7002]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The \nF/A-18E/F program is now entering its last year of Engineering and \nManufacturing Development (EMD).

CONVEYANCE OF NDRF VESSEL EX-USS LORAIN COUNTY.\n\n       (a) Authority To Convey.--The Secretary of Transportation \n     may convey all right, title, and interest of the Federal \n     Government in and to the vessel ex-USS LORAIN COUNTY (LST-\n     1177) to the Ohio War Memorial, Inc., located in Sandusky, \n     Ohio (in this section referred to as the ``recipient''), for \n     use as a memorial to Ohio veterans.\n       (b) Terms of Conveyance.--\n       (1) Delivery of vessel.--In carrying out subsection (a), \n     the Secretary shall deliver the vessel--\n       (A) at the place where the vessel is located on the date of \n     conveyance;\n       (B) in its condition on that date; and\n       (C) at no cost to the Federal Government.\n       (2) Required conditions.--The Secretary may not convey a \n     vessel under this section unless--\n       (A) the recipient agrees to hold the Government harmless \n     for any claims arising from exposure to hazardous materials, \n     including asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls, after \n     conveyance of the vessel, except for claims arising before \n     the date of the conveyance of from use of the vessel by the \n     Government after that date; and\n       (B) the recipient has available, for use to restore the \n     vessel, in the form of cash, liquid assets, or a written loan \n     commitment, financial resources of at least $100,000.\n       (3) Additional terms.--The Secretary may require such \n     additional terms and conditions in connection with the \n     conveyance authorized by this section as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate.\n       (c) Other Unneeded Equipment.--The Secretary may convey to \n     the recipient of the vessel conveyed under this section any \n     unneeded equipment from other vessels in the National Defense \n     Reserve Fleet, for use to restore the vessel conveyed under \n     this section to museum quality.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Ohio, Senator Glenn, to offer an amendment to restore a piece of \nhistory for our veterans. This may be the last opportunity we have to \nbring an Ohio-built ship back to the state of Ohio--where so many U.S. \nNavy ships were built. Our amendment would allow for the restoration of \nthe tank landing ship, the U.S.S. Lorain County  (LST-1177), so that it \nmay be restored and serve as a memorial to Ohio veterans.\n  A number of individuals deserve credit for this initiative. First, I \ncommend my friend and colleague Congressman Paul Gillmor. Congressman \nGillmor is a true friend of Ohio Veterans. He took the lead in adding \nsimilar legislation to the House of Representatives' version of the \nDefense Authorization Bill. Secondly, I would like to recognize the \nefforts of the members of Ohio War Memorial, Inc. Their patriotic \ndevotion to this memorial is very worthwhile and highly admirable.\n  The U.S.S. Lorain County was built during the 1956-58 time period by \nLorain County's American Shipbuilding Company. She spent 14 years on \nactive duty as a part of the U.S. Navy's Amphibious Force in the \nAtlantic, Mediterranean, and the Caribbean. She completed distinguished \nservice and was decommissioned in 1972.\n\n[[Page S7005]]\n\n  The Lorain County is presently in Virginia and she is intact and in \ngood condition. Without this amendment, she likely will be sold for \nscrap metal. So this is our last opportunity to save and utilize this \nship as a memorial to all of those who not only built the mighty ships \nof the U.S. Navy, but to those dedicated veterans who served on them as \nwell.\n  This amendment would not impose any cost to the Federal Government \nand would allow Ohio War Memorial, Inc., a private, nonprofit citizens \ngroup, enoght time to raise the funds needed to return the ship to \nOhio, renovate it, and turn it into a memorial that every veteran from, \nor visiting the state of Ohio would be proud to see.\n  Mr. President, I ruge my colleagues to support this effort to save \nthis piece of history.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The Amendment (No. 2826) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Violations of regulated acts involving the exportation of United \n              States property.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthis year's Defense bill to address the unexcusably lax procedures for \ndisposing of surplus military equipment which currently exist. There \nhave been several media reports indicating that these procedures are \nunacceptably loose. To examine this issue, I chaired a hearing on the \nproper disposal of military surplus before the Judiciary subcommittee \non Administrative Oversight and the Courts. I was alarmed at the ease \nwith which hostile foreign nations like China can purchase classified \nmilitary items from depots right here in America.\n  Mr. President, my amendment makes several much-needed reforms. First, \nthe amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to assign codes to \nmilitary equipment. These codes determine whether the equipment can \nlater be resold to the public as surplus or if the equipment must be \ndestroyed before it can be resold as surplus. Further, the amendment \ngives the Secretary of Defense the authority to take whatever steps he \ndeems necessary to fulfill this responsibility. Finally, my amendment \ncreates a new export control law which closes loopholes in current law \nwhich arms smugglers use to avoid prosecutions for exporting military \nsurplus. Importantly, this new export control law has the support of \nthe administration.\n  The problem of lax disposal procedures isn't new. The first \ncongressional hearings on this topic were conducted in the early 1970s. \nAt that time, Congress received testimony that the Pentagon's program \nfor ensuring the proper disposal of surplus items was in shambles.\n  Mr. President, after my hearing, I can say that the disposal process \nis still badly in need or reform. My hearing showed that there is a \ncavalier attitude toward the disposal of surplus equipment that \npresents a real danger to our national security and to the safety of \nthe American people. In one case, the Pentagon lost track of surplus \nequipment valued at 39 million dollars. That's a lot of stuff to lose \nin just one transaction.\n  It seems to me that disposing of tanks or missiles or classified \nmilitary equipment in a way that keeps them out of the hands of hostile \nforeign nations or terrorists is really central to the military \nmission, and so I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  Under current practice, the Pentagon has decided the answer to the \nquestion of what to do with surplus parts is to sell them to the \nhighest bidder, with practically no controls in place. The few controls \nthat are in place, which are supposed to make sure that military-grade \nsurplus doesn't end up with terrorists or hostile nations, continue to \nbe an abject failure by any reasonable standard.\n\n  Mr. President, the depots which sell sensitive military surplus have \nbecome thriving terrorist flea markets. In fact, the Pentagon even has \na world wide web homepage to advertise military surplus for sale--some \nof it classified. Who knows, right now some of Saddam Hussein's \nhenchmen could be browsing this homepage looking for spare parts or new \nweapons.\n  One way to measure whether an agency takes a problem seriously is to \nlook at how that agency disciplines its own employees when their \nmisconduct contributes to that problem in other words, how does the \nPentagon react when one of its own employees breaks the rules on \ndisposing or dangerous military surplus? By that standard, it appears \nto this Senator that the Defense Department doesn't take security \nbreaches at military depots very seriously. For instance, it's my \nunderstanding that the chief of a depot in Crane, Indiana was not \nseriously reprimanded for allowing over 70 grenade launchers to be sold \nwithout being properly destroyed. To date, only about 30 of those \nlaunchers have been recovered. What's the result? Every once in a \nwhile, law enforcement seizes one of these missing grenade launchers \nfrom a gang of criminals. Pentagon sloppiness is making criminals even \nmore dangerous and well-armed.\n  In another case which caused problems for law enforcement, the \nJustice Department had to drop illegal export charges against an arms \nsmuggler who had tried to send armored personnel carrier parts to Iran. \nThe Justice Department had to drop the charges because the defense \nlogistics agency had assigned the wrong code to the equipment.\n  Another indication that the Pentagon doesn't take the issue of \nproperly disposing of surplus very seriously is that no one from the \noffice of the Secretary of Defense would come to testify at my \nhearing--despite repeated requests that someone appear who could speak \nfor the Defense Department as a whole. That's why my amendment puts the \nresponsibility for disposing of surplus in the office of the Secretary \nof Defense. Congress needs to have someone to look to if there is to be \ngenuine accountability.\n  Finally, I'd like to sum up the situation we have here. Despite \ncongressional oversight going back to Senator McLellan's 1972 hearings, \nnothing has really changed. Therefore, it's clearly time for Congress \nto step up to the plate and take action. That's why I am offering this \namendment to the DOD authorizations bill to give law enforcement an \nenhanced ability to catch arms smugglers who are targeting military \nsurplus.\n  But helping law enforcement is only part of the solution that's \nmerely reactive. What we really need is for the Pentagon to get its \nhouse in order and prevent this problem from happening in the first \nplace. So, my amendment requires the office of the Secretary of Defense \nto take control of the surplus issue.\n  I think it's fair to say that if classified or highly sensitive \nmilitary technology is being sent to foreign nations and terrorists, we \nhave a clear threat to national security. We have dangerous weapons \ngoing from our own military depots into the hands of criminals. My \namendment would give law enforcement the tools they need and would hold \nthe Department of Defense accountable for solving this problem. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote for this amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand the amendment has been \ncleared. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, we are in the midst of a disturbing \nslowdown in the confirmation of judicial nominations, especially when \nthe nominees are women or minorities. A few days ago, on June 22, the \nSenate finally confirmed, by a vote of 56 to 34, Susan Oki Mollway, a \nJapanese-American nominated by President Clinton almost 3 years ago to \nserve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii.\n  Ms. Mollway was first nominated in the 104th Congress and was \nrenominated again in the 105th Congress. She was favorably reported out \nof the Judiciary Committee, not once but twice. It took 3 years for \nRepublicans to bring her nomination to the Senate floor despite the \nfact that a judicial emergency was declared in her district.\n  I am particularly concerned about the lack of progress in the \nconsideration of Hispanic judicial nominees before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Of the 36 judges confirmed in 1997, none were Latino, \nalthough six Latinos had been nominated. Thus far in 1998, 2 of the 26 \njudges confirmed were Latino and five are currently awaiting \nconfirmation. It took the Senate 32 months to confirm Ms. Hilda Tagle, \nthe only Hispanic woman the Senate confirmed this year. Why are the \nnominations of these qualified individuals taking so long? These \nnominees and the American people deserve an explanation.\n  The nominations of Emilio Cividanes, Richard Paez, Jorge Rangel, \nAnnabelle Rodriguez, and Sonia Sotomayor have been pending before the \nSenate for months. Two of these 5 nominees had to be renominated this \nCongress because their nominations expired in the 104th Congress \nwithout Senate action.\n  Sonia Sotomayor, a nominee for Second Circuit Court of Appeals, was \nreported out of committee on March 5, 1998. Nominee Richard Paez for \nthe Ninth Circuit was reported out of committee on March 19, 1998. No \nSenate action has been taken or scheduled on either nominee, and no \nexplanation of the delay has been forthcoming. My colleague, Xavier \nBecerra, Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said it best \nwhen he stated, ``This is a crisis. . . . Only two Latino judges have \nbeen confirmed this Congress out of a total of 62 confirmations.''\n  The Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy, \nhas come to the floor 3 times in the past month to demand Senate \nRepublican action. He pointed out that ``We are having hearings at the \nrate of one a month, barely keeping up with attrition and hardly making \na dent in the vacancies crisis . . . confronting the judiciary.''\n  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, William Rehnquist, calls that \n``vacancy crisis'' a ``most serious problem.'' He warns that \n``vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without \neroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated \nwith the federal judiciary.''\n  We cannot wait for the judicial system to collapse before the Senate \nacts. I call upon Senate Republicans to reject partisan politics and \nsignificantly\n\n[[Page S7009]]\n\naccelerate the pace of scheduled judicial confirmations before the \nSenate adjourns in October.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7008-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMUNITY OPPORTUNITIES, ACCOUNTABILITY, TRAINING, (AND EDUCATION) \n                          SERVICES (COATS) ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a colleague \nwho serves with me on the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources \nand on the Armed Services Committee. This morning, at the Labor \nCommittee's mark-up of S. 2206, the Human Services Reauthorization Act \nof 1998, I offered an Amendment to rename the legislation after the \nauthor of the bill, Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, which the Committee \napproved unanimously. As you know, Senator Coats will retire at the end \nof this Congress after serving in the Senate since 1988. Senator \nKennedy, Senator Dodd, and Senator Jeffords, Chairman of the Committee, \njoined me in offering the Amendment.\n  Senator Jeffords renamed the legislation the ``COATS'' Act--the \nCommunity Opportunities, Accountability, Training, (and Education) \nServices Act. S. 2206 reauthorizes and makes improvements to the Head \nStart program, the Community Services Block Grant program, the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, and it creates the new Assets \nfor Independence Act.\n  In the past, legislation has often been identified by ``legislative \nshorthand''--identifying legislation by the author instead of by the \ntitle. This began in the late nineteenth century with tariff bills \nnamed after either the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee or the \nChairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, or whichever body would \nreport and pass the legislation first. One example is the 1890 McKinley \nTariff legislation, named after Congressman William McKinley, then \nChairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and later President of \nthe United States.\n  In the twentieth century, naming legislation after a Senator became \nmore commonplace and lent legislative standing and prestige to both the \nbill and to its author. For instance, in 1935, the Wagner Labor Act was \nnamed after Senator Robert Wagner from New York. Another Labor bill in \n1947, the Taft-Hartley Act, was named after Senator Robert Taft from \nOhio.\n  Today, however, it is not as easy or as common to have a Senator's \nname formally placed on a bill. Only in cases of special recognition \nfor service, or to honor an accomplishment is this done. Throughout his \nSenate career, Senator Coats has been recognized and identified as a \nleader on issues dealing with children and families. It is an honor for \nme along with Senator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Dodd to \nsuggest renaming S. 2206 the COATS Act, and I am pleased the Labor \nCommittee unanimously agreed. I cannot think of a finer Senator to name \nthis legislation after than Dan Coats of Indiana who has worked so \ntirelessly on these issues.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, it is my pleasure to come to the floor of \nthe Senate today to inform my colleagues of something very special that \nhappened this morning during the committee's mark-up of S. 2206, the \nHuman Services Reauthorization Act.\n  The Human Services Act, as many of my colleagues know, authorizes a \nnumber of important programs, such as Head Start and the various \nactivities under the Community Services Block Grant that provide \nservices to families and communities in need. For the past 30 years, \nthe State, local and federal governments have worked jointly under this \nprogram to help lift our most vulnerable citizens out of poverty and \ninto self-sufficiency--one of the most noble goals of a responsible \ngovernment. Moreover, the programs in the Human Services Act has done \nthis effectively, and with widespread community involvement.\n  In the Labor and Human Resources Committee, the Subcommittee on \nChildren and Families--which is chaired by our colleague, Senator Dan \nCoats of Indiana--has been responsible for much of the heavy lifting \nthat has to be done as these programs make their way through our \ncommittee for the fifth time in the last twenty years. The Human \nServices Act is a large and very important act, so its reauthorization \nis never an easy process, especially in a committee as diverse as ours. \nWhile broad bipartisan support for the reauthorization bill is always a \ndesirable goal, it is never a given. And this year, Senator Coats \nworked overtime to make sure that his bill would not only responsibly \nreauthorize the Human Services Act, but would also do so in a way which \naccommodated the concerns and requests of members on both sides of the \naisle. Consequently, the Labor and Human Resources Committee approved \nthe reauthorization of the Human Services Act by a unanimous vote of 18 \nto 0.\n  But Mr. President, I am not here today to make my pitch for the \nreauthorization of the Human Services Act--that will come soon enough. \nRather, I want to highlight Senator Coats' hard work on this \nlegislation. It is yet another illustrative example of the years of \nservice that Senator Dan Coats has committed to strengthening families, \nstrengthening children, and strengthening communities. It is typical of \nSenator Coats that he does so in a manner that is always tenacious, but \nnever brash. While he is always accommodating, he never loses sight of \nthe ultimate goal of helping families and communities. And with his \nquiet demeanor and a wit that I think sometimes surprises even him, \nSenator Coats is always a pleasure to work with, especially when it is \nfor a common goal, as it was in this morning's mark-up.\n  As we all know, Senator Coats has announced he will not be returning \nto this body when his term expires at the end of the 105th Congress. \nHowever, his departure does not mean his voice on behalf of children \nand families will be any quieter. Senator Coats will move into a new \nleadership role as President of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of the USA. \nThis is a program that I know is very near to Senator Coats' heart, and \nthe Senate's loss is clearly Big Brothers/Big Sisters' gain.\n  In the Labor Committee, and in the Senate as a whole, we will miss \nDan Coats. We will miss his leadership, and we will miss his \nfriendship. When someone who is such a good friend leaves, it is \nsometimes difficult to know just what to give that friend of yours as a \ntoken of your affection. Well, Mr. President, at this morning's mark-up \nof the Human Services reauthorization, we gave it a try.\n  It is with real pleasure that I inform the Senate that this morning \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee unanimously agreed to name the \n1998 reauthorization of the Human Services Act as the ``Community \nOpportunities, Accountability, Training and Educational Services Act,'' \nor, as we prefer to call it, the COATS Act. We did this in recognition \nof all that Senator Coats has done not only on this bill, but for \nchildren and families throughout his career.\n  Mr. President, I know there will be more time later to honor Senator \nCoats for all that he has done here in the Senate. But sometimes time \ngets away from us and we never let some of our colleagues know how much \nthey mean to us. The action by the Labor Committee this morning is a \nmodest gesture, but a sincere one. I think Senator Coats knows that it \nis from all of our hearts. We shall miss you, Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7009-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7009-S7010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEATH OF A GREAT IRISH-AMERICAN--PAUL O'DWYER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was greatly saddened to learn of the \ndeath today of Paul O'Dwyer of New York City. To all of us who knew him \nand worked with him and loved him, he was a great friend, a great \nchampion of democracy and civil rights, a great friend of working \nfamilies, and a great friend of Ireland. He will be dearly missed.\n  Paul was born in County Mayo in Ireland, and immigrated to the United \nStates in 1924 at the age of seventeen. He put himself through law \nschool at night, and formed his lifelong commitment to the political \nand social causes which were so important to him and for which we all \nadmired him.\n  He was a proud supporter of Ireland all his life. He was a hero to \nthe people of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and to Irish Americans as \nwell. At the same time, he recognized the importance of reaching out to \nthe Protestant community in Northern Ireland to achieve\n\n[[Page S7010]]\n\npeace and reconciliation in that troubled land, and he always insisted \non meeting with Protestant leaders visiting this country.\n  Paul was elected to a number of offices in his long and brilliant \ncareer, including President of the New York City Council. Once, when \nasked about his decision to come to America as an immigrant, Paul said \n``I thought of going back, but something that grips you as an immigrant \nis the sense of freedom here.'' As few individuals have ever done, he \nworked hard and long and well to provide that freedom for all \nAmericans. We will miss his leadership, and we will miss his \nfriendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7009-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PASSAGE OF A+ SAVINGS ACCOUNT BILL\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent this morning \nand I missed the vote on the Conference Report for H.R. 1882 the A+ \nSavings Account for Public and Private Schools.\n  I am pleased that this bill was approved by the Senate by a vote of \n59-36. This legislation has my wholehearted support.\n  Several significant reforms in the bill are based, in part, on \nfindings of a Senate Task Force on Education that I was privileged to \nbe a part of. These include testing and merit pay incentives of \nteachers, and tax incentives for parents who save for their children's \nK-12 education needs.\n  The President should look at the merits of this bill and sign it into \nlaw. It is time that the federal government stops enabling an \nentrenched education bureaucracy that resists every attempt at \nexponential change.\n  New Mexicans, I believe, are ready to embrace such change, and this \nlegislation is the vehicle to begin making our schools ready for the \ntwenty-first century.\n  I am pleased this bill includes a provision to provide incentive \nfunds to states that establish periodic assessments of elementary and \nsecondary school teachers, including a merit pay system to reward \nteachers based on merit and proven performance. The provision permits \nthe use of federal education dollars to establish and administer these \nprograms.\n  Teacher testing and merit pay is an important philosophical shift. It \nis reasonable to expect teachers to know the subject matter they are \nresponsible for imparting to our young people.\n  The centerpiece of the bill is the establishment of tax-free savings \naccounts that can be used for qualified education expenses from \nkindergarten through twelfth grade.\n  Main provisions in the bill, beyond the merit pay and block grant \nprovisions, are:\n  A+ Savings Accounts.--These accounts are similar to the current \nEducation IRA for college tuition. Under this bill, the annual \ncontribution limit will be increased from $500 to $2,000 a year. This \ngives millions of famlies the opportunity to save tax-free for their \nchildren's education.\n  Extend employer-provided education benefits to 1 million employees--\nThe bill extends this popular provision that allows employees to accept \nemployer-provided education assistance without having to declare it as \nincome (up to $5,250 a year). The tax exclusion will apply to \nassistance for undergraduate courses.\n  Allow 1 million students to benefit from tax-free state pre-paid \ntuition plans--Many states have established pre-paid tuition plans to \nmake it more affordable to attend state colleges in the future, and to \nhelp families save for this important expenses. The bill goes a step \nbeyond tax deferral of such savings as currently allowed--this bill \nmakes such savings tax-free. (The New Mexico legislature is expected to \nconsider a pre-paid tuition plan.)\n  School Construction: Assists local governments in issuing tax-exempt \nbonds for school construction by increasing the small-issuer exception \nfrom $10 million to $15 million, provided that at least $10 million of \nthe bonds are issued to finance public schools.\n  Health Scholarships: Provides tax-free treatment for National Health \nCorps Scholarships. In addition, the conferees extended tax free \ntreatment to Hebert Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarships.\n  Student Improvement Incentive Awards: Allows State education agencies \nto make awards to public schools that demonstrate a high level of \nacademic achievement.\n  State Incentives for Teacher Testing and Merit Pay: Authorizes the \nDepartment of Education to provide awards to states that test their K-\n12 teachers every three to five years in the subjects they teach and \nthat have a merit pay program.\n  Same Gender Schools and Classrooms: Allows federal funding for \neducation reform projects that provide same-gender schools and \nclassrooms, as long as comparable opportunities are afforded both \nsexes.\n  Reading Excellence: Authorizes a literacy program that focuses on \ntraining teachers to teach reading using scientifically proven methods \nsuch as phonics. The President supports the program and $210 million \nwas appropriated by Congress last year to establish a literacy program.\n  Safer Schools: Includes language providing that weapons brought to \nschool are admissible as evidence in any internal school disciplinary \nproceedings.\n  I genuinely hope that the President will sign this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7010-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to reduce class size in the early grades and to \nprovide for teacher quality improvement; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n          Class-Size Reduction and Teacher quality Act of 1998\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I send to the desk legislation to \nhelp school districts hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers to combat \novercrowding in our nation's classrooms. Few issues are more important \nto the American family than the quality of our public schools. With \nchallenges like illiteracy, poor work and study skills, and the threat \nof student violence, what we need are strategies that work to produce \nresults for all students. Increasing the number of well-qualified \nteachers to reduce class size is an effort that works.\n  The research is clear, and the research only backs up what our school \ncommunities have long known, that class size reduction improves student \nachievement. Unlike vouchers and tax schemes that don't provide the \nbenefits for schools or students that they claim--class size reduction \nworks, and it benefits all students.\n  Public education is important to the American people, and has been \nsince the beginning of our nation. The public school is one of the most \neffective self-betterment tools in the history of this country.\n  But this bastion of democracy is threatened when public expectation \nchanges, and the public school is not allowed to follow the public \nwill. There was a time not long ago when people with a high school \ndiploma or people who had not graduated from high school could still \nparticipate meaningfully in our economy. Those times have changed.\n  Americans expect public schools to educate all students to a higher \nstandard, and expect a high school diploma to be accurate assurance \nthat a graduate knows and can do what it takes to succeed in higher \neducation and in today's economy. Most teachers in most classrooms do a \ngood job--and some are clearly gifted.\n  But many teachers, excellent in other ways, lack the training, \npreparation, and know-how to teach reading in ways that reflect the \nbest research. Many otherwise skilled teachers need help to teach \ntoday's skills with today's technology. And any teacher has a difficult \ntime getting youngsters ready for today's world when there are more \nthan 30 children in a classroom.\n  So the class size reduction bill I'm introducing today puts the funds \nin the hands of local school districts to train teachers in effective \npractices, to get uncertified teachers up to certification standards, \nto provide mentor teachers for teachers who need it, and to improve \nteacher recruiting.\n  Improving class size is an investment in our future that we know will \npay dividends. This proposal is still building momentum in Congress. \nTwice now, this class size proposal has been voted on this year, and \nthe last time it was one vote away from passage. The public is aware \nthat efforts such as the Coverdell IRA proposal do not provide results \neven for the few students they are targeted to help. Ask any parent or \nstudent, and they'll tell you class size reduction works for all \nstudents.\n  The President had originally talked about funding class size \nreduction with tobacco revenues, but class size improvement was left \nout of the bill that left the Commerce Committee.\n  With or without a tobacco bill, we can pass the class size \nimprovement initiative and keep a balanced budget. In the President's \nbudget request, there are still more than $20 billion in mandatory and \ntax offsets we have not yet used. There are several ways to fund a \nclass size initiative, keep a balanced budget, and provide in one \naction real results for all students.\n  Also, as I've mentioned before, this really is an issue of \npriorities. Yesterday, the House Appropriations Committee took a meat \ncleaver to social programs, such as elimination of the summer jobs for \nteenagers, and winter heating assistance for elderly people in harsh \nwinter climates. This year, thanks to the tough decisions I and others \nhere made in 1993 and other factors, we are looking at a balanced \nbudget.\n  Now more than ever, the American people priorities are what matter, \nand they must be reflected in our funding decisions. These are their \nfederal tax dollars we are investing, and education is a much higher \npriority to most Americans than the two percent of spending it \ncurrently holds.\n  We have been sending out and continue to send funds to communities so \nthey can hire 100,000 police officers. The communities which have hired \nthese officers have responded with enthusiasm. Allowing school \ndistricts to hire 100,000 teachers to school districts will do the same \nthing--invigorate both the local school district they affect, and the \nstate governments who can fund class size improvement on a greater \nscale.\n  The American people want their national investments to be common \nsense solutions that work. They want to see national initiatives jump-\nstart real improvements in their local school. They want better \nteachers, and smaller class sizes. They want to know that when their \nchild goes to school next fall, they are going to get good answers to \ntheir perennial questions: ``Who's your teacher, and how many kids are \nin your class?''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2210. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act with \nrespect to the requirements for the admission of nonimmigrant nurses \nwho will practice in health professional shortage areas; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7013-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7013-S7018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NURSING RELIEF FOR DISADVANTAGED AREAS ACT OF 1998\n\n   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Today I introduce the Nursing \nRelief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1998. Today,\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\nsome of our nation's poorest rural and inner-city communities face a \ncrisis --they may soon have inadequate or no hospital health care \nbecause nurses are unwilling to work in these neighborhoods. The \nNursing Relief Act will ensure that hospitals located in these \ndesperately under served areas can continue to provide adequate health \ncare to our most needy communities.\n  Hospitals located in underprivileged areas often experience severe \ndifficulty in attracting nurses. These hospitals operate in the middle \nof some of the harshest poverty and crime in our country. The employees \nof these hospitals often treat the worst and most troubling cases.\n  And, the condition of the surrounding area imperils the ability of \nthese hospitals to recruit and maintain an adequate nursing staff. \nThese circumstances have pushed some hospitals into a financial crisis, \nthreatening the quality of health care to those most in need.\n  For the past eight years, this problem has been addressed by the \nH(1)(a) visa program which has allowed these hospitals to hire \nnonimmigrant nurses. Unfortunately, the H(1)(a) visa program sunset \nlast fall, and so once again such hospitals are in crisis. By replacing \nthe H(1)(a) visa, the Nursing Relief Act will alleviate this crisis.\n  The true beneficiary of this program will not be the hospitals, but \nthe underprivileged communities which rely on the hospitals' services. \nLet me tell you a story about the role that this program can play in \nthe health of a community. The story is about St. Bernard hospital on \nthe South Side of Chicago.\n  St. Bernard Hospital is the only remaining hospital in the Englewood \ncommunity on the south side of Chicago, one of the poorest and most \ncrime ridden neighborhoods in the country. Over the years, St. Bernard \nhas become indispensable to its community. Even though it has not been \ndesignated as a trauma center, St. Bernard receives the second highest \nnumber of ambulance runs from the Chicago Fire Department. St. Bernard \nalso provides free vision exams and free screening for blood pressure, \ncholesterol, diabetes, and sickle cell anemia. In addition, \nschoolchildren receive free physicals and inoculations, and the \nhospital sponsors numerous health fairs throughout the area.\n  St. Bernard also offers a great number of outreach and community \nservices. A food pantry is stocked, and clothes are made available for \npatients in need. St. Bernard is sponsoring a project for affordable \nhousing in the community. The hospital has opened four family clinics \nin Englewood to provide safe and easy access to health care for \ncommunity residents. Physicians from St. Bernard visit senior housing \nfacilities on a regular basis, and the hospital has been recognized by \nCatholic Charities for its work with senior housing and health care.\n  In addition, St. Bernard is the largest employer in the Englewood \narea. When the hospital faces a crisis, many jobs in the community are \nplaced at risk.\n  Even though the health of Englewood relies on this hospital, St. \nBernard almost had to close its doors in 1992. Even after aggressive \nrecruitment efforts, the hospital was unable to attract enough health \ncare professionals to maintain its services. The hospital was \nespecially in need of registered nurses.\n  The problem had been solved in part by hiring foreign nurses through \nthe H(1)(a) visa program. The hospital had gone through great lengths \nto hire domestic nurses, and was using the h(1)(a) program only as a \nlast alternative to closing its doors.\n  In the first half of 1997, for example, the hospital placed want ads \nin the Chicago Tribune and received approximately 200 responses. \nHowever, almost 75 percent of the respondents declined to interview \nwhen they learned where the hospital was located. St. Bernard has also \ntried to hire nurses through nurse registries. However, the rates of \nthe registries would cost the hospital more than $2 million each year, \nan unsustainable expense for an already financially burdened hospital.\n  Clearly, the H(1)(a) visa program had been offering St. Bernard a way \nto maintain its service to the community when no other option was \navailable. This past fall, even that option was eliminated.\n\n  My measure, the Nursing Relief Act, will ensure that hospitals like \nSt. Bernard can keep their doors open to the public and continue to \nsupport their community. In addition, however, my bill has been \ndesigned to protect the jobs of domestic nurses and to ensure that \nhospitals use the visa program faithfully and only as a last resort \nsolution.\n  I have therefore drafted the Nursing Relief Act to be more narrowly \ntargeted than the old H(1)(a) visa program. My measure ensures that \nnurses can only be brought into the United States by hospitals that \nhave no other alternative. In short, we have made every effort to \nensure that no American nurse will lose his or her job as a result of \nmy bill. While we want to assure that these hospitals have an adequate \nnursing staff, we must also guarantee that foreign nurses are not \ntaking away jobs from domestic nurses.\n  Let me tell you what my bill does:\n  It establishes a nonimmigrant classification for nurses in health \nprofessional shortage areas. The program provides non-immigrant visas \nfor 500 nurses each year to work in hospitals where there are severe \nnursing shortages.\n  The Nursing Relief Act protects the jobs of domestic nurses in three \nseparate ways:\n  First, my measure requires that a hospital must certify that it has \ngone through great lengths to hire and retain domestic nurses before it \ncan use this visa program to hire nonimmigrant nurses.\n  Second, my measure requires that nonimmigrant nurses must be paid the \nsame wages and work under the same conditions as domestic nurses. In \naddition, nonimmigrant nurses cannot be hired in order to disrupt the \nactivities of labor unions. These provisions ensure that hospitals \ncannot undercut the working conditions of domestic nurses.\n  And third, my measure limits the number of nonimmigrant nurses who \nmay enter the United States in any given year. The Act provides spaces \nfor only 500 nonimmigrants each year, and it caps the number of nurses \nwho may enter each state.\n  In addition, the Nursing Relief Act provides for serious penalties \nfor abuse, thus ensuring that hospitals will not misuse this new visa \ncategory. Moreover, my bill guarantees that hospitals use this program \nfaithfully by narrowly defining the hospitals which are eligible. In \norder to hire nonimmigrant nurses through this visa program, hospitals \nmust fulfill four strict requirements:\n  First, the hospital must be located in an area which has been defined \nby the Department of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of \nhealth care professionals.\n  Second, the hospital must have at least 190 acute care beds.\n  Third, the hospital must have at least 35 percent of its in-patient \ndays reimbursed by Medicare.\n  Fourth, the hospital must have at least 28 percent of its in-patient \ndays reimbursed by Medicaid.\n  All of these measures ensure that the Nursing Relief Act will serve \nas a relief to our communities rather than a loophole in the \nimmigration laws.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to introduce this \nimportant and very timely initiative. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me and support the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of \n1998 so that every hospital can maintain an adequate nursing staff \nregardless of its location.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for \nCongressional Review of rules establishing or increasing taxes, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                         Taxpayer's Defense Act\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I introduce the Taxpayer's \nDefense Act. Quite simply, this bill prohibits any agency from \nestablishing a tax on the American people.\n  Mr. President. As we all know, the United States was founded on one \nsimple and fundamental principle--no taxation without representation.\n  ``In the Second Treatise of Government,'' John Locke said, ``if \nanyone shall claim a power to lay and levy taxes on the people . . . \nwithout . . . consent of the people, he thereby . . . subverts the end \nof government.'' According to Locke, consent required agreement by a \nmajority of the people, ``either by themselves or their representatives \nchosen by them.'' The Declaration of Independence listed, among the \ndespotic acts of King George, his ``imposing taxes on us without our \nconsent.''\n  The Boston Tea Party remains the symbol of Americans' opposition to \ntaxation without representation. The Constitutional authority--given \nonly to Congress--to establish federal taxes is clear. Its reasoning \nalso is clear. It is the Congress that represents the people. Only \nCongress considers and weighs every issue that rises to national \nimportance. While Federal agencies consider their own priorities to be \nparamount, only Congress can determine which goals merit a tax on the \nAmerican people.\n  The modern era of restricted federal budgets, however, threatens to \nerode the essential principle of ``no taxation without \nrepresentation.'' In many subtle and often hidden ways, federal \nagencies are receiving from Congress the power to tax.\n  They tax by adding unnecessary charges to legitimate government user \nfees. They tax through federal mandates. These taxes pass the cost of \ngovernment on to the American people--without their knowledge.\n  The worst example of administrative taxation is the Federal \nCommunications Commission's Universal Service Tax. ``Universal \nservice'' is the idea that everyone should have access to affordable \ntelecommunications services. It originated at the beginning of the \ncentury when the first national telecommunications service was still \nbeing created. This idea was expanded in the Telecommunications Act of \n1996, which allowed the FCC to extend universal service funds to \nprovide ``discount telecommunications services'' to schools, libraries, \nand rural health care facilities.\n  Most importantly, the Act gave the FCC the power to decide the level \nof ``contributions''--taxes--that telecommunications companies would \nhave to pay to support universal service. The FCC now determines how \nmuch must be collected in taxes that subsidize a variety of `universal \nservice' spending programs. Long distance providers pass the costs on \nto consumers in the form of higher telephone bills. In the first half \nof 1998, the tax was $625 million, and the Clinton Administration's \nbudget projects it will rise to $10 billion per year. This \nadministrative tax is already out of control.\n  This is possible because Congress delegated its authority to tax. The \nFCC is able to collect taxpayer dollars at levels it sets--without \napproval from Congress or the people. The FCC can defy Congress and the \npeople because it has the power to levy taxes.\n  Mr. President, some people thought the tax and spend liberals had \nleft Washington. Not so. Washington interest groups who want to feed at \nthis new federal trough already are geared up to accuse the Republican \nCongress of cutting funding for education and health care if any \nattempt is made to rein in the FCC. They will frame the issue as a \nmatter of federal entitlements for sympathetic causes and groups.\n  The most sympathetic group is the American taxpayer, whose money is \nbeing taken, laundered through the Washington bureaucracy, and returned \nfor purposes set by unelected Washington Bureaucrats. This is why the \nFCC must be required to get the approval of Congress before setting \nfuture tax rates.\n  Should tax dollars be used for federal universal service programs and \nwhat amounts or should Americans spend what they earn on their own, \nreal, local priorities? Requiring Congress to review any administrative \ntaxes would answer this question.\n  My bill would create a new section to the Congressional Review Act \nfor mandatory review of certain agency rules. Any rule that establishes \nor raises a tax would have to be submitted to and receive the approval \nof Congress before taking effect. In essence, the Act would disable \nagencies from setting taxes, but would allow them to formulate \nproposals under existing rulemaking procedures.\n  Once submitted to Congress, a taxing regulation would be introduced \nin both the House and Senate by the Majority Leader. The rule would \nthen be subject to expedited procedures, allowing a prompt decision on \nwhether or not to approve a rule. The rule would have to be approved by \nboth Houses and signed by the President.\n  Congress must not allow a federal agency--unelected and unaccountable \nfederal bureaucrats--to determine the amount of taxes hardworking \nAmericans must pay. The Taxpayer's Defense Act will require Congress to \nstand up and face the American people when it decides to tax. The cry \nof ``no taxation without representation'' has gone up in the land \nbefore, and today we are hearing it again. It is time that we \nrespond.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kerrey, Mr.\n\n[[Page S7017]]\n\n        DeWine, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Ford, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Roth, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 2213. A bill to allow all States to participate in activities \nunder the Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Act; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              the education flexibility amendments of 1998\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I introduce, with my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden, the Education Flexibility Amendments of \n1998. This bipartisan measure will expand the immensely popular and \nhighly successful Ed-Flex program to all 50 states in the country. As \nyou may know, Ed-Flex is currently a demonstration program, available \nonly to 12 states. Under the Frist-Wyden bill, all states would be \nallowed to participate in the program and the 12 original states would \nbe permitted to expand Ed-Flex waiver authority to include programs \nunder the Adult Education and Technology for Education Acts.\n  As the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Task Force on \nEducation, formed by Budget Chairman Pete Domenici, I heard first-hand \naccounts of the success of the Ed-Flex program and the need for \nflexibility for our states that are overburdened by federal \nrequirements. The Commissioner of the Florida Department of Education, \nFrank Brogan, told the Task Force that it takes 297 state employees to \noversee and administer $1 billion in federal funds. In contrast, only \n374 employees oversee approximately $7 billion in state funds. Thus, it \ntakes six times as many people to administer a federal dollar as a \nstate dollar.\n  Brogan went on to say:\n\n       We at the State and Local level feel the crushing burden \n     caused by too many Federal regulations, procedures, and \n     mandates. Florida spends millions of dollars every year to \n     administer inflexible, categorical Federal programs that \n     divert precious dollars away from raising student \n     achievement.\n\n  This must change.\n  Secretary Riley told the Task Force that, ``through our Ed-Flex \ndemonstration initiative, we are giving State-level officials broad \nauthority to waive federal requirements that present an obstacle to \ninnovation in their schools.'' The Department of Education further \nnotes, `` Ed-Flex can help participating states and local school \ndistricts use federal funds in ways that provide maximum support for \neffective school reform based on challenging academic standards for all \nstudents.''\n  The National Governors Association has expressed its strong support \nfor the expansion of Ed-Flex. At the NGA Winter Meeting, the Governors \nexpressed their interest in expanding Ed-Flex to all 50 states. At this \nsame meeting, President Clinton also expressed his support for Ed-Flex \nexpansion.\n  I pose the following question to my colleagues: who isn't for \nexpanding Ed-Flex?\n  Numerous articles have highlighted the innovative reform efforts \nunderway in the Chicago Public School System and have extolled its \nearly successes. Illinois is an Ed-Flex state. Cozette Buckney of the \nChicago School System attributes much of the Chicago success to \nflexibility--the very flexibility offered to states and localities by \nEd-Flex. She pleaded, ``Let us be accountable to you for getting the \nresults, but give us the flexibility to do it the way that works best \nfor us.''\n  According to other Chicago officials:\n\n       One of the frustrating things with Federal assistance that \n     has come in through this process is we oftentimes find our \n     way saying how can we do what we want to do and how can we \n     use federal funding so that we can make sure that it is \n     happening. Most of our initiatives are locally based, locally \n     funded, locally developed by people who have been working in \n     Chicago for many years. We know the system, and we believe we \n     know the things that it needs to have happen in order to \n     improve. So the more flexibility that we have with federal \n     and states funds, the easier it is to make those changes.\n\n  During another Education Task Force hearing, we heard from Texas that \nthey have granted over 4,000 waivers, largely to streamline the \npaperwork associated with administering and applying for the various \nfederal programs. According to Texas Education Official Madeleine \nManigold:\n\n       Ed-Flex has allowed Texas to foster the coordination of \n     programs and streamlining of administration of programs that \n     are actually operated by the United States Department of \n     Education, while maintaining the underlying purpose of the \n     covered federal programs.\n\n  Rest assured, though I support the concept of block grants to states \nas a means to achieve even greater flexibility, Ed-Flex expansion is \nNOT a block grant proposal. States may NOT pool funds from various \nfederal education programs, and they must ensure that the underlying \npurposes of the program in question will continue to be met. Ed-Flex \nsimply allows states some relief from the burgeoning mass of \nbureaucratic federal regulations and requirements in administering \ndesignated federal education programs.\n  It's time to bring some common sense to education reform. Ed-Flex is \na good first step toward granting states and localities more \nflexibility in using federal funds in the most effective and efficient \nway possible. Our states and localities are the engines of change--\nlet's give all of our states the freedom and capability to meet the \nchallenges of education with innovation and creativity.\n  Mr. President, I believe that passage of this legislation is a strong \nfirst step for improving our public education system. Let's give states \nand localities the flexibility that they need to address the many needs \nof our students. I strongly urge passage of this bill. Mr. President, I \nunanimous consent that a letter of support from the National Governors' \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n         National Governors' Association, National Conference of \n           State Legislatures\n                                                    June 18, 1998.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     United States Senate, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Wyden: We write on behalf of the \n     nation's Governors and state legislatures to express our \n     strong support for your efforts in the Senate to expand the \n     highly successful Ed-Flex demonstration program to all fifty \n     states during this Congress. States that participate in Ed-\n     Flex have found that this program has been helpful in moving \n     education reform forward in the 12 states that currently \n     participate. Under the Wyden-Frist proposal, states currently \n     participating in Ed-Flex would receive additional waiver \n     authority and the bill would permit all states to become Ed-\n     Flex states. We strongly support the expansion of this \n     successful program.\n       While Ed-Flex is perceived to be a positive program because \n     it provides states with greater flexibility, some members of \n     Congress have questioned whether there are immediate benefits \n     that Ed-Flex can provide to states. Some members have \n     suggested a delay in expanding the Ed-Flex program to all \n     fifty states until Congress reauthorizes the elementary and \n     secondary programs in the next Congress. We know that this \n     program has helped states and schools by giving them some \n     limited waiver authority. With experiences of the 12 current \n     Ed-Flex states as evidence, we know that the adverse \n     predictions made about the Ed-Flex program when it was \n     originally created have not materialized. With the Secretary \n     of Education's guidance, this program has helped states and \n     school districts do a better job. We need Ed-Flex now.\n       By expanding Ed-Flex during this congress, all states would \n     have the opportunity to identify and waive regulations, and \n     in the process, identify aspects of the statutes and the \n     regulations that need to be changed or eliminated when the \n     elementary and secondary education bills are reauthorized \n     next year.\n       We applaud your current efforts and look forward to working \n     with you toward the enactment of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor George V. Voinovich,\n       Chair, National Governors' Association.\n     Governor Thomas R. Carper,\n       Vice Chair, National Governors' Association.\n     Donna Sytek,\n       Speaker, New Hampshire House of Representatives,\n     Chair, National Conference of State Legislatures Assembly on \n                                                   Federal Issues.\n     Linda Furney,\n                            Assistant Minority Leader, Ohio Senate\n     Chair, National Conference of State Legislatures Committee on \n                        Education, Labor and Job Training.\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I join together with Senator Frist \nand ten other colleagues today to introduce bipartisan education reform \nlegislation, based on a simple proposition: the federal government \nshould liberate schools from the federal government's mandated \nbureaucratic water torture in return for schools committing to improve \nstudent performance. This bill is an invitation to innovation, an \nopportunity to develop home grown, locally\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\ndriven solutions to Americans biggest education challenges.\n  This legislation would empower states to get out from under \nburdensome federal education regulations, by expanding the enormously \npopular ``Ed-Flex'' demonstration program--in which 12 states already \nparticipate--into a nationwide effort. Ed-Flex is the program that \nallows states to waive out of certain federal regulations if they come \nup with a plan to show how they can do a better job. A State has to \nwaive their own set of education regulations, develop high academic \nstandards for their students and hold schools accountable for results.\n  Here is a brief example of how Ed-Flex works: In the past, federal \nfunds have allowed schools to purchase computers for students with \ndisabilities, but the rules prevented others from using the equipment \nwhen the students weren't using it. So in an Oregon school district, in \nreturn for committing to using the idle computers to improve adult \neducation, the State got a waiver to use the computer for this extra \nuse as well as for the disabled students.\n  Ohio uses a teacher training program that, without a waiver, can only \nbe used to train teachers in math and science. Ohio wanted to use it \nwhere the greatest academic need is. They now have an Ed-Flex waiver \nand can tailor their teacher training program to the needs of the \nstudents, not to the needs of the federal government. In exchange, Ohio \nwill have better prepared teachers in the classroom to help students \nimprove in those areas.\n  My state also uses Ed-Flex to allow school districts to team up with \ncommunity colleges to better prepare kids to go into the workforce. \nUsing the Carl Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Act program, \nOregon students can earn college credit or learn a practical skill \nwithout worrying about whether a credit will transfer or if they have \nto file several different pieces of paperwork.\n  And even more kids will be able to benefit if we can expand Ed-Flex \nto allow school districts to streamline bureaucracies even further and \neliminate waste. The bill Senator Frist and I are introducing today \nwill expand Ed-Flex from a pilot program in just a few states to every \nplace from Maine to Honolulu. The bill will also provide a unique \nopportunity for current Ed-Flex states to experience more flexibility \nin their adult literacy and educational technology programs.\n  Let me give you an example of how the new flexibility will benefit my \nstate. According to the National Adult Literacy Survey, Oregon has one \nof the highest literacy levels in the country. In fact, 75 percent of \nOregonians have basic reading skills; that is, they can proficiently \nread, write and speak in English, whereas 55 percent of all adults in \nthe nation achieved that level. Yet, for Oregonians, less than 100 \npercent is not good enough. We want all of our adults to have basic \nliteracy skills. Under the Adult Education Act, a State can only use 20 \npercent of the funds to prepare people to make high school equivalency \ntests. That may work for a state that has a very low literacy level, \nbut it does not work for Oregon.\n  Oregon would like to develop a waiver to use the funds to help all \nilliterate or semi-literate adults earn a GED (general education \ndevelopment) or other high school equivalency measure. The more people \nwith a GED, the more valuable our workforce becomes. Under our Ed-Flex \nbill, Oregon would be eligible to apply for that waiver.\n  Mr. President, this bill grows out of the work of the Senate Budget \nCommittee's Education Task Force, which Senator Frist chaired, and on \nwhich I served. Together, in hearing after hearing, we listened to \nStates tell us that they can do a better job. They said they could \nbalance flexibility and accountability and they we ready to be judged \nby results, not process. We know as well that Ed-Flex has strong \nsupport from the Administration, and our bill has strong bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate and from the National Governors Association.\n  Oregon was the first state to participate in Ed-Flex, and people in \nOregon are convinced that regulatory flexibility and school \naccountability work. It is time to expand that approach \nnationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

\n REGARDING THE CULPABILITY OF SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC FOR WAR CRIMES IN THE \n                           FORMER YUGOSLAVIA\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 105\n\n         \n       Whereas there is reason to mark the beginning of the \n     conflict in the former Yugoslavia with Slobodan Milosevic's \n     rise to power beginning in 1987, when he whipped up and \n     exploited extreme nationalism among Serbs, and specifically \n     in Kosovo, including support for violence against non-Serbs \n     who were labeled as threats;\n       Whereas there is reason to believe that as President of \n     Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic was responsible for the conception \n     and direction of a war of aggression, the deaths of hundreds \n     of thousands, the torture and rape of tens of thousands and \n     the forced displacement of nearly 3,000,000 people, and that \n     mass rape and forced impregnation were among the tools used \n     to wage this war;\n       Whereas ``ethnic cleansing'' has been carried out in the \n     former Yugoslavia in such a consistent and systematic way \n     that it had to be directed by the senior political leadership \n     in Serbia, and Slobodan Milosevic has held such power within \n     Serbia that he is responsible for the conception and \n     direction of this policy;\n       Whereas, as President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     (Serbia and Montenegro), Slobodan Milosevic is responsible \n     for the conception and direction of assaults by Yugoslavian \n     and Serbian military, security, special police, and other \n     forces on innocent civilians in Kosovo which have so far \n     resulted in an estimated 300 people dead or missing and the \n     forced displacement of tens of thousands, and such assaults \n     continue;\n       Whereas on May 25, 1993, United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 827 created the International Criminal Tribunal \n     for the former Yugoslavia located in The Hague, the \n     Netherlands (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``Tribunal''), and gave it jurisdiction over all crimes \n     arising out of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas this Tribunal has publicly indicted 60 people for \n     war crimes or crimes against humanity arising out of the \n     conflict in the former Yugoslavia and has issued a\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\n     number of secret indictments that have only been made public \n     upon the apprehension of the indicted persons;\n       Whereas it is incumbent upon the United States and all \n     other nations to support the Tribunal, and the United States \n     has done so by providing, since 1992, funding in the amount \n     of $54,000,000 in assessed payments and more than $11,000,000 \n     in voluntary and in-kind contributions to the Tribunal and \n     the War Crimes Commission which preceded it, and by supplying \n     information collected by the United States that can aid the \n     Tribunal's investigations, prosecutions, and adjudications;\n       Whereas any lasting, peaceful solution to the conflict in \n     the former Yugoslavia must be based upon justice for all, \n     including the most senior officials of the government or \n     governments responsible for conceiving, organizing, \n     initiating, directing, and sustaining the Yugoslav conflict \n     and whose forces have committed war crimes, crimes against \n     humanity and genocide; and\n       Whereas Slobodan Milosevic has been the single person who \n     has been in the highest government offices in an aggressor \n     state since before the inception of the conflict in the \n     former Yugoslavia, who has had the power to decide for peace \n     and instead decided for war, who has had the power to \n     minimize illegal actions by subordinates and allies and hold \n     responsible those who committed such actions, but did not, \n     and who is once again directing a campaign of ethnic \n     cleansing against innocent civilians in Kosovo while treating \n     with contempt international efforts to achieve a fair and \n     peaceful settlement to the question of the future status of \n     Kosovo: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should publicly declare that it \n     considers that there is probable cause to believe that \n     Slobodan Milosevic, President of the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), has committed war crimes, \n     crimes against humanity and genocide;\n       (2) the United States should make collection of information \n     that can be supplied to the Tribunal for use as evidence to \n     support an indictment and trial of President Slobodan \n     Milosevic for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and \n     genocide a high priority;\n       (3) any such information concerning President Slobodan \n     Milosevic already collected by the United States should be \n     provided to the Tribunal as soon as possible;\n       (4) the United States should provide a fair share of any \n     additional financial or personnel resources that may be \n     required by the Tribunal in order to enable the Tribunal to \n     adequately address preparation for, indictment of, \n     prosecution of, and adjudication of allegations of war crimes \n     and crimes against humanity posed against President Slobodan \n     Milosevic and any other person arising from the conflict in \n     the former Yugoslavia, including in Kosovo;\n       (5) the United States should engage with other members of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other interested \n     states in a discussion of information any such state may hold \n     relating to allegations of war crimes and crimes against \n     humanity posed against President Slobodan Milosevic and any \n     other person arising from the conflict in the former \n     Yugoslavia, including in Kosovo, and press such states to \n     promptly provide all such information to the Tribunal;\n       (6) the United States should engage with other members of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other interested \n     states in a discussion of measures to be taken to apprehend \n     indicted war criminals and persons indicted for crimes \n     against humanity with the objective of concluding a plan of \n     action that will result in these indictees' prompt delivery \n     into the custody of the Tribunal;\n       (7) the United States should urge the Tribunal to promptly \n     review all information relating to President Slobodan \n     Milosevic's possible criminal culpability for conceiving, \n     directing, and sustaining a variety of actions in the former \n     Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, that have had the effect of \n     genocide, of other crimes against humanity, or of war crimes, \n     with a view toward prompt issuance of a public indictment of \n     Milosevic; and\n       (8) upon issuance of an indictment of President Slobodan \n     Milosevic for war crimes or crimes against humanity by the \n     Tribunal, the United States should adopt a policy of having \n     no dealings with President Milosevic at any level in any \n     context other than as a defendant before the Tribunal, and \n     should make every effort to support his immediate \n     apprehension.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President.\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution that \ncalls for President Slobodan Milosevic of the rump Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia to be indicted publicly by the International Criminal \nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (the War Crimes Tribunal), under its \njurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide \ncommitted on the territory of the former Yugoslavia on or after January \n1, 1991. This step is long overdue.\n  As early as December 1992, then-Secretary of State Lawrence \nEagleburger publicly identified Milosevic as one of several individuals \nwho could and should be held personally accountable for war crimes. I \nam confident that Secretary Eagleburger, in making this serious charge, \nwas fully informed of the underlying facts that would form the basis of \na prima facie case against Milosevic and which could be used to support \nhis indictment.\n  Still, there are some who have questioned whether a case against \nMilosevic can really be established. This issue was addressed in \ntestimony before the Helsinki Commission in 1995 by Cherrif M. \nBassiouni, who headed the U.N.'s Commission of Experts, the body first \ntasked with examining war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. Professor \nBassiouni's work set the stage for the establishment of the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\n  Professor Bassiouni's Commission had exhumed numerous mass grave \nsites, interviewed thousands of victims of rape and torture, and \nexamined overwhelming quantities of other evidentiary materials. Based \non this far-reaching study of the first two years of the Yugoslav \nconflict, Professor Bassiouni stated:\n\n       At first, many thought that this was a sort of haphazard \n     type of situation. We subsequently found that this was not \n     haphazard, particularly in Bosnia, as you know, but also \n     throughout most of the territory of the former Yugoslavia . . \n     . there is no doubt that, in a large territorial expanse, \n     over a significant period of time, the same patterns of \n     behavior occurred, and the same administrative organization \n     characterized the acts of ethnic cleansing--who did it, and \n     how it was done . . . Particularly interesting is the way \n     ethnic cleansing was done. It was done with plausible \n     deniability in mind.\n\n  When Professor Bassiouni was explicitly questioned about the \npossibility of indicting Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic--Karadzic was \nalso named by Eagleburger and has since been publicly indicted, not \nonce but twice--Professor Bassiouni said ``It is unlikely that a number \nof similar incidents occurring over long periods of time, which were so \nwell-publicized, could not have been known to the senior political \nleadership as well.'' Since then, the evidence against Milosevic has \nonly mounted, particularly as cases have proceeded before the Tribunal \nin The Hague.\n  In spite of the overwhelming evidence of war crimes in this conflict \nand the clear command responsibility of Milosvic for his agents, no \npublic indictment against him has yet been issued. In fact, it has been \nsuggested by some that Milosevic has been granted de facto immunity \nbased on a misguided belief that he is necessary for the implementation \nof the Dayton Accords. Nothing could be further than the truth.\n  Under Milosevic's leadership, the situation in Kosovo has \ndeteriorated dramatically, demonstrating the same fact pattern that we \nhave already seen in Bosnia: systematic attacks against civilians, \nreported that rape is once again being used as a form of warfare, and \nmass displacement of men, women and children. Milosevic is not part of \nthe solution, he is part of the problem. Significantly, the War Crimes \nTribunal has made it clear that, under its statute, it also has \nresponsibility for the war crimes in Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, we know that the War Crimes Tribunal has issued an \nunknown number of sealed indictments; in a few instances, the existence \nof these indictments have become public when the indictee has been \narrested. Certainly, there are cases where it may facilitate the arrest \nof an individual if his indictment remains sealed. In the case of \nMilosevic, however, I can see no such benefits. Indeed, the failure to \nindict him publicly may have emboldened him in Kosovo. The time has \ncome to indict Slobodan Milosevic for the atrocities that have been \ncommitted--and continue to be committed in Kosovo--under his leadership \nas head of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and to issue that \nindictment publicly.\n\n  Accordingly, the resolution I am submitting today calls on the United \nStates to collect and supply to the International Criminal Tribunal for \nthe Former Yugoslavia, on a priority basis, evidence to support an \nindictment and trial of Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes, crimes \nagainst humanity, and genocide; calls on the United States to provide a \nfair share of any\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\nadditional financial or personnel resources that may be required by the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, \nthe Netherlands, in order to enable the Tribunal to adequately address \npreparation for, indictment of, prosecution of, and adjudication of \nallegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity posed against \nYugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and any other person arising from \nthe conflict in the Former Yugoslavia, including in Kosovo; calls on \nthe United States to engage with our NATO allies and others in a \ndiscussion of measures to be taken to apprehend indicated war criminals \nand persons indicated for crimes against humanity with the objective of \nconcluding a plan of action that will result in these indictees' prompt \ndelivery into the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for \nthe Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, the Netherlands; calls on the \nUnited States to urge the International Criminal Tribunal for the \nFormer Yugoslavia in The Hague, the Netherlands, to promptly review all \ninformation relating to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's \npossible criminal culpability for conceiving, directing, and sustaining \na variety of actions in the Former Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, that \nhave had the effect of genocide, of other crimes against humanity, or \nof war crimes, with a view toward prompt issuance of a public \nindictment of Milosevic; and calls upon the United States to adopt a \npolicy of having no dealings with Milosevic at any level in any context \nother than as a defendant before the International Criminal Tribunal \nfor the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, the Netherlands and to make \nevery effort to support his immediate apprehension.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in this sense of the \nSenate resolution, to demonstrate once again that we are not blind to \nthe suffering that Milosevic continues to inflict on innocent people in \nthe Balkans, for no reason other than to secure his own political \npower. By supporting and seeking prompt enactment of this resolution, \nwe will show that Milosevic cannot act with impunity, that the world \nwill hold him accountable, and that the United States is prepared to \ntake a leadership role in obtaining justice for those killed, maimed, \nor injured as this man pursues his political ambitions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7019-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7021-S7022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 254--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE RECOGNIZING \n      100 YEARS OF GUAM'S LOYALTY AND SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:\n\n                              S.

administered and governed the island, initially as a coaling \n     station, then as a major supply depot at the end of World War \n     II;\n       Whereas a series of rulings popularly known as the \n     ``Insular Cases'', issued by the United States Supreme Court \n     from 1901 to 1922, defined Guam as an ``unincorporated \n     territory'' in which the United States Constitution was not \n     fully applicable;\n       Whereas the United States Naval Government of Guam was \n     forced to surrender the island of Guam to the invading forces \n     of the Japanese Imperial Army on December 10, 1941, after \n     which Japanese occupation and control of Guam lasted until \n     the United States Forces recaptured the island in 1944;\n       Whereas Guam is the only remaining United States territory \n     to have been occupied by Japanese forces during World War II, \n     the occupation lasting for 32 months from 1941 to 1944;\n       Whereas the people of Guam remained loyal to the United \n     States throughout the Japanese occupation, risked torture and \n     death to help clothe and feed American soldiers hiding from \n     enemy forces, and were subjected to forced labor, ruthless \n     executions, and other brutalities for their support of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas upon liberation of the people of Guam, the island \n     was returned to United States Navy governance, which, like \n     its prewar predecessor, limited the civil and political \n     rights of the people, despite numerous appeals and petitions \n     to higher authorities and Congress for the granting of United \n     States citizenship and relief from military rule;\n       Whereas in 1945, upon establishment of the United Nations, \n     the United States voluntarily listed Guam as a nonself-\n     governing territory, pursuant to Article 73 of the United \n     Nations Charter, and today Guam continues to be included in \n     this list;\n       Whereas on March 6, 1949, the House of Assembly, the lower \n     house of the popularly elected 9th Guam Congress, which was \n     merely an advisory body to the Naval Governor of Guam, \n     adjourned in protest over the limitation of its legislative \n     rights granted to it by the United States Department of the \n     Navy in 1947 and refused to reconvene until the United States \n     Congress enacted an organic act for Guam;\n       Whereas the Organic Act of Guam (64 Stat. 384) passed by \n     Congress and signed by President Truman on August 1, 1950, \n     statutorily decreed Guam's status as an ``unincorporated \n     territory'', established a three-branched civilian government \n     patterned after the Federal model, and conferred United \n     States citizenship upon the people of Guam;\n       Whereas since the granting of American citizenship, the \n     people of Guam have greater participation in the American \n     democratic processes and some measure of self-government;\n       Whereas the people of Guam, who strongly adhere to the \n     belief that a government should derive power and right from \n     the governed, successfully gathered enough support to push \n     for the passage of the Elective Governor Act (Public Law 90-\n     497) on September 11, 1968, and in which Congress granted the \n     people of Guam the right to elect their own governor and \n     lieutenant governor;\n       Whereas the Congress enacted the Guam-Virgin Islands \n     Delegate bill on April 10, 1972, allowing for Guam to have a \n     nonvoting delegate in the United States House of \n     Representatives, and although the delegate is not accorded a \n     vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, it is \n     still one of the benchmarks in Guam's political evolution and \n     heightens Guam's visibility in the national arena;\n       Whereas although Congress authorized in Public Law 94-584, \n     the formation of a locally drafted constitution, the \n     subsequent Guam Constitution, it was not ratified by Guam's \n     electorate through a referendum on August 4, 1979;\n       Whereas concerns regarding Guam's political status led the \n     Twelfth Guam Legislature to create the first political status \n     commission in 1973, known as the Status Commission, the \n     Thirteenth Guam Legislature in 1975 created another \n     commission, known as the Second Political Status Commission, \n     to address Guam's political status issue and explore \n     alternative status options, and in 1980, the existing Guam \n     Commission on Self-Determination (CSD) was created to \n     identify and pursue the status choice of the people of Guam, \n     and in 1996 the Twenty-Fourth Guam Legislature created the \n     Commission on Decolonization to continue pursuing Guam's \n     political status;\n       Whereas the CSD, after conducting studies on 5 Guam \n     political status options, proceeded to conduct a public \n     education campaign, which was followed by a status referendum \n     on January 12, 1982 in which 49 percent of the people of Guam \n     voted for Commonwealth, 26 percent for Statehood, 10 percent \n     for Status Quo, 5 percent for Incorporated Status, 4 percent \n     for Free Association, 4 percent Independence, and 2 percent \n     for other options;\n       Whereas on September 4, 1982, a runoff was held between \n     commonwealth and statehood, the top options from the January \n     referendum, with the outcome of the runoff resulting in 27 \n     percent voting for statehood and 73 percent of Guam's \n     electorate casting their votes in favor of a close \n     relationship with the United States through a Commonwealth of \n     Guam structure for local self-government;\n       Whereas in 1988 the people of Guam first presented the Guam \n     Commonwealth Act to Congress to meet the various aspirations \n     of the people of Guam, which bill has been reintroduced by \n     Guam's Congressional delegates since 1988 until the present;\n       Whereas Congress has continued to enact other measures to \n     address the various aspirations of the people of Guam, while \n     considering legislative approaches to advance self-government \n     without precluding Guam's further right of self-\n     determination, consistent with the national political climate \n     that emphasizes decentralization of the decision making \n     process from Washington to the local governments and a \n     relationship with the Federal Government that is based on \n     mutual respect and consent of the governed; and\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\n       Whereas the people of Guam are loyal citizens of the United \n     States and have repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to \n     the American ideals of democracy and civil rights, as well as \n     to American leadership in times of peace as well as war, \n     prosperity as well as want: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes 100 years of Guam's loyalty and service to \n     the United States; and\n       (2) will use the centennial anniversary of the 1898 \n     Spanish-American War to reaffirm its commitment to the United \n     States citizens of Guam for increased self-government, \n     consistent with self-determination for the people of Guam.\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution to \ncommemorate the centennial anniversary of U.S. relations with the \nterritory of Guam, which was acquired by the United States as a result \nof the Spanish-American War in 1898. The Philippines and Puerto Rico \nwere acquired at the same time under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, \nbut the Philippines has since become an independent nation and Puerto \nRico is a U.S. Commonwealth. The island of Guam remains an \nunincorporated U.S. territory and is geographically located in the \nwestern Pacific.\n  As we commemorate this historic moment in U.S.-Guam relations, I \nthink it is fitting that we recognize the contributions and sacrifices \nthat the people of Guam have made to our country, and the strategically \nsignificant role that Guam continues to play in the western Pacific. \nGuam is the only remaining U.S. territory that was occupied by Japan \nduring World War II from 1941 to 1944, and served as a significant \nstaging area for our military conflicts in World War II, the Korean \nWar, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. The people of Guam also \nserved our nation well in assisting our efforts to resettle thousands \nof refugees affected by these conflicts. The island continues to be \nused by the U.S. military as a strategic post in the Pacific. We need \nto commend the people of Guam for their loyalty and their sacrifice to \nour country.\n  Because of Guam's great distance from the continental United States \nand close proximity to Asia, it is often difficult for Americans to \nremember that Guam is even a part of the United States and her people \nare U.S. citizens. Moreover, given Guam's history, isolation and small \nsize, it is not easy for Americans and Congressional policymakers to \nunderstand the aspirations of the people of Guam and the issues \nconfronting her political leaders.\n  That is why I am pleased that President Clinton recently acknowledged \nthat the federal government has a duty to fully consider the unique \nsituation Guam faces on political status and land issues. I \nwholeheartedly agree with the President and urge that we engage the \nGovernment of Guam in a constructive discussion on Guam's quest for \ncommonwealth status and the return of federal excess lands. One point I \nwould like to make clear, however, is that I believe that federal \nexcess land issues can be addressed separately from commonwealth \nnegotiations. The resolution of Guam's political status should not \nhinder the federal government's efforts to redress longstanding land \nissues. In fact, last year the Senate passed S. 210, an omnibus \nterritories bill, which includes a provision which provides for the \ntransfer of certain federal excess lands in Guam. With one third of the \nland in Guam controlled by the Defense Department, I think that the \npeople of Guam have more than shouldered their burden as part of U.S. \nnational security in the Asia-Pacific region. The federal impact on \nland use planning is more evident if you consider that Guam is just 30 \nmiles long and nine miles wide. Let's recognize this year's centennial \nby enacting S. 210 and show that we do care about Guam's needs.\n  Mr. President, for the past 100 years, the people of Guam have served \nas loyal citizens to our country. They have worked hard to develop a \nprivate sector to supplement the jobs created by the presence of our \nU.S. military bases. They have done their best to promote economic \nself-sufficiency. They have been there for us all these years and I \nthink it is time that we recognize this and show our appreciation. I \nbelieve that the United States should take this opportunity to give \nback to the people of Guam by seriously engaging them in political \nstatus and land issues. It is the last we can do for all that Guam has \ndone for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7021-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7022-S7030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TORRICELLI (AND LAUTENBERG) AMENDMENT NO. 2973\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the bill (S. 2057) to \nauthorize appropriations for the fiscal year 1999 for military \nactivities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \nfor defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \npersonnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 350.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONTINUED \n                   PARTICIPATION OF UNITED STATES FORCES IN \n                   OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The contributions of the people of the United States \n     and other nations have, in large measure, resulted in the \n     suspension of fighting and alleviated the suffering of the \n     people of Bosnia and Herzegovina since December 1995.\n       (2) the people of the United States have expended \n     approximately $9,500,000,000 in tax dollars between 1992 and \n     mid-1998 just in support of the United States military \n     operations in Bosnia to achieve those results.\n       (3) Efforts to restore the economy and political structure \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina have achieved some success in \n     accordance with the Dayton Agreement.\n       (4) In February 1998, the President certified to Congress \n     that the continued presence of United States forces in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998, was necessary in order \n     to meet national security interests of the United States.\n       (5) There is, however, no accurate estimate of the time \n     needed to accomplish the civilian implementation tasks \n     outlined in the Dayton Agreement.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States ground combat forces should not remain in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina indefinitely in view of the world-wide \n     commitments of the Armed Forces of the United States;\n       (2) the President should work with NATO allies and the \n     other nations whose military forces are participating in the \n     NATO-led Stabilization Force to withdraw United States ground \n     combat forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina within a reasonable \n     period of time, consistent with the safety of those forces \n     and the accomplishment of the Stabilization Force's military \n     tasks;\n       (3) a NATO-led force without the participation of United \n     States ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina might \n     be suitable for a follow-on force for Bosnia and\n\n[[Page S7023]]\n\n     Herzegovina if the European Security and Defense Identity is \n     not sufficiently developed or is otherwise considered \n     inappropriate for such a mission;\n       (4) the United States may decide to provide appropriate \n     support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on \n     force for Bosnia and Herzegovina, including command and \n     control, intelligence, logistics, and, if necessary, a ready \n     reserve force in the region;\n       (5) the President should inform the European NATO allies of \n     this expression of the sense of Congress and should strongly \n     urge them to undertake preparations for establishing a \n     Western European Union-led or a NATO-led force as a follow-on \n     force to the NATO-led Stabilization Force if needed to \n     maintain peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and\n       (6) the President should consult closely with the \n     congressional leadership and the congressional defense \n     committees with respect to the progress being made toward \n     achieving a sustainable peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and \n     the progress being made toward a reduction and ultimate \n     withdrawal of United States ground combat forces from Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina.\n       (c) Dayton Agreement Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``Dayton Agreement'' means the General Framework Agreement \n     for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, together with annexes \n     relating thereto, done at Dayton, November 10 through 16, \n     1995.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               HUTCHINSON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2976\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Grams) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 2057, supra; \nas follows:\n\n       Add at the end the following new title:\n\n                       TITLE   --RADIO FREE ASIA\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Radio Free Asia Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     systematically controls the flow of information to the \n     Chinese people.\n       (2) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     demonstrated that maintaining its monopoly on political power \n     is a higher priority than economic development by announcing \n     in January 1996 that its official news agency Xinhua, will \n     supervise wire services selling economic information, \n     including Dow Jones-Telerate, Bloomberg, and Reuters \n     Business, and in announcing in February of 1996 the ``Interim \n     Internet Management Rules'', which have the effect of \n     censoring computer networks.\n       (3) Under the May 30, 1997, order of Premier Li Peng, all \n     organizations that engage in business activities related to \n     international computer networking must now apply for a \n     license, increasing still further government control over \n     access to the Internet.\n       (4) Both Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, as a \n     surrogate for a free press in the People's Republic of China, \n     provide an invaluable source of uncensored information to the \n     Chinese people, including objective and authoritative news of \n     in-country and regional events, as well as accurate news \n     about the United States and its policies.\n       (5) Radio Free Asia currently broadcasts only 7 hours a day \n     in the Mandarin dialect, 2 hours a day in Tibetan, and 2 \n     hours a day in Cantonese.\n       (6) Voice of America currently broadcasts only 10 hours a \n     day in Mandarin, 2 hours a day in Tibetan, and 1 hour a day \n     in Cantonese.\n       (7) Radio Free Asia and Voice of America should develop 24-\n     hour-a-day service in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tibetan, as \n     well as further broadcasting capability in the dialects \n     spoken in the People's Republic of China.\n       (8) Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, in working toward \n     continuously broadcasting to the People's Republic of China \n     in multiple languages, have the capability to immediately \n     establish 24-hour-a-day Mandarin broadcasting to that nation \n     by staggering the hours of Radio Free Asia and Voice of \n     America.\n       (9) Simultaneous broadcasting on Voice of America radio and \n     Worldnet television 7 days a week in Mandarin are also \n     important and needed capabilities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FURTHER ROUNDS OF BASE \n                   CLOSURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:--\n       (1) While the Department of Defense has proposed further \n     rounds of base closures, there is no need to authorize in \n     1998 a new base closure commission that would not begin its \n     work until three years from now, in 2001;\n       (2) While the Department of Defense has submitted a report \n     to the Congress in response to Section 2824 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, that report--\n       (A) based its estimates of the costs and savings of \n     previous base closure rounds on data that the General \n     Accounting Office has described as ``inconsistent'', \n     ``unreliable'' and ``incomplete'';\n       (B) failed to demonstrate that the Defense Department is \n     working effectively to improve its ability to track base \n     closure costs and savings resulting from the 1993 and 1995 \n     base closure rounds, which are ongoing;\n       (C) modeled the savings to be achieved as a result of \n     further base closure rounds on the 1993 and 1995 rounds, \n     which are as yet incomplete and on which the Department's \n     information is faulty; and\n       (D) projected that base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005 \n     would not produce substantial savings until 2008, a decade \n     after the federal government will have achieved unified \n     budget balance, and 5 years beyond the planning period for \n     the current congressional budget and Future Years Defense \n     Plan;\n       (3) Section 2824 required that the Congressional Budget \n     Office and the General Accounting Office review the Defense \n     Department's report, and--\n       (A) The General Accounting Office stated on May 1 that ``we \n     are now conducting our analysis to be able to report any \n     limitations that may exist in the required level of detail. . \n     . . [W]e are awaiting some supporting documentation from the \n     military services to help us finish documentation from the \n     military services to help us finish assessing the report's \n     information.'';\n       (B) The Congressional Budget Office stated on May 1 than \n     its review is ongoing, and that ``it is important that CBO \n     take the time necessary to provide a thoughtful and accurate \n     evaluation of DoD's report, rather than issue a preliminary \n     and potentially inaccurate assessment.'';\n       (4) The Congressional Budget Office recommended that ``The \n     Congress could consider authorizing an additional round of \n     base closures if the Department of Defense believes that \n     there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of \n     BRAC have been carried out. That consideration, however, \n     should follow an interval during which DoD and independent \n     analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have \n     been taken thus far.''\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the Sense of Congress \n     that:\n       (1) Congress should not authorize further rounds of base \n     closures and realignments until all actions authorized by the \n     Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 are \n     completed; and\n       (2) The Department of Defense should submit forthwith to \n     the Congress the report required by Section 2815 of Public \n     Law 103-337, analyzing the effects of base closures and \n     realignments on the ability of the Armed Forces to \n     remobilize, describing the military construction projects \n     needed to facilitate such remobilization, and discussing the \n     assets, such as air space, that would be difficult reacquire \n     in the event of such remobilization.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               HARKIN (AND WELLSTONE) AMENDMENT NO. 2982\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Wellstone) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill, S. 2057, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nrecent actions of two businessman and philanthropists, Mr. Ted \nForstmann and Mr. John Walton.\n  On Tuesday, June 9, 1998, the two men launched the Children's \nScholarship fund with an initial contribution of one hundred million \ndollars. This fund is going to provide scholarships to help families of \nmodest means send their children to private or parochial schools where \nthey will face strong academic challenges.\n  As this body, indeed this nation, continues to debate the future of \neducation, one fact is clear--a good education is the key to a \npromising future. The best way to help young people is to ensure that \nthey have a solid education that challenges their minds and helps them \nreach their full potential. Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton are helping \nmany children along the path by giving their hard-working parents a \nhelping hand.\n  Through grass roots initiatives such as the Children's Scholarship \nFund, we will we ensure that our country remains the world's leader.\n  I would like to wish the Children's Scholarship Fund the best of luck \nover the next several months as they look for people across America \nwilling to serve as partners in this effort. The fund has already \ncontacted more than 300 mayors and community leaders to seek their \npartnership with the fund and provide scholarships in their \ncommunities. Also, I would like to offer my assistance in contacting \ncities and other municipalities in my home state of Georgia.\n  Once again, Mr. Forstman and Mr. Walton should be commended for their \ncommitment to the education of our nation's youth, and I thank them for \ntheir generosity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7031-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7031-S7032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF DR. JANE HENNEY FOR THE COMMISSIONER OF FOOD AND DRUGS\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Dr. Jane Henney for the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.\n  In November, 1997, President Clinton signed legislation charging the \nFood and Drug Administration with the responsibility for bringing \nlifesaving drugs and medical devices to the American people more \nquickly and efficiently, without compromising safety or effectiveness. \nThis legislation requires the FDA to rethink many of its old models and \nto work collaboratively with the public and with drug and device \nmanufacturers to improve the certainty of the product review process, \nto provide patients with better access to investigational therapies, \nand to encourage manufacturers to test the safety and efficacy of their \nproducts for children. Such responsibilities require strong, innovative \nleadership--leadership that Dr. Henney can clearly provide.\n  Dr. Henney is a distinguished physician, a cancer specialist, and a \nnationally recognized academic leader and public health administrator \nwho has served in the Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton \nAdministrations. She served as Deputy Commissioner for Operations at \nthe FDA from 1992 to 1994 and is thoroughly familiar with FDA's \nresponsibilities, having managed the agency's daily activities and six \noperating centers.\n  Dr. Henney has also proven her ability to manage in a challenging \nenvironment. At the University of New Mexico, she led the Health \nSciences Center\n\n[[Page S7032]]\n\nto increase its efforts to stabilize local health care delivery systems \nand to engage in extensive reorganization initiatives. Earlier, as a \nDeputy Commissioner at the FDA, Dr. Henney reorganized and improved the \nefficiency of the FDA's centers, recruiting new directors for five of \nthe six centers. She also played a principal role in the enactment of \nthe Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, which revitalized the \nagency's drug and biologics review system.\n  The position of Commissioner of Food and Drugs has been vacant for \nmore than 14 months, leaving without leadership a federal agency that \narguably has a more direct and significant impact on the lives of the \nAmerican people that any other. The foods we serve our family, the \nmedicines we take when we're sick, and even the drugs we give our pets, \nare all approved and monitored by the FDA. One quarter of every dollar \nspent by consumers goes to products regulated by the FDA. Jane Henney's \ninnovative managing skills as well as her medical reputation make her \nthe ideal candidate to shoulder the responsibility for leading the Food \nand Drug Administration into the next century. I encourage the Senate \nto act expeditiously and support Dr. Henney's well-deserved \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7031-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO FOSTER'S DAILY DEMOCRAT ON ITS 125TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Foster's Daily Democrat on its 125th birthday.\n  On June 18, 1873, Foster's first paper proclaimed, ``We shall devote \nthese columns mainly to the vital interests of Dover and vicinity. \nWhatever may tend to benefit this people and enhance their prosperity, \nwill receive our warm and enthusiastic support.''\n  Our nation and indeed the world has changed many times since that day \n125 years ago when Foster's first made that commitment to its readers. \nUlysses Grant was president and the United States had just gone through \nthe most destructive and divisive war in its history. Since then, the \nUnited States has fought two world wars, an economic depression and the \nCold War.\n  Yet in over 125 years, one thing has always stayed the same: Foster's \ncommitment to truth, journalistic integrity and its readers. It is that \nunyielding commitment that has made Foster's Daily Democrat the \nnation's longest continuously managed and owned newspaper by direct \nfamily descendants of its founder in the United States. As the paper \nitself eloquently states, ``When your family's name is at the top of \nevery page, you try a lot harder.''\n  Foster's has also been a leader in applying technological \nadvancements to the field of newspaper publishing. In 1964, it became \nthe first newspaper in New Hampshire to use offset printing as a way to \nproduce brighter and sharper newspapers.\n  At a time in our nation's history when journalists and the media in \ngeneral are often accused of fostering cynicism, the people at Foster's \nhave been reporting news to the men and women of New Hampshire while \nnever sacrificing the principles of Joshua Lane Foster, the paper's \nfounder. Congratulations to current publisher Robert Foster and all the \nother hard working men and women at Foster's Daily Democrat on your \n125th birthday. It is an honor to represent you in the United States \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7032-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COLONEL JAMES HANLEY\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I have the sad duty of \nannouncing to this chamber that America has lost a hero, and a friend \nwho had a large impact on my life. On June 20, 1998, Col. James Hanley \ndied in Palo Alto, California after living a life marked by service to \nhis country and commitment to the ideals for which this nation stands.\n  I had the privilege of serving with Col. Hanley in battle during \nWWII. He was the Commanding Officer of the 2nd Battalion, 442nd \nRegimental Combat Team, of which I am proud to have been a member. \nThose trying days seem like yesterday and I can recall Col. Hanley \nbeing a source of strength for us. He was admired and respected by his \nmen.\n  The story of the 442nd is rich and dramatic, but mostly it paints a \npicture of bravery and courage. When America learned of the news that \nPearl Harbor had been bombed by the Empire of Japan on December 7, a \nwidespread distrust of anyone of Japanese ancestry began to grow. \nDespite a prejudice which had many of them and their families \nincarcerated in concentration camps, brave Japanese American soldiers \nvolunteered for military service following the attack. Those courageous \nvolunteers were kept together and eventually became the 442nd \nRegimental Combat Team and Col. Hanley became one of its leaders.\n  To give you a flavor for Col. Hanley's leadership, sensitivity, and \nwisdom, I would like to read for the record a letter he wrote to a \nnewspaper editor when that individual made ethnic slurs against the \nJapanese. Keep in mind that the letter is dated March 10, 1945, when \nthe war with Japan was at its bloodiest.\n\n       Dear Charlie: Just received the Pioneer of Jan. 20 and \n     noted the paragraph enclosed.\n       Yes, Charlie, I know where there are some GOOD Japanese \n     Americans--there are some 5,000 of them in this unit. They \n     are American soldiers--and I know where some of them are \n     buried. I wish I could show you some of them, Charlie. I \n     remember one Japanese American. He was walking ahead of me in \n     a forest in France. A German shell took the right side of his \n     face off. I recall another boy, an 88 had been trying to get \n     us for some time--finally got him. When they carried him out \n     on a stretcher, the bloody meat from the middle of his thighs \n     hung down over the end of the stretcher and dragged in the \n     dirt--the bone parts were gone.\n       I recall a sergeant--a Japanese American, if you will--who \n     had his back blown in two--what was he doing? Why, he was \n     lying on top of an officer who had been wounded, to protect \n     him from the shell fragments during a barrage.\n       I recall one of my boys who stopped a German counterattack \n     single handed. He fired all his BAR ammunition, picked up a \n     German rifle, emptied that--used a German Lugar pistol he had \n     taken from a prisoner.\n       I wish I could tell you the number of Japanese Americans \n     who have died in this unit alone.\n       I wish I could tell you the number of wounded we have had, \n     the sightless eyes, missing limbs, broken minds.\n       I wish I could tell you the decorations we have won.\n       I wish the boys in the ``Lost Battalion'' could tell you \n     what they think of Japanese Americans.\n       I wish all the troops we have fought beside could tell you \n     what they know.\n       The marvel is, Charlie, that these boys fight at all--they \n     are good soldiers in spite of the type of racial prejudice \n     shown by your paragraph.\n       I know it makes a good joke--but is the kind of joke that \n     prejudice thrives upon. It shows a lack of faith in the \n     American ideal. Our system is supposed to make good Americans \n     out of anyone--it certainly has done so in the case of these \n     boys.\n       You, the Hood River Legion Post, Hearst, and a few others \n     make one wonder just what we are fighting for. I hope it \n     isn't racial prejudice.\n       Come over here, Charlie, I'll show you where ``some good \n     Japanese Americans'' are buried.\n                                                      J.M. Hanley,\n                                          Hgq. 442nd Inf. APO 758.\n\n       Mr. President, in conclusion, I offer my deepest sympathy \n     for Col. Hanley's family and his dear wife, Joan. I want them \n     to know of my deepest admiration for him, as they reflect on \n     his significant life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7032-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7032-S7034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONG KONG ONE YEAR LATER\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr President, as the first chapter of the Analects \nof Confucius says, ``is it not a great joy when friends come from far \naway?\"\n  This week we have had the pleasure to welcome two good friends to \nWashington--President Kim Dae-jung of the Republic of Korea, and Chief \nSecretary Anson Chan of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n  And today, as President Clinton prepares to make the first visit of \nany sitting President to Hong Kong, I would like to offer some thoughts \non the events of the past year in Hong Kong.\n  Let me begin with some context. When we speak about Hong Kong, we are \nreally talking about three different Hong Kongs.\n  One Hong Kong is Hong Kong itself: a city of six million people on \nChina's southern coast. It is a place of hard work, good humor and open \ndebate; one of our major Asian trading partners; the site of $15 \nbillion in direct American investment and the base for much of our \nbusiness in China; a site for 60 Navy port calls a year; a place many \nof\n\n[[Page S7033]]\n\nus have visited and where our country has many friends.\n  A second Hong Kong is part of China. This Hong Kong, emerging from \n150 years as a Crown Colony to become the Hong Kong Special \nAdministrative Region, can play a unique part in China's future \nhistory. It combines a living western intellectual and legal heritage \nwith a Chinese identity, and as such offers Chinese reformers a model \nfor the rule of law and an open society, as well as for economic and \nfinancial management. And of course Hong Kong also plays a unique part \nin our own broader relationship with China.\n  And a third Hong Kong is the financial and management hub of a vast \nproductive region which extends from southern China to Southeast Asia. \nAnd so Hong Kong is also bound up with our economic and trade \nrelationship with most of Asia--and in particular the financial crisis \nwhich afflicts so many Asian nations this year.\n  In summary, history has placed a very heavy responsibility on Hong \nKong and its people--for the management of their own city; for China's \nfuture; and for Asia's prosperity.\n  How have they managed these responsibilities since the Union Jack \nwent down and the Bauhinia went up last July 1st?\n  Here I will quote the very succinct view of an American businessman \nbased in Hong Kong, who came to see me back in February:\n  ``Everything we thought might be a problem is not a problem. \nEverything we assumed would be fine has become a problem.''\n  He was referring, of course, to politics and economics. Last year at \nthis time, many were worried about Hong Kong's political future, asking \nwhether Chinese sovereignty would mean a controlled press and \nrepression of political debate. Few saw any threat to its economic \nfuture. And what have we seen since?\n  Hong Kong residents retain and exercise their rights. The Hong Kong \nAlliance holds regular commemoration of the Tiananmen Square massacre. \nHan Dongfang's China Labor Bulletin and the Human Rights Monitor \noperate just as before. All are freely and widely covered in the Hong \nKong press--as are American China policy debates, the recent interview \ngiven by the Chinese political reform advocate and former political \nprisoner Bao Tong, and much more.\n  Hong Kong's elections of May 24th went off more freely and its \nresults were more interesting than anyone might have expected. Turnout \nrose from 35% in 1995 to 55% this year. The Democratic Party, along \nwith the other parties which opted out of the Provisional Legislature, \nparticipated and did brilliantly. Equally interesting, the success of \nthe Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, traditionally \nidentified as a ``pro-Beijing'' party, may point toward the eventual \nestablishment of a two-party system in Hong Kong.\n  And China has, as far as I can tell, kept its promises to stay out of \nthe Hong Kong government.\n  These facts, I believe, disprove two theories. After this election, \nnobody can now pretend that Hong Kong people are indifferent to \npolitical rights and elections and care only about money. Likewise, \nafter the election, the view that China has malevolent intentions and \nwill inevitably crack down on Hong Kong seems naive at best. And \nalthough one year is a short time in which to judge, the facts also \ntend to show that the one-country, two-systems idea may work. And it is \na disappointment, but not a surprise, to see that none of last year's \ndoomsayers have stepped up to the plate and admitted they sold Hong \nKong--and China--short.\n  Unfortunately, what they should have been selling short was not Hong \nKong--nor its government, nor its citizens, nor the Chinese \ngovernment--but the Hang Seng Index. And those of us who were \noptimistic about Hong Kong's prospects last year should also admit that \nwe didn't get it quite right. The things we felt would not be a \nproblem--Hong Kong's economy--has become not only a problem but a \ncrisis.\n  I last visited Hong Kong in May of 1997, as the last stop on a trip \nthat also included Seoul, Pyongyang and Beijing. At that time, the \nKoreans were worrying about a slowdown in growth rates--maybe to 5.5% \nor 6%--and some scandals in the chaebols. And The Economist magazine \nran a cover story on financial problems in Bangkok. And in Hong Kong, I \nasked a few people what might show that the transition was going \nwrong--and a few said that one clue might be a speculative boom in the \nHong Kong markets. Not a single person I met--and that includes \nAmerican diplomats, tycoons, civil servants, Chinese dissidents, \nlegislators from the Democratic Party, the Citizens Party and the \nLiberal Party--predicted that the economy might go wrong.\n  What has happened since?\n  We need no longer worry about a speculative boom in the markets. The \nHang Seng is down from nearly 16,000 then to below 8,000 this week.\n  Hong Kong is in its first recession ever, with growth at negative 2% \nso far this year. Some predict that the contraction could be 5% or \nworse.\n  Unemployment is already at 4% and will rise in the months ahead.\n  This, ironically enough, has overshadowed the political divisions in \nthe new Legislative Council, to the point that the Democrats, the DAB, \nthe Liberals and other parties have come together to criticize the \ngovernment's budget and push for emergency economic relief.\n  Why has this happened? The answer is obvious. The problem is not the \nHong Kong economy per se--its properties may have been overvalued, but \nthe real problem is the crisis affecting every country around Hong \nKong. When a typhoon blows, everyone feels the wind and rain.\n  In summary, Hong Kong is a territory whose politics are in better \nshape, and whose economy is in worse shape, than anyone guessed last \nyear would be possible. And with that let me now turn from the lessons \nof the past year to the issues we must address, together with Hong \nKong, in the next.\n  Our interest is clear: a prosperous, healthy Hong Kong whose politics \nare free and open, which integrates peacefully with China, and which \ncontinues to play its part as the center of a prosperous Asian economy. \nAnd to secure this interest, we need three things: first, a solution to \nthe Asian financial crisis; second, a working relationship with China, \nespecially in the field of economics and trade; and third, a continued \ngood relationship with Hong Kong's government, political leaders and \npeople.\n  And let me begin with the first of these. When a typhoon blows, \npeople feel the wind and the rain. But they also tend to see, perhaps \nmore than they might in easier times, that they need to work together. \nWe see that in Hong Kong's Legislative Council today. And we see it on \na larger scale, as the crisis has brought together the countries \nhardest hit by the crisis, Hong Kong and China, Japan, and we \nourselves.\n  The affected countries--particularly Thailand and Korea--have acted \nwith a great deal of courage and good sense. And as bad as the times \nmay be, their approach is working. In the last few months their \ncurrencies have stabilized and capital flight ended. The task now is no \nlonger stopping a panic, but restoring financial health, enduring \nrecession and protecting the most vulnerable people. Indonesia, with an \neven more difficult economic situation and a weaker political \nsystem,thus far, has weathered an even more difficult situation with a \nweaker political without descending into violence.\n  China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have responded \nadmirably. Hong Kong's refusal to devalue the dollar last October did \nmore than any single other action, anywhere in the world, to prevent \nthe crisis in Southeast Asia and Korea from becoming a meltdown. And \nChina's refusal to devalue the yuan since then has allowed markets to \nrecover and begin acting more rationally. The proof is that the \nrevolution in Indonesia, as earthshaking an event as that is, has not \ncreated a new currency panic. And continued commitment by China and \nHong Kong will make sure that the worst-affected countries can get back \non their feet.\n\n  This will impose tremendous strain on China in the months to come, \nbecause China is in no way immune to the crisis itself. The Central \nBank Governor, Dai Xianglong, said yesterday that while China will \nstick to its commitment not to devalue:\n  ``The economic adjustment in Southeast Asia and the sluggish Japanese\n\n[[Page S7034]]\n\neconomy, particularly the depreciation of the yen, have all produced a \nvery negative impact on China's imports, exports and inflow of \ninvestment funds, and increased pressure on the restructuring of our \ncountry's economic system.''\n  This points to the need for rapid action in Japan to pass its fiscal \nstimulus package and perhaps to go further to prevent recession. In \nthis crisis, Japan should be importing and growing; if it slumps and \ndevalues its currency we can expect the situation to worsen.\n  And we in the United States must act sensibly and seriously. Our open \nmarket is as important to recovery as the currency commitments by China \nand Hong Kong. So far, we have not given in to fears or temptations to \nreduce imports as our exports to Asia have fallen, and that should \ncontinue. We must pass our IMF replenishment, as the Senate has done. \nAnd we should give a strong endorsement to China's MFN status. As Ms. \nChan said on arrival to the United States, revoking MFN status:\n  ``[W]ould not only deal a devastating blow to business confidence in \nHong Kong when we are grappling with the fallout from the regional \nturmoil, it would also undermine our ability to continue to play the \nrole of firewall in the Asian financial crisis. Eventually it would \ntake away a powerful line of defense in the economies of the region. \nNone of us, including the United States, can afford another wave of \nuncertainty.''\n  As this comment indicates, our annual debate over MFN status has \nbecome a pointless and essentially destructive affair. It does nothing \nto promote human rights, political reform or better security policies \nin China; instead it threatens jobs here and economic stability in Hong \nKong and China. And that brings me to the second point: our economic \nrelationship with China, and in particular to China's accession to the \nWTO.\n  As Governor Dai's comments indicate, China is by no means immune from \nthis crisis. Its growth rate has fallen; its export growth rates \ndropped by nearly half; and foreign investment in China is off. These \nare some of the early warning signs we saw in Southeast Asia two years \nago. And that should worry us--because today's China is not so \ndifferent from yesterday's Southeast Asia.\n  China has some advantages that its neighbors lacked. It has more \nfixed investment, less short-term debt, and larger foreign currency \nreserves than its neighbors. But it also has many of the problems they \nhad before the crisis. We see a level of bad debts about the same, or \neven higher, as Thailand had before a year ago. We see nepotism, \ncorruption and intimate ties between big business and the state; \npolitically directed loans to unnecessary industrial policy projects in \nfiber optics, semiconductors, autos, and other areas; property bubbles \nin the big cities; foreign investment dropping; and early signs of an \neconomic slowdown that could worsen if the Asian crisis deepens. And \nall this is combined with a brittle political system, intolerant of \nopposition and with only a weakly developed rule of law, that in the \nevent of crisis may not offer China the flexibility it needs to get \nthrough economic difficulties without a social upheaval.\n  Part of the answer must be political reform. China has a good \nexample, inside its own political borders, with Hong Kong's strong rule \nof law and open society in a Chinese society; and when the one-country, \ntwo-systems formula comes to an end in 2047, political development in \nChina may be its most important legacy. but in the short term, the \neconomic reforms WTO accession will bring are equally crucial for \nChina's economic health.\n  WTO accession, on the commercially meaningful basis we should expect, \nwill reduce subsides and break the links between ministries and their \nsemi-privatized profit-making offspring. Promote open competition at \nthe expense of rigged markets. And strengthen the rule of law. This \nwill produce a more rational economy which is more open to imports; has \nless interference by ministries in the market; which is run more by the \nrule of law than by informal connections; and offers more freedom for \nordinary Chinese to determine their own future. And in the long run it \nwill help ensure that China has a stable, sustainable economy.\n  So as President Clinton's state visit approaches--and in its \naftermath if necessry--we should push as hard as we can to reach a \ncommercial meaningful agreement. We must not accept less than we \nshould; that would be unfair to our own country and it would mean \nlittle to China. But we should work hard to get the job done right. And \nof course, when it happens we should live up to our responsibilities by \ngranting China permanent MFN status.\n  Finally, let me turn back to the first Hong Kong--the one that is \nsimply a city.\n  A year after the transition, Hong King faces and extraordinary array \nof challenges. It is at the eye of an economic storm worse that any \nAsia has faced since the Vietnam War. It is adapting to a political \nrole unique in China and probably unique in the world. And its own \ngovernment and constitution are very new.\n  These challenges might bring a lesser city to its knees. But Hong \nKong has handled them about as well as anyone could have. And beyond \nthat--as far as I can tell from ten thousand miles away--it has grown \nbecause of them.\n  Last May's election, to me, indicates that the ordinary Hong Kong \npeople understand how important a responsibility history has given them \nthis year. The qualities we have always associated with Hong Kong--hard \nwork, good humor, honest government--have been amplified by growing \ncivic responsibility, democratic participation and political maturity.\n  In summary, a year after the transition, Hong Kong has defended its \nrights; acted to good effect in an economic crisis; and can look ahead \nwith confidence. And as President Clinton prepares for the first visit \nany sitting American President has ever made to Hong Kong, he is going \nto a city whose future is bright.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7032-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7034-S7035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RETIREMENT OF GENERAL EUGENE E. HABIGER\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the country has recently lost to \nretirement its commander in chief of the United States Strategic \nCommand, General Eugene E. Habiger, USAF, and his wife, Barbara. \nGeneral Habiger has taken the United States and the U.S. Strategic \nCommand into a new world environment. With the end of the Cold War, two \nrivals were uncertain how to proceed. Under General Habiger's \nleadership, the former Soviet Union and United States strategic forces \nhave developed a trusting, confident understanding of the other's \ncapabilities and operations.\n  During his tenure, General Habiger's insightful leadership and \nvisionary initiatives revolutionized the readiness and flexibility of \nthe Nation's strategic deterrent force in support of the National \nCommand Authorities and regional combatant commanders. He made major \ncontributions to the national security of the United States by \nestablishing parameters for future strategic forces; by leading a \nstable drawdown of nuclear forces; by fostering mutual understanding \nand cooperation with Russia; and by shaping the process by which the \nUnited States maintains the long-term safety and reliability of its \nnuclear weapons stockpile. New tools and concepts developed under \nGeneral Habiger's leadership ensured strategic forces remained safe, \neffective, ready and responsive to changing world needs.\n  As stated in a letter from General Henry H. Shelton, Chairman, Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General Habiger ``helped Americans more fully \nappreciate the important strategic mission, improved the relationship \nwith Russia, and molded future leaders who will ably take the \nUSSTRATCOM mission into the 21st Century.'' From the early days as a \nstudent pilot at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, to commander of the \n325th Bombardment Squadron, General Habiger was an outstanding aviator \nand leader. A command pilot with more than 5,000 flying hours, he flew \ncombat missions in support of ARC LIGHT operations in Southeast Asia \nfrom October 1969 to April 1970. The general's varied and vast \ncontributions to the nation's strategic defense and his many critical \ncommand positions helped secure peace through strength and make the \nU.S. Air Force the world's best.\n  We also lose a tremendous supporter and friend in his wife, Barbara. \nBarbara's extraordinary voluntary contributions to the community of \nOmaha,\n\n[[Page S7035]]\n\nNebraska contributed to the well being of countless military and \ncivilian families in the area. As an active member of the Salvation \nArmy Advisory Board, her efforts touched thousands through dollars \nraised during the Tree of Lights and Bell Ringers programs. Her work \nwith the Nebraska Council for Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention and the \nWestern Heritage Museum helped ensure the effectiveness and success of \nthese vital organizations. The Henry Doorly Zoo benefitted from \nBarbara's volunteerism, as she led efforts to help raise nearly one \nmillion dollars for the care and feeding of the zoo's animals.\n  General and Mrs. Habiger leave the military after a distinguished 39 \nyear career serving their nation. The people of the United States \nsalute General and Mrs. Habiger and wish them well as they begin their \nlives after military service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7034-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHURCH OF ST. JOSEPH-ST. THOMAS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my \ncongratulations on the occasion of the 150th Anniversary of the oldest \nCatholic church in continuous existence on Staten Island, the Church of \nSt. Joseph-St. Thomas. Evolving out of a small Catholic community in \nRossville, the church has improved New York's quality of life for \ngenerations and is an integral part of the Staten Island community.\n  The impact this parish has had on its community is remarkable. Both \nin times of prosperity and in times of despair, the contributions of \nthe pastors and congregants of St. Joseph-St. Thomas have profoundly \naffected the residents of Staten Island. The parish has provided \neducation for children, held community gatherings and helped the \ndisadvantaged.\n  The leaders of St. Joseph-St. Thomas have been responsible for much \nof this tradition of community involvement. Though I will not name all \nof the former pastors here, I would like to mention two. Father Edward \nA. Dunphy's established child-care programs for immigrants during the \n19th century. These first Catholic child-care facilities helped \nmaintain the devotion to Catholicism within Staten Island's immigrant \ncommunity. During the Great Depression, Father Thomas S. Magrath cut \nchurch expenses to relieve parishioners' fiancial burdens. All the \nwhile, he developed projects and programs to feed and shelter the \nsuffering.\n  Today this spirit of helping those in need lives on with Monsignor \nPeter G. Finn and the church's involvement in such programs as Project \nHospitality and the St. Vincent De Paul Society.\n  With appreciation and admiration I extend my best wishes to the \nChurch of St. Joseph-St. Thomas. Its 150th Anniversary is cause for \nmuch celebration and anticipation of even greater accomplishments to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7035-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2877, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2877) to amend the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Act of 1970.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleague from \nWyoming to help me clarify the intent of H.R. 2877 as it relates to \nevaluating the performance of employees. Several States with OSHA-\napproved State plans have expressed concern that the language regarding \n``the results of enforcement activities'' could prevent them from \nconsidering the quality of an enforcement officer's reports or \nrecommendations; the percentage of cases which are upheld or overturned \nin legal proceedings; the timeliness of case completion; the \ncomprehensiveness of evaluations; and other legitimate means of \nevaluating employee performance.\n  Contrary to this very broad interpretation, it is important to point \nout that the authors of the bill read much more narrowly the language \nprohibiting OSHA from evaluating employees based on ``the results of \nenforcement activities, such as the number of citations issued or \npenalties assessed.'' When H.R. 2877 was originally introduced, it \nprohibited the Secretary of labor from establishing ``any performance \nmeasures for any subordinate'' within OSHA ``with respect to the number \nof inspections conducted, citations issued, or penalties assessed.'' \nAfter the administration expressed concerns that the language could \nadversely impact the ability of OSHA supervisors to assign inspection \nwork and ensure employee productivity and accountability, new language \nwas negotiated. The intent of that language, which is contained in the \nversion of H.R. 2877 that we are about to pass, was intended to prevent \nOSHA from establishing any quota or goal requiring OSHA inspectors to \nassess a specific number or amount of penalties. Clearly, Congress \nwould not want to prevent OSHA from ensuring that the penalties \nactually assessed by its inspectors are legally valid, based on true \nand accurate information, and issued in a timely, professional manner.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that the ``results'' referred to in \nthe legislation refer to whether an OSHA inspector is evaluated on a \nspecific quota or goal regarding the number of citations issued or \npenalties assessed, rather than the other means I have outlined?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, I agree with the analysis of my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to present my colleague with three examples \nto illustrate the intent of H.R. 2877. First, assume an OSHA inspector \nuses falsified inspection results to justify and recommend the issuance \nof citations and penalties against one or more employers. Does the \nlanguage in H.R. 2877 allow OSHA to negatively evaluate the inspector \nand proceed to dismiss him or her?\n  Mr. ENZI. Absolutely. OSHA must have the right to discipline such an \nemployee and evaluate him or her accordingly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What about an inspector who, in the course of a year, \nconducts one tenth of the inspections conducted by the average \ninspector? The inspector finds no violations in any of the inspections \nhe or she conducts, leading the inspector's supervisor to suspect that \nthe inspector may be failing to identify serious hazards in at least \nsome of those workplaces. Does H.R. 2877 allow OSHA to examine these \ncircumstances to ascertain whether the employee is adequately \nperforming his or her duties?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, it does. Such evaluations are fundamental to measuring \nemployee performance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If an inspector's citations and penalties are \nconsistently\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\nbeing overturned in legal proceedings, would H.R. 2877 inhibit OSHA's \nability to use that experience to evaluate how well that employee is \ndoing his or her job?\n  Mr. ENZI. No, it would not, Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, that the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2877) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the two bills just passed by the Senate were \nauthored by my good friend, Congressman Ballenger.\n  H.R. 2864, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \nCompliance Assistance Authorization Act, and H.R. 2877, a bill to \neliminate the imposition of quotas in the context of OSHA's enforcement \nactivities, are intended to help increase the joint cooperation of \nemployees, employers, and OSHA in the effort to ensure safe and \nhealthful working conditions. These bills are the first in a series of \nefforts to modernize the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, a \nlaw which has only been amended one time, in 1990, and that amendment \nwas simply an effort to raise the amount of the fines. So this is the \nfirst substantial change in 27 years.\n  Since its inception, OSHA has consistently relied upon an adversarial \napproach rather than placing a greater emphasis on a collaborative \nstrategy geared toward increasing worker safety and health. Agency \nofficials have admitted that 95 percent of the employers in the country \ndo their level best to try to voluntarily comply with the law. \nUnfortunately, OSHA inspectors still treat employers as adversaries, \nissuing them citations for what they haven't done and not assisting \nthem in complying with regulations to make the workplace safer.\n  Positive changes in the relationship that exists between employers \nand OSHA are long overdue. It is not productive to threaten employers \nwith fines for noncompliance when millions of safety-conscious \nemployers don't know how they are supposed to comply. Nor is it \neffective to burden employers with more compliance materials than they \ncan possibly digest or understand.\n  To achieve a new cooperative approach, the vast majority of employers \nwho are concerned about worker safety and health must have compliance \nassistance programs made more accessible to them. Creating true \npartnerships between businesses and OSHA will ultimately empower the \nhonest employers to improve worker safety while allowing OSHA to \nconcentrate its enforcement efforts on the small number of employers \nwho constitute the ``bad actors.'' I firmly believe that H.R. 2864 is a \ngood first step in accomplishing just that.\n  H.R. 2877 would eliminate enforcement quotas for OSHA compliance \ninspectors. This language would prohibit OSHA from establishing a \nspecific number of citations issued or the amount of penalties \ncollected. I believe that inspectors must not face institutional \npressure to issue citations or to collect fines but, rather, they \nshould work to identify potential hazards and assist the employer in \nabating them. OSHA's success must depend upon whether the Nation's \nworkforce is safer and healthier and not upon meeting or surpassing \ngoals for inspection citations or penalties.\n  Congress' approach to OSHA is different this session. During my \ntenure in the Senate, I have committed much of my time to the \nadvancement of workplace safety and health. This commitment is shared \nby my House colleagues, Representatives Ballenger and Talent, who are \nboth authors of other commonsense incremental legislation. It is our \nbelief that OSHA has operated since its inception as a reactionary \nregulator, inspecting work sites primarily after a fatality or injury \nhas occurred. In 1994 and early 1995 alone, three-quarters of the work \nsites in the United States that were the scene of serious accidents had \nnever--had never--been inspected by OSHA during the decade. Even more \ntroubling is that OSHA officials acknowledge that their inspectors do \nnot investigate most lethal work sites until after accidents occur. \nThus, a worker essentially has to get hurt or killed in order for OSHA \nto act.\n\n  We all want prevention. We don't want accidents. We don't even want \nnear misses. A near miss is an accident about to happen.\n  While it is important for OSHA to retain its ability to enforce law \nand to respond to employee complaints in a timely fashion, the agency \nmust begin to broaden its preventive initiatives in an effort to bring \nmore workplaces into compliance before accidents and fatalities occur. \nThese bills are the first of several rational, incremental steps in \nmaking OSHA a preventive regulator, not a reactionary regulator.\n  As the Senate author of S. 1237, the Safety Advancement for Employees \nAct, or SAFE Act, it is my hope that this important legislation will \nalso be considered in the same sensible light. This bill was derived \nfrom the thoughts, suggestions, and good ideas of employees, employee \nrepresentatives, employers, and certified safety and health \nprofessionals prior to even its original draft--comments that helped us \nkeep out a number of past contentious provisions.\n  I listened carefully to these concerns, and, as a result, the SAFE \nAct was crafted to promote and enhance workplace safety and health \nrather than dismantle it. What is left out of that bill may be as \nimportant as what is in the bill.\n  The contentious parts from the past are not there. The two provisions \nthat we passed tonight are there. The spirit of cooperation must \noverpower polarization if true improvements in occupational safety and \nhealth are to be achieved. It is essential that stereotypical rhetoric \nbe set aside, with the understanding that an overwhelming majority of \nemployers cherish their most valuable assets: their employees. Without \nthe employee, management would ultimately have no production, no \nprofits, and no business. It is logical to surmise that by promoting \ncooperation, good business will ultimately prevail. We cannot rest as \nlong as there are injuries or deaths on the job. We need everyone \ninvolved in safety.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to continue along this path. Much remains \nto be done in the area of workplace safety and health. There are \ncurrently 6.2 million American work sites being inspected by 2,451 \nFederal and State OSHA inspectors. Under these conditions, it will take \nOSHA 167 years to visit every workplace before an accident or fatality \noccurs. That is entirely unacceptable. We must continue to advocate \ncooperative compliance initiatives, incentives to the employers to look \nat the job before an accident happens, initiatives that are strictly in \nline with preventive regulation.\n  We must see that OSHA does not get an IRS image. We must see that \neveryone goes home whole. I will continue to advocate this type of an \napproach in the coming weeks when additional measures will be \nconsidered. I urge my colleagues to both note the change in attitude on \nthe House side and the Senate side on the work being done on OSHA, and \nI urge my Senate colleagues to help us work on these bills.\n  I thank Senator Frist, who is the subcommittee chairman, and Senator \nWellstone, who is the subcommittee ranking member. I thank the chairman \nof the Labor Committee, Senator Jeffords, and the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Kennedy. I, in fact, thank all of the Labor \nCommittee members on both sides of the aisle for the time and care and \ninterest that they have shown in the OSHA issue.\n  I give special mention, of course, to Congressman Talent, who has \ntaken the SAFE Act on the House side and worked diligently on it and \nheld hearings and just been a great promoter of the new attitude on \nimproving workplace safety. I also congratulate Chairman Ballenger on \nthe first change in the OSHA Act in 27 years.\n  I would be remiss if, last but not least, I did not thank my \nexcellent staff for the diligence, care, and persistence that they have \nput into all of the research and all of the meetings we have had with \nany group that was willing to meet with us across the entire country. \nThat is what has resulted in being able to take this first step and \nwhat will result in future steps.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7035-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Res. 176\n\n       Whereas young people will be the stewards of our \n     communities, Nation, and world in critical times, and the \n     present and future well-being of our society requires an \n     involved, caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas concerns about the character training of children \n     have taken on a new sense of urgency as violence by and \n     against youth threatens the physical and psychological well-\n     being of the Nation;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and that character \n     counts in personal relationships, in school, and in the \n     workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play a very important role in supporting \n     family efforts by fostering and promoting good character;\n       Whereas the Senate encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the valuable role \n     our youth play in the present and future of our Nation and to \n     recognize that character is an important part of that future;\n       Whereas, in July 1992, the Aspen Declaration was written by \n     an eminent group of educators, youth leaders, and ethics \n     scholars for the purpose of articulating a coherent framework \n     for character education appropriate to a diverse and \n     pluralistic society;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states, ``Effective character \n     education is based on core ethical values which form the \n     foundation of democratic society.'';\n       Whereas the core ethical values identified by the Aspen \n     Declaration constitute the 6 core elements of character;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character are \n     trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, \n     and citizenship;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character transcend \n     cultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states, ``The character and \n     conduct of our youth reflect the character and conduct of \n     society; therefore, every adult has the responsibility to \n     teach and model the core ethical values and every social \n     institution has the responsibility to promote the development \n     of good character.'';\n       Whereas the Senate encourages individuals and \n     organizations, especially those who have an interest in the \n     education and training of our youth, to adopt the 6 core \n     elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society as a whole; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages communities, especially \n     schools and youth organizations, to integrate the 6 core \n     elements of character into programs serving students and \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week of October 18 through October 24, \n     1998, as ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to embrace the 6 core elements of character and to \n     observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7037-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL BONE MARROW REGISTRY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3035) was considered, read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate today \nhas passed the National Drought Policy Act of 1998. I introduced the \nNational Drought Policy Act of 1997 a year and a half ago in response \nto the devastating drought suffered in New Mexico and the rest of the \nSouthwest in 1996. The Senate passed that legislation, and \nRepresentative Skeen introduced H.R. 3035. The time is indeed ripe to \nsend this legislation now to the President, as once again the Southwest \nmay face devastating drought conditions.\n  The drought of 1996 was a natural disaster that cost $5 Billion in \nthe Western United States. Already this year,\n\n[[Page S7038]]\n\ndrought conditions in Texas are parching farming and grazing lands that \nwill cost an estimated $1.7 Billion in crop and livestock losses. \nDrought conditions are also being reported in areas throughout the \nSouth. And the summer of 1998 has not yet officially begun.\n  Every region in the United States can be hit by these catastrophes. \nYet, while drought is so pervasive and affects the economic and \nenvironmental well-being of the entire nation, the United States is \npoorly prepared to deal with serious drought emergencies. As a result \nof the hardships being suffered in every part of my state last year, I \nconvened a special Multi-State Drought Task Force of federal, state, \nlocal, and tribal emergency management agencies to coordinate efforts \nto respond to the drought. The Task Force was ably headed up by the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, and included every federal agency \nthat has programs designed to deal with drought.\n  Unfortunately, what the Task Force found was this: although the \nfederal government has numerous drought related programs on the books, \nwe have no integrated, coordinated system of implementing those \nprograms. Drought victims in this nation do not know who to turn to for \nhelp, and when they finally do find help, it is too late and totally \ninadequate. The gradual nature of drought devastation underscores the \nneed for drought management rather than drought response.\n  This legislation will be the first step toward finally establishing a \ncoherent, effective national drought policy. The House-passed bill only \nslightly modifies my original language which passed the Senate in \nNovember. The National Drought Policy Act of 1998 creates a commission \ncomprised of representatives of those federal, state, local, and tribal \nagencies and organizations that are most involved with drought issues. \nS. 222 charges the commission with providing recommendations on a \npermanent and systematic Federal process to address this particular \ntype of devastating natural disaster.\n  Unfortunately, drought conditions are a way of life in my region of \nthe country. But better planning on our part, and with the \nrecommendations of the Drought Commission established by this \nlegislation, may limit some of the damage. I look forward to the \nPresident's prompt signing of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/24/senate-section/article/S7037-5", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 25, 1998\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

There will then be 10 minutes for \nclosing remarks with respect to the Harkin amendment relative to VA \nhealth care, followed by a vote in relation to that amendment.\n  Therefore, three votes will occur beginning at 10 a.m.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the previously \nmentioned debate times be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
