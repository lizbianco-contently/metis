Mr. President, this morning there will be 15 minutes \nremaining for debate on the religious freedom bill. At 9:45, under a \nprevious order, the Senate will proceed to vote on the passage of the \nreligious freedom bill. I commend Senator Arlen Specter and Senator \nNickles and Senators on both sides of the aisle who have worked on \nthis. I am sure Senator Lieberman was involved, and others. I think \nthis is a really fine accomplishment in the waning hours of this \nsession of Congress.\n  Following that vote, the Senate may consider any available \nappropriations conference reports--we have at least one that I believe \ncould be taken up, that is the Treasury-Postal Service bill--and any \nother legislative or executive items cleared for action. It is \nanticipated that we will move at some point today to the nomination of \nMr. Paez from California, to be a judge for the Ninth Circuit. There is \nopposition, significant opposition to that nomination, so there will \nhave to be some debate and I am sure a vote.\n  The Senate will also consider a continuing resolution or an omnibus \nappropriations bill, should they become available or when they become \navailable. Members should expect, then, rollcall votes throughout \ntoday's session and into the evening. I thank my colleagues for their \nattention.\n  I might just note, last night a lot of good work was done in the \nwrapup, including approval of the intelligence authorization conference \nreport and the water resources bill. This is a very significant bill \nthat is important to every State in the Nation. It had been tied up \nwith various and sundry problems, but with a lot of hard work and a lot \nof cooperation, that bill was cleared. We hope, now, the House will \ntake expeditious action and we can complete action on the water \nresources bill before we go out for the year. Also, we did the human \nresources reauthorization and the vocational education bill. When you \ncouple higher education and vocational education, plus the Coverdell A+ \nbill that Congress passed, there has been a significant achievement \nthis year in education. Even though the President vetoed the ability \nfor people to save for their children's education, higher education and \nvocational education are two areas where we have completed our action \nand will be signed into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12091-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             A PRODUCTIVE BIRTHDAY FOR THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I think the regular order is we are back \non the International Religious Freedom Act?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). If the Senator will suspend, the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12092]]\n\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2431) to establish an Office of Religious \n     Persecution Monitoring, to provide for the imposition of \n     sanctions against countries engaged in a pattern of religious \n     persecution, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes equally divided. The \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I spoke at length on this bill last \nnight. I mentioned that we have had a lot of cooperation and effort on \nbehalf of a lot of Senators to help make this bill a reality and \nhopefully to soon become law. Principal among those is Senator \nLieberman from Connecticut, who is not just a principal cosponsor, but \na tireless worker on behalf of individuals throughout the world who \nhave been suffering from religious persecution or who desire religious \nfreedom. Senator Lieberman has been working on their behalf. I am \nprivileged to work with him on this bill and I yield him such time as \nhe desires on this bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nOklahoma for his kind words and for his extraordinary leadership on \nthis measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we are heading rapidly to the end of \nthis second half of the 105th Congress. There will be time for reviews \nand evaluations. Some will say what did we accomplish in this second \npart of this 105th Congress? I hope when we are asked that, one of the \nanswers we will be able to give is that we adopted the International \nReligious Freedom Act, a historic piece of legislation, genuinely \nbipartisan, representing and expressing the core beliefs and values of \nthe American people and putting those beliefs and values at the center \nof our foreign policy.\n  It is, in fact, a measure that has the potential to affect the \nfreedom, the lives, the fates of tens of millions of people around the \nworld today who are denied the basic right of freedom of religion that \nbrought so many of our ancestors to the United States.\n  This kind of measure does not reach the edge of passage without a lot \nof strong support. I thank particularly the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nNickles, and his outstanding staff--especially Steve Moffitt of that \nstaff--for the hundreds of hours that they spent working on this \nlegislation and the spirit of common purpose that guided them as we \nwent on.\n  I thank also my friend and colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, \nand his staff, particularly Brian McKeon, who contributed immeasurably \nto, not only the purpose, but to the way in which this legislation is \ncrafted; to Senator Feinstein and her staff, particularly Dan Shapiro, \nfor their very constructive contributions; and Senator Coats as well, \nabout whom I have a little more to say in a few moments. And I want to \nrecognize Cecile Shea who is on my staff for the literally hundreds of \nhours she worked to help craft this bill.\n  This effort began with some Pied Pipers outside the Congress who \neducated us to the fact that these religious freedoms that we hold so \ndear in the United States are not real for many people, millions of \npeople around the world. Surprisingly to many of us, they are \nparticularly not real for people of the Christian faith around the \nworld, who are subjected to discrimination, and in many cases \npersecution.\n  One of the people who started this effort was Michael Horowitz of the \nHudson Institute, and he deserves to be mentioned here and thanked for \neducating and opening our eyes to the persecution that exists. Senator \nSpecter and Congressman Wolf introduced the initial bill. They were the \npioneers here and blended together with the effort that Senator Nickles \nand I initiated here in the Senate. I thank them for their support.\n  As we come to the conclusion, I want to thank the administration \nrepresentatives, led by Under Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, who worked \nwith us to craft the language that could finally be approved by \nNational Security Advisor Sandy Berger and the President. The \nadministration endorsement guarantees that when passed this legislation \nwill become law.\n  The list of groups that endorsed the act is extraordinary, a true \nexpression of all of God's children:\n  The Episcopal Church, the Catholic Conference, the United Methodist \nChurch Women's Division, the Evangelical Lutherans, the American Jewish \nCommittee, the Christian Coalition, the National Association of \nEvangelicals--the list goes on and on and on--the B'nai B'rith, the \nAnti-Defamation League, the Catholic conference of Major Superiors of \nMen's Institutes, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, the National \nConference of Soviet Jewry, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, \nthe Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, the American \nCoptic Association, Advocates International, the Religious Liberty \nCommission of the Southern Baptist Convention, Union of American Hebrew \nCongregations, the International Fellowship of Jews and Christians, the \nTraditional Values Coalition, the Justice Fellowship and the Church of \nthe Disciples.\n  What brought all of these groups together? What brought them together \nis, in many ways, what brought the founders of our country to these \nshores and what led them to declare their independence ultimately from \nEngland. And that was faith, shared faith in God and a belief that no \ngovernment has the right to tell people how to worship and certainly \ndoes not have the right to discriminate against them or persecute them \nfor the way in which they choose to express their faith in God.\n  The founders of this country declared in the Declaration of \nIndependence that: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all \nmen are created equal'' and that they have certain endowments, not from \nthe founders of the country, not from a group of politicians. The \nendowments come from their Creator, and the endowment is the right to \nlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Then in the very first \namendment to the Bill of Rights, they established the freedom of \nreligion that has been so dear to our country, so central to our \ncountry and such a magnet for our fathers and grandfathers and great \ngrandfathers who came here driven by a desire to have that freedom.\n  On this day, I think of my grandmother who came here from Central \nEurope. My grandmother was probably one of the greatest American \npatriots I ever knew, for a simple reason: She said to me in her old \nage how much she loved the country. She said, ``It may not seem that \nprofound to you, it may not seem that complicated, but the fact I can \nwalk to synagogue on Saturday morning and not only is no one harassing \nme or bothering me, not only do I live free of fear, not only do I have \nno hesitation about what I will find in the synagogue, nobody bothering \nthe building or any of us worshipping there, but my neighbors who are \nnot Jewish, as they see me, say ``Good morning, Mrs. Manger, good \nSabbath to you.' ''\n  This to her expressed the essence of what it meant to be American and \nfree and the gratitude that she felt. In some measure, I suppose many \nof us are supporting this legislation and trying to express that \ngratitude by extending as best we can that freedom and respect to \npeople around the world.\n  Some say, ``OK, it is good for the United States. What gives you the \nright to tell other countries how they should treat their citizens?'' \nWhat we are saying here is that we have the right to express our \nvalues; we have the right to put our values at the center of our \nforeign policy. Countries can do what they will, but we have no \nobligation to deal with countries on a normal basis, to give them aid \nand comfort if they are violating a central animating principle of \nAmerican life, which is freedom of religion.\n  Who else, if not a nation whose forebears and citizens, beginning \nwith the Puritans and continuing to this day, suffered under \npersecutors in foreign lands before coming to this country? Who else \nwill speak for those around the world who are denied those basic \nliberties?\n  Mr. President, this legislation, finely crafted, worked on for more \nthan a year, expresses, in sensible terms, those values to which I have \nspoken. It clearly states America's unwavering commitment to religious \nfreedom around the world. It requires that every succeeding American \nadministration report once a year on the state of religious freedom in \nevery country in the world--put it on the record--and\n\n[[Page S12093]]\n\nalso report on the steps the administration has taken to encourage--and \nthat is the way this proposal will best work--and raise the status of \nreligious freedom in every country around the world to a level of \nvisibility and report on it. We have given the administrations--this \nand all future administrations--a menu of choices to respond to, some \nmodest and, in most extreme cases of persecution, some severe.\n  In nations where violations are particularly egregious, where \ntorture, execution and inhumane punishment routinely are used to limit \nthe free expression of religion, today the President may choose from a \nlist of economic incentives to pressure the offending government to \nreform. The menu of sanctions in this bill is narrowly focused. It is \ndesigned to mitigate the offending behavior without causing economic \nhardship to our own country. The President has a waiver authority on \nthe sanctions and is also required to seek, first, multilateral \ncooperation in this sanctions bill.\n  But this is much more than a sanctions bill. It is a reminder to the \nexecutive branch of the American Government, both now and in the \nfuture, that as it encourages human rights around the world, it must \nconsider freedom of religion.\n  This bill requires training in religious freedom issues for foreign \nservice and immigration officials. It establishes an independent \ncommission to monitor religious persecution around the world and to \nmake recommendations to the administration on how to encourage greater \nreligious freedom.\n  Mr. President, right now somewhere in the world a man or woman \nlanguishes in prison, some on death row, because he or she did nothing \nmore than choose faith in God over personal expediency. They probably \nwonder if anyone cares about what has happened to them. In too many \nplaces in this world today, a group, a village, perhaps a province, \nwill suffer economic hardship, lack of access to medical care, \nsystematic harassment and intimidation because its citizens refuse to \nturn their backs on the most fundamental definition of who they are. \nThey wonder, I suppose, whether anyone cares or has noticed. And this \nbill, the International Religious Freedom Act, says to them that we \nnotice, we care and the Government of the strongest nation in the world \nwill speak up for them to protect their right to worship their God in \nthe way in which they choose.\n  Mr. President, just a final word about our retiring colleague from \nIndiana, Senator Dan Coats. As fine a person of faith as I have ever \nknown in my life, as trustworthy a man as I have ever had the privilege \nto work with, worked very hard on this piece of legislation because the \nprinciples embodied in this legislation spring from the inner core of \nthis man of surpassing and illuminating Christian faith.\n  In some measure, I think this is one of the great testaments, one of \nthe great monuments that he will leave as he leaves the Senate. With \nthis act, we send a message that our Nation, founded under God, with \nfreedom of conscience on religion as its cornerstone is prepared to do \nwhat it can to extend those values reasonably, sensibly to people \nthroughout the world.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to support H.R. 2431--the \nInternational Religious Persecution Act of 1998--as amended by the \nsubstitute offered by Senator Nickles and others. I believe that the \nchanges that this amendment makes to the underlying bill vastly improve \nthe effectiveness of this legislation in promoting religious freedom \naround the world and in better responding to actions that would deny \npeople such freedom, regardless of where they reside.\n  Mr. President, we in the United States are very fortunate. Our \nFounding Fathers recognized the importance of religious freedom as a \nbedrock issue. That they did so is not surprising. It was borne out of \ntheir personal experiences having been forced to flee their countries \nbecause of religious intolerance and outright persecution. For that \nreason, religious freedom was given a prominent place by the drafters \nof the Constitution--in the Bill of Rights as the first amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  We as Americans are not the only ones who cherish and hold dear our \nreligious freedom. This important and unalienable right is also a part \nof the universal collection of rights that people around the globe hold \nsacred. It is recognized in both the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights and the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights.\n  Despite the seeming universality of the right to religious freedom, \npeople throughout the planet are every day being denied the right to \npractice their religion--Christian and Jew, Moslem and Buddhist, Hindu \nand Baha'i. At its most extreme, unthinkable acts have been perpetrated \nagainst an entire people in the process of denying them the right to \npractice their faith, I am speaking of the annihilation of more than 6 \nmillion Jews by Adolf Hitler while the world looked on.\n  Even today, religious intolerance remains rooted in too many \nsocieties throughout the planet--in Iran, in Sudan, in Burma, in the \nPeople's Republic of China, in Russia--and this is by no means an \nexhaustive list.\n  H.R. 2431, as amended, seeks to establish a policy and procedures for \nthe United States government to follow in defending religious freedom \ninternationally. It provides for the imposition of targeted sanctions \nagainst governments which practice religious persecution. However, it \nalso gives the President and the Secretary of State some measure of \nflexibility in carrying out the policy.\n  I am also pleased to note that it excludes the denial of food and \nmedicine as a sanctions option under this legislation. I have never \nbelieved that to deny innocent men, women and children access to the \nvery basic necessities of life places the United States as a government \non a particularly high moral ground at the very time we are trying to \nelicit a higher standard of moral behavior by other governments. The \nbill also includes waiver authority that will enable the President to \nreact with flexibility to changing events in furtherance of U.S. \nnational interests. Finally, the bill includes a sunset provision that \nwould lift any sanctions imposed pursuant to this act after two years, \nunless specifically reauthorized by the Congress.\n  I believe that President Clinton is committed to promoting \ninternational religious freedom. In no way should the passage of this \nlegislation be interpreted as a criticism of the administration's \nefforts to champion the cause of international religious freedom. \nRather, my support for this legislation should be viewed as an effort \nto complement the Administration's efforts. Passage of the pending \nlegislation will signal to the world that the Congress stands fully \nbehind all efforts to promote religious freedom along with other \nfundamental human rights as a core component in the United States \nforeign policy agenda.\n  I commend Senator Nickles and my colleague from Connecticut Senator \nLieberman for all their work on this legislation. Thanks to their \nefforts to perfect and refine its provisions, this legislation will be \nfar more effective in furthering U.S. efforts to promote respect for \nreligious freedom throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with them and many others in this \nChamber in voting for final passage of this bill at the appropriate \ntime.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the International Religious Freedom Act \nof 1998 represents a vitally important piece of legislation to raise \nawareness of and combat religious persecution overseas. Some would \ndownplay the problem of religious persecution abroad, but preserving \nreligious freedom at home and promoting it in other countries is \ncentral to the purpose and objectives of the United States.\n  In our own history as a nation and in the histories of countries \naround the world, religious freedom has been at the center of movements \nfor broader civil liberty. Efforts to restrict religious freedom strike \nat the heart of liberty itself. Thus, the United States has a duty to \nstand for religious liberty abroad as we continue to preserve it at \nhome.\n  If the Administration had been more aggressive in confronting \nreligious persecution, such legislation might not be necessary. In \nfact, at a White House meeting to discuss one of the major bills on \nreligious persecution, President Clinton told religious leaders that \nlegislation which actually required him to confront persecution abroad \nwould put ``enormous pressure on whoever is in the executive branch to \nfudge\n\n[[Page S12094]]\n\nan evaluation of the facts of what is going on.''\n  That is a troubling statement by the President of the United States, \nwhich not only calls us to question this Administration's commitment to \nfight religious persecution, but the reliability of other presidential \ncertifications on issues such as Chinese missile and nuclear \nproliferation. Such statements by Administration officials make it \nclear why legislation to address religious persecution is needed.\n  Religious persecution is a tragic fact of life in many countries, \nfrom Latin America to Asia to Africa. Religious persecution in Sudan \nand China has been of particular concern to me. As Chairman of the \nAfrica Subcommittee, I held a hearing on religious persecution in Sudan \nin September of last year.\n  Religious persecution has become enmeshed in a brutal Sudanese civil \nwar that has taken more than 1.5 million civilians since 1983, with \nover 4 million more being displaced by the fighting. An estimated \n430,000 refugees have fled Sudan to seek safety in neighboring \ncountries.\n  Human rights organizations working in Sudan have testified before \nCongress that the government uses ``aerial bombardment and burning of \nvillages, arbitrary arrests, torture, chattel slavery--especially child \nslavery--hostage taking, summary execution, inciting deadly tribal \nconflict, the abduction and brainwashing of children, the arrest of \nChristian pastors and lay church workers, and the imprisonment of \nmoderate Muslim religious leaders'' to suppress dissent and form a \nradical Islamic state. Such barbarous atrocities, along with Sudan's \nsupport for international terrorism, has led me to introduce \nlegislation to cut off financial transactions with the Sudanese \ngovernment.\n  The viciousness of religious persecution in Sudan should not callous \nus to the very real and brutal oppression taking place in other \ncountries. As Nina Shea notes in The Lion's Den, China has more \nChristians in prison because of religious activities than any other \nnation. The State Department's first comprehensive review of \npersecution against Christians, issued in July 1997 and entitled ``U.S. \nPolicy in Support of Religious Freedom,'' says, ``The Government of \nChina has sought to restrict all actual religious practice to \ngovernment-subsidized religious organizations and registered places of \nworship.''\n  China's efforts to restrict religious freedom are driven by \noppressive policies which seek to make all religion subservient to the \nstate's secular objectives. In the book China: State Control of \nReligion, Human Rights Watch states that ``the Chinese government \nbelieves that religion breeds disloyalty, separatism, and subversion.'' \nThe book goes on to note: ``Chinese authorities are keenly aware of the \nrole that the church played in Eastern Europe during the disintegration \nof the Soviet empire.''\n  Rather than embrace and encourage the free expression of faith, the \nChinese government is engaged in a massive, ongoing, and brutal effort \nto repress non-sanctioned religious activity. Ministers or lay people \nwho seek to practice their faith free from bureaucratic interference \nand oppression are subjected to imprisonment, torture, and worse. The \nFar Eastern Economic Review noted that 15,000 religious sites were \ndestroyed by government police in the first five months of 1996 alone. \nPaul Marshall and Nina Shea note that ``China's underground Christians \nare the target of what they themselves describe as the most brutal \nrepression since the early 1980s when China was just emerging from the \nterror of the Cultural Revolution.''\n  And yet, in spite of such repression by the Chinese Communist \ngovernment, this Administration declined even to sponsor a resolution \nat the U.N. Commission on Human Rights condemning China's human rights \nrecord. Apparently, some type of back door deal was made with the \nChinese government in which a few prisoners would be released and we \nwould turn our head and close our ears to the thousands that remain in \nChinese prisons and labor camps.\n  I am aware of mounting concern in the U.S. business community on the \ndamage done to U.S. competitiveness due to unilateral sanctions. I want \nU.S. companies to compete and succeed in the international marketplace. \nThe Nickles legislation, however, is a carefully crafted bill which \noffers the President an array of options to promote religious liberty \nabroad and will target any resulting sanctions on those countries most \ndeserving of reproach for religious persecution. This legislation is a \nnecessary first step to address the problem of religious persecution.\n  Mr. President, I submit that it is time for the Senate of the United \nStates to take a stand on this issue of religious persecution, and \npassage of the Nickles legislation offers just such an opportunity. It \nis also time for the Executive Branch to take a stand on this issue. \nRather than look at how we might ``fudge'' legislative requirements to \navoid confronting oppression abroad, let us have the courage of our \nconvictions. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to express my enthusiastic \nsupport for the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which was \npassed by the Senate earlier today. This legislation condemns religious \npersecution and promotes what is indisputably a fundamental human \nright--the right to freedom or religion.\n  I am proud to have co-sponsored this legislation, which I might add \nwas passed by the Senate without opposition. That is due in no small \npart to the efforts of Senators Nickles and Lieberman. I want to \ncommend them and their staffs for all the hard work they've done to \ncraft a bill that is meaningful and effective without being excessively \nrigid or inflexible.\n  Mr. President, it has amazed me to see how Americans' awareness of \nreligious persecution abroad has grown just in this decade. It is, no \ndoubt, a result of the incredible resources and vast amounts of \ninformation that ordinary Americans now have at their fingertips. As \nmore and more people gain access to the Internet, the velocity of \ninformation continues to increase. Americans have learned about \nreligious persecution by foreign governments around the globe and they \nexpect our government to take serious action to curb this behavior.\n  Their can be no doubt that we have a responsibility to advocate and \nencourage freedom of religion in foreign lands. We, as a nation, have \nalways held it to be the most sacrosanct of human rights. Indeed, it is \nnot just enshrined in our Bill of Rights, it is a thread that is woven \ninto the very fabric of our national identity.\n  The International Religious Freedom Act channels U.S. assistance to \ngovernments that are not gross violators of human rights, in particular \nthe right to religious freedom. It provides for sanctions or other \ncomparable action against countries that persecute citizens on \nreligious grounds. The bill establishes a Commission on International \nReligious Persecution to publish yearly recommendations to the White \nHouse and the Congress on how to promote religious freedom abroad. It \nalso establishes an Ambassador-at-Large of Religious Freedom within the \nState Department and a Special Advisor on International Religious \nFreedom within the National Security Council. As a result, it requires \nthe Administration to produce a yearly ``Annual Report on Religious \nFreedom Around the World.''\n  Mr. President, these are reasonable provisions that I believe will \nhelp focus our efforts to stand up for religious freedom abroad while \nat the same time allowing the executive branch a degree of needed \nflexibility to deal with different facts and circumstances in different \ninstances of persecution. It is an important bill, and I am hopeful \nthat the Congress can send it to the President for signature before \nadjournment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is fitting that, as we conclude the \n105th Congress, we can add to our long list of accomplishments the \npassage of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.\n  This bill has been in the works throughout this Congress and is a \nfine example of the legislative results we can achieve through long, \nthoughtful study and debate. I would like to compliment the numerous \nmembers and their staffs who have worked on this bill since its \ninception. Senator Specter introduced the first version of this bill \nlast year. Senator Lugar and Senator Lieberman worked diligently to \ndevelop that initial draft. And Senator Nickles took the final drafts \nand brought the bill to the version we will vote on today.\n\n[[Page S12095]]\n\n  Numerous compromises were made, but the lasting product of this body \nrarely passes without such compromising, and again I wish to compliment \nall the senators who so assiduously developed the bill I expect will \npass overwhelmingly this morning.\n  There is a conceptual problem whenever we seek to apply serious \ndiplomatic and economic sanctions to worldwide problems. On the one \nhand, you risk over 70 cases of unintended consequences. I use that \nnumber because recent estimates are that at least 70 nations violate, \nabuse or proscribe outright religious freedom. One legislative solution \nmandating tangible and serious sanctions applied to over 70 cases can \nhave a myriad of consequences we don't intend.\n  On the other hand, a mere resolution of disapproval of such behavior \nappears weak, and can give the signal that the Congress is strong on \ndenunciation, but weak on action.\n  Mr. President, one of my favorite quotes on geopolitics comes from \nthe British historian Paul Johnson, who wrote in his magisterial \nhistory of the blood-soaked 20th century, Modern Times, that ``it is of \nthe essence of geopolitics to be able to distinguish between different \ndegrees of evil.''\n  Of course, evil is evil. But, it takes sophisticated legislating to \naddress it in a geopolitically sound way, and I believe that this \ncurrent bill has succeeded in doing that.\n  By the detailed and considered list of incremental actions directed \nof the President, and by the selective waiver authorities, we have, in \nthe International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, a piece of legislation \nthat is both substantive and flexible. It conscientiously fulfills the \nCongress's intent to act against one of the most hideous violations of \nhuman rights, persecution based on faith.\n  We could not ignore the moral imperative to act, Mr. President. It \nwould be impossible now to list all of the egregious abuses of this \nfundamental right that are occurring today, and I fear that to select a \nfew examples risks suggesting other, unmentioned, abuses are less \nobjectionable.\n  Nor would it be accurate to suggest that abuses of religion occur \nmerely in totalitarian or authoritarian regimes. The renowned human \nrights organization Freedom House recently reported that the number of \ndemocracies in the world has grown over the past ten years from 66 \ndemocracies to 117. This is a remarkable accomplishment and bodes well \nfor global political trends.\n  But we should not believe this trend is irreversible, nor should we \nassume that all of the new democracies are well-established in their \ninstitutions. While democratic development is required to further the \nprotection of individual rights, including the right to conscience and \nfaith, certain democratic regimes around the world still constrain \ncomplete freedom of religion.\n  There is a relation, however, between the degree of abuse of the \nright to individual faith and authoritarian regimes, because it mostly \nis in authoritarian regimes do you the horrific abuses--torture, \nimprisonment, execution and disappearance--that are most disturbing to \nAmericans. That is why all of us gathered today to support this bill \nmust redouble our efforts to maintain a strong commitment to the \ndevelopment and expansion of democracy as a pillar of American foreign \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, I take my own Mormon faith seriously; and, because of \nmy faith, I am acutely aware of the historical suffering of an \nintolerant society. Perhaps that is what makes me more attuned to the \nsufferings of the faithful--of all the great religions--around the \nworld. Perhaps it is because I am a conservative, who simply believes \nin a life based on faith, family and country, with faith underpinning \nthe values of family and country.\n  But it is probably because I am an American, a proud citizen of a \ncountry where we have so developed a rule of law that enshrines the \nindividual right to belief that we are the envy of freedom-seeking \npeople around the world and the enemies of those regimes too insecure, \ntoo primitive, and, in some cases, too barbaric to countenance this \nmost fundamental freedom.\n  Mr. President, I have traveled a great deal in this world, and I have \nmet many leaders. I have met communists who believed, and believers who \ncountenanced oppression of other faiths. The varieties of personal \nfaith and its expressions are countless, but the fundamental political \nright to personal conscience is indivisible, and universally desired.\n  This bill before demonstrates that the United States Congress, and \nall its members with all their faiths, believe that the pursuit of this \npolitical right must be a conscious, vocal, activist, and determined \npart of our foreign policy. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor, I rise in \nstrong support of the International Religious Freedom Act and hope for \nthe persecuted everywhere. I commend my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in the Senate and House for their dedicated efforts in crafting \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, the desire for religious freedom is not uniquely \nAmerican. But as Americans we are in a unique position to advocate it. \nAs a superpower, we have the resources. As a nation of free people, we \nhave the responsibility. Religious freedom is at the core of our \ncountry and enshrined in our Constitution. Our nation's founders fled \nfrom religious persecution in search of a land where they could freely \nexercise their ideal of religious freedom They stood recognizing that \nthe suppression of their faith was tryanny over their hearts and minds. \nThey knew that without the freedom to gather, to worship, to speak \nabout their God, there would be no freedom. So they laid a cornerstone \nfor our democracy, establishing freedom in law. And from that day, the \nprotection of religious freedom has become part of our legacy, part of \nour identify as a nation. We must exercise this identify or one day \nrealize that we have lost it. For the fruits of democracy, hoarded in \nthe hands of the few, become bitter and rotten.\n  Mr. President this legislation takes concrete steps to promote the \nbasic right to religious freedom. It establishes three entities to \ncooperatively guarantee that combating religious persecution is a \npriority in U.S. foreign policy. Within the State Department, an \nAmbassador-at-Large for Religious Liberty will serve as a high level \ndiplomat, raising issues of religious persecution in bilateral meetings \nand heading up the Office of International Religious Freedom at the \nState Department. A Special Advisor on Religious Persecution at the \nNational Security Council will monitor incidents of persecution and act \nas an advisor and resource for the executive branch. The Commission on \nInternational Religious Liberty, a ten member, bipartisan commission, \nwill investigate religious persecution and provide an outside voice for \npolicy recommendations to both Congress and the White House. Under this \nlegislation, the U.S. government collects information on religious \npersecution, through the compilation of an Annual Report on Religious \nPersecution, and responds to these violations through a broad range of \noptions, ranging from diplomatic protest to economic sanctions. The \napparatus under this legislation is not simply reactive, however. It \nalso provides for active promotion of religious freedom through \ninternational broadcasts, Fulbright exchanges, and training for Foreign \nService Officers and refugee and asylum personnel on these issues. \nWhile the apparatus may seem extensive, it only reflects the magntitude \nof the problem. I believe that is the least that we can do to lay a \nconcrete foundation for religious freedom.\n  Religious persecution around the world may go unnoticed in the hectic \nrun of our daily lives, but for millions of people it is a horrifying, \nincessant reality. They live in fear of arrest, imprisonment, torture, \nand death for simply exercising their faith. In Pakistan, fear reigns \nunder the constitution, which stipulates the death penalty for \nblaspheny against Mohammed. Ayoob Masih, a Christian, was beaten by a \nmob for reading his Bible, arrested, imprisoned, fined, and sentenced \nto death by hanging for blasphemy. Local police have failed to control \nangry mobs destroying the homes and churches of Christians in Pakistan. \nAhmadis, Hindus, Zakris, and other minority religious groups have also \nbeen targets of lynching. In Egypt, Coptic Christians are routinely \ndenied permits to build or repair churches. In Cairo's Tora district, \nsecurity forces forcibly closed the doors of the Church of St. Bishoi,\n\n[[Page S12096]]\n\nwaxing its windows and preventing any further entry and any freedom to \nworship there. An eighteen year old girl in Laos was thrown into prison \nby government forces for teaching Bible classes to neighborhood \nchildren. In Iran, a man was shot in the street for not being in the \nmosque during prayer time. Bahai's have also been subject to a rash of \nexecutions. In Sudan, where civil war has ravaged the land and claimed \nover a million lives, Christians and Animists are subject to abduction, \nimprisonment, torture, enslavement, forced conversion to Islam, and \nexecution. Christian children are abducted, forced into reeducation \ncamps, given Arab names, and raised as Muslims. A Muslim sheik who \nChristianity was arrested, charged with apostasy, and faced with \nexecution unless he returned to Islam within two months. Only \ngovernment-certified clergymen are allowed to talk about religion in \nUzbekistan. Private religious instruction is also formally banned under \npains of stiff fines and labor camp sentences.\n\n  This type of insidious government control is also present in China, \nwhere Article 36 of the Chinese Constitution guarantees religious \nfreedom, but religious repression is carefully meted out through an \napparatus of government registration, intense scrutiny, unrelenting \nintimidation, and brutal punishment. Only five religions are permitted \nand control is exercised over these official churches in matters such \nas personnel selection, sermon themes, congregation size, and \ndissemination of religious materials. Unofficial, or illegal, religious \ngatherings are forcibly broken up, its participants arrested, victims \nof extortion, torture, and even fatal beatings. Zheng Muzheng, who was \nactive in sharing his faith, was beaten to death in a jail in Hunan \nProvince. His grieving widow has been repeatedly interrogated and held \nwithout arrest. Members of unofficial churches fortunate enough not to \nbe imprisoned live under the glare of government surveillance. They are \narbitrarily and repeatedly detained without formal charges, threatened \nwith loss of property and employment, subject to heavy fines--all for \nbelieving in and worshiping an authority higher than the Communist \nParty. Under their reign of terror, Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and \ntemples cannot be constructed and are often destroyed. Monks and nuns \nare restricted in numbers and tortured. Palden Gyatso, a Tibetan \nBuddhist monk, testified before the House International Relations \nCommittee about the routine use by the Chinese government of electric \nshock guns, serrated and hooked knives, handcuffs and thumbcuffs on \nthose who would dare to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed \nfreedom of religion.\n  The grim and disturbing reality is that religious persecution is not \nlimited to a particular region or a particular faith. It beats on the \nbacks of Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Baha'is. It \nscourages over half the world's population in over seventy countries.\n  Mr. President, this legislation takes comprehensive action against \nthis alarming trend of oppression. Through its reporting provisions, it \nsheds light on the dark practices of persecution-- a radiant ray of \nhope for those languishing in prisons. By requiring the President to \nuse those means deemed necessary to not allow these atrocious acts to \npersist, this legislation cracks the heavy yoke of persecution. In its \nactive promotion of religious freedom, it sweeps open the gates of \nsuppressed faith, preparing the way for the liberty.\n\n  Mr. President, I am aware that detractors of this legislation claim \nthat it establishes a false hierarchy of human rights abuses. But I \nsuspect that for those same critics, treating all human rights abuses \non an equal basis means voting against all human rights provisions on \nan equal basis. Others claim that it binds the hands of the President, \npropelling him on a course of self-defeating foreign policy, forcing \nhim to ultimately ``fudge'' sanctions. This well-crafted legislation \nhas taken this concern into consideration, incorporating the views of \nits sponsors, the Administration, and the business community. It \nfocuses on specific and particularly egregious instances of religious \npersecution. While it requires the President to act, it also presents \nthe President with a wide berth of options and requires a review of the \npotential impact on American security and economic interests and its \nintended efficacy.\n  Still others claim that we should not be moralizing or imposing our \nvalues on other countries. Those suffering in prison for practicing \ntheir faith would certainly disagree. Freedom of religion is a \nuniversal right and aspiration, recognized and articulated in a number \nof international instruments including the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, which states that ``Everyone has the right to freedom of \nthought, conscience, and religion . . . to manifest his religion or \nbelief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.'' The \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes that \n``Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and \nreligion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a \nreligion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or \nin community with others in public or private, to manifest his religion \nor belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.'' By \nadvocating this freedom, we are not imposing our values on others but \nreaffirming a universal right.\n  We must not cower under the covers of complacency. We must not be \ncomplicit actors, carried away in a current of oppression. We must not, \nfor fear of taking a false step on the path of justice, refuse to walk \nat all. We must be the voice of those muted by their oppressors, crying \nout for a land of the free. We must, in the words of Ronald Reagan, ``. \n. . be staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole \nprerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable and universal right of \nall human beings.''\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I offer my comments on the Nickles \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 2431, the International Religious Freedom \nAct of 1998.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] for \nall the hard work that he and others have devoted to this important \npiece of legislation. These Senators, and our House colleagues, have \nrecognized the importance of promoting religious freedom abroad, and \nhave tried to craft legislation that both emphasizes our serious \nconcerns about this issue, and provides authority to the President to \nreact to governments which abuse these fundamental rights.\n  In particular, I appreciate their efforts to make improvements to the \noriginal bill, most of which I support.\n  Mr. President, the issue of religious freedom is especially important \nfor our country. Freedom of religion is one of the bedrock principles \nof American democracy. Our founders, who came to America in part to \nflee religious intolerance, championed freedom of religion as a \nuniversal right, and made it an integral part of the Constitution \nthrough the Bill of Rights.\n  Throughout our history, immigrants from every corner of the globe \nhave arrived on our shores seeking a community where they could \npractice their religion openly and without fear of persecution. Today, \nwe value the separation of church and state as one of our guiding \nprinciples.\n  But we are all well aware that such liberties are not fully enjoyed \neverywhere, and there are millions of people who daily face persecution \nor intolerance because of their religious beliefs. Worse yet, the \nexploitation of religious and ethnic differences for political ends has \nbecome all too common in the post-Cold War era.\n  These trends have been around for centuries, but have been getting \nmore serious press attention in the last several years. They mirror the \nmyriad other abuses that are conducted, or at least tolerated, by non-\ndemocratic regimes around the world. Examples of restrictions on basic \nfreedoms--of expression, of association, of the press--abound, and \nthose who dare violate such restrictions face imprisonment, repression \nor even death. As we consider this legislation today, it is likely that \nsomewhere, a political prisoner is being beaten by the police or armed \nforces, or by some paramilitary group whose members might include \npolice officers or soldiers. It is likely that somewhere a union \norganizer is being detained or harassed by authorities, that a woman is \nbeing raped by government thugs, that a newspaper is being\n\n[[Page S12097]]\n\nshut down, or that a prisoner has ``disappeared.''\n  The question for us today is this: what is the appropriate U.S. \npolicy response to such acts of oppression by other nations on the \nbasis of religious beliefs? We should also ask: what is the appropriate \nresponse to oppression of any kind?\n  I firmly believe that the defense of human rights around the world \nrelates directly to our ``national interests'' and therefore justifies \nleadership from the United States, a nation founded on respect for \nindividual rights and liberties.\n  We are bound by our country's founding principles to promote and \ndefend certain ideas: that we are all created equal, that we are born \nwith certain inalienable rights, that government is legitimate only \nwith the consent of the people, and that government should exist to \npromote the general welfare and to secure the blessings of liberty for \nall. Our other national interests--security and economic opportunity--\nhave the best chance for advancement in a climate of freedom and \nrespect for individual rights, and are undermined where that climate \ndoes not thrive.\n  I have never shied away from the use of every economic, diplomatic, \nor rhetorical tool to advance our human rights agenda. It is through \nthe vigorous use of these tools that the United States can exercise the \ntype of leadership such fundamental violations of justice demand. To a \ncertain extent, this is the approach implicit in the bill we are \nconsidering today, which provides a menu of presidential actions to \nrespond to violations of religious freedom.\n  But, with deference to my colleague from Oklahoma and the work he has \ndone on this bill and although I support the bill, I have some \noutstanding concerns regarding this legislation. I believe that if we \nhad been able to fully consider this bill in the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, we would have been able to work out some of these issues.\n  I strongly support the basic premise of the bill, that the United \nStates should defend religious liberty, but I am concerned that it \nmight appear to subordinate other fundamental rights to the right to \nreligious freedom. As we defend the freedom of religion, should we not \njust as vigorously defend the rule of law, basic human rights and the \nexercise of political rights? We would be pleased if, tomorrow, Sudan's \nruling National Islamic Front suddenly lifted its Shar'ia law and \nallowed Christians to worship freely. But would we then tolerate the \nforced conscription of children, the lack of press freedom and the \nmanipulation of humanitarian assistance that also takes place in the \nSudan?\n  I also have some concerns about a few specific provisions.\n  First, this bill creates a new commission, the ``Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom.'' Although I am open to arguments on \nthis subject, I am not convinced a new commission is needed. We already \nhave in operation the Advisory Committee on Religious Freedom. This \nbody, which is broadly representative of various religious communities, \nhas been in operation since early 1997 and has already produced several \nuseful reports about the state of religious freedom around the world. \nIts work has helped focus administration attention on the issue of \nreligious persecution and the conditions of religious minorities.\n  Second, Section 205 of the bill authorizes $6 million over two years \nto carry out the work of this new Commission. The protection of \nreligious freedom is vital work that must be done, but I believe this \nis an enormous amount of money to be devoting to a commission of any \nsort, and I have seen no explanation of why $6 million is required. The \nAdvisory Committee was able to conduct its work with existing resources \nfrom the Department of State. I understand that the Committee's work \ngreatly strained the resources of the Department's Bureau for \nDemocracy, Human Rights and Labor, but I also understand that, even if \nstaff salaries are included, the Committee could have been run with a \nbudget of less than $500,000. Also, the new Commission proposed by the \nlegislation would be comprised of nine commissioners, rather than the \n20 on the existing Advisory Committee, so it might be expected to \nrequire less resources.\n  In addition, I am concerned that because of the narrow language of \nSection 205, the authorized funds might be used only for the specific \nactivities of the Commission, and not for the many additional \nrequirements of the bill which would then have to borne by the already \nstretched resources of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.\n  Mr. President, I hope there will be further clarification of the \nintended uses of these funds, and--if the Congress does appropriate \nsuch high levels of funding--I hope it will be used to further the \ngoals of the whole bill, and not simply Title II.\n  Third, another provision that raises some concerns is Section 107, \nwhich provides equal access to the premises of diplomatic missions to \nany U.S. citizen seeking to conduct religious activities. It is in the \nbest American tradition to provide a haven for Americans of faith who \nfind themselves in a country that is not hospitable to their religion, \nbut I wonder if some might argue that this provision would expand what \nthe Supreme Court has determined constitutes a ``public forum'' with \nrespect to equal access for religion. In practice, it is possible that \nit might then be deemed by some court to be an unconstitutional \nendorsement of a particular religion. That is not what we intend, so I \nhope the provision allows for discretion on the part of the chiefs of \nmission to appropriately respond to requests from the American \ncommunity.\n  My fourth concern relates to the provisions in Section 108--not what \nis in those provisions, but rather, what has been left out. Section 108 \nrequires the Secretary of State to prepare and maintain issue briefs on \nreligious freedom on a country-by-country basis. These will be similar \nto the annual country reports on human rights, which have proven to be \nan excellent source of information on conditions in individual \ncountries. However, the briefs are also required to include lists of \n``persons believed to be imprisoned, detained, or placed under house \narrest for their religious faith.'' In cases where the production and \npublicizing of prisoner lists is useful, perhaps we should devote \nsimilar attention to individuals detained in the pursuit of other \ninternationally recognized human rights. The Secretary should consider \nexercising her authority to broaden the list to include all prisoners \nof conscience, as appropriate. In addition, there may be cases where \nthe production or publication of such a list might actually be harmful \nto the individuals in question, or indeed to our intelligence \nresources. I believe on this point the administration is given \nconsiderable discretion.\n  Fifth, in an earlier draft of this legislation, included in the \ndescription of what might constitute a violation of religious freedom \nwas ``arbitrary prohibitions or restrictions on the grounds of religion \non holding public office, or pursuing educational or professional \nopportunities.'' For unknown reasons, this language unfortunately was \ndeleted from all subsequent drafts of this bill, including the current \nversion. However, the bill's definitional language is merely \nsuggestive, indicating areas the administration can take into \nconsideration when making a determination about a given country. I will \nassume that the administration will also consider restrictive \nprohibitions on education and employment, among other factors, when \nmaking such determinations. Any kind of religious discrimination is \nunacceptable.\n  Finally, Section 103 provides for the establishment of a religious \nfreedom Internet web site which would contain major international \ndocuments relating to religious freedom, among other items. This is a \nfantastic way to disseminate information about this issue to \nindividuals around the world who can use it to help promote their \ncauses in their own countries. Already we have seen the importance of \nthe Internet in promoting civil society. The Internet is the modern \nversion of the underground literature of the Cold War, only it does not \nrequire printing presses which can be taken away, and it is more \nreadily available to its audience. I hope, however, that the Secretary \nof State will take the opportunity to also include in the web site \nother important documents related more generally to human rights. In \nthat way, we can be sure to pursue the protection of all human rights \nthrough the most modern technology possible.\n\n[[Page S12098]]\n\n  Also, Mr. President, just to make the record clear, I do not support \nthe provisions of Section 406 which allow an exception to the sanctions \nin this bill for defense contractors.\n  Again, I commend the sponsors of this legislation and everyone who \nhas worked so hard to produce a consensus package.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of the International \nReligious Freedom Act, I rise today to commend my colleagues for their \nefforts to bring this bill to the Senate. This legislation takes \nconcrete steps to insure continued U.S. leadership and diplomatic focus \non issues of religious liberty around the world. Few things are more \nprecious to the American people than freedom of religion, and I \nstrongly support our efforts to bring this freedom to those who are \npersecuted for their faiths around the world.\n  The vast majority of those who suffer abridgement of their right to \nreligious liberty do not suffer torture, rape, or murder. Instead, they \nface harassment, discrimination, and onerous bureaucratic obstacles to \nregistering their religious organizations. The Act covers all \nviolations of religious liberty, not just the most egregious acts of \npersecution and I commend the drafters of this legislation for its \nbroad coverage.\n  As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nI am very concerned over rising religious intolerance and even \noppression in the OSCE region. As Eastern European countries begin to \nloosen their grip on their economies, they must also learn to \nrelinquish government control over legitimate private action by their \ncitizenry that is protected by international commitments. I have \nwritten repeatedly strong letters to heads of state or government in \nsupport of religious liberty and to hold them to their international \nhuman rights commitments.\n  The Commission has had two hearings and several public briefings on \nthis issue in the OSCE region. We have heard testimony that, contrary \nto our expectations when the Communist governments of the former Warsaw \nPact states fell, a variety of official measures have been taken \nrestricting, or in some cases denying, freedom of thought, conscience, \nreligion or belief. One of the core values of the United States is \nfreedom of religion. The various documents of the Helsinki Process and \nthe Universal Declaration on Human Rights have adopted this fundamental \nfreedom and established it as an international norm all nations are \nexpected to meet. I strongly believe that adoption of this legislation \nwill help the United States advocate religious liberty around the \nworld, and address some of the specific problems our hearings and \nbriefings have documented.\n  This year in Uzbekistan, for instance, a new law was passed which, \namong other restrictions, requires 100 Uzbek citizens to sign a \nreligious community's application for registration, criminalizes any \nunregistered religious activity, and penalizes religious free speech. \nIn 1997, similarly restrictive laws were passed in Russia and Macedonia \nand a number of OSCE participating states are reportedly considering \nlegislation imposing significant restrictions on religious liberty, \nparticularly for minority religious groups.\n  In Western Europe, the trends toward increased religious intolerance \nhas been more insidious. In the last few years, governments in Western \nEurope, particularly France, Germany, Belgium, and Austria, have \ntargeted numerous groups that they label ``dangerous'' and have \npublished official government propaganda against them, placed them \nunder surveillance by security agencies, and revoked tax exempt status \nbased on the determination that groups are not a positive influence on \nsociety. Furthermore, these Western European actions embolden the more \nintolerant sectors of Eastern European society to further restrict \nreligious liberty for minority or ill-favored groups.\n  By requiring the President to take action against all countries \nengaged in violations of religious liberty, the Act insures that less \negregious cases of religious liberty violations will not be ignored. By \nenumerating the specific policy responses required ranging from a \nprivate demarche to sanctions, the Act reflects the need for \nflexibility in diplomacy. Finally, by instituting a separate \ncommission, the Act facilitates accurate and independent reporting on \nreligious liberty violations around the world.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this important \nlegislation and I urge my colleagues to support the International \nReligious Freedom Act.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nproceed for 2 minutes on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the International Religious \nFreedom Act presented by the Assistant Majority Leader, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and the Senator from Connecticut.\n  We have discussed this legislation at some length over the last \ncouple of weeks, and my colleagues have been very gracious in trying to \naccommodate some of my concerns with the bill.\n  Although it is not a perfect bill, it is a compromise that I support.\n  The persecution of individuals for their faith, like persecution for \npolitical beliefs or ethnicity, is abhorrent to all Americans. \nUnfortunately, too many nations around the world fail to protect the \nbasic human rights of their citizens. The reasons for this are often \ncomplex and varied--but they are never justified.\n  What justification can there be, for example, for the jailing by the \nChinese government of thousands of dissidents--not to mention a few \nCatholic leaders who choose to remain loyal to the Vatican, rather than \nbow to the dictates of the so-called ``official'' church in Beijing?\n  What justification can there be for a law in Russia which appears to \ndiscriminate between ``established'' religious organizations and those \nwhose roots in Russia are not long-standing?\n  As a nation founded on the premise that ``all men are created equal. \n. .endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights'', \nAmericans have long been committed to promoting and protecting human \nrights. Existing law, in place since the 1970s, prohibits U.S. \nassistance to nations which engage in a ``consistent pattern of gross \nviolations'' of human rights--including the right to religious freedom. \nSince the 1970s, we have also had an Assistant Secretary of State \nspecifically devoted to the task of advancing human rights.\n  In recent years, the Clinton Administration has taken important steps \nto promote religious freedom. In 1996, Secretary of State Christopher \nestablished an Advisory Committee on Religious Persecution Abroad, a \n20-member panel which is broadly representative of many religious \nfaiths, and has provided practical guidance to the Secretary and the \nState Department about this important subject.\n  More recently, Secretary of State Albright has appointed a Senior \nAdviser to take the lead on religious freedom in the State Department.\n  This legislation is designed to further elevate religious freedom on \nour foreign policy agenda. It does so by creating a new Office on \nInternational Religious Freedom at the Department of State, to be \nheaded by an Ambassador-at-Large.\n  Under this legislation, the State Department will produce a new \nannual report on religious freedom, which will assess the state of \nreligious freedom around the world. This report, which will expand on \nthe information available in the annual human rights report already \nproduced by the State Department, should prove an invaluable resource \nto Americans concerned about religious freedom.\n  Additionally, a new Commission will be established, for a period of \nfour years, which will serve in an advisory capacity, producing a \nreport of its own on an annual basis which will include recommendations \nfor U.S. policy.\n  The bill also contains new provisions of law requiring that the \nPresident impose sanctions against the most severe violators of the \nright to religious freedom.\n\n[[Page S12099]]\n\n  I must confess to some skepticism that new sanctions legislation is \nnecessary, for two reasons. First, as I stated, current law already \nprohibits U.S. assistance to countries which engage in serious human \nrights violations.\n  Second, in recent months I have reconsidered my own view on sanctions \npolicy--and have come to the conclusion that, even though Congress is \nwell within its constitutional power to apply sanctions, it is not \nalways wise, as a matter of sound foreign policy, for Congress to do \nso.\n  But I am willing to go along with this sanctions law because it \nincludes many aspects that I believe must be present in any sanctions \nlaw that Congress enacts. Indeed, the sanctions provision in this bill \noffers considerable flexibility to the President.\n  First, the bill provides the President with a ``menu'' of options--\nseven different types of sanctions from which the President must choose \njust one sanction. If the President doesn't like the choices on the \nmenu, he is free to take ``commensurate action''--that is, action \ncommensurate to the items on the menu of options.\n  Second, the bill provides a broad waiver authority.\n  The President may waive the application of the sanction if the \nforeign government has ceased the violations; if using the waiver would \n``further the purposes'' of the Act; or if important national interests \nof the United States justified the exercise of the waiver.\n  Third, the bill provides that any sanctions sunset two years after \nthey are imposed unless they are specifically reauthorized.\n  The President may also terminate the sanctions if the foreign \ngovernment has ``ceased or taken substantial and verifiable steps to \ncease'' the violations that gave rise to the sanctions.\n  Fourth, there is an exemption from the sanctions for the provision of \nfood, medicine, medical equipment or supplies, as well as other \nhumanitarian assistance.\n  In sum, although I am not eager to enact a new sanctions law, I \nbelieve we are setting an important precedent with this bill in terms \nof what should be contained in any sanctions law.\n  We must make every effort to ensure that the steps we take under this \nlaw will help those who are suffering from persecution--and not \nincrease the dangers they face. During the hearings in the Foreign \nRelations Committee on this legislation, several witnesses representing \nreligious communities that operate overseas expressed this concern.\n  I know the sponsors of this bill share this concern--and so I hope \nthat both Congress and the Executive Branch will be attentive to it in \nthe coming years.\n  This bill takes several steps which I hope will lead to the \nadvancement of religious freedom--one of the fundamental human rights--\naround the world.\n  We must be certain that in implementing this law, it is not to the \ndetriment of other fundamental human rights that are recognized \ninternationally.\n  As the columnist Stephen Rosenfeld has written, religious freedom \ndeserves a seat at the human rights table, but it should not overturn \nthe table.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Pennsylvania on the floor, \nSenator Specter. I compliment him--he is the one who got me into this, \nquite frankly--and my colleagues from Oklahoma and from Connecticut. I \ncan claim no credit for starting this initiative. I can only claim that \nI have attempted to play a role here to make sure that the desire we \nall have to extend religious freedom around the world becomes a \nreality. I have tried to make sure that our sanctions meet a realistic \ntest of promoting an actual change in the behavior of other nations. It \nwas toward that end that I worked on a small part of this bill. I \nattempted to rationalize the sanctions legislation on this issue with \nwhat we are attempting to do on all the other sanctions legislation we \nhave around here.\n  The thing we have all learned is, unilateral sanctions on any subject \nseldom ever work. Sometimes, and promoting religious freedom is one of \nthose times, we may have to act even if it is not efficacious, just to \nstate our principled commitment to religious freedom. I recommend my \ncolleagues take a look at this legislation though because I think we \nhave produced a sound sanctions bill.\n  For that, I have to thank the authors, Senator Specter and Senator \nNickles and Senator Lieberman, for accommodating some of the changes I \nsuggested in the functional way in which these sanctions would be \nemployed.\n  I thank them for their consideration. They were very gracious to me \nand very patient with me. And I am very satisfied with the way the bill \nhas turned out--not only the principle but the efficacy of the \nlegislation.\n  I thank my colleague for the extra time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for \nhis statement but also for his leadership. I have already complimented \nSenator Lieberman for his leadership and his partnership in making this \nhappen. But also I mentioned last night Senator Specter worked \ntirelessly on this; Senator Coats did as well. Senator Feinstein came \nin and negotiated with us and I think made some important changes.\n  I also just quickly would like to thank a couple of staff people. \nCecile Shea of Senator Lieberman's staff worked tirelessly on this \nlegislation; John Hanford of Senator Lugar's staff and Steve Moffitt of \nmy staff have put in maybe more hours on this piece of legislation than \nmost any I have seen. Others who helped were Laura Bryant and Willie \nImboden.\n  Also, I thank Senator Helms for his support and leadership, as well \nas Congressman Wolf for leading the effort in the House of \nRepresentatives. They have assured us that they will pass this \nlegislation as soon as they receive it.\n  So I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor. And I yield the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on final passage.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 574, H.R. 3830.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3830) to provide for the exchange of certain \n     lands within the State of Utah.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Hatch for 2 minutes, and \nthen to Senator Bennett for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for this \nlegislation to exchange school trust lands located in Utah to the \nfederal government. This timely piece of legislation has the full \nsupport of the Utah delegation, the Governor of Utah, and the Clinton \nadministration, as well as the PTA and local educators from across our \nstate. It is, in some small measure, the result of the unfortunate \nsituation created several years ago when President Clinton created the \nGrand Staircase Escalante Monument that withdrew hundreds of thousands \nof additional Utah school trust lands from benefitting Utah s school \nchildren. This bill represents the largest land exchange in the history \nof Utah.\n  I commend the President for being willing to do this, the Secretary \nof the Interior for being willing to do this, and others on the floor, \nincluding my colleague, Senator Bennett, the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, Senator Murkowski, and the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas, Senator Bumpers. Without their leadership and support, this \nlegislation would not have been possible. I want to express that \nappreciation. This is a momentous day for the State of Utah that will \nleave a lasting legacy for our school children.\n  This bill passed the House of Representatives in July and was \napproved by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources last \nmonth. I am pleased the full Senate will consider it today and send it \nto the President.\n  I and all the citizens of Utah have looked forward anxiously to this \nday, which has been a long time coming.\n  When Utah became a state in 1896, Congress designated a portion of \neach township in the state to be set aside as School Trust Land which \nwould be used to generate revenue for Utah's schools. The patchwork \nlayout of these school trust lands across the state has historically \ncreated management difficulties between federal and state governments. \nAs new national parks, forests, and monuments are designated, the \nschool lands are often enveloped within them. This has the effect of \nclosing off development of these lands and, therefore, any revenue they \nmight produce for the school land trust fund.\n  As of 1995, over 200,000 acres of school trust land, called \ninholdings, were isolated this way. As I mentioned, President Clinton \ndoubled this amount with his designation of the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante Monument in 1996.\n  At the time of the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nMonument, President Clinton gave numerous assurances that Utah's school \nchildren would not be hurt by this designation. H.R. 3830 represents \nthe partial fulfillment of these promises.\n  The Utah Schools and Lands Exchange Act is the culmination of long \nand careful deliberations between Governor Leavitt and Secretary of the \nInterior Bruce Babbitt. As a result of this thorough and delicate \nplanning, the act enjoys broad support from environmentalists, private \nlandowners, educators, legislators, and the Administration.\n  The bill exchanges approximately 350,000 acres of school trust lands \nlocated in Utah monuments, recreation areas, national parks, and \nforests to the Federal Government. To provide equitable compensation \nfor these lands, Utah will receive cash, lands, mineral rights, coal \ndeposits, and other Federal properties. I assure my colleagues that \nthis is a fair and equitable exchange of assets.\n  The land received by the Federal Government, totaling 376,739 acres \nof\n\n[[Page S12101]]\n\nland and 65,853 acres of mineral rights, includes school trust areas \nthat are similar in nature to the surrounding blocks of federal lands. \nBy transferring these areas to the federal government, the land will \nfall under federal protection and management.\n  Consolidation of these lands will be beneficial because land \nownership will be harmonized, precious natural resources will be \npreserved and protected, and the American public will gain access to \npreviously isolated areas.\n  A number of priceless natural landmarks will come under the \nprotection of the federal government as a result of this bill. These \ninclude: Eye of the Whale Arch, located in Arches National Park; \nancient Native American ruins and the Jacob Hamblin Arch of Glen Canyon \nNational Recreation Area; several hundred-foot red rock cliffs located \nwithin the Grand Staircase Escalante Monument; and the high mountain \nalpine area in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest known as Franklin \nBasin. Other natural wonders safeguarded through the exchange include: \nancient Native American rock art panels in Dinosaur National Monument \nand unique geologic formations of the Waterpocket Fold within Capitol \nReef National Park.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 3830 addresses many land management problems \nwhich have plagued Utah for decades. Specifically, this measure helps \nsolve a problem suffered by all states, such as Utah, having large \ntracts of federally owned or controlled land --that is, the starvation \nand lack of funding for our school systems which traditionally depend \non property taxes for funding.\n  The trust land system, developed by Congress in the 19th century \nduring the period of westward expansion, was an attempt to offset the \nlosses from the Federal Government's desire to protect certain lands. \nWe are pleased that, after 2 years, the Clinton administration has \ndelivered on this commitment.\n  I especially want to commend Utah Governor Mike Leavitt for \nundertaking the task of painstaking identification of lands for \nexchange and for conducting these negotiations with the Interior \nDepartment. His determination and dedication to initiating this process \ncannot be understated.\n  I also want to recognize the efforts of Utah's educators, parents, \nand school board members, who kept this issue on the front burner. \nTheir dedication to resolving this serious funding helped drive these \nnegotiations and ensure that nothing got bogged down. In short, land is \nland; but we needed to keep our eye on the ball, and that is our \nchildren.\n  Again, I want to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Bennett, for \nhis efforts on this bill. I know he shares my feeling of joy that this \nbill is finally coming to fruition. It means a great deal to improving \neducation in our State, and I appreciate my colleagues' support.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, thank you.\n  This is a delightful day. As I think about the issue of swapping \nland, school trust lands in Utah for other Federal lands, I realize \nthat this is an issue that my father worked on in this Chamber over 40 \nyears ago. Governor Matheson, to keep it bipartisan, the Democratic \nGovernor of Utah, tried an initiative on this same issue while he was \nthe Governor some 20 years ago. To see it finally come to fruition now \nbrings me a great sense of satisfaction.\n  I thank my senior colleague for his support and leadership on this \nissue, I thank the members of the Energy Committee for their work, and \nI particularly thank my friend from Arkansas, the senior Senator, Mr. \nBumpers, for his support as we have gone through this. He and I became \nacquainted when I first came to the Senate and went on that committee. \nWe worked on a number of issues together, and I am delighted that this \nis one that comes together in a bipartisan fashion.\n  So this is a time of rejoicing, nostalgia, and great pleasure on my \npart.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe I still have the time. If the \nSenator from Arkansas would like a couple of minutes, I would be glad \nto yield to him for a comment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there are few Senators in the U.S. Senate \nfor whom I have ever held a higher esteem than my good friend Bob \nBennett. Therefore, several months ago, when I put a hold on this Utah \nland exchange, which was divinely desired by the Governor and the \nInterior Department, which is a rare instance--would that all land \nexchanges had this kind of support--I went to Senator Bennett and I \ntold him privately--and he will agree to this--I told him privately, \n``Bob, if push comes to shove''--I am not going to go into the details \nof why I put a hold on it. We all do these things around here \noccasionally. I never liked it, but sometimes we have to do things to \nprotect ourselves.\n  I told Senator Bennett privately, ``At the right time, I will take my \nhold off this bill.'' I said, ``I want you to know I would never allow \nsomething this popular and well received to go down and''----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend?\n  The Chamber will come to order. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I must say, his determination--his fierce \ndetermination--to get this bill passed was reflected in the fact that \nhe asked me every day for 6 months when I was going to take my hold \noff. This morning, I was very happy to tell him that my reason for \nputting the hold on in the first place had been resolved. One of the \nhappiest days of my life was the day I could take that hold off to \naccommodate the Senator and Senator Hatch. I know he has been actively \ninvolved in this also.\n  I just wanted to say that, Mr. President. I thank the leader very \nmuch for yielding the time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Has the clerk reported the title?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk has reported.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table without intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased at the Senate's \npassage of S. 2402, the Old Jicarilla Administrative Site Conveyance \nAct of 1998. This legislation allows for transfer by the Secretaries of \nAgriculture and Interior real property and improvements at an abandoned \nand surplus administrative site of the Carson National Forest to San \nJuan College. The site is known as the old Jicarilla Ranger District \nStation, near the village of Gobernador, New Mexico. The Jicarilla \nStation will continue to be used for public purposes, including \neducational and recreational purposes of the college.\n  The Forest Service determined that these ten acres are of no further \nuse to them, since the Jicarilla District Ranger moved into a new \nadministrative facility in the town of Bloomfield, New Mexico. The \nfacility has had no occupants for several years, and the Forest Service \nrecently testified that the improvements on the site are surplus, and \nendorsed passage of this bill to provide long-term benefits for the \npeople of San Juan County and the students and faculty of San Juan \nCollege.\n  Clearly, this legislation deserves prompt approval in the House and \nsignature by the President because it is noncontroversial and the land \ncan readily be put to good use for San Juan College and the area \nresidents. We also need to put this property in the hands of the \ncollege so it can protect the area from further deterioration and fire.\n  Over one third of the land in New Mexico is owned by the federal \ngovernment, and therefore finding appropriate sites for community and \neducational purposes can be difficult. S. 2402 is a win-win bill in \nproviding facilities and lands to San Juan College and removing \nunwanted and unused land and facilities from federal ownership. I urge \nprompt passage in the House of Representatives.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2402), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read: ``A bill to direct the \nSecretaries of Agriculture and Interior to convey certain lands in San \nJuan County, New Mexico, to San Juan College.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12102-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APACHE-SITGREAVES NATIONAL FOREST\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 2413) to provide for \nthe development of a management plan for the Woodland Lake Park tract \nin Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in the State of Arizona reflecting \nthe current use of the tract as a public park, which had been reported \nfrom the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, with amendments; as \nfollows:\n  (The parts of the bill intended to be stricken are shown in boldface \nbrackets and the parts of the bill intended to be inserted are shown in \nitalic.)\n\n                                S. 2413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     [SECTION 1.

I thank the majority leader and minority leader for \nbringing this legislation forward. Although time has been short, to \nsome of us this is very important. Mr. President, this is a simple \neffort to conserve 15 acres of land in Morristown, NJ. It is for most \nAmericans a sacred piece of real estate. It is where George Washington \nspent the winter of 1779. There are few more hallowed grounds in \nAmerican history.\n  While previous Congresses have saved much of this real estate, this \nparticular acreage is under threat of development. This is a simple \nauthorization. The U.S. Government can either enter into a contract to \npurchase or receive it as a gift, this final threatened acreage. I am \nvery grateful for this support and bringing this forward today.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to mention, while Senator Gorton is on \nthe floor, that in separate legislation in the Interior bill he has \nauthorized a study of all remaining threatened lands from the \nRevolutionary War, that we no longer have to do this on a piecemeal \nbasis.\n  I thank again the majority leader, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12103-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, today the United States Senate has taken \na historic step in preserving one of America's treasures--Route 66. S. \n2133, the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Act of 1998, will preserve the \nunique cultural resources along the famous Route 66 corridor and \nauthorize the Interior Secretary to provide assistance through the Park \nService. Congresswoman Heather Wilson of Albuquerque, New Mexico, \nintroduced a companion bill (HR. 4513) in the House of Representatives. \nI am hoping that body will promptly act on this bill with the changes \nproposed by the distinguished Environment and Public Works Committee \nChairman Chafee.\n  I introduced the ``Route 66 Study Act of 1990,'' which directed the \nNational Park Service to determine the best ways to preserve, \ncommemorate and interpret Route 66. As a result of that study, I \nintroduced S. 2133 this June authorizing the National Park Service to \njoin with federal, state and private efforts to preserve aspects of the \nhistoric Route 66 corridor, the nation's most important thoroughfare \nfor east-west migration in the 20th century.\n  The Administration testified in favor of this legislation, with some \nmodifications. We've made some good changes to the bill, and Senator \nChafee's amendment furthers progress for success of this Park Service \nprogram. This legislation authorizes a funding level over 10 years and \nstresses that we want the federal government to support grassroots \nefforts to preserve aspects of this historic highway.\n  New Mexico added to the aura of Route 66, giving new generations of \nAmericans their first experience of our colorful culture and heritage. \nDesignated in 1926, the 2,200-mile Route 66 stretched from Chicago to \nSanta Monica, California. It rolled through eight American states, and \nin New Mexico, it went through the communities of Tucumcari, Santa \nRosa, Albuquerque, Grants, and Gallup. Route 66 allowed generations of \nvacationers to travel to previously remote areas and experience the \nnatural beauty and cultures of the Southwest and Far West. S. 2133 will \nfacilitate greater coordination in federal, state and private efforts \nto preserve structures and other cultural resources of the historic \nRoute 66 corridor, the 20th century route equivalent to the Santa Fe \nTrail.\n  This bill authorizes the National Park Service to support state, \nlocal and private efforts to preserve the Route 66 corridor by \nproviding technical assistance, participating in cost-sharing programs, \nand make grants. The Park Service will also act as a clearing house for \ncommunication among federal, state, local, private and American Indian \nentities interested in the preservation of the Route 66 corridor.\n  As we draw to the close of this century, there is more interest in \ntrying to save Route 66. I sincerely hope that this legislation is \nquickly passed on the House floor. The time is now to provide tangible \nmeans of assistance to preserve this special highway.\n  The amendment (No. 3800) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2133), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2133\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am joined by my Oregon colleague, Senator \nSmith, in offering an amendment to S. 2513. My amendment will provide \nthe critical final step to enable Deschutes County, Oregon, in the \ncompletion of more than three years of intense work that they have done \nto find an effective way to protect their groundwater and wetlands from \ninappropriate residential development.\n  Deschutes County has completed several years collaborative work to \nresolve a number of extraordinarily difficult land use problems in that \ncounty. In particular, the County faces the prospect of development of \nmore than 13,000 subdivided lots in the vicinity of the Deschutes River \nin the southern half of the county. More than half of these lots have \nnot yet been developed, and the county now knows that if it does not \nprevent the further development of these lands, they are going to have \nmajor, intractable pollution of the groundwater and of the Deschutes \nRiver.\n  The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality tells us that at \npresent rates of growth, this area faces serious ground water quality \nproblems over the next decade. Further, these lands constitute the most \nimportant wildlife and wetlands habitat in the area.\n  After several years of working with federal and state agencies and \nlocal citizens, under the authority of Oregon's Regional Problem \nSolving initiative, the County has come up with a plan to use \nincentives to shift development from these sensitive lands, over on to \nBureau of Land Management lands that are not nearly so sensitive. Under \nthis plan, the County will sell parcels of this land to prospective \nresidential developers. However, before a developer may acquire a \ntract, the developer must have purchased ``development rights'' to \nlands in environmentally sensitive areas. Once these rights are \nacquired, the land will be rezoned so as to prevent any future \ndevelopment in the undesirable area.\n  In fact, the BLM lands have already been logged. The BLM lands are \neasily served by a wastewater collection system and have other features \nthat make the location far more appropriate for development. Local BLM \nofficials have been deeply involved in this effort and tell us that if \nit fails, the damage to the natural environment of the area will be \nsubstantial, and far more expensive to deal with later.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Smith, Senator Bumpers, and \nChairman Murkowski for working with me at this late date to work out \nthis provision. I want to express my deep appreciation to Governor John \nKitzhaber, whose Regional Problem Solving initiative paved the way for \nthis effort. And finally, I want to thank the staff at the Bureau of \nLand Management here in Washington, in Portland, and at the Prineville \nDistrict for approaching this matter from the distinct perspective of \nthe greater benefit to the environment that this legislation will \nachieve.\n  I also note the very active participation of Deschutes County \nCommissioner Linda Swearingen, Assistant County Attorney Bruce White, \nand Community Development Director George Read. They have provided \ncritical help to get this measure approved, and certainly it is their \nvision for the future of Deschutes County that has gotten us where we \nare today.\n  The amendment (No. 3802) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2513), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2513\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to the consideration of S. 2131, and ask that the \nsubstitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill be \nread a third time and passed, with the motion to reconsider laid upon \nthe table.\n  I note that this legislation passed last evening, and this is a \nhousekeeping matter to allow this matter to be received by the House \nquickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3803\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments submitted.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in support of the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1998, one of the most important \npublic works measures before the Senate. This important measure was \napproved this summer by the Committee on Environment and Public Works, \non which I serve.\n  This legislation includes authorizations for numerous water resources \nprojects important to my state. Three shoreline protection projects \nwhich will protect property, wildlife habitat, and contribute to New \nJersey's coastal economy are authorized to proceed to construction.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that this Committee has addressed a \nserious policy disagreement with the Administration over funding for \nshore protection projects. For the past five years, the Administration \nhas requested no funding for new shore protection studies and has \nunderfunded the construction work of ongoing projects. This year, the \nAdministration proposed modifying the cost-share for shore protection \nprojects to require the states and localities to finance the majority--\n65 percent, of the costs of periodic renourishment. This activity is \nthe most expensive portion of the project, since these projects \ngenerally receive 3-5 year renourishments over their 50-year period.\n  I disagreed with this approach because I believed that it was unfair \nto\n\n[[Page S12109]]\n\nthose communities that had planned for these projects and expected a \ntrue partnership with the federal government. During the consideration \nof this bill in Committee, I offered an amendment to allow us to phase \nin a more reasonable cost-sharing formula for shore protection \nprojects. Those projects which have a feasibility study completed by \nthe end of 1998 or which are authorized to proceed to construction in \nthis bill, will continue to be covered by the 65/35 cost-share formula \nthrough the life of the projects, just as all flood control projects \nare cost-shared. Those projects authorized subsequently will continue \nto receive the 65/35 cost-share formula for the initial construction. \nHowever, states will be required to provide 50 percent--just five \npercent more of the costs--for periodic renourishment. While I was \ndisappointed that we could not maintain the current cost share for all \nprojects, I believe that the committee's proposal is fairer to the \ncommunities and states that have planned for these projects. We have \nauthorized many shore protection projects that have only moved forward \nbecause of the efforts of Congress. I sincerely hope that our action \ntoday moves the Administration forward to begin planning and budgeting \nfor these projects.\n  The bill also provides necessary authorization adjustments for \nprojects critical to the movement of cargo through the Port of New York \nand New Jersey as proposed by Senator Moynihan and I. The port annually \nhandles 1.4 million containers and 30 billion gallons of petroleum \nproducts and is the gateway to a thriving economy for New Jersey, New \nYork, and the entire country. By the year 2010, experts predict that 90 \npercent of all liner freight will be shipped in containers. The bill's \namendments are important to addressing the increasing cost of dredged \nmaterial disposal in light of the moratorium on ocean disposal.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes flood control studies important to \nnumerous communities in my state. The bill provides for a study of \nflood control measures in the Repaupo Creek. This waterway contains a \ndeteriorating 76-year old floodgate, which, if breached, threatens the \ncommunities of Greenwich, East Greenwich, Harrison, and Logan, Mantua, \nand Woolwich. Another important study of the Delaware River streams and \nwatersheds in Camden and Gloucester Counties is authorized in the bill. \nThe bill also includes a study of navigational needs along the \nFortescue Inlet of the Delaware Bay.\n  Mr. President, the State of New Jersey, local governments and \nregional authorities have been carefully planning and budgeting for the \ncritical projects that this bill authorizes. Any further delays could \nhave an adverse impact on the economies of regions that are affected by \nthese projects. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I want to thank the Chairman, Senator Chafee, the Ranking Member, \nSenator Baucus, and the Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Warner, and \ntheir staff members for their hard work on this bill. The members of \nthe committee staff, including Dan Delich, Ann Loomis, and Jo-Ellen \nDarcy were extremely helpful and professional, putting in many long \nhours to produce a bill that benefits communities across the country.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Water \nResources Development Act of 1998 (WRDA 98). WRDA 98 recognizes the \nimportance of Florida's natural resources--through the authorization of \nprojects and studies related to the Everglades, flood control, shore \nprotection and water supply.\n  The investment Congress has made in the Everglades is significant. \nThe authorization of the extension of the Everglades' Critical \nRestoration Projects is important because there are many stakeholders \ninvolved. The Senate, through WRDA 98, sends a clear message that this \ninvestment is important.\n  WRDA 98 recognizes the leadership Florida provides in the development \nof water resources by authorizing Aquifer Storage & Recovery projects \nin South Florida, as well as a deep water storage project in the \nCaloosahatchee River basin. These projects provide the important and \nnecessary next steps to continue the progress made in the restoration \nof the Everglades.\n  Finally, a critical Alternative Water Source provision provides the \nnecessary framework for developing a sustainable water supply as \nFlorida continues to experience unprecedented growth. In total, WRDA 98 \nprovides for the authorization of 23 projects in Florida to meet \nimportant shore protection, flood control and water supply needs in the \nState.\n  The amendment (No. 3803) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2131), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Let me just say again, a lot of work went into this \nimportant legislation involving water resources. It affects States \nthroughout the country. I am very pleased that we got this done. We \nworked on it in a bipartisan way. And we are hoping now that the House \nwill act expeditiously and we can complete this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12108-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we do have another move we will need to make \nin a few minutes, but Senator Daschle has indicated he would wish to \nhave an opportunity to use some leader time at this point and, \ndepending on how things go, I may want to do the same. But we worked on \nthese things in a cooperative way, and he is entitled to take leader \ntime. And we have assured each other that nobody is going to try to \ntake advantage of this time.\n  I yield the floor so that Senator Daschle can use leader time on his \nissue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12125-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12125-S12128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLOCKING HMO REFORM\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. First, let me say that I would not have required leader \ntime had we been following what I understand is normal procedure on the \nSenate floor: The majority leader is recognized first, the Democratic \nleader is recognized second. I was not recognized following the motion \nthat I made, and I am very disappointed--\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate is not in order. I think the leader is entitled \nto be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Please take all \nextraneous conversations to the cloakroom.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  I would clarify my comments by adding that the current Presiding \nOfficer was not in the chair, nor was the current Parliamentarian. So \nit could have\n\n[[Page S12126]]\n\nbeen an accident, and I will accept it as that, but I would hope that \nthe Chair--not this particular Presiding Officer--but the Chair would \nalways recognize the importance of following Senate rules. And Senate \nrules oblige the Chair to recognize either leader before any other \nMember.\n  Mr. President, I wanted the opportunity to talk about why we raised \nHMO reform today and why it was important that we have a vote. We had \nthe vote on almost a partisan basis--there were a couple of our \nRepublican colleagues who joined us, but it was largely on a partisan \nbasis. Once again, our efforts to bring forth a bill and a debate on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights failed. I am disappointed because this may \nbe the last opportunity we have to consider this issue.\n  We have considered a lot of items over the last couple of weeks. I \nhave reported to the distinguished majority leader that I have heard \nfrom many of my Members on a daily basis why it is important to bring \nup HMO reform if we are going to bring up so many other issues. As the \nsponsor of the legislation, frankly, I feel much the same with regard \nto the priority this legislation should have.\n  We have attempted to deal with H.R. 10, and I have supported that \neffort. We have successfully dealt with Internet tax, and I supported \nthat. We dealt with bankruptcy, and, unfortunately, that bill will be \nvetoed in large measure because we weren't able to come to some \nsuccessful conclusion in the negotiations, but I supported that. We had \ntime for all of those measures. That our Senate colleagues do not have \nthe time or are unwilling to provide the priority to this legislation \nspeaks volumes about where their real priorities are.\n  Democrats have said over and over again there is nothing more \nimportant than this legislation, that there is nothing more important \non our agenda than passing a Patients' Bill of Rights this year.\n  We have held hearings throughout the year. We introduced our bill in \nMarch, S. 1890. We attempted over the last 9 months, through myriad \nparliamentary procedures, to be able to come to some conclusion on this \nissue. We even proposed working overtime, a second shift, to be able to \naddress a Patients' Bill of Rights in a meaningful way. We even offered \nthe bill as an amendment. We have been thwarted in every single \nscenario that has presented itself to the Senate to date.\n  Frankly, the priority that this legislation should have is probably \nas great a dividing line as there is between our Republican colleagues \nand Democratic Senators. Our Republican colleagues first urged insurers \nto ``get out their wallets'' and fight protections as though it were a \nwar.\n  In April, they voted against the sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nregarding patients' rights--a vote against access to specialists, \nagainst protection from drive-through mastectomies, against an end to \nthe practice of medicine by insurance company bureaucrats.\n  By July they had read polls and, frankly, I think they were concerned \nabout the political implications of this issue. Then they introduced a \nbill, strikingly different from ours but using exactly the same title. \nThe fact is there are now two bills entitled a Patients' Bill of \nRights--one that is real and one that is not. Their bill is filled with \nloopholes that benefit the insurance industry. And today, once again, \nthey have refused to debate the real issues and our real differences \nregarding this legislation.\n  Passage of real patient protections should have been the highest \npriority of this session of Congress. We should have ended this session \ncelebrating bipartisan cooperation on a bill of this import.\n  Instead, our colleagues have thwarted us at every turn. They have \nignored how real people get hurt. Over the past year, we have heard \nstory after story of abuses that should have been addressed.\n  We heard about a 6-month-old by the name of James Adams, who was \nburning with a 105-degree fever, and his HMO forced his parents to \ndrive to an emergency room over an hour away, even though there was a \nhospital closer by. Young James suffered cardiac arrest, and lost his \nhands and feet.\n  We also heard about forty-five-year-old Buddy Kuhl who died after his \nHMO denied and delayed heart surgery. He left a wife and two young \nchildren. We could go on with these tragedies that occur every day \noutside this chamber.\n  The tragedy within this chamber is, with all of these stories and \nmillions and millions of people abused every year, this Congress has \nignored and thwarted every effort to address the problem. There is no \nexplanation, no excuse, no way it can be explained away.\n  One-hundred and eighty different groups, as disparate as they can \nbe--from doctors and nurses organizations, to organizations \nrepresenting consumers and workers, to the American Cancer Society--\nurged the Congress, in as strong terms as they could, to do something, \nresolve this problem, address it in a comprehensive way. Don't pass a \nsham bill. Don't say you passed something and falsely raise \nexpectations. Don't talk about how serious the problem is and then not \naddress it.\n  We have lost an opportunity to address this issue. We have lost the \nopportunity to provide critical protections to those who need emergency \ncare, to those who need access to specialists, and to those who have \nongoing illnesses who recognize the abuses by HMOs and are increasingly \nfrustrated with Congress' unwillingness to deal with this issue. These \nare the people who recognize the importance of access to the \nprescription drugs a doctor prescribes as necessary. They recognize the \nimportance of access to clinical trials. They recognize that the \nprotection against retaliation for doctors and nurses who advocate for \npatients is critical. They recognize that protection from insurance \ncompanies who interfere with a doctor's best judgment is necessary.\n  With all the recognition of the problems that exist, with all that \nrealization, we had an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to \nresolve these matters. To leave the issue on the calendar, to leave \nthat work undone is indeed a tragedy.\n  I acknowledge that our prospects for passing something this year are \nnot good. But I will state as unequivocally as I can that this will \ncontinue to be an issue until it is resolved. This will continue to be \nsomething we will force on the Senate agenda in whatever way we can--as \nan amendment, moving to a motion to proceed, finding ways to reach out \nto the millions of Americans who need our help this year and who will \ncertainly need it next year.\n  We must act responsibly. We must act comprehensively. I hope we do it \nsooner rather than later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will say at the beginning that I agree \nwith Senator Daschle that this is something we should address and I \nbelieve we will address because there are some legitimate concerns and \nproblems in this area that need to be dealt with. I am very hopeful we \ncan do that next year.\n  I want to thank Senator Nickles and our task force that worked on \nthis issue. I want to thank Dr. Bill Frist, a Member of the Senate, who \nworked on this issue. I think it is great that we actually have a \ndoctor involved that understands what happens in this area.\n  I have told people, you can take your choice here of which bill is \nreally the best bill--the one proposed by the Democratic side, led by \nSenator Kennedy, or the one proposed over on the Republican side led by \nDr. Bill Frist. I think the choice is pretty clear. But thank you for \nyour work. I do believe that we are going to address this next year. I \nbelieve we will do it in, hopefully, a responsible way and, eventually, \nit can be a bipartisan bill.\n  This effort today was clearly a planned PR effort because we were \nable to accidentally come across some e-mail that indicated that this \nwas in preparation for a big hoopla down at the White House.\n  We have tried to get this issue up in a fair way--on June 18, three \ndifferent times; on July 15, twice; on June 25, and on other occasions, \nI had offered a very fair process to bring this up. The Democratic \nproposal, sponsored by Senators Daschle, Kennedy, and others, would \nhave been offered. Our alternative proposal, the Republican proposal, \nwould have been offered. We could have debated them both, with three \namendments on both sides. It\n\n[[Page S12127]]\n\ncould be small amendments or big amendments--that is up to either \nside--and we could have had the votes and been done with it, and sent \nit to conference with the House. We could have completed this in June \nor July.\n  But, no, the Democrats objected. They didn't want to have the two \nbills head to head and amendments in order because they knew what the \nresult would be. We had a good proposal; it was going to pass. By the \nway, we might actually have gotten something done.\n  They don't want this issue to pass. They want a political issue. We \ncould have done this in June or July, but they objected, saying, no, we \nmust have 20 amendments on each side. Twenty amendments; forty \namendments total--days. The whole plan was to try to find a way to have \nthe Members have to cast repeated votes on an issue that would \nobfuscate the difference between the two bills in reality.\n  So we have made an effort. We are ready to go. We would have been \nhappy to do it in June or July. We are going to be looking for a way to \ndo it next year. When the time comes, it won't be the Kennedy-Daschle \nbill. The American people don't want or need that. What we need is a \nfair bill. We need access. What we don't need is something that will \nlead to more costs and more lawsuits--hallelujah.\n  Is this about the patients and the doctors and health care, or is \nthis so my brother-in-law can file another lawsuit? I have the answer. \nThe answer is that we ought to be worrying about the patients and the \nhealth care providers in America. We have a good bill. I am proud to \nhave supported it and to have been willing to bring it up in a fair \nway. We will do it, I hope, early next year.\n  I would be glad to yield to the assistant majority leader, Senator \nNickles, who has done great work on this.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am disappointed that our colleagues on \nthe Democrat side of the aisle really have tried to play politics with \nthis issue. Many of us were very, very serious about trying to pass a \npositive bill that dealt with HMO organizations, with health care. We \nstudied the issue for a long time. Senator Daschle said after they \nrealized the polls, they introduced the bill in July. We worked 7 or 8 \nmonths trying to put a bill together that would be a responsible, \npositive bill to meet certain objectives. One, not increase the number \nof people in the uninsured category. Unfortunately, I think that would \nhave happened under the Kennedy bill. It would have dramatically \nincreased the cost of insurance and, therefore, dramatically increase \nthe number of people who are uninsured. We said, What can we do that \nwould be a positive impact on helping people have affordable health \ncare and maybe provide some coverage and protections for those people \nwho don't have it from their States, and so we put together a package \nto do that.\n  We didn't come up and say, hey, trial lawyers, what would you like? \nUnder the Democrats' bill, really, it was a bill that would greatly \nenhance attorney fees. It gave people the right not only to sue the HMO \nand the health care provider, but also the employer as well. The net \nresult is that lots of employers would have dropped plans, increased \nthe number of uninsured. That would not have helped anybody. It would \nhave been a serious mistake. We didn't want to pass legislation that \nwould increase the number of uninsured by 1 million people. That would \nhave been a mistake.\n  So we were willing to take it up. Our colleagues have said, wait a \nminute, we want to vote today. Today may be the last or second to last \nday we are going to be in session. In June or July, we offered to do \nthis. Or we tried to get it done this September where we would have a \nreasonable time limit, where we would vote and pass legislation. \nUnfortunately, I think Senator Kennedy and others didn't want to do \nthat because they didn't have the votes.\n  Their proposal didn't have the votes. It had a lot of rhetoric, but \nit didn't have the votes. They never would take yes for an answer. We \nwere willing to take up their proposal. We were willing to take up our \nproposal. We were willing to have a couple of amendments on each side. \nThey could have drafted those amendments any way they wanted to. They \ncould have addressed every issue they wanted to, and we could have \npassed legislation. We could have done it in time to go to conference \nwith the House and maybe work out a responsible and reasonable bill \nthat could be enacted into law. Unfortunately, they wouldn't take yes \nfor an answer.\n  So they played games trying to turn it into an election year issue. I \ncan see it right now. People will try to run ads--maybe in my State--\nand say, ``Nickles opposed Patients' Bill of Rights.'' But the truth \nis, we had 50 cosponsors on this side of the aisle who cosponsored a \nPatients' Bill of Rights that, in my opinion, and the belief of the \nmajority of the body, was far superior to the bill that was proffered \nby our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle. It is \nunfortunate to me that they wouldn't take yes for an answer. They \nwouldn't agree to a unanimous consent request that would have allowed \nus to pass legislation and, instead, resorted to some type of \nshenanigan where they tried to get a vote and then have the galleries \nfilled with people in the House.\n  And so, ``Oh, yes, we are really working to do this,'' when all they \nwere looking for was an election year ad not to pass real legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. President, I listened with interest to the attempts of my good \nfriends Senators Lott and Nickles to rewrite the history of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights in this Congress. No amount of rhetoric and \ndisinformation can disguise the fact that the Republicans in Congress \nhave abused the rules of the Senate to prevent passage of strong \npatient protections this year. The vote today was the latest \ninstallment payment to powerful special interests opposed to change.\n  The Republican leadership could have called the Patients' Bill of \nRights at any time for a full and fair debate. Instead, proposed a \nseries of phony ``consent'' agreements that would prevent fair debate \nand make passage of real reform impossible. These stalling tactics were \nclearly meant to run out the clock, so that managed care reforms cannot \nbe passed before Congress adjourns, and so that the Republican \nleadership can avoid responsibility for its defeat.\n  The record of Republican attempts to avoid the blame for inaction \nwould be laughable, if the consequences for patients across the country \nwere not so serious.\n  On June 18, Senator Lott proposed to bring up the bill, but on terms \nthat made a mockery of the legislative process. His proposal would have \nallowed the Senate to start considering HMO reform, but he would have \nbeen permitted to end the debate at any time. The proposal also barred \nthe Senate from considering any other health care legislation for the \nrest of the year. So if Senator Lott did not like the direction the \nbill was headed, he could kill it and tie the Senate's hands on HMO \nreform for the remainder of the year.\n  On June 23, 43 Democratic Senators wrote to Senator Lott to urge that \nhe allow a debate and votes on the merits of the Patient's Bill of \nRights. We requested that the Senate take up this issue before the \nAugust recess.\n  In response, on June 24, Senator Lott repeated his earlier \nunacceptable offer.\n  On June 25, Senator Daschle proposed an agreement in which Senator \nLott would bring up a Republican health care bill by July 6, so that \nSenator Daschle could offer the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, \nand other Senators could offer amendments on HMO reform. We would agree \nto avoid amendments on any other subject. Only amendments related to \nthe Patients Bill of Rights would be eligible for consideration. \nSenator Lott rejected this offer as well.\n  On June 26, he offered once again an agreement that allowed him to \nwithdraw the legislation at any time, and bar any further consideration \nof any health care legislation for the remainder of the year.\n  On July 15, Senator Lott made yet another offer. This time, he \nproposed an agreement that permitted only one amendment. He could bring \nup bill. We could bring up ours. And that would be it--all or nothing. \nNo votes on key issues.\n\n[[Page S12128]]\n\n  On July 29 and on September 1, the Republican leadership offered \nvariations of this proposal, with amendments restricted to three for \nDemocrats and three for Republicans.\n  Senator Daschle offered yet another reasonable approach to resolve \nthe impasse that Senator Lott had created by his efforts to prevent \nmeaningful reform. He offered to agree to let the Senate debate other \nbills during the day, and use evenings to debate the Patients' Bill of \nRights--but the Republican leadership said, ``no.''\n  Our patients' Bill of Rights was introduced in March--and a \npredecessor bill was introduced by Congressman Dingell and myself more \nthan eighteen months ago, at the beginning of this Congress.\n  Senator Daschle, in an effort to be responsive to the Republican \nLeader's ultimatum that an agreement on the terms of the debate must be \nreached before the debate can begin, has offered reasonable proposal \nafter reasonable propsal--and every one was rejected.\n  Yet the Republican leader has allowed the Senate to debate many other \nbills this year, with ample time and ample opportunity for amendments.\n  We had 7 days of debate on the budget resolution, and considered 105 \namendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Nickles.\n  We had 6 days of debate on the defense authorization bill, and \nconsidered 150 amendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Lott \nand he cosponsored 10 others. We had 8 days of debate on IRS reform and \nconsidered 13 amendments.\n  We had 17 days of debate on tobacco legislation--a bill we never \ncompleted--and considered 18 amendments.\n  We had 5 days of debate on the agriculture appropriations bill and 55 \namendments.\n  We had 19 days of debate on the highway bill, with 100 amendments.\n  The Republican leadership has allowed 5 days of debate and 24 \namendments to the bankruptcy bill.\n  They have allowed 36 amendments and 2 days of debate on the FAA bill.\n  All these bills were important, and all deserved reasonable debate \nand opportunities for amendments. They were brought up without any \nundue restrictions on debate. That is the normal way of doing business \non important pieces of legislation in the Senate.\n  The Republican leadership was willing to have an adequate opportunity \nto debate and vote on these other important measures. But when the \nissue is protecting American families instead of insurance industry \nprofits, different ground rules apply to protect the industry and deny \nthe rights of patients.\n\n  The reason the Republican leadership was unwilling to engage in a \nfair debate is obvious. Senator Lott knows his legislation is deeply \nflawed, and that it cannot possibly be fixed with just three \namendments. He believes that he and his special interest friends can \nhold most of the Republican Senators for a few votes, but he feared \nthat the would not be willing to stand before the American people on \nthe Senate floor and cast vote after vote for the special interests and \nagainst the interests of American families. The fundamental flaws in \nthe Republican bill mean greater profits for insurance companies and \nlesser care for American patients. Senator Lott does not want the \nSenate to vote to fix these flaws. He does not want a vote: on whether \nall Americans should be covered, or just one third of Americans as the \nRepublicans shamefully propose; on whether there should be genuine \naccess to emergency room care; on whether patients should have access \nto the specialists they need when they are seriously ill; on whether \ndoctors should be free to give the medical advice they deem \nappropriate, without fear of being fired by their HMO; on whether \npatients with incurable cancer or Alzheimer's disease or other serious \nillnesses should have access to quality clinical trials where \nconventional treatments offer no hope; on whether patients in the \nmiddle of a course of treatment can keep their doctor if their health \nplan drops them from its network, or their employer changes health \nplans; on whether the special health needs of the disabled, and women, \nand children should be met; on whether patients should be able to \nobtain timely independent review of plan decisions that deny care; or \non whether health plans should be held responsible in court for \ndecisions that kill or injure patients.\n  The list of flaws in the Republican bill goes on and on.\n  The Republican leadership's record on this issue is painfully clear. \nTheir cynical strategy is to protect the insurance industry at all \ncosts, by blocking any reform at all, or by passing only a minimalist \nbill so weak that it would be worse than no bill at all. And today, \nthey finally ended the charade--by moving to table a motion to bring \nthe bill passed by Republicans in the House before the Senate.\n  Last Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Republican \nCongressional Campaign Committee held a $25,000-a-person fundraiser for \na ``select group'' of health care industry executives. The heading for \nthe article was, ``Politicians seek to profit from the debate over \nhealth care policies.''\n  The American people are sick of health insurance companies that \nprofit by abusing patients. And it is equally unacceptable that \npoliticians should profit by protecting those exorbitant industry \nprofits.\n  Every family in this country knows that it will some day have to \nconfront the challenge of serious illness for a parent, or grandparent, \nor a child. When that day comes, all of us want the best possible \nmedical care for our loved ones. Members of the ?Senate deserve good \nmedical care for their loved ones--and we generally get it. Every other \nfamily is equally deserving of good quality care--but too often they do \nnot get it, because their insurance plan is more interested in profits \nthan patients.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights provides simple justice and basic \nprotection for every one of the 160 million Americans with private \ninsurance. It is supported by the American Medical Association, the \nConsortium of Citizens with Disabilities, the American Cancer Society, \nthe American Heart Association, the National Alliance for the Mentally \nIll, the National Partnership for Women and Families, the National \nAssociation of Children's Hospitals, the AFL-CIO, and many other groups \nrepresenting physicians and other health care providers, children, \nwomen, families, consumers, persons with disabilities, Americans with \nserious illnesses, small businesses, and working families.\n  It is rare for such a broad and diverse coalition to come together in \nsupport of legislation. Both they have done so to end these flagrant \nabuses that hurt so many families.\n  We serve notice today that this struggle is not over. The Republicans \nin Congress and their friends in the insurance industry may have won \nthis year's battle, but they will lose in the end.\n  Democrats in Congress intend to make the Patients' Bill of Rights the \nfirst order of business when the new Congress convenes next January. We \nwill continue to fight for meaningful patient protections until they \nare signed into law. We will not give up this struggle until every \nfamily can be confident that a child or parent or grandparent who is \nill will receive the best care that American medicine can provide.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I know \nthere is a lot of interest in trying to determine what the schedule \nwill be for the balance of the day and perhaps even the weekend.\n  It is obvious because of the feelings of the Senator from Nevada, \nSenator Reid, with regard to the Treasury and Postal Service \nappropriations conference report, that he does not intend to allow the \nSenate to have a vote on the conference report itself anytime soon.\n  Therefore, as we approach the end of this session, we will probably \nhave a vote, if we can get some accommodation here--I think we may--\nwithin a couple of hours, on or in relation to the bankruptcy bill. So \nwe should expect another recorded vote in about 2 hours. We will need, \nhopefully, to get that locked in here in the next few minutes. The main \npoint is we will have one more vote.\n  Then, other than unanimous consent requests or voice votes, the only \nvotes we would expect for the balance of this year would be on a \ncontinuing resolution, if necessary, and the omnibus appropriations \nbill.\n  Now, I will need to confer further with Senator Daschle. We will \ncertainly keep Members informed as to what the schedule may be. \nNegotiations are continuing with regard to all of the different issues \nthat are pending on the omnibus appropriations bill. We expect to work \nthis weekend. We hope we will have this completed to possibly vote on \nMonday. If that is not possible, we will let Members know as soon as \nsome determination is made. For now, we will expect a vote in a couple \nof hours, and then we would go to the vote on the bankruptcy bill. That \nwould be it as far as recorded votes for tonight.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the majority leader will yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have been getting questions about what \nour intentions are with regard to a new CR. My understanding is that we \nwould be contemplating a CR that would take us at least through Monday.\n  Mr. LOTT. That's correct. We have discussed that with administration \nofficials this morning. They indicated that they understood it was just \na physical problem in terms of getting final agreements and getting \npaperwork ready, and a short-term CR would be no problem from their \nviewpoint. I discussed that with you. We anticipate a CR that would \ntake us until Monday at midnight. So there would be no question that we \nare still working, and there is no threat of a Government shutdown, \nwhile we continue to count on our appropriators to do their work, and \nwe hope to get it completed this weekend.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I tell my friend from Mississippi, we have \non the calendar 22 Federal judges pending, plus another 5 or 6 court of \nclaims. Can the distinguished leader give us any advice on what might \nhappen?\n  Mr. LOTT. I have been working diligently to get some of the more \ncontroversial judges done. We did have a couple votes. I was trying to \nget Paez done today. The time is going to be consumed by reading the \nTreasury/Postal Service conference report and now the appearance of \nhaving to read the Bankruptcy Reform conference report. So that has \nbeen pushed aside. I tried to move three nominations last night. It was \nobjected to. We are in the usual last days of the session where \neverybody is holding this one on the basis of that one. I think where \nwe are is, over the next few days as we make progress, if we can get \nagreements on some things, then we will probably get agreements on all \nthings. They are all interrelated. We will have to see how that plays \nout.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am prepared to pray and consult with the distinguished \nleader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate that attitude of the Senator from Vermont. He \nhas been very helpful, and he continues to remind me of the need for \nthese judges.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the leader yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12132-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12132-S12133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BIRTHDAY WISHES FOR SENATOR LOTT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on behalf of all of us here on the floor \nand all colleagues here in the Senate, we know this is a stressful day. \nIt should actually be a joyful day for Senator Lott. It is his birthday \nand we wish him a happy birthday.\n  [Applause.]\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you all very much. It is a joyful day. I resented \nwhen Senator Daschle came over and told me he was only about 50, \nreminding me of his youth. Then Senator Strom Thurmond welcomed me into \nhis range of age. I don't know quite what that meant. Actually, in \nspite of all the things we have working, it has been a great day. \nActually, I enjoy every day here and I appreciate the friendship of all \nof you on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, not to be the skunk at the lawn party, \nbut that reminds me of a story I feel like I have to share with you. \nRecently, in the caucus, Senator Daschle announced the birthdays of \nthree Senators that would occur in the ensuing week. He named them, and \nJohn Glenn was one of them, and I forget the other two. Barbara \nMikulski was one. Everybody applauded, and I turned to Senator \nTorricelli and said, ``Isn't it strange that we applaud birthdays in \nthis country?'' He said, ``It is an American anachronism that we \napplaud the march toward death.''\n  Mr. LOTT. Was that supposed to be humorous?\n  Mr. DODD. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Dodd for a question.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. Leader, I don't want to disrupt your birthday, but I \nhave a unanimous-consent request I want to make at an appropriate time, \nwhich I suspect the majority will object to. I want to be able to do it \nbefore we move on to the next order of business. I don't know the plan \nhere.\n  Mr. LOTT. If we could complete comments on this, and then you will \nhave an opportunity to do that. You have put me on notice, but let us \ntry to do this.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the leader yield to me?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am delighted to yield to Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was listening to the debate going on on \nthe\n\n[[Page S12133]]\n\nfloor and I heard that it was someone's birthday. For those in the \ngalleries who wish to make note of it, I am 29,544 days old today. It \nis not my birthday, but I am 29,544 days old. I want to congratulate \nour leader on his birthday.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, sir.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I say to the leader:\n     Count your garden by the flowers,\n     Never by the leaves that fall;\n     Count your days by the sunny hours,\n     Not remembering clouds at all.\n     Count your nights by stars, not shadows;\n     Count your life by smiles, not tears;\n     And on this beautiful [October] afternoon, [leader,]\n     Count your age by friends, not years.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much.\n  [Applause.]\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, only the distinguished Senator Byrd would be \nable to come to the floor and have poetry that he could quote on the \nspur of the moment. I always enjoy his remarks so much. Thank you, \nSenator Byrd.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12132-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12133-S12137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes at this time to the \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Campbell. I thank him for his \nwork on this bill. He has worked very hard. The problems we have were \nnot caused by him, but by difficulties in the House of Representatives. \nI thank the Senator for the effort that he put into this legislation. \nWe will get it done before the day is done--maybe not this day, but \nbefore the day is done.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the majority leader. Whether this bill is \npulled down or proceeds is yet to be determined. I would like to make a \nfew comments about the bill. Senator Kohl and I, as well as our staffs, \nworked very hard on this bill. It seemed like the longer it hung out \nthere the more lightning it drew. I want comment on a few provisions in \nit.\n  This report provides funding for the Department of Treasury, the U.S. \nPostal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and various \nindependent agencies, as our colleagues know.\n  Although this has not been an easy bill to complete, because of the \nfunding constraints as well as controversial issues, I think we did as \ngood a job as we could, accommodating as many requests as we could from \nour colleagues. The most difficult issues for the conferees were not \nabout money, but about legislative riders to this appropriations bill. \nThere were some very strong opinions on both sides on these riders and \nthat did end up stalling the bill.\n  But I am concerned about one article. As I mentioned, during the heat \nof the debate, there were some strong opinions. I was concerned about \nan article appearing in the October 7 Hill that implied the Senator \nfrom Texas, Senator Hutchison, was blocking the bill because it \ncontained language to name a post office building in St. Paul for \nformer Senator Eugene McCarthy. For the Record, I want to say that is \nabsolutely not true. At no time, did she ever disagree with this bill, \nand in fact that language is in the bill. I wanted to make that part of \nthe Record.\n  The ranking member of our subcommittee, Senator Kohl, and I continued \nto place greater emphasis on treasury law enforcement, which is a \ncentral focus of this bill, and tried to ensure that agents and \ninspectors have the tools to do their job. I certainly appreciate \nSenator Kohl's support and hard work.\n  There is much in this conference report that deserves the support of \nthe Senate:\n  $128 million for the IRS customer service initiative, and to \nrestructure and reform their long overdue operation.\n  $2 million for low-income taxpayers clinic.\n  $2.4 million to double the staffing for the cyber-smuggling unit at \nthe Customs Service to stop child pornography, plus an additional $1 \nmillion for technology to assist in this effort.\n  $13 million for grants to state and local law enforcement for gang \nresistance education and training programs, called GREAT programs--$3 \nmillion more than the President actually had requested.\n  $6 million to allow eligible State and local law enforcement to \nacquire ballistics identification and comparison computer systems for \nboth bullets and cartridge cases.\n  There is another $27 million to continue and expand the Youth Crime \nGun Interdiction Initiative to help stop gun trafficking to our youth.\n  There is $182 million for the high-intensity drug trafficking areas, \nknown as HIDTAs, and $13 million to continue the program to transfer \ntechnology to State and local law enforcement.\n  Courthouse construction projects, as well as repair and alterations \nof current Federal facilities, were also included.\n  There is $185 million for a second year of a very successful antidrug \nyouth media campaign that was administered by the drug czar.\n  All in all, Mr. President, I think it is a good bill. We worked very \nhard.\n  I am just here to say I am sorry that some of these rather divisive \nriders that ended up being on the bill ended up making it so \ncontroversial. But the underlying fact of the bill, the mission of the \nbill, has great intentions. It is a good bill.\n  I just wanted to again thank Senator Kohl for all of his work on it. \nI hope we proceed forward with it. I am realistic enough to know that \nit is in trouble.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I agree with much of what my colleague, \nSenator Campbell, has said about this bill.\n  It is a good bill. It provides sufficient appropriations for the \nDepartment of the Treasury and the independent agencies. But, since \nthis bill left the Senate floor, it changed in ways that made it \nimpossible for me to sign the conference report.\n  First, the good news. The conference report before us is silent on \nthe issue of staffing the Federal Election Commission. I am very \npleased we have decided to avoid a partisan battle on this issue.\n  Unfortunately, several other changes to the bill were made after the \nconference--and these make the bill much worse.\n  First, the Senate bill contained a provision that would have provided \nfor the adjustment of the status of Haitians. This provision, which had \nbipartisan Senate support, would allow 40,000 Haitian refugees who have \nbeen in this country since 1995, to stay permanently. Last year \nCongress provided this same type of correction for 150,000 Nicaraguans \nand 5,000 Cubans. The conference report before us drops that \nprovision--despite the fact that it was agreed to by all conferees.\n  Second, the Senate bill contained a provision that would address the \nrequirements of providing quality child care in Federal facilities. \nThis measure, proposed by Senator Jeffords, would simply make sure that \nFederal child care facilities operate under reasonable quality \nstandards. In addition, it would bring under Federal regulation the \nchild care centers run by Congress--child care centers that operate now \ncompletely unregulated by local, state, or Federal law.\n  The conference report before us drops this provision--which until now \nwas uncontroversial. I find it unacceptable that Congress would use the \nlast minute legislative rush to exempt itself from basic health and \nsafety standards for the children in its care.\n  And, third, this conference report drops language--adopted by a \nbipartisan majority in both Houses--that would provide Federal \nemployees with health insurance coverage for contraception. Again it is \nunacceptable that an extreme minority should be able to prevail on \nthis. Close to half of all pregnancies in the United States are \nunintended, and tragically, those unintended pregnancies often led to \nabortion. By providing federal workers with the most appropriate and \nsafe means of contraception, we can reduce the number of abortions \nperformed and increase the number of children who are born wanted, \nplanned for, and loved.\n  We in the Senate made good decisions when we passed the Treasury-\nGeneral Government appropriations bill. It is disappointing that so \nmany of those decisions have been overturned in last minute, partisan \nnegotiations.\n  The White House has promised that they will work with us to get the \nHaitian fairness, child care and contraception provisions included in \nthe omnibus\n\n[[Page S12134]]\n\nfunding bill. Based on that assurance, and knowing of the many other \nstrong provisions retained in the conference report, I will vote for \npassage. But I do so with great disappointment at how this bill has \nbeen altered in the last few days and great hope that the democratic \ndecisions overturned will be restored in the final omnibus \nappropriations measure.\n  One last note, I want to thank the staff members who have worked so \ntirelessly to bring this bill to the floor. Pat Raymond and Tammy \nPerrin of Senator Campbell's staff have always been helpful and \nprofessional in their dealings with us--their demeanor has allowed us \nto put this bill together in a truly bipartisan way. Paul Bock, my \nchief of staff, approached this bill as he does everything: with \nintelligence and a healthy sense of humor. And my deepest gratitude is \nfor my clerk, Barbara Retzlaff, who has boundless energy, complete \nmastery of the programs she monitors, and incredible patience--with me \nand with this year's torturous negotiations. Thank you all.\n\n\n               public access to government research data\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank the \nSenator from Alabama and the Chairman of the Treasury and General \nGovernment Appropriations Subcommittee for their diligent efforts to \ndevelop legislation that will provide the public with access to \nfederally funded research data. The Conference Report for the Treasury \nand General Government Appropriations Act for FY 99 currently before us \nrequires the Director of OMB to amend OMB Circular A-110 to require \nFederal awarding agencies to ensure that all research results, \nincluding underlying research data, funded by the Federal government \nare made available to the public through the procedures established \nunder the Freedom of Information Act. This provision represents a \ncritical step forward in assuring that the public has access to the \nresearch and underlying data used by the Federal government in \ndeveloping policy and rules.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Majority Leader and my colleague from \nAlabama for his leadership on this issue. The gentleman is correct. The \nlanguage included in the Conference Report will require Federal \nagencies to make all Federally funded research data available to the \npublic through procedures established by the Freedom of Information \nAct. The Conferees recognize that this language covers research data \nnot currently covered by the Freedom of Information Act. The provision \napplies to all Federally funded research data regardless of whether the \nawarding agency has the data at the time the request is made. If the \nawarding agency must obtain the data from the recipient of the award, \nthe provision specifically states that the awarding agency may \nauthorize a reasonable user fee equaling the incremental cost of \nobtaining the data. It is my expectation that the Director of OMB to \nmake the required changes within 90 days of enactment and that awarding \nagencies to issue new regulations implementing the amended Circular \nwithin one year of enactment. As is true with the existing OMB Circular \nA-110, the amended Circular shall apply to all Federally funded \nresearch, regardless of the level of funding or whether the award \nrecipient is also using non-Federal funds. I want to thank my colleague \nfrom Alabama for his leadership on this important issue and his efforts \nto safeguard the public's right to know.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Majority Leader and Chairman Campbell for \ntheir support. The lack of public access to research data feeds general \npublic mistrust of the government and undermines support for major \nregulatory programs. This measure was long overdue and it represents a \nfirst step in ensuring that the public has access to all studies used \nby the Federal government to develop Federal policy.\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to note my \ndisappointment that the permanent relief for Haitian refugees that I \nand many others in this body have worked to make law has been dropped \nfrom the Treasury Appropriations Conference Report.\n  This effort began last year during debate of the D.C. Appropriations \nbill, which included language that granted certain Central Americans \naccess to the ``suspension of deportation'' procedure, but Haitians \nwere not granted this access. And you may recall that while I supported \ngranting relief to the affected class of Central Americans, I, along \nwith several of my colleagues here in the Senate and the House, fought \nvigorously for additional provisions for Haitian refugees.\n  Although we were unsuccessful in that effort, we later introduced S. \n1504, Haitian Immigrations Fairness Act of 1997, legislation that would \nprovide Haitian refugees permanent residency status. During the course \nof this year, this legislation was reported favorably out of the \nJudiciary committee and passed by the Senate as a provision of the \nTreasury-Postal Appropriations Fiscal Year 1999 bill. Eventually, this \nlanguage was agreed to by the Conferees on the Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations bill. Unfortunately, due to last-minute, close-door \nmaneuvering and negotiations, there is no Haitian relief included in \nthe Conference Report that we are voting on today.\n  This legislation is vitally important to the several thousand Haitian \nmen, women, and children who came here in the wake of the military coup \nin Haiti that in 1991 toppled the democratically elected government of \nthat country. That coup was followed by a period of military \ndictatorship in Haiti marked by atrocious human rights abuses, \nincluding systematic use of rape and murder as weapons of terror. The \nInternational Civilian Mission, which has monitored human rights \nconditions throughout Haiti, documented this tragedy, including horrors \nso awful as to be almost imaginable.\n  To allow such human rights violations to occur so close to home while \ndoing nothing would have been inconsistent with the stated goals of our \nforeign policy. So in 1991, the U.S. took in persons fleeing Haiti at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba. After intense screening, many of these \nindividuals were paroled into the U.S. to apply affirmatively for \nasylum. Between the 1991 and May of 1992, over 30,000 Haitians were \ninterviewed. Under one-third of these individuals were paroled into the \nU.S. to seek asylum.\n  Around Memorial day in 1992, Bush issued the ``Kennebunkport Order,'' \nending the asylum screening process at Guantanamo Bay, an action which \nbecame an issue during the 1992 presidential elections. A refugee \nprogram began operating in Port-au-Prince. This practice continued \nuntil 1994, when President Clinton reinstated a screening process in \nmilitary hospital ship in Kingston Harbor, Jamaica. Democracy was \nrestored in Haiti in the fall of 1994.\n  The individuals that I am talking about today are the children, \nwives, brothers, and sisters of soldiers and activists who stood up for \ndemocracy in Haiti. They fled to this country for refuge. They played \nby our rules. In the time that they've been here, they've built homes, \npaid taxes, had families in our country. These individuals are owed \nnothing less than treatment equal to that already provided to the \nEastern European and Central European refugees residing in our Nation.\n  I regret that the Conferees decided at the last moment to strip the \nHaitian refugee relief provision from the Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations bill, but I would like to urge Senators Lott and Daschle \nto consider adding this provision to any omnibus appropriations \nmeasures that may be considered in the upcoming days.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill \nfor their hard work in putting forth this legislation which provides \nfederal funding for numerous vital programs. However, I am sad to say, \nonce again, I find myself in the unpleasant position of speaking before \nmy colleagues about unacceptable levels of parochial projects in \nanother appropriations Conference Report.\n  Earlier this year, I came to the Senate floor and highlighted the \nnumerous earmarks and set asides contained in the Senate version of \nthis bill. That bill contained $826 million in specifically earmarked \npork-barrel spending. That was a $791 million increase over last year's \npork-barrel spending total for this bill, which only contained $34.25 \nmillion in wasted funds.\n  While the Senate bill contained an unacceptable amount of pork, this \nconference report is even worse. It contains $1.5 billion in specially \nearmarked pork barrel spending. This is almost double the amount of \npork\n\n[[Page S12135]]\n\nwhich was in the bill. This is a tremendous burden which is patently \nunfair to the millions hard-working American taxpayers, who does not \npossess the resources to get a ``pet project'' placed in their back \nyard.\n  The list of projects which received priority billing is quite long \nand the dollar amounts are staggering. Nevertheless, I will highlight a \nfew of the more egregious violations.\n  First the conference report instructs the Administrator of General \nServices to purchase a property adjacent to the new courthouse \ncurrently under construction in Scranton, PA, at whatever price she/he \ndetermines is appropriate. The language then provides $668 million for \nrepairs, alterations, and construction services. That adds $668 million \nto the price of acquiring the building. I am not an expert on court \nhouse construction, but $668 million in addition to the purchase price \nseems like a lot of money for a courthouse.\n  But, the unbridled spending does not stop with the Scranton, PA court \nhouse, it continues. The conference report also contains numerous \nprovisions for millions of dollars to construct new court houses in \nspecific locations throughout the U.S. Again, why are these particular \nsites so deserving of funding, that they receive specific earmarks to \nfund their construction? Unfortunately, this spending frenzy is not \nlimited to court houses. Somebody in either the House of \nRepresentatives, or the Senate has concluded that the World Trade \nOffice in Vermont ($500,000), and the IRS Service Center in Brookhaven, \nNY ($20 million) are so unique that they should receive specific \nearmarks.\n  These are just a few examples of the spending excesses in this \nreport. The list goes on, and on. Mr. President, why are we spending so \nmuch on locality specific pork barrel projects? Why are we spending so \nmuch on new court house construction? Maybe if we used some of the new \ncourt house construction money to combat teen drug use, we would not \nneed to construct so many new court houses. Maybe, we should redirect \nsome of this court house construction money to combating overall drug \nuse, putting more police on our streets, or funding crime prevention \nprograms to prevent people from ever becoming involved in the criminal \njustice system.\n  Mr. President, I will not deliberate much longer on the objectionable \nprovisions in the conference report. I simply ask my colleagues to \napply fair and reasonable spending principles when appropriating funds \nto the multitude of priority and necessary programs in our \nappropriations bills.\n  As I have said many times in the past, we must remain committed to \nopen and fair consideration of public expenditures. Our objective must \nalways be to further the greatest public good. This must remain the \ncornerstone of the appropriations process. And, most important, we must \nremember, responsible spending is the cornerstone of good governance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise because the Treasury-Postal \nconferees have bypassed the will of the majority and decided to kill \nthe contraceptive coverage language in the Treasury/Postal bill.\n  This is an outrage. Our contraceptive language was included in the \noriginal legislation passed both in the House and in the Senate, and \nconferees last week signed off on including the House language in the \nbill. At the same time, conferees agreed to include the Senate's \nprovision specifically excluding coverage of abortion or abortion-\nrelated service, and conferees signed the report, closed out the \nconference and sent the report to the House for consideration.\n  The language the House of Representatives passed by a vote of 224 to \n198 on July 15, 1998. The Senate language was agreed to by unanimous \nconsent.\n  It isn't very complicated language. If you take the time to read the \ntwo versions, you will see that their intent is the same. The main \ndifference in the two versions is the conscience clause in the Senate \nbill.\n  In addition to listing the five plans that OPM identifies as being \nreligious-based, it goes a step further by providing a waiver to future \nor existing plans that have reason to oppose contraceptive coverage \nbecause of their religious beliefs. Also the Senate language clarifies \nthat this provision is not intended to cover abortion--and again I \nwould note that this provision was in the conference report when it was \nsigned the first time.\n  So last week the conferees accept the language and this week it \nbecomes a ``killer provision'' that would keep us from passing the \nTreasury/Postal appropriations bill. Mr. President that fallacious \nargument is belied by the fact that not one person--not one of the 435 \nmembers of the United States House of Representatives--stood up on the \nHouse floor when the rule on Treasury-Postal was debated last Thursday \nnight and cited this provision as a reason for opposing the bill. Not \none!\n  Why is this a ``killer amendment''?\n  It can't be because of the cost. CBO won't even score the bill, \nbecause they don't score legislation that costs less than a million \ndollars. And they put the price tag on this language at $500,000.\n  It can't be about the rights of religious plans, because this \nlanguage protects the health care plans that OPM identifies as being \nreligious-based.\n  It can't be about abortion, because it does not cover abortion in any \nway, shape or form and it says so.\n  So, why is it a ``killer amendment'', Mr. President? The answer to \nthat question will remain a mystery, as it is opposed by a few people \nin a backroom at the expense of 1.2 million American women who are \nbeing denied affordable access to a basic health care need--\ncontraception. These opponents lurk in the shadows, unwilling to come \nout in the daylight and discuss their opposition--and apparently these \nfew make the decisions and they decided on their own that it was coming \nout. They have made a mockery of the democratic process.\n  Let's consider the language the House and Senate agreed to. It is \nvery simple--all this language will do is provide women who work for \nthe federal government and the spouses and daughters of federal \nemployees equality in health care and the affordable access to \nprescription contraception coverage they need and deserve; and it will \nhelp reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in this \ncountry.\n  The provision we are talking about requires plans that participate in \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) that provide \nprescription drug coverage to also cover prescription contraceptives. \nWhat exactly is wrong with that? Nothing, according to 224 members of \nthe United States House of Representatives.\n  Today 81 percent of these plans do not cover all five of the most \nbasic and widely used methods of contraception and 10 percent of these \nplans do not cover any type of contraception at all. Yet all but one of \nthe more than 300 FEHBP plans covers sterilization. Think about that \nfor a moment--we are willing to cover sterilization but not \ncontraceptives. Unbelievable!\n  Today, the victory may go to those who have lurked in the shadows, \nbut I have something to say to those few. Do not let yourselves believe \nthat you have had the final word on this issue because the women of \nAmerica will not `go quietly into that good night' on an issue as basic \nto their health and well being and that of their family as \ncontraceptive coverage.\n  It took us 72 years to get the vote and it wasn't until 1978--only 20 \nyears ago--that Congress finally passed legislation requiring health \ncare plans to cover maternity leave. This is not an issue that will go \naway, Mr. President. You can rest assured that we will be back next \nyear, and the year after that and as many votes and debates as it takes \nuntil we win.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 4104, the \nConference Agreement on the Treasury and General Government \nAppropriations Bill for FY 1999.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $26.9 billion and new \noutlays of $23.2 billion to finance the operations of the Department of \nthe Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Customs \nService, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the \nFinancial Management Service. The bill also finances the Executive \nOffice of the President, the Office of Personnel Management, the \nGeneral Services Administration, and other agencies that perform \ncentral government functions.\n\n[[Page S12136]]\n\n  I congratulate the Chairman and Ranking Member for producing a bill \nthat is within the Subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation. I also \ncommend the Chairman's strong commitment to law enforcement throughout \nthis bill, including support for the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter.\n  When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into \naccount, the bill totals $26.9 billion in BA and $26.0 billion in \noutlays. The total bill is at the Senate subcommittee's revised 302(b) \nallocation for nondefense discretionary budget authority and outlays. \nThe subcommittee is also at its Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund \nallocation for BA and outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \na table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the Conference \nAgreement on H.R. 4104. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            H.R. 4104, TREASURY-POSTAL APPROPRIATIONS, 1999--SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                   [Fiscal year 1999; in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Defense     Nondefense     Crime      Mandatory      Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       13,311          132       13,439       26,882\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       12,429          129       13,439       25,997\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       13,311          132       13,439       26,882\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       12,429          129       13,439       25,997\n1998 level:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       12,649          131       12,713       25,493\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       12,460          123       12,712       25,295\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       13,495          132       13,439       27,066\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       13,174           86       13,439       26,699\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       13,209          132       13,439       26,780\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       12,428          129       13,439       25,996\nSenate-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       13,211          132       13,439       26,782\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       12,068          125       13,439       25,632\nConference Report compared to:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:\n        Budget authority.......................  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........\n        Outlays................................  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........\n    1998 level:\n        Budget authority.......................  ...........          662            1          726        1,389\n        Outlays................................  ...........          -31            6          727          702\n    President's request:\n        Budget authority.......................  ...........         -184  ...........  ...........         -184\n        Outlays................................  ...........         -745           43  ...........         -702\n    House-passed bill:\n        Budget authority.......................  ...........          102  ...........  ...........          102\n        Outlays................................  ...........            1  ...........  ...........            1\n    Senate-passed bill:\n        Budget authority.......................  ...........          100  ...........  ...........          100\n        Outlays................................  ...........          361            4  ...........          365\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nthat a provision in the fiscal year 1999 Treasury, Postal \nAppropriations Bill relating to contraceptive coverage under the \nFederal Employee Health Benefits program was dropped in conference.\n  This provision, authored by Senators Harry Reid and Olympia Snowe, \nwould have required the Federal Employee Health Benefits plans that \ncover prescription drugs to treat contraceptives in the same fashion as \nall other covered drugs. This amendment passed the Senate unanimously. \nA similar provision, offered by Representative Nita Lowey, was approved \nby the House by a vote of 224-198. However, even after the strong, \nbipartisan show of support by both bodies, this provision was still \ndropped in conference.\n  I was a cosponsor of the bipartisan legislation on which this \nprovision was based. Along with a bipartisan group of 25 of my \ncolleagues, I wrote the conferees on this bill asking them to retain \nthis provision in the conference report.\n  I'd like to think we've come a long way since the early 1960s when \nbirth control was illegal in many states. So it was astonishing to me \nto learn that in this day and age, many families find their \ncontraceptive choices to be limited by their insurers--because insurers \nare not required to cover prescriptive contraceptives.\n  In Connecticut, for example, 62% of insurers don't cover birth \ncontrol pills and 85% don't cover devices such as IUDs and diaphragms. \nAt the same time, almost all of these policies cover sterilization. And \nof the 68,000 pregnancies each year in our state, more than 14,000 are \nunplanned.\n  Under far too many health plans, women are offered the unconscionable \n``choice'' of getting help in paying for an unplanned pregnancy, an \nabortion, or sterilization--but not for birth control.\n  Is this the best choice we can offer to families trying to act \nresponsibly, wanting to bring children into the world when they can be \nsupported and cared for?\n  Many of us agree that contraception, and improved access to \ncontraception, is a simple, cost-effective way to lower the staggering \nrate of unintended pregnancies in the United States.\n  I am very disappointed that this provision has been dropped from the \nfiscal year 1999 Treasury, Postal Appropriations Bill and the federal \ngovernment lost an opportunity to be a leader on this critical issue.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that we passed a regulatory \naccounting provision in the Treasury and General Government \nAppropriations bill. I appreciate that the conferees retained the \nprovision I introduced to the Senate bill. I believe that this \nlegislation will help promote the public's right to know about the \nbenefits and costs of regulatory programs; to increase the \naccountability of government to the people it serves; and ultimately, \nto improve the quality of our government. This amendment aims to \nprovide better information on the performance of regulatory programs. \nThis information should help us assess what benefits our regulatory \nsystem is delivering, at what costs, and help us understand what need \nto do to improve it.\n  The American people deserve better results from the vast time and \nresources spent on regulation--$700 billion per year, or $7,000 for the \naverage American household by some estimates. By regulating smarter, we \ncould have a cleaner environment, safer workplaces, quality products, \nand a higher standard of living at the same time. As the Office of \nManagement and Budget stated in its first Report to Congress on the \nCosts and Benefits of Federal Regulations in 1997:\n\n       [R]egulations (like other instruments of government policy) \n     have enormous potential for both good and harm. . . . The \n     only way we know how to distinguish between the regulations \n     that do good and those that cause harm is through careful \n     assessment and evaluation of their benefits and costs. Such \n     analysis can also often be used to redesign harmful \n     regulations so they produce more good than harm and redesign \n     good regulations so they produce even more net benefits.\n\n  I am pleased that there is broad support for this amendment, \nparticularly\n\n[[Page S12137]]\n\nfrom Majority Leader Lott and Senators Breaux, Robb, and Shelby, who \ncosponsored it. There is a broad bipartisan coalition in the House that \nsupported this provision. And it continues the efforts of my \nprecedessors. Senator Ted Stevens first passed a regulatory accounting \namendment in 1996 when he was the Chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Regulatory accounting also was a part of a regulatory reform \nbill that unanimously passed out of committee in 1995 when Bill Roth \nchaired Governmental Affairs.\n  I added several new requirements to the Stevens amendment to improve \nthe credibility and usefulness of the report. First, OMB is required to \narrange for peer review of its draft report and draft guidelines. The \npeer review must be conducted by an organization independent and \nexternal from the government, with expertise in regulatory analysis and \nregulatory accounting. It is critical that the peer review be performed \nby experts who will critique the draft based on the state of the art--\nnot by a partisan interest group. Last year, the American Enterprise \nInstitute and the Brookings Institution sponsored a conference on OMB's \nfirst regulatory accounting report. A distinguished group of \nindependent economists unanimously agreed that OMB had fallen short in \nmany respects. That is the kind of constructive peer review we need.\n  Second, OMB must take a more active role in ensuring the quality and \ncredibility of information used in the report. OMB must issue \nguidelines to the agencies to standardize plausible measures of costs \nand benefits and the format of regulatory accounting statements. Third, \nOMB must provide more detailed information on the incremental costs and \nbenefits of regulation, broken down by agency and by agency program. \nThus far, OMB has failed to provide that information, despite repeated \nstatements in legislative history and in correspondence to OMB. A great \ndeal more information on the incremental costs and benefits of agency \nprograms can be assembled by OMB, especially for programs run by big \nagencies such as EPA, DOT, OSHA, FDA and the Department of Labor. \nFourth, OMB must count the paperwork burden. A 1995 report of the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration, entitled The Changing Burden of \nRegulation, Paperwork, and Tax Compliance, estimated the process costs \nof regulation at $229 billion for 1998. Clearly, this must be accounted \nfor. Finally, OMB must assess the direct and indirect impact of Federal \nregulation on small business; State, local and tribal government; \nwages; and economic growth. This provision addresses several important \nconcerns. Regulation can have a disparate impact on small businesses. \nThe 1995 SBA report found that, for companies with under 20 workers, \nregulation costs $5,500 per worker each year--far higher than the per \nworker cost for large companies. Many regulations also impose unfunded \nmandates on State, local and tribal government. Unfunded mandates are \nputting a severe strain on these governments, forcing them to raise \ntaxes, reduce essential services, or even face bankruptcy. Finally, the \npublic has a right to know that there is no free lunch. Regulation can \nreduce productivity, wages and economic growth. In the end, the public \npays for regulatory programs through higher prices and taxes, reduced \ngovernment services, and squandered opportunities to do better.\n  It is time for the Government to come to grips with the good, the \nbad, and the ugly about regulation so we can design a smarter, more \ncost-effective regulatory process.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just want to inquire. I see the majority \nleader.\n  Before we go to the reading of the bill, I had mentioned to the \nmajority leader earlier that I was going to propound a unanimous \nconsent request on behalf of myself and Senator Reid of Nevada.\n  Very briefly--I will just take 30 seconds--this unanimous consent \nrequest will be the discharge of the Finance Committee and then to \nproceed immediately to a piece of legislation I introduced that would \npropose a moratorium on HMOs terminating any of their patients between \nnow and over the next 4 or 5 months while we are out of session.\n  I realize that there will be objection probably filed to this, or \nexpressed on this.\n  We have seen 400,000 people in the last number of months who have \nlost their HMOs--12,000 in my State over the last 3 weeks. When we are \nout of session, I am concerned that more of these people are going to \nbe dropped.\n  So for those reasons, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nFinance Committee, on behalf of myself and Senator Reid, be discharged \nfrom consideration of S. 2562 and the Senate then proceed to its \nimmediate consideration.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I appreciate \nthe notification that the Senator was going to make this request.\n  We have not had a chance to look at this legislation. I know there is \ninterest in this area. I think next year we are going to have to do \nsome work on it, and maybe we will even have some legislation in this \narea. But in view of the hour and the fact that we haven't had a chance \nreally to review it, and the committee hasn't had a chance to act on \nit, I object at this time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, very briefly, I will not take the \ntime now, but before we adjourn, I would like to make some additional \ncomments on this.\n  My State and 21 other States are adversely affected. But I can only \nhope that there will not be more people asked to leave or pull out of \nthese markets and cause the kind of disruption that these people feel.\n  I will reserve time later to discuss it. But I thank the majority \nleader for his consideration and regret deeply that we cannot bring \nthis bill up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nbefore the 105th Congress adjourns to honor our distinguished colleague \nand my friend, Dan Coats, who will be returning to private life at the \nend of this Congress.\n\n[[Page S12138]]\n\n  For the past 10 years it has been my privilege to join with Senator \nCoats in serving the people of Indiana. During that time, he has \nepitomized strong character and devotion to public service.\n  Senator Coats has been a determined advocate for his point of view, \nbut also a good listener who has often forged compromises that \nbenefited our Nation. He has been a work horse able to shoulder the \ndaily burdens of a thousand details, but also a thoughtful observer who \nsees beyond the politics of the moment to provide perspective on the \ndirection of our country. And he has been an effective defender of the \ninterests of Indiana, while always upholding his national \nresponsibilities.\n  Dan Coats has applied his expertise and commitment to many of the \nmost critical areas of public policy. He has become one of our foremost \nadvocates for protecting America's children and strengthening American \nfamilies. His knowledge of military issues and his leadership on the \nArmed Forces Committee will be difficult to replace.\n  Of particular note is his Project for American Renewal, because it \nspeaks to both Dan's personal convictions and his legislative \ninnovation. With this project--a set of 19 legislative proposals--he \nhas succeeded in articulating a coherent philosophy of compassionate \nconservatism.\n  Senator Coats understands that the limits of government do not limit \nour responsibilities to each other as citizens of a great nation. His \nproject promotes volunteerism, charitable giving, personal \nresponsibility, and the cohesiveness of communities. His proposal \nembodies both Senator Coat's insightful reading of modern American \nsocial conditions and his optimism for our future. I know that Senator \nCoats will continue to be an eloquent spokesman for the Project for \nAmerican Renewal as he returns to private life.\n  I am especially sad to see Senator Coats leave because he has been an \noutstanding partner. Ever since he arrived in the Senate in 1989, he \nand I have operated a unique joint office arrangement in Indiana \ndesigned to maximize our efforts on behalf of Hoosiers. By combining \nour resources, we have been able to provide better service at less \nexpense to the citizens of Indiana.\n  Many Senate colleagues over the years have been surprised when they \nlearn that we share office space and staffs in Indiana. They understand \nthe daunting challenges of combining the staffs of two independent-\nminded Senators with distinct responsibilities and committee \nassignments. But our Hoosier partnership has been strong and \nsupportive, for which I am deeply appreciative.\n  Senator Coats leaves the Senate after 10 years having established a \nlegion of friendships and a legacy of achievement and integrity. The \nSenate will miss his expertise, his hard work, his thoughtful \nreflection, and his talent for innovation. I am confident that Dan will \ncontinue to serve the public in the many challenges that lie ahead of \nhim. I wish Dan and Marcia Coats all the best as they move on to these \nnew adventures.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to compliment the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Indiana for his parting words about our colleague. \nI agree with him. It will come as no surprise that there are those on \nthis side of the aisle, like myself, who also will miss Dan Coats and \nwho are most impressed by the way that he and his distinguished \ncolleague work together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12137-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12138-S12140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATOR JOHN GLENN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is a time when Senators say goodbye to \nSenators who are leaving, and I was privileged, in 1974, to be elected \nwith a very special class of Senators, a very large class of Senators--\nnearly a dozen--who came to this body. We developed personal \nfriendships. Of that class, there are only four left: The distinguished \nsenior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Glenn; the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky, Mr. Ford; the distinguished senior Senator from \nArkansas, Mr. Bumpers; and myself. Each of the other three have \nannounced their plans to retire this year. In some ways I feel like the \nlonely person who is given the chore to turn out the lights after \neverybody else leaves, because I will be the last of the class of 1974.\n  I am going to speak of each of them, but I wish to speak now and to \ngive tribute to a great statesman, a person who is recognized as a true \nAmerican hero and a very good friend of mine, John Hershel Glenn, Jr.\n  As I said, we both arrived in the Senate at the same time in 1974. \nThere was a big difference, however. I came here as a 34-year-old \nunknown county prosecutor from rural Vermont. John Glenn arrived here \nas a living American legend. We have served together now for 24 years \nand it is with the fondest memories that I recollect his time here. I \nremember the very first day I met him. The two of us had gone over to \nsee the legendary Jim Eastland, President pro tempore of the Senate. \nThat is probably the only time, then or since, I have ever seen John \nGlenn look at all nervous, was going in to see Senator Eastland. \nSenator Glenn was nervous. I was terrified. There is a big difference.\n  But John Glenn will be remembered here in the Senate as a man who \nadvocated a role for Government in daily life, but he never stopped \ntrying to make Government more efficient. He is one of our leading \nexperts on science and technology. He has always been a tireless \nadvocate for Government-sponsored scientific and health research. He \nbrought tremendous intellect and dedication to the task of preventing \nthe spread of weapons of mass destruction. I remember when the United \nStates and the Soviet Union were locked in a wasteful nuclear arms \nrace, John Glenn was a voice of reason and moderation.\n  He has used his seat on the Armed Services Committee to advocate for \nour men and women in uniform, while at the same time looking out for \nwasteful spending. I remember, when I and others began to have doubts \nabout the costly B-2 bomber--$2 billion a plane--that I read papers and \nmemos about it. John Glenn went out and flew it, then came back and \nsaid its cost outweighed its benefits. I credit him for saving the \ntaxpayers a lot of money.\n  He used his position in the Governmental Affairs Committee to expose \nwaste in Government and to clean up the Nation's nuclear materials \nproduction plants.\n  In his conduct here in the Senate, John has always been nonpartisan, \npolite, accommodating, but always true to his beliefs. His personality \nreminds me of Longfellow's words, ``A tender heart; a will \ninflexible.''\n  It is hard for us to think of John Glenn before he was a national \nhero, but not so long ago he was a smalltown boy like many of us. He \nwas born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, OH. He grew up in the tiny \ntown of New Concord, OH. But, like millions of Americans, his life was \nforever changed by World War II.\n  Many of us know the details of what makes John Glenn a hero, but I \nwant to repeat them for my colleagues. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, he \nwas commissioned in the Marines Corps. He served as a fighter pilot in \nthe South Pacific. He stayed in the Marines, and when the Korean War \nstarted, John Glenn requested combat duty. He ended up flying 149 \ncombat missions in both wars. How good a pilot is our colleague from \nOhio? In the last 9 days of fighting in Korea, he downed three Chinese \nMiG fighters in combat along the Yalu River.\n  In July 1957, he set a speed record from Los Angeles to New York, the \nfirst transcontinental flight to average supersonic speed.\n  An avid pilot to this day, John has over 9,000 hours of flight time \nin a variety of aircraft. To put that statistic in perspective, to \nequal that mark you would have to fly 8 hours a day, every day of the \nyear, for 3 years.\n  Probably the flight that I remember the best, the one I enjoyed as \nmuch as any, was when John Glenn and I flew to the northeast kingdom of \nVermont in a small float plane at the height of glorious fall foliage. \nJohn and Annie Glenn were staying with Marcelle and I at our farm in \nMiddlesex, VT. John had borrowed the plane from a friend of mine in \nVermont. We flew up and set down in one of those little Vermont ponds \nwith the fall foliage around it. There happened to be a trapper's \nconvention there. Some of the people there\n\n[[Page S12139]]\n\nwere calling him Colonel Glenn, not Senator Glenn. They kind of put up \nwith me being there, but he was the hero.\n  Of course I do remember also the look on John and Marcelle's and \nAnnie's faces when we landed in Montpelier Airport in a heavy \ncrosswind. John turned to me after he taxied up and said, ``You know, I \nhave never been so frightened landing anything in my life,'' which \nalmost stopped my heart to hear him tell it. But when we got out of the \nplane, John was wearing--this is accurate now--a skunk-skin cap which \nthe trappers had given him.\n  He stepped out of the airplane with me shaking and quivering behind \nhim. Annie turned to Marcelle and says, ``Marcelle, I told you we never \nshould have let those boys go off by themselves.''\n  We all know what happened in a far more dramatic time when John \nstrapped himself into a tiny capsule on top a gigantic tube of volatile \nfuel on February 20, 1962. When he landed 4 hours 55 minutes later, \nJohn Glenn not only became the first American to orbit the Earth, but \nhe boosted the psyche of our Nation in a way not seen equaled before or \nsince.\n  Cicero said a man of courage is also full of faith. It should be said \nthat John Glenn is a man who puts all his faith in God.\n  All his accomplishments here in the Senate, in the cockpit, in the \ncapsule, all pale before the one true constant in John Glenn's life, \nand that is the love he shares with his beautiful wife Annie. They are \ntruly a couple for the ages and role models for all of us. Married for \n55 years, they have two wonderful children, John David and Carolyn Ann, \nwhom we all know as Lyn.\n  When the space shuttle Discovery surges into space later this month, \nthe cabin will be cramped with the seven astronauts aboard. But sitting \nwith John in spirit, as she has for so many years, will be Annie. They \nare truly inseparable. No matter how fast or far he travels, she is \nalways with him.\n  Mr. President, later this month the eyes of the Nation and the world \nwill focus on Cape Canaveral, FL. We will watch as a marvelous machine, \nbuilt by Americans, flown by an international crew, roars into the \nheavens in the name of science, and on board will be our colleague from \nOhio, a great Senator, an expert pilot and extraordinary American hero, \nmy friend, John Glenn. I intend to be there to cheer him on.\n  Once again, as he has done in so many ways over the years, John Glenn \nwill make us turn our eyes toward the heavens, and like all who will be \nthere, I will say, ``Godspeed, John Glenn, and thank you.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from Roll Call \nabout Senator Glenn be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Roll Call, Oct. 5, 1998]\n\n    Glenn Counts Down to Launch With Complete Support From Wife and \n               Colleagues--Senator Set to Repeat History\n\n                             (By Ed Henry)\n\n       He's survived 149 combat missions as a Marine, orbited the \n     Earth three times at 17,544 miles per hour as an astronaut \n     and endured 24 years of partisan battles as a Senator.\n       But John Glenn says that one of the toughest missions of \n     his life came as a husband: convincing his wife, Annie, that \n     it was a good idea for him to be shot into space again at the \n     end of this month.\n       ``Let's say she was a little cool with this whole idea to \n     begin with--that's the understatement,'' Glenn said in an \n     interview about the Oct. 29 space mission. ``She didn't react \n     too kindly when I first started talking about this some time \n     ago.''\n       The 77-year-old Ohio Democrat said that while the couple's \n     two children were not excited about the Discovery launch \n     either, ``Annie was the main one to convince.''\n       Slipping into the lingo of an old Marine, Glenn noted that \n     based on all of the dangers he's already faced, he could have \n     gotten ``bagged'' long ago.\n       ``There were lots of times that things could have gone a \n     little bit different way, but they didn't,'' he said. ``But I \n     think all my life, I guess, you don't look back and think \n     what might have been or where you might have gotten bagged or \n     whatever. You look forward. There are risks in everything you \n     do.''\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), one of the couple's closest \n     friends, said Annie was ``apprehensive'' about the fact that \n     her husband was heading into space so close to his retirement \n     from the Senate.\n       ``She had some reluctance because he was coming to a time \n     in his life when they were going to have more time \n     together,'' said Leahy. ``They are an extraordinarily close \n     couple--they're sort of the role model for all of us in our \n     own marriages.''\n       Nobody underestimates the strength of Annie Glenn, who \n     toughed her way through her husband's Feb. 20, 1962, Mercury \n     mission, when he flirted with death in the 36-cubic-foot \n     Friendship 7. She also had the guts to stand up to then-Vice \n     President Lyndon Johnson by refusing to let him come into her \n     home for a photo-op, out of fear for how her stutter would \n     look in front of Johnson and so many network TV \n     correspondents.\n       She was sitting up in the House gallery on that day in 1962 \n     when Glenn jubilantly told a joint session of Congress, ``I \n     want you to meet my wife, Annie * * * Annie * * * the rock!''\n       And Glenn was there for Annie, Leahy recalled, when she \n     conquered her stuttering problem 20 years ago. ``We don't \n     think of them as John or Annie,'' he said. ``We think of them \n     as JohnandAnnie--it's just one word.''\n       In finally deciding to hop aboard for this mission, Annie \n     thought back to a vow her husband had made on the day they \n     wed 55 years ago.\n       ``One thing that she's reminded me of is that on our \n     wedding day, along with the vows, one of the things I told \n     her that day or that night sometime was that I would pledge \n     to her I would try to do everything I could to keep life from \n     ever being boring,'' said the Senator.\n       Then he added with a laugh, ``And she's reminded me of that \n     several times in the past, and this time, too, that she'd \n     just as soon have things be a little bit more boring.''\n       Since critics have said the upcoming nine-day mission is \n     merely a joy ride, Glenn has done his homework. With great \n     specificity, he can recount how the research about how a \n     senior citizen is affected in space will do a great deal for \n     the 34 million seniors in America.\n       ``She gradually over a period of time became an enthusiast \n     for this,'' he said. ``She's changed her view on this, as has \n     my whole family, so she's excited about it.''\n       Sen Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) said he spoke to Annie last week \n     and she revealed that NASA will be providing a laptop so she \n     can communicate with her husband in space.\n       ``I said, `Annie, aren't you apprehensive at all about this \n     flight?' '' recalled Bumpers. `` `She said, `I'm never \n     apprehensive about anything John really wants to do.' ''\n       Annie Glenn will not be the only person close to the \n     Senator lending her support at Cape Canaveral. A bipartisan \n     delegation of Senators will be heading down to Florida on an \n     official CODEL authorized by Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-\n     Miss.) and Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).\n       Daschle plans to be there for the launch, even though he \n     faces re-election back in South Dakota less than a week \n     later. Because Lott has a scheduling conflict, he will be \n     sending Senate Appropriations Chairman Ted Stevens (R-\n     Alaska)--who helped come up with the idea of a trip--to lead \n     the Republican side.\n       ``Senators have a way of coming together when another is \n     involved,'' Lott said in an interview.\n       The office of Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Greg Casey, who is \n     organizing the trip, does not have a complete list of \n     Senators attending yet. The trip will originate from Andrews \n     Air Force Base on the morning of the launch.\n       ``We have a lot of interest from Senators,'' said Secretary \n     of the Senate Gary Sisco, who will also attend.\n       Glenn said that while colleagues have not discussed the \n     launch with him, he's heard whispers about it and feels \n     gratified.\n       ``It's a good feeling to know that there are going to be \n     people there that you have worked with all these years--that \n     they think enough about it to be down there,'' he said.\n       Another person who was supposed to be at the Cape was Alan \n     Shepard, his onetime rival in the Mercury program, who \n     recently died. Glenn admits that Shepard's death reminded him \n     of his own mortality, but the Senator insists he's not \n     worried about his safety.\n       ``I've always been very aware of my own mortality anyway,'' \n     said Glenn. ``I got over that teenage immortality bit a long \n     time ago.''\n       Glenn suggested he is at peace with his decision. ``I have \n     a deep religious faith and I have all my life,'' he said. ``I \n     don't believe in calling on your religion like a fire engine, \n     you know, `Oh God, get me out of this mess I've gotten myself \n     into and I'll be so good even you won't believe it.''\n       He added, ``But I think . . . we should all live so that if \n     something like that happens to us it won't be a big shock. \n     It's a shock. It would be a shock, of course. Nothing can be \n     100 percent safe. Everyone knows that. But I think the safety \n     record NASA has had through the manned space program has been \n     absolutely amazing.''\n       Besides his combat missions in Korea and World War II, \n     Glenn faced danger in 1962.\n       ``Some of the ophthalmologists predicted your eyes might \n     change shape,'' he said. ``It was serious enough that if you \n     look at the Friendship 7 over there in the Air and Space \n     Museum now, up on top of the instrument panel there's still a \n     little eye chart that I was to read every 20 minutes to see \n     if my eyes were changing.''\n       When asked why he took such risks, without so much as a \n     blink Glenn responds, ``I thought it was valuable for the \n     country.''\n       Colleagues say it is this modesty--as well as Glenn's \n     relationship with his wife--that they will remember most.\n\n[[Page S12140]]\n\n       ``He's one of my favorite people in the whole world because \n     he wears his heroism with such extraordinary modesty,'' said \n     Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.).\n       Senators like 51-year-old Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) seem awed by \n     getting the chance to serve with Glenn.\n       ``It's like serving with a legend,'' said Johnson. ``The \n     fact that I served with John Glenn is something I'll tell my \n     grandkids.''\n       As a young Navy pilot, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) revered \n     Glenn and says the upcoming mission will remind everyone of \n     that.\n       ``I know it will just affirm in people's minds that we're \n     privileged to have known a great American hero,'' he said. \n     ``I am honored to be in his company. I am serious. I am \n     honored to be in his company.''\n       Sen. Richard Bryan (D-Nev.) said he will try to be in \n     Florida, partially because of a simple expression of love he \n     saw when Bonnie Bryan and Annie Glenn recently traveled \n     together to Saudi Arabia. From across the globe, Mrs. Glenn \n     placed a phone call to her husband in the Senate cloakroom.\n       Bryan recalled, ``He was very excited and came up to me and \n     said, `I've got Annie on the line, would you like to talk to \n     Bonnie?' John and Annie have this very special relationship--\n     you can sense that.''\n       Leahy recalled riding in the back seat one time as the \n     Glenns kept teasing and poking fun at one another in front \n     seat.\n       ``The two of them are like a pair of teenagers,'' he said.\n       But a much sadder occasion reminded Leahy of his affection \n     for the couple. When Leahy's mother died last year, he found \n     out that the Glenns had been trying to lift her spirits \n     during her illness.\n       ``One of the things I found on her bed stand was a \n     handwritten note from John and Annie,'' said Leahy. ``They \n     both had written a couple of paragraphs in the letter. These \n     are very special people.''\n       For Glenn, his frequent trips to Houston for training seem \n     to have been a sort of fountain of youth.\n       Every time Glenn returns from Houston, said Sen. Richard \n     Lugar (R-Ind.), he's been updated about the status of the \n     mission. ``It's wonderful to see someone so engaged and lit \n     up with enthusiasm,'' he said.\n       It has also reminded Glenn about the differences between \n     his two careers.\n       ``Here of course, the political lines are drawn and you \n     have confrontation and you have to put everything through a \n     political sieve to know what's real and what isn't in \n     people's minds,'' he said.\n       ``Back when I was in the Mercury program or in the program \n     down there now, it's such a pleasure to work in that program \n     because everything is so focused on one objective that \n     everybody's agreed on.''\n       The similarities between the two jobs, he concluded, are \n     limited.\n       ``Both fields take a lot of dedication to accomplish \n     anything. That would be a big similarity, dedication to \n     country and dedication to what you're doing. But that's about \n     where the similarities end.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, the business before the Senate is the \nmotion to proceed on the bankruptcy conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as we take up the conference report to \nthe bankruptcy bill, I want to make clear that this report is a \nbalanced and fair compromise between the House and Senate bankruptcy \nbills. The fact of the matter is that the process of a conference is a \nprocess of joining two bills that have passed both Houses in different \nforms.\n  One of the key differences between the House and Senate was the \nquestion of means testing. The House had a very strict formula, while \nthe Senate bill contained a change to a section of the bankruptcy code \nwhich directs judges to consider repayment capacity.\n  On this point of means testing, the House had one provision formula \ndriven, very much different from the Senate provision that was more \nsubjective in the decision of a judge of whether somebody should be in \nchapter 7 or chapter 13. But, obviously, even in the Senate bill, we \nhad penalties and incentives for people who should be filing under \nchapter 13 but, in fact, filed under chapter 7. We had these \ndifferences on means testing between the House and the Senate.\n  Under the conference report that is now before us, a debtor can file \nin any chapter of the bankruptcy code, and before a debtor can be \ntransferred from chapter 7 to chapter 13, a judge will review the \nmerits of each case.\n  Mr. President, I think this is important to understand because we \nprovide that every single person who wants their day in court with due \nprocess will get it, because under the conference report, each debtor \nwill receive an individual hearing and get a chance to press his or her \nown case. In other words, the conference report maintains the judicial \nscrutiny that I think was the distinguishing factor of the Senate \nbill's means test. Of course, we have a flexible means test before us \ntoday that is a product of the conference compromise.\n  When the Senate considered my bankruptcy reform bill, I spoke at \nlength about the need for reform, and I would like to restate those \npoints as we go to final consideration, after this conference report \nwas overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives just a few \nhours ago.\n  The need for this bill is based upon the statistics of bankruptcy, \nand those statistics speak for themselves. The number of bankruptcy \nfilings has skyrocketed in recent years. In 1994, the total number of \nnonbusiness filings was just over 780,000, probably thought to be too \nmuch at that time, and maybe the number was too high at that time. But \nin 1996, this figure jumped to 1.1 million, and, astonishingly, the \n1997 figure was almost 1.35 million. Of course, the trend is \ncontinuing.\n  There is no letup in the dramatic increase in the number of personal \nbankruptcies being filed even this very day in this country, because \nfilings for the first quarter of 1998 are over 20,000 higher than for \nthe same time last year. They are almost 90,000 ahead of the first \nquarter of 1996. Unfortunately, the future looks even bleaker. A study \nreleased just a few days ago predicted that the number of personal \nbankruptcies will exceed 2.2 million by the year 2001.\n  If there is any better reason or rationale for the adoption of this \nconference report by this body before we go home for recess, it is that \nthe high number of personal bankruptcy filings is continuing to shoot \nup at a tremendous rate, unjustified for the economic conditions we are \nin. We think 1.4 million is too high. In 3 years--in 2\\1/2\\ years--they \nwill be well over 2 million if we don't do something about it, and I \nthink this legislation will do something about it.\n  The interesting and alarming thing is that this unprecedented \nincrease in the filings for bankruptcy comes at a time when our economy \nis very, very healthy. Disposable income is up, unemployment is very \nlow, and the interest rates are very low.\n\n  Here is something that just does not make sense, then. Common sense \nand basic economics would say that when times are as good as they are \nnow--almost the longest peacetime recovery this country has ever had--\nwhen the economy is flourishing, that bankruptcies should not shoot up \nas well; that is, unless there is something wrong. And there is \nsomething wrong.\n  The bankruptcy code is flawed. There is need for reform. There is not \nany shame connected with bankruptcy anymore. There is lack of personal \nresponsibility. There is lack of corporate responsibility, as well as \ncredit card companies are pushing credit cards into mailboxes every \nday. And the bankruptcy bar is not adequately counseling people as to \nwhether or not they should even be in bankruptcy, let alone \ndiscouraging them from being in chapter 7 when they should be in \nchapter 13. But with all of these put together, Mr. President, in my \nview, the main problem in our bankruptcy law, quite simply, is that \ncurrent law discourages personal responsibility.\n  Let me start out by saying that most people who declare bankruptcy \nbecause of their low incomes, their inability to pay, probably are \ncorrect in doing so. When I say that, that does not counteract what I \njust said about assuming personal responsibility or not having some \nshame connected with bankruptcy. But as far as our present law is \nconcerned, and their ability to repay, I would have to say that that is \nprobably where they should be.\n  But that does not mean that we do not have a responsibility through \nour society and through the standards set by our Government to do \nsomething about the fact that so many people are in bankruptcy in the \nfirst place. We will have to deal with that sometime\n\n[[Page S12141]]\n\nother than in this legislation, because this legislation is dealing \nwith the fact that those who have the ability to repay ought to not get \noff scot-free. But if you do not have the ability to repay, then, of \ncourse, that is another consideration. You have to deal with that in \nsome ways differently than what we do in this legislation.\n  Estimates vary, but about 80 percent of the people who declare \nbankruptcy are in desperate straits. And then under the principle that \nwe have had for the last 100 years in our bankruptcy laws, particularly \nif this is in situations beyond their control--like natural disaster, \ndeath, divorce, medical problems--then they may need to get a fresh \nstart.\n  The problem is, Mr. President, as I have already hinted, some people \nuse bankruptcy as a financial planning tool. They do it to get out of \npaying off debts which they could pay off. And that is what is pushing \nthe desire for bankruptcy reform. We have a bankruptcy system that lets \nhigher-income people write off their debts with no questions asked and \nno real way for creditors to prevent this from happening. And this \nlegislation deals with that unjust situation--unjust for creditors, \nunjust for consumers, because consumers pay it, and too just for people \nwho have the ability to repay.\n  As I said so often last year, we had a record number of Americans \nfiling for bankruptcy. Of course each bankruptcy case means that \nsomeone who extended credit in good faith will not get paid. While \nestimates differ as to the exact number, American businesses are losing \nabout $40 billion a year as a result of consumer bankruptcy.\n  You might say, well, big banks and big businesses are in somewhat of \na stronger position since they can offset these losses by increasing \nthe amount that they charge other customers. That is an important \npoint, Mr. President. Under the best of circumstances, where a big \nbusiness can stay afloat in the face of large losses due to \nbankruptcies, then it is simple: Honest customers pay the price because \nthere is no free lunch. This is like a hidden tax--a hidden bankruptcy \ntax--which consumers pay, people who play by the rules pay. Because, as \nbusinesses end up writing off their debts in bankruptcy, the consumers \nmake it up.\n  So my legislation would reduce this tax by requiring those consumers \nwho can afford to pay, who have the capacity to make good on their \ndebts, or even some portion thereof, to do so. But that is the \nsituation with big businesses that can pass it on. They can survive in \nthe face of huge bankruptcy losses. They stay in business. They get \nconsumers coming to their door. The consumers pay. But there are a lot \nof small business people who have to close their doors because maybe \nthey cannot afford to absorb the loss of so much income and \nconsequently do not have the ability to pass it on to their consumers. \nThe Bankruptcy Reform Act limits complete debt relief to only those who \ncannot repay their debts. Those who can repay their debts are required \nto do that. And of course, that is common sense.\n  That is one important aspect of the legislation, the means testing \nprovisions of it. There was a compromise between the House and the \nSenate. The House had that very strict formula that decided whether a \nperson was in bankruptcy 13 or bankruptcy 7. We had a subjective \njudgment with encouragement for people to be in chapter 13 and \npenalties to those who went into 7 when they had the ability to repay \nand should have been in 13. But it was very subjective, and it took \nmotions by creditors. It took action by trustees to bring that about, \nand it took penalties against lawyers who were not properly counseling \nthe debtor. So we joined these together to have the bright line of the \nHouse version of who should be in chapter 13, but we also make sure \nthat every debtor gets their day in court with due process to make sure \nthey have been treated fairly.\n  So we move on to another hot-button issue. On this issue the Senate \nprevailed. The conference report still provides that child support \nobligations must be paid during any bankruptcy proceeding.\n  You can see here in this chart, under the conference report, child \nsupport and alimony receive first priority. Child support must be paid \nin full before debt forgiveness. You can see across here, under current \nlaw child support/alimony is seventh in priority. We move that to first \nin priority. You can see that under present law there is no requirement \nto pay child support before debt forgiveness in chapter 13. Child \nsupport must be paid in full before debt forgiveness. Under the \nconference report, bankruptcy trumps wage garnishment for child \nsupport. Under the conference report, bankruptcy does not trump wage \ngarnishment for child support. And lastly, and added to child support, \ncollections are exempt from automatic stay.\n  The reason that it is important to put child support claimants at the \ntop of the list during bankruptcy proceedings is that most bankrupts do \nnot have enough money to pay all creditors in full. So somebody is not \ngoing to be paid. This bill makes it more certain that child support \nwill be paid in full before other creditors can collect a penny. That \nis real progress in making sure that children and former spouses are \ntreated fairly.\n  I know this was very much a concern of many members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, including my distinguished ranking member, Senator Durbin of \nIllinois, and other members of the committee. I know it is very much a \nconcern of people at the White House. I hope, first of all, that they \nunderstand there was no intent of changing this in the original \nlegislation, but I guess it is the way combinations can work, that \nthere was some suspect that this could happen, but I hope that we make \nit very, very clear that families and children and spouses are first. \nWe have moved it from seventh to first.\n\n  Also, the conference report provides that someone owed child support \ncan enforce their obligations even against the exempt property of a \nbankrupt. This means that wealthy bankrupts can't hide their assets in \nexpensive homes or in pension funds as a way of stiffing their children \nor their ex-spouses. This is another example of how this legislation \nwill help--not hurt--child support claimants. And rightly so.\n  This conference report states that debtors receiving child support \ndon't have to count that income when calculating a repayable schedule.\n  Outside the bankruptcy context, when there are delinquent child or \nspousal support obligations, State government agencies often step in \nand try to help collect that child support. The conference report \nexempts these collection efforts from the automatic stay. The automatic \nstay is a court injunction which automatically arises when anyone \ndeclares bankruptcy, and it prevents creditors from collecting on their \ndebts.\n  Now, if this legislation were to pass, State agencies would be in a \nmuch better position to collect past due child support. In practical \nterms, that means that State government agencies attempting to collect \nchild support can garnish wages and suspend driver's licenses and \nprofessional licenses--plenty of incentive for people to get on the \nstick and keep their social obligations to the families they have been \na part of, benefited from, and to the children that they ought to love \nin the first place.\n  Clearly, this will help State governments in catching deadbeats who \nwant to use the bankruptcy system to get out of paying child support. \nIn fact, the district attorneys who actually collect child support \nstrongly support this conference report. So any argument that this \nconference report is bad for child support is empty political rhetoric.\n  If I could go to another chart, the conference report also maintains \ntough fines against creditors who misuse their new powers to harass or \nintimidate honest consumers, rather than to stop abuses. I think the \nchart shows what we are doing. I can tell you that this was a very key \nfeature of the Senate bill. Whenever we give creditors a new tool, we \nalso give debtors a new shield to rein in potential creditor abuses. If \nit is wrong for a debtor to avoid personal responsibility, it is wrong \nfor creditors to misuse the bankruptcy code in an unethical way, as \nwell.\n  I think it is amazing that we hear from our Democratic friends that \nwe should oppose this conference report, as I think we will, because we \nlimit the ability of unscrupulous trial lawyers to bring class actions \nagainst the bankruptcy code. Now, I think that is a very\n\n[[Page S12142]]\n\ntelling point. It seems that those who oppose this bill do not really \noppose it because they are worried about consumers. They might oppose \nit because they want to help trial lawyers clean their pockets. I hope \nmy colleagues will keep this in mind as we consider this conference \nreport.\n  There is another example of how the conference report gives debtors \nimportant new tools to defer, to deter and punish abusive creditor \nconduct. In the last few years, there have been a number of reports \nabout creditors coercing debtors into agreeing to paying their debts \neven though the debt could be wiped away in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy \ncode allows debtors to reaffirm debts if they choose to do so \nvoluntarily. The problem is that some companies have been threatening \nconsumers in order to force reaffirmation. The conference report gives \nevery debtor the right to a hearing before a bankruptcy judge who will \nreview the agreement to make sure that there has been no coercion. This \nis a crucially important change to protect consumers.\n  I want to make one last point in regard to this chart. We have \n``truth in advertising'' requirements for bankruptcy lawyers. It seems \nto me this is very, very important. In the original debate on this bill \nbefore it went to conference, 2 or 3 weeks ago, the point was made that \nsome lawyers with the bankruptcy mills were advising people through \nadvertising that they had the ability to avoid paying alimony and other \nthings. ``Truth in advertising'' is very important in any business. It \nis just as important in the legal profession.\n  Debtors get new rights to court hearings to stop unfair debt \ncollection practices.\n  It promotes out-of-court settlements by punishing creditors who \nrefuse to negotiate. We think there ought to be the willingness and the \nobligation, when somebody who is greatly in debt and wants to work \nsomething out without going through the costly and adversarial \nenvironment of the court, they ought to be able to. That incentive is \nin here.\n  And it requires credit card companies to point out the dangers of \nmaking only the minimum payments.\n  Finally, the conference report makes important changes to help \nprevent the collapse of the financial sector when a party to a swap or \na repurchase agreement defaults on an obligation. These changes were \nsuggested by our Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin. As President \nClinton put it, we are in a serious financial crisis and we need to \nreduce systematic risk in the financial markets now.\n  This conference report, I think, is balanced and fair. I am sure that \nwe will hear that it is not. Obviously, it is not entirely to my \nliking. No conference report is to everyone's liking. The essence of \nthis legislative process, when a House and a Senate pass different \nversions of the bill, is that there be compromise. Actually, the \ndifferences in these versions was greater than you would normally have \nbetween pieces of legislation passed by the respective bodies and much \nmore difficult to do.\n  I want to repeat for our colleagues, as well as for his constituents \nin Illinois, Senator Durbin has been very, very cooperative throughout \nthis process. We have had a bipartisan bill through the Senate. The \nprocess of compromise detracted from that, I am sorry to say. I was \nhoping that we would have a bill by the last week in July so we could \nhave the whole month of September to work on the tremendous differences \nbetween the House and Senate. But things didn't work out the way I \nwanted them to and I am sure they didn't work out the way our \ndistinguished Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, wanted them to work \nout, so this bill came out during the third week of September.\n  Now here we are about ready to adjourn for the year and to go home \nand campaign. That process was not handled in the spirit of \nbipartisanship that I had planned a year and a half ago when I started \nworking on this legislation, and that has been the practice not only \nthrough the Senate, but through conference in previous times. Some of \nthat probably was within my control, but most of it was outside of my \ncontrol. So the extent to which the last step did not encompass the \nspirit of bipartisanship that I had anticipated a year and a half ago, \nI apologize to my friend, the Senator from Illinois.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say at the outset, my respect for my colleague, \nSenator Grassley of Iowa, has not been diminished by this experience, \nbut enhanced. It has been a joy to work with him over the last year and \na half in preparing this important legislation. It is complex. It is \ndifficult. He has shown both legislative and intellectual stamina \nthroughout. He has been fair in his dealings with me, and to the moment \nwhere we were successful in passing this bill on the floor of the \nSenate by an overwhelming vote of 97-1, a strong bipartisan vote, I \nthink we both took pride in the fact that we had given it virtually \neverything that we could to make the best possible legislation for a \nvery difficult challenge.\n\n  Having said that, I will knowledge, as the Senator from Iowa has, \nthat once that bill left the Senate floor, once the conferees were \nappointed, a totally different process took place, which was very \ndisappointing to me. It was totally different in that it was not \nbipartisan. In fact, as I stand here today and look up at the clerk's \ndesk and see the conference report from this committee, this is the \nfirst time I have ever laid eyes on it. I wasn't there. I wasn't \ninvited to the conference committee meetings. I wasn't asked to sign \nthe conference committee report. In fact, virtually no Democrats--at \nleast on the Senate side--were involved in any of that negotiation. \nThat is truly unfortunate.\n  There is no reason why this had to be a partisan endeavor. Senator \nGrassley and I proved that in working together on a bipartisan basis we \ncould come up with a good and balanced bill. In fact, when this issue \nfirst came to me and people representing banks and the credit industry \ncame to my office, I said to them: I agree with you, there are abuses \nin the bankruptcy system that need to be cleaned up. I will help you \nclean them up if, and only if, you will concede that there are also \nabuses when it comes to credit cards in America that need to be cleaned \nup as well.\n  Each bank, each merchant, each credit card company said, without \nfail: We agree. We are in for both sides to be repaired, both sides to \nbe changed, and reform to come that will really affect bankruptcy in \nthe future.\n  The Senate bill did that. The Senate bill said: Yes, we will clean up \nthe bankruptcy court, but we will also say to the credit card \ncompanies, you have a responsibility to clean up your act. It also said \nto creditors that when it comes to the whole question of your efforts, \nif there are predatory credit practices that are, in fact, unfair, \nthose credit practices will not allow you a ticket into the bankruptcy \ncourt.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. President, before proceeding, I ask unanimous consent that the \npreviously scheduled vote now occur at 5:50 p.m. this evening.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. If I might \nask the manager if I may speak 5 minutes before 5:50. Otherwise, I will \nobject. I ask the managers of the bill if they can assure me they will \ngive me 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will not speak anymore.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Otherwise, I will object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, can we have some indication from other \nMembers on the floor of the time they might need? Perhaps we can come \nto some accommodation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama would like \nabout 10 minutes on the bankruptcy bill. There are 10 minutes set aside \nfor me now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time would the Senator from Ohio need?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I would like 8 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is 23 minutes. I would have to sit down, and that \nwould be a painful experience at this moment. I will withdraw the \nunanimous consent request at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am concerned that when we set about \ndealing with the bankruptcy code and reform, we tried to do it in a \nbalanced fashion in the Senate bill.\n  Tonight, when you go home, open the mailbox, and you know what you \nare\n\n[[Page S12143]]\n\ngoing to find--preapproved credit card applications. If you are an \naverage American, you get 28 a year. If you happen to be in the prime \ntarget group, you get many more. A college student, in the first 6 \nmonths they are in college, can expect to be inundated. You are 18 \nyears old and you can sign a contract; they can't wait to get you. The \ndean of students at the University of Indiana tells us that the No. 1 \nreason kids are leaving school at Indiana is not grades, it is credit \ncard debt. That is what is happening.\n  So when there is a speech made about the shame of bankruptcy, what \nabout the shame of some of these credit practices?\n  So what did we suggest be changed as part of this debate? Let me give \nyou an idea of one thing in the Senate bill that was totally rejected \nby the conference committee. The banks and credit card companies said: \nThis is unreasonable, we don't want it in the bill. This example credit \ncard statement belongs to a staff member who probably used this as a \nbasis for acquiring more salary. We have added to this a provision that \nwould have been from the Senate bill. We would put it at the bottom of \nyour statement, a tiny paragraph, which says: if you pay only the \nminimum payment due and make no new purchases or advances, it will take \nyou x number of months to pay off your balance, and the total cost will \nbe approximately x.\n  Does that sound like an outrageous request of a credit card company--\nthat we as consumers would know what the minimum monthly payment means \nin terms of indebtedness?\n  This individual has a balance of $1,295. They asked him to make a \nminimum payment of $26. If we put our provision on this, we would be \ntelling him it would take him 93 months--almost 8 years--to pay off the \nbill. When it is all said and done, he would be paying $2,418, or \nalmost double the amount of the current balance.\n  I don't think consumers should be in any way tricked or deceived or \nthe facts concealed. Yet, that is what is happening because this \nconference committee felt that it was unreasonable to put that burden \non a credit card company.\n  We had another provision that said that these predatory lenders that \ngo after senior citizens--primarily widows in their late years--in the \nfamily home, and sign them up for siding and roofs and home repair with \na second mortgage with a balloon, and take the house away because they \nhave deceived some poor person, should not be able to walk into \nbankruptcy court and execute their claim against that person and their \nhome. Predatory credit practices would not allow you a ticket to the \nbankruptcy court. As soon as this got in conference committee, they \nripped it out and said: We don't want to go that far.\n  Let me tell you what happened as a result. We received a letter from \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Lew has \nwritten to us--in fact, to the leaders of Congress --within the last 2 \ndays, to say that if this conference report is presented to the \nPresident, his senior advisers will recommend that he veto it. Why? \nBecause it is unreasonable. This conference report could have been so \ngood, could have been so fair and so balanced, and it is not.\n  When it comes to the test that they are going to put someone in \nbankruptcy court, this is inflexible and unforgiving. Frankly, as a \nresult of it, a lot of people who don't have resources and should not \nbe put through this wringer will face it.\n  In addition to that is the whole question of class actions. I will \nconcede to the Senator from Iowa that there are undoubtedly class \naction lawyers who are unscrupulous, but there are also class action \nlawyers who stand up for consumers who could not afford a day in court \nby themselves.\n  Consider this: A major retailer in the United States of America, as a \nmatter of policy, has a coercive practice that when you are in \nbankruptcy court, they put the hammer on you as a debtor and say: We \ndon't want you to have our debt written off. We want to tell you that \nyou have to re-sign up to pay off this debt on this refrigerator--or \ncar, or set of tools. They put the pressure on them. The person, under \npressure, signs it. And it turns out to be a national policy. In fact, \nit is a national scandal. Only by class action suits on behalf of \ndebtors across America can you go after these major banks and major \nretailers.\n  This conference report removes the right of debtors, through classes, \nto come to court. That was a right under the law before we even \nconsidered bankruptcy code reform. And so not only does this bill take \naway new protections for consumers, it takes away the existing \nprotections for consumers--another reason why the President's Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget says they will veto this bill, \nas I believe they should.\n  There has been a lot said about child support and alimony. Consider \nhow many of the people who go into bankruptcy court have an obligation \nto pay for the debts of their children and are, frankly, facing a lot \nof other debts and wondering how they will pay them off. The bottom \nline on this bill, as the letter from Mr. Lew indicates, is that they \nare putting more people in line to draw from the limited assets of \nestates. So a spouse trying to raise children and looking for child \nsupport, when they walk out the door in bankruptcy, has less money to \nturn to.\n\n  This bill, unfortunately, does not provide the kind of protection \nthat I believe is absolutely necessary.\n  When we came to this Senate floor, we adopted a variety of consumer \nprotection provisions that really gave balance to this bill. Almost \nwithout exception every single one of them was removed in this \nconference committee.\n  The credit industry that promised us they would give us a balanced \nbill, that they would agree to end abusive practices in their own \nindustry--when they went into that conference committee and closed the \ndoor, they basically broke the deal. They walked out of that door with \nthe conference committee report to their liking. The conference \ncommittee report, which they are lauding, is one which most of us \nbelieve is, frankly, a bill that should not be signed into law.\n  It is one sided. It is designed to reward the credit industry and to \npenalize the average consumer. They save the worst treatment for the \nunlucky families facing bankruptcy. They held aside the mother who \ndepends on child support so that coercive creditors can claim the \nlimited assets of bankrupt spouses. They refuse to protect the widow \nbilked out of her home by a home repair con artist. They refuse to \nprovide any new credit card disclosure so that consumers can better \nunderstand the termination of their card agreements, or monthly bills.\n  Our purpose in this bill on this side was never to ration credit, but \nonly to say that credit should be more rational, that each of us, as we \nenter into agreements for credit cards, should be able to understand \nthe terms of the those credit cards and make our own decisions for \nourselves, our families, and our businesses. Each and every time we \nattempted to do that in the bankruptcy bill, it was stripped out in the \nconference report.\n  What did they put in instead? A study--a study. So when it comes to \nnailing the consumers going into bankruptcy court, we need laws. When \nit comes to protecting the consumers who are trying to understand the \nterms of credit, they need studies.\n  That isn't balanced. And that isn't fair.\n  I think, frankly, that they have gutted the current law which \nprotects consumers in bankruptcy from creditor abuse and manipulation.\n  This bill rips into low- and middle-income families and still lets \nthe Florida and Texas millionaires hide their assets in mansions \nfeatured in Architectural Digest.\n  What am I talking about? Let's get specific.\n  There is an actor we have all heard of named Burt Reynolds. Mr. \nReynolds is going through bankruptcy. He had a chain of restaurants and \nthat chain of restaurants, unfortunately for him, failed. So when he \nreached the end of his rope, he decided to file for bankruptcy. But Mr. \nReynolds happens to be a resident in the State of Florida.\n  If you happen to be a lucky resident of a State like Florida or Texas \nor Kansas, you can buy whatever size home at whatever expense you care \nto, and basically it is protected from bankruptcy. The rest of us \nliving in other States would find in bankruptcy court that we are only \nprotected to a limited extent. In those States, you are virtually \nunprotected.\n\n[[Page S12144]]\n\n  Mr. Reynolds--this is reported in the newspaper; it is not some \nprivileged information--is going to be able to protect a home in \nbankruptcy valued at $2.5 million.\n  This has been called the worst single scandal and abuse in the \nbankruptcy system.\n  If we set out to clean up the system, how did we overlook this \nglaring problem? Because, frankly, there are an awful lot of \npolitically powerful people who do not want to see this changed.\n  We see a former commissioner of baseball moving to Florida and filing \nfor bankruptcy so he can put as much of his assets as possible into a \nhome that can't be attached under bankruptcy.\n  A former Governor of Texas filing for bankruptcy is buying 200 acres \nof ranch land protected from bankruptcy. And the average person walking \ninto a bankruptcy court across America doesn't have that kind of a \nsweetheart deal.\n  We cleaned that up in the Senate bill. And the conference committee, \nwhen they closed the door, basically stripped it out. They made some \nchanges--I will give them credit for that--some modifications.\n  But when it comes to dealing with the amendment offered by Senator \nKohl of Wisconsin, Senator Sessions of Alabama, they are not even \nclose.\n  If you are talking the shame of bankruptcy, I think it is shameful \nthat we would allow that kind of loophole to continue and say that we \nhave passed a meaningful reform bill.\n  I come here today in opposition to this bill. I am glad that the \nadministration has indicated that it will veto the bill.\n  I have said to Senator Grassley and all others who are interested in \nthis subject that I want a fair bill, one that is fair to consumers as \nwell as to creditors. The door is still open for us to come and sit \ntogether and try to achieve that.\n  But those who think they can push this through, that they can slam-\ndunk this change without taking into consideration the protection of \nconsumers, I think have really done a disservice to families across \nAmerica--families who count on this Senate and their House of \nRepresentatives to listen to their interests, not just to the interests \nof the banks and the credit industry and the institutions which can \nafford the high-paid lobbyists in this town.\n  A few days after our bill passed in the Senate, I ran into a banking \nlobbyist in this town who said to me with a smile, ``When it is all \nsaid and done, your consumer protections are gone.'' She seemed to know \nalready what the outcome would be. I didn't think that was going to \nhappen. I thought when we got into conference we would be able to \nprotect consumers. It didn't happen. What we got was a study--a study \ninstead of a law. A law doesn't protect anybody unless it is enforced. \nAnd a study has never protected anybody even if it is enforced.\n  We need to make certain that if we are going to have real bankruptcy \nreform, it is balanced reform.\n  I hope this conference report is ultimately defeated. I hope it is \nvetoed by the President. I hope we will return to the table and in the \nspirit of bipartisanship guide us to a Senate bill that passed 97 to 1 \non a bipartisan basis. I hope we will come up with that balanced \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois. He did a good amount of work. He worked hard on this bill in \ncommittee. He worked hard on it to the very end. He was a champion of \nit in the committee. It came out of our committee by a 17-to-2 vote. It \npassed in the Senate with only one negative vote. Then we went into \nconference with the House. I am convinced that the bill is better today \nafter having been be in conference than it was before it left, even \nthough I had to give up some things that I favored.\n  I certainly agree with the idea that this homestead situation, where \nmillionaires move off, buy mansions, and then declare bankruptcy, is a \nscandal.\n  But I am telling you, I was amazed how many Senators from States who \nhave those homestead exemptions, mistakenly in my view, felt very \nstrongly that this somehow abrogated their State law, their State \nconstitutions. Their opposition, as Senator Grassley knows, jeopardized \nthe ability of the bill to pass. We made some modest progress towards \nrestraining this abuse.\n  Senator Grassley said he was prepared to let us take it up again next \nyear and see what we could do then. But in order to move the bill, we \nmade some progress rather than no progress on this issue. I certainly \nbelieve we can do better.\n  This bill passed the House with 300 affirmative votes; 75 Democrats \nsupported it. I really do not agree with the assertions that this is \nnot good bipartisan legislation.\n  It really hurts me to hear the Senator say that this bill guts the \nprotections that were in the Senate version. This bill institutes \nprotections for debtors, but it does set some standards in bankruptcy. \nIt will not let an individual come in and wipe out all of their debt \nwithout any explanation or any justification for it. They have to \njustify that they need this radical protection.\n  With regard to the question of fairness, we have been on this bill \nfor years now. Senator Grassley has met and met and met. He worked very \nhard and had the bipartisan support of his Senate Judiciary Committee \nand his subcommittee on this bill. Senator Durbin is the ranking member \nof it. The staff on Sunday met for 7 hours. They met 10 hours with the \nDemocratic staff between Sunday and Wednesday of this week discussing \nthis bill. They were asked to sign the conference report and they chose \nnot to. Those of us who supported the bill signed it. The Democrats \nrefused to do so. Obviously, at some point, they made a decision they \nwere going to object to this bill. I don't believe the majority of the \nSenators want to do that in either party. It came out of this body and \nthe other body with overwhelming support.\n  It is stunning to me. I know there is a campaign theme about this \n``do-nothing Congress.'' The President has been suggesting that.\n  This is a good historic piece of legislation. We haven't made a major \nimprovement bankruptcy laws since 1978. A lot of work has gone into \nthis reform. This is major legislation setting forth major progress. \nAnd, all of a sudden now, at the last minute, all of the objections \ncome up. I suppose they will accuse us of not being able too pass the \nbankruptcy legislation.\n  But I want to say this: I think some people who killed this bill are \ngoing to have to answer why. I don't believe it is going to be a \nsatisfactory explanation to say that they voted against it because it \nprohibited trial lawyers from bringing a bunch of class actions. Only \nwithin the area of a finite part of the bankruptcy law are class \nactions prohibited.\n  That is almost an insignificant part of this bill. And to raise that \nnow and suggest it is a basis to oppose this bill suggests to me just \nhow good a bill it is, if that is all they can find to fuss about. \nMaybe this suggests that it is trial lawyers making the phone calls and \nstirring up the opposition. It really is frustrating to see a man of \nthe ability, the patience and the integrity of Senator Grassley bring \nthis bill up with the great support he had from both parties and see it \nnow being jeopardized by a Presidential veto.\n  I would hate for that to happen. I believe when the President \nactually studies this bill carefully, he is going to conclude ti is a \nhistoric improvement over the present law, that he cannot justify not \nsigning it, that it will be good for America and that he will sign it. \nI certainly hope that is true.\n  Let me mention a couple of things about the bill. We have several \npages of restrictions on credit. There is a whole section of this bill \nentitled ``Enhanced Disclosures on the Open End Credit Plan.'' We went \ninto credit cards and some of that stuff, but this is not a banking \nbill. This is not a credit card bill. This is a bill to improve \nbankruptcy, not credit cards. Attaching and raising all those issues is \nsomething that ought to be done by the Banking Committee. But we \nincluded some restrictions, a number of restrictions, and we put in \nthis bill a study required to be done by the Federal Reserve Board to \nhelp us develop a way to control any abuses in the credit card \nindustry. I think it will be a step forward.\n\n[[Page S12145]]\n\n  This is a not a stonewall. Here at the last minute we don't have to \nbe creating movement from bankruptcy to credit cards. I feel strongly \nabout that.\n  Let me just mention a couple of things the bill does. It, for the \nfirst time, states that if you have plenty of money to pay back a lot \nof your debts, you ought to do so. So if you can pay back 50 percent, \n70 percent of your debts, you ought to go into chapter 13. The court \nwill protect you from lawsuits and creditors, and you set up a payment \nplan and you can pay back those creditors a portion of what you owe if \nyou have sufficient income.\n  Now, the standard used for income is the national median income for a \nfamily of four. This means that the person would have to make over \n$50,000 a year to be required to pay any back. If they make less than \nthat, they can stay in the chapter 7 and wipe out all of their debts. \nSo I don't think the standard is very high at all. But people who are \nwealthy, have money, ought to pay back some of their debts. And many of \nthem can pay all of their debts back.\n  That is the historic step. It is only fair. And it is just not moral \nto allow people to not pay their just debts when they are capable of \ndoing so.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nhas come in the Chamber. I have a couple of minutes remaining. I will \nbe delighted to yield for any comments he has. He has been a strong \nleader in this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  the PRESIDING OFFICER. the Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I want to talk about something very \nsimple. It is about post offices and particularly small town or \ncommunity post offices. Our first Postmaster General was Benjamin \nFranklin, 200 years ago. And, obviously, at that time post offices were \nvery important to Americans. It was a local gathering place; it was a \nmeeting place, in addition to sending and receiving mail. And the same \nis true today in small town America, in some of our smaller communities \nand even some of our larger communities.\n  For example, in my State of Montana, let's take Livingston, the post \noffice is where people meet to compare notes, talk about what the fly \nhatch is on the Yellowstone so they will know what to go fishing with. \nAnd maybe Red Lodge, MT--collect the mail and talk about what happened \nat the most recent track meet. The same is true in Plains, MT, a post \noffice that has been there for 115 years.\n  The problem is this: The Postal Service recently, in my judgment, has \nnot treated communities fairly because it has come in and closed local \npost offices and often rebuilt them outside of town to essentially \ndestroy the local character of the community.\n  Senator Jeffords and I offered an amendment on the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill. It passed the Senate by a vote of 76 to 21. A \nsimilar version passed the House. Essentially, we are just providing \nfor notice so that local communities, when the Postal Service decides \nto come in and close a post office or move it, would have a chance to \nhave a hearing, would have an opportunity to have notice, would have an \nopportunity to have some say in their community.\n  Today, under Postal Service regulations, local people don't have a \nsay. They don't have the ability to influence, in any meaningful way, \nwhere their post office is located or whether it should be closed.\n  I think that is wrong. I regret saying this, but the conferees on the \nbill stripped our amendment, even though it passed the Senate 76 to 21, \nand even though it had very large support in the House.\n  That is just not right. It is not fair. It is not fair to those folks \nin communities who very much rely on their post office. We are just \nasking for a fair process so the local people have the opportunity to \nhave some say in their community so that Uncle Sam, Uncle Postal \nService, doesn't ram down their throats a solution that doesn't make \nsense. I regret to say the conferees did not include it, and next year \nI will reintroduce the legislation, I am sure, along with Senator \nJeffords. That provision, unfortunately, is not in the bill.\n  Again, I thank my good friend from Utah, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12145-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12145-S12148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what this legislation will accomplish is \nstraightforward. If a person is able to repay their debts, they will be \nrequired to do so. We must restore personal responsibility to the \nbankruptcy system. If we do not, every family in America, many of whom \nstruggle to make ends meet, will continue to shoulder the financial \nburden of those who abuse the system.\n\n  It always has been my view that individuals should take personal \nresponsibility for their debts, and repay them to the extent possible. \nUnder the present system, it is too easy for debtors who have the \nability to repay some of what they owe to file for chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. Under chapter 7, debtors can liquidate their assets and \ndischarge all debt, while protecting certain assets from liquidation, \nirrespective of their income. Mr. President, I believe that the \ncomplete extinguishing of debt should be reserved for debtors who truly \ncannot repay them.\n  Mr. President, let's think about this problem in fundamental terms. \nLet's say that somebody owes you money, and is perfectly able to pay \nyou back However, this person finds a clever way under Federal law to \navoid paying you. That would be wrong--it would be unfair. Yet, we are \nallowing this to happen every day in our bankruptcy courts. We have a \nsystem woefully in need of reform. The bankruptcy system was never \nintended to be a means for people who are perfectly able to repay their \ndebts to get out of paying them. It was designed to be a last resort \nfor people who truly need it. What our bill does is allow those who \ntruly need bankruptcy relief to have it, but requires those who can \nrepay their debts to do so. This is not a novel concept. It is basic \nfairness.\n  Americans agree that bankruptcy should be based on need. As this \nchart demonstrates, 87 percent believe that an individual who files for \nbankruptcy should be required to repay as much of their debt as they \nare able to and then be allowed to extinguish the rest. Yet, as stated \nin the Wall Street Journal (Nov. 8, 1996) bankruptcy protection laws \ngive an alarming number of ``obscure, but perfectly legal places for \nanyone to hide assets.'' For instance, one Virginian multimillionaire \nincurred massive debt, but under State law was entitled to keep certain \nhousehold goods, farm equipment, and ``one horse.'' This particular \nindividual opted to keep a $640,000 race horse.\n  This bill does a number of things to make ti harder for people who \ncan repay their debts to avoid doing so by using loopholes in the \npresent bankruptcy system.\n  It provides a needs-based means test approach to bankruptcy, under \nwhich debtors who can repay some of their debts are required to do so. \nIt contains new measures to protect against fraud in bankruptcy, such \nas a requirement that debtors supply income tax returns and pay stubs, \naudits of bankruptcy\n\n[[Page S12146]]\n\ncases, and limits on repeat bankruptcy filings.\n  Mr. President, I am amazed to hear critics of this legislation make \nthe argument that his report does not protect consumers. As recently as \nyesterday, I read that an opponent of this legislation said, ``The \nRepublican conferees stripped out every significant consumer protection \nin the Senate bill, and to add insult to injury, repealed existing \nconsumer protections in the law.'' How, Mr. President, does this bill \n``repeal existing consumer protections?'' Further, I challenge anyone \nwho would make such an unfounded claim to compare the House bill, which \npassed with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 306 to 118, with this \nbalanced conference legislation, and tell me there are no new \nsignificant consumer protections.\n\n  Let's get beyond the politics. Let's stop with the unfounded \ncriticisms of this legislation, and look at what it really gives to \nconsumers:\n  A debtor's bill of rights with disclosure requirements for debtor \nlawyers who advertise. This provision is designed to protect consumers \nfrom ``bankruptcy mills'' that are out to make money without regard to \nconsumers. This provision will protect unwary consumers from being \nlured into bankruptcy without knowing what they are getting into and \nwithout knowing their alternatives.\n  Credit counseling for debtors before they file for bankruptcy, so \nthat they may be able to avoid bankruptcy altogether.\n  New consumers protections with regard to reaffirmations. Every debtor \nwho reaffirms unsecured debt will have the opportunity to appear before \na judge. And, a new heightened standard is required in the review of \neach of these agreements to make sure debtors are not coerced into \nmaking them.\n  New reaffirmation disclosure requirements. Even it a debtor is \nrepresented by counsel, the creditor must give new disclosures to the \ndebtor with regard to the debtor's rights.\n  New penalties for pressuring debtors after discharge. A $1,000 \npenalty plus actual damages and attorneys fees if a creditor violates \nthe post-discharge injunction.\n  New penalties for abusive reaffirmation practices: Another $1,000 \npenalty on top of actual damages and attorneys fees if a debtor is \ninjured by a creditor's failure to follow the procedures for a \nreaffirmation agreement.\n  New penalties for refusal to credit the payment plan properly--again, \n$1,000 plus actual damages and attorneys fees when the creditor refuses \nto credit payments under a plan.\n  New protection for debtors from unjustified motions for dismissal in \nthe form of liability for the debtor's attorneys fees and costs.\n  New penalties for creditors who fail to negotiate. If a creditor \nunreasonably refuses a good faith offer to settle before bankruptcy for \n60 cents on the dollar, the court can decrease the creditor's claim by \nup to 20 percent.\n  New penalties for violating the automatic stay--including actual \ndamages and attorneys fees.\n  New protections from credit card cancellation. A credit card company \nis prohibited from terminating a customer's account solely because the \ndebtor has not incurred finance charges on the account.\n  New credit card warnings and disclosures, including new initial \ndisclosures, new periodic statement disclosures and new annual \ndisclosures about the reality of paying off a balance by making only \nthe minimum payment.\n  A new study on disclosures for closed and open end credit secured by \nthe debtor's house, to be conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, with \nauthority to issue new disclosure regulations.\n\n  A new Fed study on the sufficiency of current consumer protections on \ndebit card liability and the authority to issue new disclosure \nregulations.\n  A report from the comptroller general within 1 year on whether there \nare excessive extensions of credit to college students.\n  And, the bill makes extensive reform to the bankruptcy laws in order \nto protect our children. The bill ensures that bankruptcy cannot be \nused by deadbeat dads to avoid paying child support and alimony \nobligations. The obligation to pay child support and alimony is moved \nto a first priority status under this legislation, as opposed to its \ncurrent place at seventh in line, behind bankruptcy lawyers and other \nspecial interest. With this new law, debtors who owe child support will \nhave to keep paying it when they file for bankruptcy, and they cannot \nobtain a discharge until they bring their child support and alimony \nobligations current. Also, if a debtor pays child support right before \nfiling for bankruptcy, the child support payment can't be taken away \nfrom the kids.\n  The National Association of Attorneys General has told me that they \n``applaud the provisions * * * that improve the tr4atment of domestic \nsupport obligations by ensuring that the spouse and children will \ncontinue to be able to collect support payments they are owed during \nthe bankruptcy case and that debtors will not obtain a discharge until \nthey have met their obligations to their spouse and children.'' The \nattorneys general go on to say that ``these are much needed additions \nto current law, and we strongly support these changes.'' the National \nChild Support Enforcement Association has also written to me in support \nof these improvements to bankruptcy law because of the need ``to \nstrengthen and clarify the rights of separated families during and \nfollowing bankruptcy proceedings.''\n  In addition, this bill protects our children's educations. With this \nlegislation, postsecondary education accounts will be protected in \nbankruptcy up to $50,000 per child or $100,000 in the aggregate.\n  This bill also provides new and important protections for retirement \nsavings. The AARP has stated, ``The accumulation and preservation of \nretirement funds * * * represents an important national goal.'' The \nAARP believes--and I agree with them--that retirement savings should be \nmore uniformly protected, and that ``Shielding retirement funds would \nreduce the likelihood that legitimate petitioners will be impoverished \nlater in life.'' Under this bill, retirement plan assets are \ncategorically untouchable by creditors, even if State exemptions are \notherwise claimed.\n  Furthermore, this legislation keeps drunk drivers from using \nbankruptcy to get out of paying their victims the judgments they owe \nthem.\n  I simply can't believe that opponents of this legislation can say \nwith a straight face that this legislation doesn't help the American \npeople.\n  About $40 billion in consumer debt will be erased this year in \npersonal bankruptcies.\n  Let me put this figure in perspective. $40 billion is enough to fund \nthe entire U.S. Department of Transportation for a year, or to provide \nPell grants to 13 million needy college students.\n  It has been estimated that bankruptcies cost every American family \nabout $400 per year. Apparently, critics of this legislation are \ncontent to throw this money away. But where I come from, $400 a family \nmeans something. It buys 5 weeks worth of groceries, 20 tanks of gas, \n10 pairs of shoes for a grade school child, or more than a year's \nsupply of diapers.\n  Are opponents of this bill really comfortable with the status quo? \nAre they willing to throw away all of the important new consumer \nprotections we have worked for in this bill? Are they willing to have \nretirement savings and educational savings exposed to the claims of \ncreditors in bankruptcy? Are they willing to continue to let deadbeat \ndads use the U.S. bankruptcy system to get off the hook for child \nsupport? Are they willing to let drunk drivers use bankruptcy to get \nout of paying their victims?\n  The only conclusion we can reach is that opponents of this \nlegislation simply never wanted to see bankruptcy reform at all. \nApparently, they are content to do nothing to curb the record increases \nin bankruptcy filings. They are willing to allow people to continue to \n``game'' the bankruptcy system at the expense of honest, hardworking \nAmericans. And, they are happy to sit idly by and do nothing when they \nsee a $400 hidden bankruptcy tax imposed on every American family year \nafter year.\n  It is my sincere hope my colleagues will not derail this bill just to \nmake a political statement, and instead vote their conscience on the \nsubstance, and support this bill. I am also hopeful that the President \nand his advisors will recognize the importance of this bill to the \neconomy and to all consumers.\n\n[[Page S12147]]\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I have heard these arguments from my \ncolleagues on the other side that this process has not been a good \nprocess and all of their consumer protection items have been taken out \nof this bill.\n  Look, I negotiated with the House on this, and we had to do it in a \nvery intensive, tight framework. It was a very difficult thing to do. \nLet me go down through some of the new consumer protections that are in \nthis bill, because nothing could be farther from the truth than for \nthem to come out here and indicate there are no consumer protections.\n  No. 1, we have a Debtor Bill of Rights in this bill, credit \ncounseling; we have judicial review of reaffirmation; we have \nreaffirmation of disclosure requirements; we have penalties for \npressuring debtors after discharge; we have penalties for abusive \nreaffirmation; we have penalties for refusal to credit payments; we \nhave protections from unjustified motions; and penalties for failure to \nnegotiate.\n  This is all for the protection of consumers. Penalties for violating \nautomatic stays, protection from credit card cancellations, credit card \nwarnings and disclosures that we require, rules and study on \ndisclosures, over 100 percent mortgage credit study; we have a study on \ndebit card liability; we have a college student and credit card study. \nAll of this is important, meaning we are going to continue to revisit \nthis and do all of the things we can to do what is right here.\n  We have child support protected, education savings protected, \nretirement savings protected; we have drunk-driving judgments are going \nto get paid.\n  Now, there are a lot of consumer protections here. Look at this: \n``Americans agree bankruptcy should be based on need.''\n\n       An individual who files for bankruptcy should be able to \n     wipe out all their debt regardless of their ability to repay \n     that debt.\n\n  That is 10 percent of the people.\n  The ``DK refused,'' 4 percent.\n\n       An individual who files for bankruptcy should be required \n     to pay as much of their debt as they are able to and then be \n     able to wipe out the rest.\n\n  Eighty-seven percent fit in that category. What does that mean to the \nAmerican taxpayers and the real consumers in this country and everybody \nelse who is paying for this ungodly process? About $40 billion in \nconsumer debt will be erased this year in personal bankruptcy. First, \n$40 billion would fund the entire U.S. Department of Transportation for \n1 year; second, provide Pell grants to 13 million needy college-bound \nstudents; third, ``The Flawed System Costs Every American Household \n$400.'' Just think about that. Last but not least, ``Bankruptcies Cost \nAmerican Families $400 a Year.''\n  That $400 could buy a family of four 5 weeks of groceries, 20 tanks \nof unleaded gasoline 10 pairs of shoes for the average grade-school \nchild, and more than 1 year's worth of disposable diapers.\n  There is a lot we have done here. Is it perfect? No, because we have \ntwo bodies here that have to get together.\n  I would also like to express any disappointment that despite hours \nand hours and numerous meetings between Democrats and Republicans, some \nsay that the process was not fair or somehow excluded Democrat \nparticipation.\n  I lived through years and years of Democrat control of this body, and \nthe other body, and I have to tell you, they were not nearly as fair in \nmost conferences as we have been here in trying to accommodate \nDemocrats--when many did not want to. So we have tried to do it. I \nthink it is just really very phony to go otherwise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senate-House \nConference Report on the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act. I applaud the \nhard work of both the Senate and House conferencees, especially the \nleadership that Senator Grassley has shown on reforming our bankruptcy \nlaws.\n  I believe that this conference report is a balance between preventing \nthe fraud and abuse of our bankruptcy system and protecting those who \nare in considerable economic pain. The increase in bankruptcies has put \na strain on our economy and families. These losses associated with \nbankruptcies have been passed onto consumers, costing every household \nthat pays its bills $400 in hidden taxes. That is not fair to the \nmillions of families who pay their bills every month. This report will \nprohibit fraud, abuse, and the casual use of our bankruptcy laws while \nensuring the payment of child support and alimony.\n  I am disheartened by some of my Democratic colleagues and the \nAdministration's opposition to this conference report. This bill not \nonly reforms our current bankruptcy laws, but places Chapter 12 into \nour bankruptcy code permanently in order to protect family farms and \nfarmers.\n  Farmers in Kansas and across the country are experiencing cash flow \nproblems associated with low commodity prices. U.S. Dept. of \nAgriculture estimated that net farm income would be down by 15.8 \npercent this year. Some economists have indicated that America's \nfarmers could soon see a recession similar to the one which occurred in \nthe mid-1980's.\n  Chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code was created by Congress in 1986 in \nresponse to the farm crisis of the mid-1980's, which caused many family \nfarmers to lose their farms and homes. This chapter was specifically \ndesigned to protect family farmers by enabling them to reorganize their \ndebts and keep their land. However, this chapter has not yet been \nreauthorized and expired on October 1.\n  While I realize both sides of the aisle have differences on how to \nprovide relief to our family farmers during this difficult time, we are \nall unanimous in protecting their farms and homes. Just last year, the \nSenate passed the Family Farmer Protection Act by unanimous consent \nthat would permanently place Chapter 12 in our bankruptcy code. If we \nwant to protect our family farms and farmers during this crisis, we \nmust pass the bankruptcy conference report and place Chapter 12 \npermanently into our bankruptcy code.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I want to express my disappointment with \nH.R. 3150, the Bankruptcy Reform Conference Report, and the decision of \nthe Conference members to drop important provisions that would have \nhelped our farmers.\n  I voted for the Senate version of the bankruptcy bill because I \nbelieve it properly toughened provisions to keep bad seeds from filing \nfor bankruptcy, while maintaining protections for consumers. I voted \nfor the Senate bill because I worked hard to get important protections \nfor farmers added to the bill.\n  The Senate passed a bipartisan piece of legislation that not only was \ncrafted in the best spirit of bipartisanship, but included valuable \nprovisions to help our farmers, who are facing the worst economic \ncrisis in a decade.\n  I, along with my friend from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, worked hard to \nadd provisions to the Senate bill to specifically help family farmers \nby increasing debt limits so that inflation levels are factored into \ntheir debt calculations; ease regulations related to income acquired \noff of the farm by families trying to make ends meet; and help farmers \nbetter structure their debt in order to continue to prepare for next \nseason's crops and livestock.\n  All of these provisions were removed in the Conference Report.\n  I come to the floor today to make something clear. I will not let the \nConference Committee's decision to exclude these important protections \nfor farmers be the final word. I plan on doing everything I can during \nthese remaining days to get these much needed farming provisions \nincluded in the Omnibus Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong concern about \nthe conference report on bankruptcy reform. We do need to stop abuse of \nthe bankruptcy system, and there is some good in this measure. But \nregrettably this is not an adequate solution. I do want to ``proceed,'' \nbut to a better bankruptcy bill.\n  Two weeks ago, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a reform bill which I \nwas proud to support. It targeted the worst abuses by debtors and \ncreditors, without overburdening the vast majority of debtors who truly \nneed--and deserve--relief. Senator Grassley and Senator Durbin deserve \nmuch of the credit for putting together such a balanced and effective \nmeasure.\n  But this bill is not that bill. Let me tell you why.\n  Mr. President, we can't truly ``reform'' the bankruptcy system unless\n\n[[Page S12148]]\n\nwe eliminate the most egregious abuse. That is, debtors who shield \ntheir assets in luxury homes in states like Florida and Texas, while \ntheir legitimate creditors--children, ex-spouses owed alimony, \ngovernments, retailers and banks--get left out in the cold. If we \nreally want to restore the stigma to bankruptcy, all of us know this is \nthe best place to start. By capping the homestead exemption at \n$100,000, the Senate bill would have stopped this abuse.\n  But the Conference Report won't put an end to this practice. Indeed, \nit only addresses part of the problem--by making it harder to move to \nFlorida or Texas solely to take advantage of their liberal homestead \nlaws. Now that is a step forward. But it is just a small step; it does \nnothing to stop debtors who already own lavish homes--or second homes--\nin those states from continuing to live like kings. That's an injustice \nto legitimate creditors and an outrage to anyone who believes--like I \ndo--that deadbeats who go into bankruptcy shouldn't be able to shield \ntheir assets in luxurious homes.\n  Just take a look at what Burt Reynolds did earlier this week. The \nmeasure wouldn't apply to him, because he lives in Florida and that \nstate has no homestead cap. As part of his bankruptcy settlement, he \nmanaged to hold onto his $2.5 million estate called ``Valhalla.'' Now, \nI like Burt Reynolds' movies. I liked ``Deliverance,'' ``Daisy \nMiller,'' and ``The Longest Yard''--though I didn't see ``Boogie \nNights.'' Burt Reynolds is a fine actor. But it seems like he's making \nout much like his title role in ``Smokey and the Bandit.'' While he \nlives in luxury, his legitimate creditors lose millions. The Conference \nReport allows this to happen; the Senate bill would have put an end to \nthis travesty.\n  Of course, the dramatic rise in bankruptcies is very troubling, \nregardless of whether the blame lies with credit card companies, a \nculture that disparages personal responsibility, the bankruptcy code \nor, most probably, with all of the above. While none of us wants to \nreturn to the era of ``debtors' prison,'' we need to do something to \nreverse this trend, reduce the number of bankruptcy filings and make \nsure bankruptcy remains a tool of last resort. This bill does some of \nthat. For example, it discourages repeat filings and it encourages \ndebtors who can repay some of their debts to do so. But Mr. President, \nultimately this Conference Report falls short. Instead of proceeding to \nthis measure, we should proceed to a better bill. And hopefully next \nCongress we will. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the end of the 105th Congress marks the \nbeginning of my transition from Senator to\n\n[[Page S12149]]\n\ncitizen. This ends 24 years for me of public service: Two in the U.S. \nArmy, four as a legislative assistant and district director for then-\nCongressman Dan Quayle, and 18 in the Congress. While I look forward to \nlife after politics, I know how much I will miss this place and its \npeople, and so I want to acknowledge some debts.\n  I want to acknowledge the privilege of serving under two remarkable \nRepublican leaders and one Democrat majority leader, all of whom I hold \na great deal of respect. Senator Mitchell was majority leader when I \narrived. He gave me nothing but the utmost courtesy, fairness and \nrespect. I have a great deal of respect for him in the way he conducted \nthis Senate. Senator Dole became my friend and mentor. His life is a \ntribute to a true patriot and to someone whose commitment to public \nservice, I think, is nearly unequal. Our current leader, Senator Lott, \nis someone who is a dear friend, someone who I greatly respect, and I \nthink certainly has a great future as majority leader.\n  There are many others that have made a deep impression on me and \nprovided friendship and support in ways that I will never be able to \nadequately acknowledge: The senior Senator from Indiana, whose lifetime \nof public service serves as a model to many; my staff, who have \nfaithfully and tirelessly served. I have always said good staff makes \nfor good Senators. I don't know if I fit the quality of a good Senator, \nbut I know I had a good staff. Any failings on my part are not due to \nmy staff, they are due to me. They have been exceptional. I think they \nare the best Senate staff assembled. I say that for the very few who \nare left that have not secured employment. Some of you are passing up \ngreat opportunities if you don't grab them.\n  I have had three very, very able administrative assistants, chiefs of \nstaff: David Hoppe, who now serves as the floor's chief of staff and \nserved with me for my first 4 years; David Gribbin, who many of you \nknow, assistant secretary of staff for Dick Cheney for many, many years \nin the House; and now Sharon Soderstrom. All have been exceptional \nchiefs of staff. They have assembled a wonderful staff.\n  The Senate support team: All those who man the desks and work the \ncloakroom and make sure we vote on time; the guards who protect us and \nmake sure we are safe in our jobs; the staff who serve us, and the \npeople who make this place work, they are a family. They have treated \nme like part of the family. I have tried to treat them as part of the \nfamily. They make it possible for us to do so many things and they \ncertainly deserve our acknowledgment.\n  Our Chaplain, who has meant so much to me from a spiritual \nperspective, and my colleagues, my friends, who I can't begin to thank; \nthose who share my ideals and have voted with me and those who don't \nbut who have engaged in respectful, meaningful dialog in debate, and \nwho, at the end of the debate, we have been able to meet at the center \naisle, shake hands, acknowledge, ``Well done, we will get you next \ntime,'' or ``See you at the next debate?''--all of those mean a great \ndeal to me. I come from here with many, many memories.\n  I want to thank my wife for her love and support and sacrifice. She \nis the best mother that any three children could ever have had. She has \nbeen a father many times when I haven't been there to do the job as a \nfather. My children have been patient and had stolen moments which I \nwill never be able to recover. I thank my colleagues, as I said, those \nwho have shared ideals and those who we had honorable and honest \ndisagreement. Finally, the people of Indiana who have seen fit to elect \nme many times to the Congress and twice to the Senate, thank you for \ngiving me a privilege beyond my ability to earn the privilege of their \ntrust, the honor of their votes.\n\n  In times of change you become reflective, and it is nice to think \nabout your accomplishments. It is also a time to reflect on unfinished \nbusiness, business that I hope will help shape the direction of this \nCongress that some have indicated an interest in, and hopefully others \nwill pick up that interest.\n  By constitutional design, the measure of success in the Senate, I \nthink, is different from other parts of government. We are employed to \ntake a longer view, insulated from the rush of hours to see the needs \nof future years. This is the theory. In practice, the pace of politics \nmakes this very different, very difficult. This has been the greatest \nsource of personal frustration during my years in this institution, \nthat we have not spent nearly enough time dealing with the larger \nissues that face us, things that will matter down the road, topics that \nwill be chapters in American history, not footnotes in the \nCongressional Record.\n  If you allow me the privilege, I will briefly mention three of those \nmatters that I trust will remain central to the questions of our time.\n  All of you know of my interest in the issue of life. I believe there \nis no higher call of government than to protect the most defenseless \namong us. There is no greater honor in this Senate than to use our \nvoice to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. Perhaps \nuniquely among our deliberations, the cause of life is informed and \nennobled by a simple truth: Humanity is not an achievement. It is an \nendowment, and that that endowment is made by a Creator who gives \ninalienable rights, first among them the right to life. This is a \nfounding principle of our political tradition. It is the teaching of \nour moral heritage. And it is the demand of our conscience.\n  Abraham Lincoln wrote of our Founders:\n\n       This was their majestic interpretation of the economy of \n     the universe. This was their lofty, and wise, and noble \n     understanding of the justice of the Creator to his creatures. \n     . . . In their enlightened belief, nothing stamped with the \n     divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be \n     trodden on. . . . They grasped not only the whole race of man \n     then living, but they reached forward and seized upon the \n     farthest posterity. They erected a beacon to guide their \n     children, and their children's children, and the countless \n     myriads who should inhabit the Earth in other ages.\n\n  My question is, Will that beacon shine for all our children, those \nborn and yet to be born? Or will we, in the name of personal liberty, \nstamp out the divine image and likeness of the most defenseless of all? \nI believe it is one of the central questions of our time.\n  I know we are divided on that issue. I hope, though, that we would \nall put aside some of the harsh rhetoric and continue to engage in the \ndiscussion about the meaning and the value of life and what our duties \nand responsibilities are to protect that life, to expand the ever-\nwidening circle of inclusion that our great democracy is known for: \nbringing women, the defenseless, the handicapped, African-Americans and \nminorities within this circle of protection in our democracy. And I \nbelieve--my personal view, and I hope one we would certainly debate and \ndiscuss--that extends to the unborn.\n  Secondly, another great issue that I believe demands our continued \nattention is the long-term strength of our Nation, the resource and \nplanning that we devote to the defense of liberty. Here we are, not \nweak as a nation, but I fear that we are on a trajectory toward \nweakness--that our power and authority are being spent and not \naccumulated.\n  It has been one of the highest callings and privileges for this \nSenator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee and to use that \nposition to advance the cause of our men and women in uniform. I deeply \nrespect and honor those who have served our Nation in war and peace as \nwatchmen on the wall of freedom, but the test of our appreciation is \nmeasurable by the firmness of our determination that their lives will \nnot be needlessly sacrificed because we have allowed the deterrent \npower of America's military to decay. The history of this country is a \nhistory of military victories, but it is also a history of how our \nNation often invited future conflict and unnecessary loss of American \nlife by too swiftly disarming after our victories and squandering the \nopportunities of peace.\n  In 1939, Army Chief of Staff, Malin Craig said:\n\n       What transpires on prospective battlefields is influenced \n     vitally years before in the councils of the staff and in the \n     legislative halls of Congress. Time is the only thing that \n     may be irrevocably lost, and it is the first thing lost sight \n     of in the seductive false security of peaceful times.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe we have been living in peaceful times. We \nhave enjoyed prosperity and peace that is almost unprecedented in \nAmerica these\n\n[[Page S12150]]\n\npast several years. I fear that storm clouds are gathering, however, on \nAmerica's horizon, that the ``seductive false security of our peaceful \ntimes'' is fast fading. We see a frightening proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction. We see worldwide terrorism, much of it directed at \nAmericans and American interests. We see political instability and \nhuman suffering, social disorder resulting from ethnic hatred, power-\nhungry dictators, and the very real prospect of global financial \ndistress with all of its attendant consequences. All of this, I \nbelieve, calls for eternal vigilance, a national defense second to \nnone, a military equal to the threats of a new century.\n  We have a unique opportunity, I believe, and a strategic pause that \nis fast fading to build a new military equal to the new challenges and \nthe new threats of the future. Closer to home, it is my hope that the \nSenate, in every future debate on social policy, will focus on the role \nof families, churches and community institutions in meeting human needs \nand touching human souls. This is a world of heroic commitment and high \nstandards and true compassion that must be respected and fostered and \nprotected, not harassed or undermined by Government or Hollywood. It is \na world of promise that I urge all of you to take the time to discover.\n  I believe our Nation needs a bold, new definition of compassion. We \nneed compassion that shows good outcomes, not just good intentions. We \nneed to get rid of the destructive welfare culture. We have taken a \ngreat step in that direction, but we still need to fulfill our \nresponsibilities to the less fortunate and disadvantaged, the children \nand the helpless. We need to abandon our illusions about Government \nbureaucracies, but we still need to keep our human decency.\n  How is this possible? I am convinced there is a way--a hopeful new \ndirection for change, because there are people and institutions in our \nsociety that can reach and change these things. Families and \nneighborhoods, churches, charities, and volunteer associations have the \ntools to transform people's lives. They can demand individual \nresponsibility. They can practice tough love. They can offer moral \nvalues and spiritual renewal--things that Government can't do, and we \nshould not want Government to do.\n  I believe a bold, new definition of compassion will adopt this bold \ndream: to break the monopoly of Government as a provider of compassion \nand return its resources to individuals, churches, synagogues, \ncharities, volunteer associations, community organizations and others. \nThis, I believe, is the next step of the welfare debate and the next \nstage of reform, the next frontier of compassion in America.\n  Before I close, let me add a personal note, and it is difficult for \nme to say this. I have deliberated long on whether I should say this. \nBut I believe, since I am not going to be here next year, this is \nsomething I would want to have said. So allow me to briefly do that.\n  I resolved when I came here, like many of you, from the moment I took \nthe oath, that I would do my best not to do anything to bring this body \ninto disrepute, that I would try not to tarnish it by word or action, \nthat whatever I did in public policy, I would try my best not to \ncontribute to public cynicism or a diminishing of the office. I think \nall of us feel this burden. It is one of the reasons that I believe \nthis impeachment process, which we are contemplating, which looms large \non the horizon of this Senate, has to be taken seriously. I don't \npresume that any of us should draw a conclusion at this point. But I \nbelieve it is a serious thing to consider. I don't believe that moral \nderegulation of public office is ratified by public apathy. It will be \na terrible thing if the ethical expectations of public office are \nallowed to wither. The Nation could double its wealth, but we could \nhave a shrunken legacy. I believe each of you who will be here have a \nhigh duty and moral responsibility to address this with the utmost \nseriousness and the absolute smallest amount of partisanship that is \npossible, and I speak to my colleagues on the Republican side, as well \nas the Democrat side.\n  It is my hope that when the time comes, the Senate will give evidence \nto the ideals that I have seen displayed so many times in this body. I \nbelieve these things strongly, but I don't want to end on this point. I \nmake the points because I have learned from so many here in the Senate \nand from so many great Americans who served before me how honorable \npublic service can be. I am not leaving the Senate disillusioned in any \nway. I leave having seen how important and how sometimes noble elective \noffice can be, after nearly two decades of service. I believe in this \njob and in its goals, and I am confident that the country is well \nserved by my many friends and colleagues who will continue to serve and \nlead this institution.\n  Again, I thank my great State of Indiana and the people and friends \nwho made it possible for me to serve here. I thank my God for the \nprivilege of service in this place, and I thank each of you for being \nmy friends and my colleagues and leaving me with memories that I will \nnever, ever forget. I will leave here extolling this institution as the \ngreatest deliberative body in the greatest country in the history of \nthe world, and I have been privileged to be a part of it. Thank you \nvery much.\n  [Applause.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12148-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12150-S12151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATOR DAN COATS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while our colleagues express their \nappreciation to our good friend from Indiana, I would like to just say \na few words about him and spread those on the Record of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  We are all losing some good friends in the Senate Chamber this year \non both sides of the aisle, and we will have a chance over the next few \nhours to talk about each one of them. I want to say a few special words \nabout my good friend, Dan Coats.\n  Senator Dan Coats succeeded Senator Dan Quayle in the Senate. He was \na Member of the House, and he worked as a staff member before that. I \nhave actually known this distinguished Senator from Indiana going back \nabout 20 years now, as a staff member, which I was, as a Congressman, \nand as a Senator. I have to say that I truly believe that no man or \nwoman who serves in the Senate today has had a greater influence on my \nown life and on my own career than Dan Coats from Indiana. He was \nalways there for me when I sought advice in the House. And every time I \nhave sought elective office in the Senate, he was one of the \nnominators. I referred to him as my ``rabbit's foot'' because he always \nsaid just the right things. Whenever the going is the toughest, I know \nI can go to Dan and seek good advice, and it will come from him. He is \na man that has his priorities in order--honesty, integrity, family, and \nalso those special things a lot of people don't know about, such as his \ninvolvement in the Big Brothers Program. One of the things he enjoyed \nthe most, which he didn't mention today, is that he served in the House \nfor quite some time as the ranking member on the Select Committee on \nChildren, Youth and Families. He enjoyed that assignment. I always \nwanted to eliminate all of the select committees. But for Dan and that \ncommittee, they did a great service for the families and the children \nof this country.\n\n  Dan is the kind of guy also who will run late to a meeting with the \narchbishop and will stop and visit with a homeless man on the street to \ntry to talk to him about his needs, and try to help him, try to get him \nto go to a shelter. He is really a good human being.\n  He has been a valuable asset to the Senate when it came to our \nservices, when it came to working with any of us who have problems here \nin the Senate.\n  So I am going to dearly miss him as a personal friend, as a great \nSenator, a great family man. He and Marcia are great people. In fact, I \nwas sitting on my patio a couple of weeks ago on Saturday, and I got to \nthinking about Dan Coats. I got melancholy, and I got tears in my eyes. \nI called him on a Saturday afternoon and said, ``You can't leave. I \ncan't go forward in the Senate without you.'' I found out that he and \nMarcia had been playing tennis on a nice clay tennis court instead of \nbeing out campaigning in the backwoods somewhere. And, somehow or \nother, it seemed okay.\n  He is leaving the Senate, but he is not leaving us. I have a feeling \nthat he is going to have a real influence in many ways for the rest of \nhis life, and he is going to stay close to all of us.\n\n[[Page S12151]]\n\n  So on a very personal basis on behalf of the Senate, I wish you God's \ngrace in everything you do, Dan Coats.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to add to the wonderful words \nthat were said about Senator Dan Coats by our distinguished majority \nheader. He has affected many of us. I think by his example we have all \nbeen enriched in this body, and in the U.S. Congress. We thank him very \nmuch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12150-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the bankruptcy \nreform bill that we have just proceeded to and to say that this is a \nvery important reform bill.\n  I want to commend Senator Chuck Grassley for the work he has done on \nthis bill and to specifically talk about one part of this bill which \nwas very important to me. That is the homestead exemption that is a \npart of the Texas Constitution.\n  I worked with Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch when this bill was \ncoming to the floor earlier this month to make sure that, by the time \nthe bill was finished, it would take into account those States that \nhave constitutional provisions, as my State does, which provide for \nsome sort of homestead exemption.\n  In my home State of Texas, we have had a homestead exemption under \nour bankruptcy laws and in the constitution since the 1840s, actually; \nthis is not something that has come about lately. But because many \nfarmers and ranchers were very worried about losing their livelihoods \nif they ever got into a temporary situation--they were worried that \nthey would lose their ability to maintain their families and their \nlivelihoods--so we have a constitutional provision. It was important to \nme that we keep it.\n  The first bill that passed out of the Senate did not have that. But I \nhad the assurance of Senator Grassley that he would work with me to \nmake sure that a State like mine would not be overrun on this very \nimportant point. And, in fact, Senator Grassley is true to his word. I \ncannot say enough good things about the fact that he kept his word to \nthe letter. We were able to come to an agreement that kept the Texas \nconstitutional provision for the homestead exemption intact. That is in \nthe bill that will go forward.\n  I hope we will be able to pass this bill, send it to the President, \nput it on his desk, and that he will sign it. But if in fact that isn't \nthe case, I hope we will be able to work on this next year to have real \nbankruptcy reform so that people will not be able to willingly walk \naway from their debts, but nevertheless that will also take into \naccount that there are States which have constitutions about which we \nfeel very strongly, that this is a part of our heritage. It is one that \nI will work tirelessly to see continued.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. I appreciate very much \nthe opportunity to work on this with Senator Grassley and Senator \nHatch. I hope we will prevail either in the next few days or in the \nnext year.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FORD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the majority leader noted, this is a \nbittersweet time for many of us. We bid colleagues farewell and we \nrecall the times we have had together. In some cases, we have worked \ntogether and shared friendships for many years.\n  I have been asked to do something somewhat unusual tonight. I have \nbeen asked by the staff of our distinguished Senator from Kentucky, my \ndear friend, Senator Ford, to read a letter they have composed to him \nfor the Congressional Record.\n  I am delighted that Senator Ford is on the floor to hear this \npersonally.\n  So, as requested, I will read the letter, which was written by his \nstaff. I know my own staff shares these feelings for Senator Ford. The \nletter is dated October 9, 1998.\n                                                  October 9, 1998.\n       Dear Senator Ford: After several weeks of tributes, \n     receptions, dinners and other special events in your honor, \n     we're sure that a man of your humble nature is probably ready \n     to have people quit making a fuss and let you leave town as \n     unnoticed and as low-key as possible.\n       However, these weeks have given us the opportunity to hear \n     others tell you what we've also known all along: your legacy \n     of serving our state, your labor of love on behalf of all \n     Americans, and the unfailing kindness you've shown during \n     your time in the United States Senate will never be \n     forgotten.\n       On top of just being a plain `ole good boss, you've also \n     been a mentor, a teacher, and someone we could always look up \n     to for guidance and support, no matter the situation. But \n     most importantly, you've been a friend to all of us.\n       You've given us the opportunity on a daily basis to \n     personally witness the countless hours of hard work you put \n     in on behalf of Kentuckians. We've seen you stay into the \n     early morning hours here in the Senate during an all-night \n     session, and then rush to catch an early morning plane for a \n     commitment back home. We've seen you toil late into the night \n     working on a conference committee, only to have you beat us \n     into work the next morning with a smile and joke for \n     everyone.\n       These are some of the things your Kentucky constituents may \n     never have known. But at the same time, we know they've \n     benefitted greatly from your accomplishments on their behalf \n     and your never-ending desire to see that all Kentuckians, no \n     matter their station, have the tools and opportunities to \n     lead successful and productive lives.\n       As we've heard you say many times, it's been a good run. \n     And we could not let today pass without letting you know how \n     much it's meant for us to have had the opportunity to work \n     with you, to learn from you, and have you as our favorite \n     Senator.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Your Staff.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me thank my good friend, the Democratic \nleader, Tom Daschle, for reading this letter. I didn't know it was \ncoming.\n  I really do not know how to respond to it, except to thank my staff. \nWe claim to do a lot of things around here. And if we did not have \nloyal, faithful, hard-working, dedicated, intelligent staff, not only \nin our offices but here on the floor, we would not get accomplished \nnear as much as we do.\n  So I thank them from the bottom of my heart. And I hope that in the \nlast few days I will not get so cantankerous that they will want to \nexpunge the Record of this letter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12151-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12151-S12152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          56 BIT ENCRYPTION IS A GOOD START, BUT IS NOT ENOUGH\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the White House recently announced that it \nwould allow some relaxation of its encryption export controls to allow \nthe sale of strong encryption products to companies in the finance, \ninsurance, and health sectors and to certain companies engaged in \nelectronic commerce. While the specific details have yet to be \narticulated in revised regulations, it appears that the Administration \nis finally heeding Congress' calls to modernize its export control \nregulations. While this action is a step in the right direction, I \nbelieve the Administration is still moving too slowly and \nincrementally. Even with these proposed changes, there are still a \nnumber of other businesses and consumers who will not be able to \nutilize strong American-made encryption products. Since export \nrestrictions will remain in place, foreign suppliers will continue to \ndevelop and sell strong encryption products in the international \nmarketplace without real competition from U.S. providers. Putting $60 \nbillion and over 200,000 American jobs in jeopardy over the next few \nyears.\n  Unfortunately, the Administration continues to pursue an outmoded \npolicy that supports the broad use of 56-bit encryption for the vast \nmajority of computer users. As my colleagues are aware, the government-\napproved 56-bit Data Encryption Standard was recently cracked last July \nin just 56 hours. This is particularly alarming because it was \naccomplished using a single computer instead of the thousands that were \nlinked together just a few months ago to achieve the same result in 39 \ndays.\n\n[[Page S12152]]\n\n  Fortunately, this code-breaking effort was undertaken by contest \nparticipants as part of an international challenge instead of by \nhackers or thieves preying on a vulnerable, unsuspecting target. It is \ntruly scary to see how easy it is for someone's medical, financial, or \npersonal records to be accessed and read by unauthorized persons. \nIronically, the decoded message read, ``It's time for those 128-, 192-, \nand 256-bit keys.''\n  This feat proves what many in Congress have been stating for some \ntime, that 56-bit encryption can no longer protect individual or \ncorporate computer files from unauthorized access. Yet, 56- bit \nencryption continues to be recognized as the government standard and \nU.S. companies can only sell advanced encryption software and hardware \nto a finite community abroad. Let us be clear; the Administration's \nexport regime affects American citizens everywhere. Whether you \ncommunicate via the Internet, or work in the technology business, you \nare likely to be adversely affected by the Administration's current \nencryption policy. A policy that does not allow the sale of strong \nencryption to energy suppliers, telecommunication providers, the \ntransportation industry, human rights organizations and the vast \nmajority of legitimate and responsible business entities and consumers \nthroughout the globe. Ultimately, this approach promotes the use and \ndevelopment of weak encryption. While I welcome the White House's \nrecent announcement to relax some export controls, the Administration's \nproposal simply does not go far enough.\n  Mr. President, it is encouraging that the Minority Leader has \nactively engaged himself on the encryption issue. In a floor speech \nlast July, Senator Daschle agreed that America's encryption policy \nneeds to strike a balance between privacy protections and national \nsecurity and law enforcement interests. The Minority Leader recognizes \nthat the development and use of strong encryption products promote \ninternational commerce and Internet use as well as ensure privacy and \naid national security. Senator Daschle is also equally alarmed that, \n``maintaining existing encryption policies will cost the U.S. economy \nas much as $96 billion over the next 5 years . . .'' I agree with \nSenator Daschle's comments that the Administration needs to articulate \nand advance an encryption agreement that is ``good for consumers, good \nfor business, and good for law enforcement and national security.'' \nSimilarly, we agree that it is time to move beyond endless discussion \nand debate and on to a balanced and complete solution.\n  Mr. President, with every passing month, consumers across the globe \nturn to foreign suppliers for their advanced encryption needs. If a \nsolution that reverses this trend is not found soon, then America's \ncomputer industry will fall so far behind its foreign competitors that \nU.S. suppliers will lose forever their technology market share to \nEuropean, Asian, and other foreign manufacturers. Congress and the \nAdministration cannot allow this happen.\n  As Senator Daschle pointed out, the computer industry and privacy \ngroups are serious about reaching a compromise on encryption. In May, \nfor example, Americans for Computer Privacy (ACP), a technology policy \ngroup, submitted a seven-point proposal to the Administration which \nwould provide U.S. manufactures the ability to sell the kind of \nencryption technology that is already widely available abroad. In July, \nan industry consortium announced the ``Private Doorbells'' proposal to \nassist law enforcement. This proposal was a reasonable attempt to find \nan alternative to the White House`s call for a national key escrow \nframework. Fortunately, the Administration finally appears to recognize \nthat a third party key recovery system is technically unworkable and \nunnecessary.\n  I believe Congress is still interested in modernizing the Nation's \nencryption policy based on current realities. As Senator Daschle \nobserved, several cryptography bills have been offered during this \nsession. Clearly though, they are not all created equal. Some of these \nlegislative proposals would turn back the clock by putting controls on \ndomestic encryption where no such controls currently exist. Others \nwould completely sacrifice constitutional protections by allowing law \nenforcement to read personal computer files without a court order and \nwithout the target ever knowing their files had been accessed. There \nare also proposals that would require an expensive, technically \nunworkable key escrow system. Finally, some members advocate linking \nencryption with other technology issues which could in the end result \nin no legislation being passed at all.\n  The encryption debate cannot be resolved by settling on a specific \nbit-length, giving particular industry sectors export relief while \ndenying others the same, or by sanctioning one technical solution over \nanother. Moreover, this debate will not be resolved by building secret \nbackdoors, frontdoors or any doorways into encryption software.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working further with Senator \nDaschle, my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, the \nAdministration, and the computer industry to help close the gaps that \nstill exist. As the Minority Leader recognizes, this is not about \npolitics or partisanship. This is an urgent matter that requires us all \nto work together to forge an appropriate solution. One that balances \nthe needs of industry, consumers, and the law enforcement and \nintelligence communities. In the end, we must have a consensus solution \nthat brings America encryption policy into the 21st Century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12151-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMENDING THE CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, all across America, people from every walk \nof life carry a vision in their heads and in their hearts of the \nperfect community--of the kind of place where they can raise their \nchildren and their children can in turn raise their children.\n  There's no doubt that everyone's picture would look different, based \non our own experience. But I feel certain they would have many elements \nin common. We want safe neighborhoods. We want to be economically \nsecure. And we want to keep our families healthy. These are the \nbuilding blocks of a liveable community, and the City of Louisville has \nplayed an important role in helping to put them into place, serving as \na model for inner-city revitalization.\n  The city has rehabilitated and built hundreds of housing units, \nthey've created new jobs and businesses, and more families are building \nstable, productive lives. East Russell, an inner-city Louisville \nNeighborhood, has seized the nation's attention by creating a \nrenaissance in that part of the city, bringing it new life and \nvitality. Rightfully so, this revitalization project has received \nattention by mayors and elected officials all over the United States.\n  The University of Louisville's Sustainable Urban Neighborhoods (SUN) \nis devoted to making inner city neighborhoods healthy and safe places \nto live. The project is located at the Center for Urban and Economic \nResearch at the University of Louisville. One of the biggest \naccomplishments of this project has been building affordable houses for \nresidents with a strong cooperative effort by the entire staff, \nincluding the University of Louisville, CityBank, and Telesis, along \nwith many community organizations.\n  Mr. President, the SUN staff--including its Director, Dr. John \nGilderbloom and students from the University of Louisville --and SUN \ncommunity partners have already done so much to strengthen our inner \ncity communities and boost the hopes and spirits of the people living \nthere.\n  I would ask that my colleagues join me today in commending their work \nto make our cities ``dream places'' to live and for their continued \ncommitment to the greater community. And as they host their conference \nthe week of October 15th through the 17th, we wish them the best of \nluck in their continued efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12152-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12152-S12153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DIRK KEMPTHORNE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, while each of us is looking forward to \nadjournment so that we may go home and spend time with our constituents \nand being closer to our family and friends, the end of the 105th \nCongress is a somewhat bittersweet occasion as\n\n[[Page S12153]]\n\nmany of our colleagues are concluding their careers in the Senate. One \nmember who will not be back with us in January is my friend, Senator \nDirk Kempthorne of Idaho.\n  Senator Kempthorne arrived in Washington six-years-ago and very \nquickly established a reputation for not only being dedicated to the \nduties and responsibilities of his office, but for being an individual \nwith a keen mind who approached matters before this body in a very \nthoughtful and deliberative manner. His opinion on issues was always \nwell regarded and void of partisan rhetoric. Though one will never have \nevery member of this Body agree with their position, everyone gave \nconsiderable weight to the remarks and positions of the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  One of Senator Kempthorne's committee assignments was to the Armed \nServices Committee and I quickly spotted his leadership ability, and in \na relatively short period of time, assigned him the chairmanship of the \nSubcommittee on Personnel. This was a demanding job, especially in this \nera when we are not only trying to determine what the appropriate size \nof the military should be, but also because of a number of highly \nemotional issues related to personnel matters. Regardless of the issue \nthat was before his subcommittee, Senator Kempthorne worked hard to \nensure that he discharged his responsibilities impartially, and with \nthe best interests of our men and women in uniform in mind.\n  Beyond earning a reputation for being an intelligent student of \npublic policy, Senator Kempthorne also earned a well deserved \nreputation for being a decent man. He was unfailingly polite and \ncordial to everyone with whom he dealt. Whether it was a witness before \nthe Committee, a debate opponent on the Senate Floor, or one of the \nthousands of support staff that work in the Senate, Dirk Kempthorne was \npleasant, respectful, and cordial.\n  It is truly our loss that Senator Kempthorne has decided to leave the \nSenate and return to Idaho, but the citizens of that state will indeed \nbenefit when our friend is elected Governor. The ability he \ndemonstrated for leadership and civility will serve both he and his \nconstituents well and I am certain that Idaho will be regarded as one \nof the most efficiently run states in the Union before the end of his \nfirst term. My counsel to the members of this Chamber is that Dirk \nKempthorne is a man to keep your eye on, and frankly, I would not be \nsurprised if he were to return to Washington one day, though to take an \noffice that is at the opposite end of Pennsylvania Avenue.

In the almost 45 years I have \nspent in this institution, I have had the good fortune to serve with a \nnumber of very capable, dedicated, and selfless individuals who have \nworked hard to represent their constituents and do what is best for the \nnation. One person who is an excellent example of the high caliber of \nperson who is drawn to public service is my good friend and colleague, \nDan Coats.\n  The Mid-West has the uncanny way of producing men and women of \nimminent sense and decency, individuals who have the ability to see to \nthe heart of a matter and find a way to resolve a problem. Such skill \nis extremely valuable in the United States Senate, a body by its very \ndesign that is supposed to foster compromise between legislators on \nissues before the nation. Without question, Dan Coats is a Senator who \nworked hard to bring parties together, find common ground, and to get \nlegislation passed. That is certainly a fine legacy with which to leave \nthis institution.\n  More than being an able legislator, Senator Coats developed a strong \nexpertise on defense matters, particularly those related to his \nresponsibilities as Chairman of the Airland Subcommittee of the \nCommittee on the Armed Services. In this role, Senator Coats was \nresponsible for providing advice and helping shape policy on matters \nrelated to how to describe what the threat and future threats to our \nNation are, how our military should be structured in order to guarantee \nour security, and what sort of ground and aviation assets our troops \nneed in order to do our jobs. Senator Coats had to be well versed in \neverything from the GoreTex booties that go into the boots of our \nsoldiers to the advanced aerodynamical concepts that are being used in \nthe helicopters and jets being developed for our forces. Few other \nindividuals could have mastered these disparate topics so well, and \nthat Senator Coats was able to do so, and make it look so easy, is a \ntestament to this man's intellect, dedication, and ability.\n  Without question, we are going to miss the many contributions of \nSenator Coats, both to the Committee and to the full Senate. He had a \nwry sense of humor, a civil demeanor, and a desire to serve our nation. \nHis departure from the Senate is truly a loss, but I am confident that \nhe will continue to find a way to serve and to make a difference. I \nwill miss him, both as a friend and a colleague, and I would like to \ntake this opportunity to wish both he and his lovely wife Marcia great \nsuccess and happiness in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12153-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF SENATOR JOHN GLENN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, though the 105th Congress will soon come \nto a close, and each of us will return home to meet with constituents, \nor take fact finding trips throughout the nation or the world, one of \nour colleagues has not only already left town, but is headed for a most \nunusual destination, that of outer space. I speak, of course, of our \nfriend, John Glenn who is ending his career in the United States \nSenate.\n  Like most people, I first learned of John Glenn in 1962 when he \norbited the Earth, but when the people of Ohio elected him to this Body \nin 1974, I had the opportunity to come to know him personally. In the \nsubsequent years, we worked closely together on a number of issues, \nespecially those related to national security as we served together on \nthe Senate Committee on the Armed Forces. Naturally, his experiences as \na Marine Corps officer gave Senator Glenn valuable insight into defense \nmatters and he played an important role on the Committee and in working \nto help provide for a military adequately capable of protecting the \nUnited States.\n  The same qualities that made John Glenn a successful Marine and \nastronaut, served him well here in the United States Senate. Without \nquestion, he is a determined man who has earned our respect for his \nhonor, ability, and dedication. His desire to serve our nation is an \ninspiration, and in keeping with the highest traditions of public \nservice. Without question, he has set an excellent example for others \nto follow and it is my hope that more people, from Ohio and throughout \nthe United States, will follow his lead and find a way to make a \ndifference in their communities and to our nation.\n  Mr. President, the United States Senate will just not be quite the \nsame place without the presence of Senator John Glenn. We appreciate \nthe many ways in which he has served so admirably and wish both he and \nhis lovely wife Annie health, happiness, and success in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12153-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12153-S12154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR WENDELL FORD\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Kentucky is famous for many things, \nincluding its bourbon and the Derby, but what I have come to associate \nmost with the ``Bluegrass State'' over the past 24-years is Senator \nWendell Ford, who I regret to note is leaving the Senate at the end of \nthe 105th Congress.\n  Senator Ford is a man with a deep and unwavering commitment to public \nservice. He served in the United States Army during World War II and \ncontinued his military service as a member of the Kentucky National \nGuard. He has held elected office at both the state and federal levels, \nholding the titles of\n\n[[Page S12154]]\n\nstate senator and governor before being elected to the United States \nSenate in 1974.\n  Each of us understands that our primary job as Senators is to make \nthe law, but many of us also believe that we should use our offices to \nhelp the people of our states. This is a sentiment that Senator Ford \nand I share, and over the years, my friend from Kentucky has worked \ntirelessly to help his state develop and prosper. While Kentucky, like \nSouth Carolina, is still a largely rural state, thanks in no small part \nto the efforts of Wendell Ford, the people of Kentucky are enjoying \nopportunities and economic growth that has been substantial.\n  During his time in Washington, Senator Ford has held a number of key \npositions, both in the Senate and in political organizations. His \nleadership roles as an Assistant Leader and a former Committee Chairman \nstand as testament to both his abilities and the regard in which he is \nheld by his peers.\n  I am certain that Senator Ford did not easily come to the decision to \nretire, but I am certain that he and his lovely wife Jean are looking \nforward to their new life. I wish both of them health, happiness and \nsuccess in whatever endeavor they undertake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12153-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, one of the things that makes the Senate \nsuch a unique and enjoyable place to work is the fact that there are \n100 unique personalities that make up this institution. While each \nmember takes his or her duties seriously, I hope that I do not offend \nanyone when I say that not all are gifted orators. One person who \ndefinitely can engage in articulate and compelling debate, and is also \nable to bring a little levity to our proceedings through his wit and \nability to tell a story is the Senator from Arkansas, Dale Bumpers.\n  First elected to the Senate in 1974, Senator Bumpers arrived with an \nalready well established and well deserved reputation for having a \ncommitment to serving is constituents and our Nation. He served in the \nUnited States Marine Corps during World War II, as well as the Governor \nof Arkansas, having been elected to that post in 1970. Clearly, his \ntraining as the chief executive of his home State, along with \nexperiences as a trial lawyer, gave him the skills that would make him \nan effective and respected Senator.\n  For the past more than 20-years, Senator Bumpers has worked hard to \nrepresent his State, and in doing so, has made many valuable \ncontributions to the U.S. Senate. I regret that we have not shared any \ncommittee assignments, but I have always respected and valued the \nopinions of the Senator from Arkansas. His exist from the Senate leaves \nthis institution without one of its most impressive and effective \nadvocates.\n  I am certain that Dale  and his lovely wife Betty will enjoy the more \ndeliberate lifestyle and pace that bring out of politics will afford \nthem and I wish the both of them health, happiness and success in the \nyears ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12154-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SECRETARY OF THE NAVY JOHN H. DALTON\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the framers of the Constitution \nworked to lay out the foundation of the United States, they very wisely \ndecided that the military forces of this nation should be subservient \nto civilian leadership. For the past 224 years, this arrangement has \nworked well proving the wisdom of the men who drafted the document that \nserves as the cornerstone of our democracy and government.\n  One of the reasons that civilian leadership of the military has \nworked so well is because Presidents search tirelessly to find \nqualified individuals to fill the critical positions of the service \nsecretaries. If we were to look across the Potomac and into the ``E'' \nring of the Pentagon, we would find a group of selfless men and women \nserving as the civilian leadership of America's armed forces. One of \nthose individuals is Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton, who will be \nstepping down from his position at the end of this year.\n  When John Dalton raised his right hand on July 22, 1993, swore his \noath and became the 70th Secretary of the Navy, he came to the office \nwell trained to discharge the duties of his new office. Not only was he \na successful corporate executive with invaluable experience in managing \na large organization, he graduated from the United States Naval Academy \nand served as an officer aboard the submarines USS Blueback and USS \nJohn C. Calhoun. Additionally, he served in the Carter Administration \nas a member and chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.\n  The challenges of essentially being the first post-Cold War Secretary \nof the Navy were significant. Secretary Dalton had the unenviable task \nof being responsible for the reshaping of the Navy and the Marine Corps \nto meet the security needs of the United States in a world that is no \nlonger bi-polar. Under his direction, the Navy and the Marine Corps \nimplemented the new doctrines of ``Forward, From the Sea: Anytime, \nAnywhere'', and ``Operational Maneuver from the Sea'', both which will \nhelp America meet its short and long-term tactical and strategic needs. \nFurthermore, Secretary Dalton worked to achieve acquisition initiatives \nseeking to establish practices resulting in the procurement of the best \nequipment for our sailors and marines, at the fairest cost to the \ntaxpayer. The new attack submarine teaming arrangement, the DDG-51 \nmulti-year procurement, and the testing and evaluation of the F/A-18 E/\nF are all examples of such successful endeavors.\n  Unquestionably, the Navy and Marine Corps that Secretary Dalton will \nturn over to his successor are institutions that have benefitted from \nthe leadership of this charismatic and kind Texan. His efforts have \nearned him the respect and accolades of people in the Congress, in the \nExecutive Branch, in industry, in academia, and around the world, and \neven resulted in his being awarded with the National Security Caucus' \nprestigious International Leadership Award in 1997. He is the first \nservice secretary to be recognized in this manner and his winning this \naward is a testament to the regard in which he is held.\n  Mr. President, I have worked with a lot of service secretaries in my \nalmost 45 years in this body and I say without reservation that John \nDalton is one of the finest individuals to have ever served in that \ncapacity. He is a man of honor, ability, and dedication and he will \ncertainly be missed. I know that everyone in this chamber joins me in \nwishing him ``fair winds and following seas'' as he completes his \npublic service to the Department of the Navy and the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12154-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12154-S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PASSAGE OF THE YEAR 2000 INFORMATION AND READINESS DISCLOSURE ACT, S. \n                                  2392\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Y2K bill demonstrates successful \nbipartisanship and cooperation, and how well Congress can work together \nwhen it wants to. Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, Senators \nHatch, Bennett, Dodd, Thompson, Kyl and I, along with others, have \nworked with the Administration and the House of Representatives to \ncreate and pass this legislation. I thank them for their hard work and \ndedication to this issue.\n  Four-hundred and forty-nine days from now, millions of computers \ncontrolling our air traffic, recording stock and credit card \ntransactions, running electric and telephone systems, tracking bank \ndeposits and monitoring hospital patients may crash in befuddlement. \nAll of this is due to the short-sighted omission of a couple of digits, \na one and a nine, from computer chips. Passage of this bill is a signal \nto the world that by acting now, we can work together to avoid these \nproblems.\n  The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act will not \neliminate the millennium bug--regrettably, no legislation could do \nthat. However, it will greatly increase the chances that industry, \nuniversity and government experts will work cooperatively to come up \nwith the solutions.\n  One of the scariest aspects of the Y2K bug has been the silence of \nbusinesses and industries in the face of this common enemy. Liability \nconcerns have muted industry experts, dashing the best hopes for \ndeveloping fixes for this problem. The Year 2000 Information and \nReadiness Disclosure Act was designed to overcome this isolation and \ncreate a free flow of constructive information.\n\n[[Page S12155]]\n\n  The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act will encourage \nthe sharing of knowledge and working together to create solutions. This \nbill does not give companies liability protection for their products or \nservices. Rather, for a limited time it will provide adjusted \nprocedures for the exchange of Year 2000 information. This is our best \nbet to ensuring that services and products will continue operating \nafter midnight on December 31, 1999.\n  This bill also includes a provision I proposed that will assist \nconsumers, small businesses and local governments. It charters a \nnational information clearinghouse and website as a starting point to \nprovide rapid and accurate information about solving Y2K problems. This \nwill be a needed tool for small businesses, local governments and \ncitizens so they can prepare for the millennium.\n  I want to thank the President and Vice President for their foresight \nin this issue, and the corporate leaders who worked together with us to \nget this done. Major industries--from telecommunications, electric, \ncomputer, transportation, energy, health, insurance and many others--\npitched in and listened to each other and worked together. I \ncongratulate and thank Senators for their unanimous support for this \nmeasure. It is reassuring to know that even in the midst of other \ndramas, Congress can come together to tackle fundamental issues \nconfronting our national economy and security. I look forward to the \nPresident signing this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12154-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NEXT GENERATION INTERNET RESEARCH ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that last night the Senate \ntook up and passed H.R. 3332.\n  I first introduced my domain name study bill, S. 1727, on March 6, \n1998. It was cosponsored by Senator Ashcroft on May 21, 1998 and passed \nthe Senate on June 26, 1998 as an amendment to S. 1609, Senate \nlegislation to authorize the Next Generation Internet program. The \nHouse passed a very similar domain name study bill on September 14, \n1998 as part of H.R. 3332, its legislation to authorize the Next \nGeneration Internet program. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported \nout a substitute amendment to S. 1727 on September 17, 1998 that was \nidentical to the domain name study language that is in H.R. 3332. Now, \nwith the Senate passage of H.R. 3332, the domain name study language \nwill be presented to the President for his signature into law.\n  The Leahy/Ashcroft domain name study legislation that is incorporated \ninto H.R. 3332 authorizes the National Research Council (NRC) of the \nNational Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the \neffects on trademark rights of adding new generic top level domain \nnames (gTLDs), and related dispute resolution procedures.\n  When I first introduced this bill in March, it was, in part, a \nresponse to the Administration's Green Paper released on January 30, \n1988, on the domain name system (DNS), which suggested the addition of \nfive new generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs).\n  Although adding new gTLDs, as the Green Paper proposed, would allow \nmore competition and more individuals and businesses to obtain \naddresses that more closely reflect their names and functions, I was \nconcerned as were many businesses, that the increase in gTLDs would \nmake the job of protecting their trademarks from infringement or \ndilution more difficult. In addition, increasing the number of gTLDs \nwithout an efficient dispute resolution mechanism had the potential of \nfueling litigation and the threat of litigation, with an overall \nchilling effect on the choice and use of domain names.\n  The Green Paper properly raised the important questions of how to \nprotect consumers' interests in locating the brand or vendor of their \nchoice on the Internet without being deceived or confused, how to \nprotect companies from having their brand equity diluted in an \nelectronic environment, and how to resolve disputes efficiently and \ninexpensively. It did not, however, answer these complex and important \nquestions. Dictating the introduction of new gTLDs without analyzing \nthe impact that these new gTLDs would have on trademark rights and \nrelated dispute resolution procedures seemed like putting the cart \nbefore the horse.\n  The Leahy/Ashcroft domain name study bill is intended to put the \nhorse back before the cart. We should understand the effects on \ntrademark rights of adding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution \nprocedures before we move to add significant numbers of new gTLDs. \nSince its introduction in March, groups such as ATT, Bell Atlantic, \nTime Warner, the International Trademark Association, the Information \nTechnology Industry Council, the Motion Picture Association of America, \nthe Domain Name Rights Coalition, and the American Intellectual \nProperty Law Association, amongst others, have endorsed this \nlegislation reflected in the Leahy-Ashcroft domain name study bill.\n\n  The Administration's White Paper, released on June 5, 1988, backed \noff the Green Paper's earlier suggestion to add five new gTLDs. \nInstead, the White Paper proposes that the new corporation would be the \nmost appropriate body to make decisions as to how many, if any, new \ngTLDs should be added once it has global input, including from the \nstudy called for in the Leahy-Ashcroft domain name bill. Specifically, \nthe White Paper calls upon the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization, inter alia, to ``evaluate the effects, based on studies \nconducted by independent organizations, such as the National Research \nCouncil of the National Academy of Sciences, of adding new gTLDs, and \nrelated dispute resolution procedures on trademark and intellectual \nproperty holders.''\n  I commend the Administration for the deliberate approach it has taken \nto facilitate the withdrawal of the U.S. government from the governance \nof the Internet and to privatize the management of Internet names and \naddresses. We should have a Hippocratic Oath for the Internet--that \nbefore we adopt any new regimen that affects the Internet, we should \nmake sure we are doing no harm to this dynamic medium.\n  In order for the WIPO study to be able to evaluate the effects, based \non studies conducted by independent organizations, such as the NRC, of \nadding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution procedures on trademark \nrights, the Leahy/Ashcroft domain name study legislation in H.R. 3332 \ninstructs the NRC to release an interim report that can be considered \nbefore the release of the March 1, 1999 WIPO study. I believe it \nbeneficial, however, for the final report of the NRC to still be \nreleased after the WIPO study, so that the NRC can take into account \nthe results and recommendations offered by the WIPO study and offer its \ncomments on the WIPO study.\n  One might ask whether the NRC report is necessary, given the fact \nthat WIPO will also be doing a study. I believe that the answer is a \nresounding ``yes''. Since the Internet is an outgrowth of U.S. \ngovernment investments carried out under agreements with U.S. agencies, \nmajor components of the DNS are still performed by or subject to \nagreements with U.S. agencies. Examples include assignments of \nnumerical addresses to Internet users, management of the system of \nregistering names for Internet users, operation of the root server \nsystem, and protocol assignment. although U.S. government management of \nthe Internet's most basic functions will soon be phased out, it is \nstill not clear who will be running the new nonprofit corporation \nwhich, according to the Administration's White Paper, will oversee the \ndomain name system. Moreover, the U.S. leads the world in the creation \nand dissemination of intellectual property. Given the U.S. interests \nthat are at stake and the uncertainty in who will run the domain name \nsystem and how it will affect U.S. stakeholders, I think it important \nthat a U.S. entity examine the issue of adding new gTLDs and related \ndispute resolution procedures on trademark rights. As important as it \nis for WIPO to benefit from an objective U.S. entity's perspective on \nthis matter, I also think that an objective U.S. entity should be \ntasked with considering whatever recommendations are issued by WIPO.\n  I am therefore pleased that the Senate passed H.R. 3332 last night \nwith the Leahy/Ashcroft domain name study bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12155-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12155-S12156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I would like to take just a moment to note \nthe departure later this month of my Administrative Assistant, Robert \nDibblee. Robert has served as my chief of staff for four years. He \npreviously served a number of years with our former colleague, Senator \nJake Garn.\n  He has been my right-hand man, not only in running my office --\nrunning my life actually--but also on key land policy issues affecting \nUtah. I have really come to rely on him for advice and counsel as well \nas for accomplishing the myriad of tasks that face a Senate office.\n  I want to use this public forum to recognize and thank Robert for his \ntireless efforts behind the scenes to keep the Utah Schools and Lands \nExchange Act, just passed by the Senate, on track. From the day he \narrived on my staff in 1993, I knew he would make my priority his own. \nI should mention that the first iteration of this legislation was my \nbill, S. 184, introduced during the 103rd Congress. The bill was \nenacted into law; but, unfortunately, the required land appraisals were \nnever carried out by the Interior Department. And, the presidential \ndesignation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in 1996 \ndoubled the number of acres of trust land that needed to be offset or \ncompensated.\n  Robert has worked practically on a daily basis on this issue with the \nUtah governor's office, the Interior Department, members and staff of \nthe Senate Energy Committee, and with the staff of my colleagues in the \nUtah delegation, particularly Congressman Jim Hansen, without whose \nassistance as chairman of the House Resources Subcommittee we could not \nhave passed the bill today.\n  During this final week, Robert worked to break several logjams that \ncould have sunk this legislation. Throughout the consideration of this \nbill, he has been a steady and reliable guide for this all-important \nbill to support education in Utah.\n  Robert is moving on to be Vice President for Government Relations for \nthe National Association of Independent Insurers.

Mr. President, when this Congress adjourns the Senate will \nlose its distinguished Minority Whip, the senior Senator from Kentucky, \nWendell H. Ford. Wendell Ford has earned a reputation as the Senate's \nleader on aviation matters, and has long been one of the most \ninfluential members of the Senate on energy and election reform issues. \nHe has battled for campaign finance reform legislation and led the \nfight for the ``motor voter'' bill which has expanded voter \nregistration across the country.\n  There is no member of the Senate more well-liked by his colleagues \nthan Wendell Ford. However, I have often thought that one of the true \nmeasures of a Senator is how she or he relates to staff members, \nworkers and other visitors to our nation's capital. Wendell Ford is \namong the most beloved.\n  I think back to one particular incident. A member of my staff had \nbrought his 5-year old son to work for the day. The staff member, \nneeding to attend an important meeting, left his son to play with \npaper, crayons and stapler, under the supervision of several co-\nworkers. He returned to find his son no longer at the desk where he had \nbeen left. A quick search followed. The young boy was found just \noutside the office in the Senate hallway where he had stopped Senator \nWendell Ford and attempted to sell him a book (artful pages of crayon \nscribbles, stapled together) for a nickel. Senator Ford was in the act \nof earnestly requesting two and trying to convince the young man to \naccept a dime as superior to the requested nickel.\n  Last March, Wendell Ford became the longest serving senator from \nKentucky in the history of the U.S. Senate when he surpassed another \nbeloved Kentuckian, Alben Barkley.\n  Wendell Ford is unsurpassed in many things: He is unsurpassed in his \nlove of family, love of country and love of the U.S. Senate. He is \nunsurpassed in his efforts to be helpful to new members. How many times \nhe has set aside personal needs or took the time to help newcomers to \nthis body to weather the self doubts or maneuver through the complex \nprocedures.\n  Wendell Ford is unsurpassed in his commitment to the hard working \nfamilies whom are the backbone of this nation and in his passion for \nthe ``little guy''.\n  Mr. President, to me, the story I told of the little boy in the \nSenate hall characterizes Wendell Ford. Wendell is a genuine, kind, \nstraight-forward and thoughtful man as well as an effective national \nleader. All of us in the United States Senate and our families will \nmiss the inimitable Wendell Ford and his wife, Jean.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12156-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DAN COATS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when the Congress ends, Senator Dan Coats \nof Indiana will retire from the Senate. Dan Coats and I have served \ntogether on the Armed Services Committee and the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  On the Armed Services Committee, Dan Coats has served ably as the \nChairman of the Airland Forces Subcommittee. He is a forceful proponent \nof a strong national defense and has consistently supported efforts to \nassure that our men and women in the military remain the best trained \nand equipped in the world.\n  Although Dan Coats was one of the leading proponents in the Senate of \nthe version of the line-item veto which was passed and signed into law, \nand I joined with Senators Byrd and Moynihan in arguing in an amicus \ncuriae brief to the Supreme Court that that legislation was \nunconstitutional, I greatly respected the diligence and integrity with \nwhich he fought that battle.\n  My friend from Indiana and I have worked together for several years \nto prevent our states and communities from becoming dumping grounds for \nsolid waste from other areas of the country and outside the country. He \nhas been a persistent advocate of giving states and local governments \nthe power to stem the flow of garbage flooding into their \njurisdictions. I would like to thank him for all he has done on this \nmatter, hopefully paving the way to a resolution which will give more \npower to the people whose quality of life is being harmed by a free \ninterstate flow of trash.\n  Mr. President, Dan Coats' outstanding service as a United States \nSenator came as no surprise to me or my constituents. He was born and \nraised in Jackson, Michigan and naturally this has prepared him, like \nmost Michiganders, to excel in life. However, even though he has \nwandered off to Indiana, and wandered even further into the GOP, I have \nenjoyed the opportunities which I have had to work with Dan Coats and \nwill miss his friendship next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12156-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12156-S12157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF SENATOR JOHN GLENN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when the 105th Congress adjourns sine die \nin the next few days, the Senate will lose one of our nation's true \nheroes, and one of\n\n[[Page S12157]]\n\nmy personal heroes, Senator John H. Glenn, Jr. of Ohio. I rise today to \npay tribute to this great American, a man I feel genuinely honored to \ncall my friend.\n  All of us old enough to remember John Glenn's flight into orbit \naround the earth on February 20, 1967 aboard Friendship 7 stand in awe \nof his courage and strength of character. But this enormous \naccomplishment followed on a distinguished record of heroism in battle \nas a Marine officer and pilot. He served his country in the Marine \nCorps for 23 years, including his heroic service in both World War II \nand the Korean conflict. And, in turn, his remarkable accomplishment in \nthe history of space flight has been followed by an extraordinary \nSenate career over the past 24 years, as the only Ohio Senator in \nhistory to serve four consecutive terms.\n  For the 20 years that I have been in the Senate, I have served side \nby side with John Glenn in both the Governmental Affairs Committee \nwhich he chaired for many years and now serves as Ranking Minority \nMember and the Armed Services Committee where he serves as the Ranking \nMinority Member of the Subcommittee on Airland Forces. More recently, I \nhave served with John Glenn on the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence. This has given me a front row seat to watch one of the \ngiants of the modern day U.S. Senate do the hard, grinding work of \nlegislative accomplishment.\n  Over the years, John Glenn has led the fight for efficiency in \ngovernment, for giving the American people more bang for that tax \n``buck''. He was the author of the Paperwork Reduction Act. He has \nworked to streamline federal purchasing procedures, and led the fight \nto create independent inspectors general in federal agencies. He was \nthe point man in the Senate for the Clinton Administration's battle to \nreduce the size of the federal workforce to the lowest levels since the \nKennedy Administration. He and I have fought side by side to block \nextreme efforts to gut regulatory safeguards in the name of reform and \nfor the passage of a sensible approach to regulatory reform to restore \nconfidence in government regulations. Throughout his career, John Glenn \nhas made himself an enemy of wasteful spending and bureaucracy, yet a \nfriend of the dedicated federal worker.\n  John Glenn has steadfastly served as a powerful advocate for \nveterans. He led the effort to bring the Veterans Administration up to \ncabinet-level and to provide benefits to veterans of the Persian Gulf \nconflict.\n  On the Armed Services Committee, John Glenn has brought his enormous \ncredibility to bear time and again both in that Committee and on the \nIntelligence Committee on the side of needed programs and weapons and \nagainst wasteful and unnecessary ones like the B-2 bomber.\n  Perhaps John Glenn's most important role, however, has been as the \nauthor of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act and as the Senate's leader \nin fighting the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world. In \nthis area, the Senate will sorely miss his clear vision, eloquent voice \nand consistent leadership.\n  Mr. President, John Glenn, of course, has remained the strongest and \nmost effective voice in the Senate for the nation's space program. Many \nof us will be on hand to watch the launch of his second NASA mission \nlater this month, 31 years after the first. At age 77, John Glenn has \nvolunteered to go back into space to test the effects of weightlessness \non the aging process, and once again inspires our nation and sets an \nexample for us all--an example of courage, character, sense of purpose, \nand, yes, adventure.\n  No person I've known or know of has worn his heroism with greater \nhumility. John Glenn is, to use a Yiddish word, a true mensch, a good \nand decent man.\n  John Glenn and his beloved wife, Annie, are simply wonderful people. \nThey, their children and grandchildren are the All-American family. My \nwife Barbara and I will keenly miss John and Annie Glenn as they leave \nthe Senate family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12156-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the United States Senate is about to lose \none of the great orators of its long history. I never had the \nopportunity, of course, to hear Webster or Clay or Calhoun. But, I have \nheard Dale Bumpers of Arkansas on the Senate floor and it's hard to \nimagine anyone could have been a more forceful, eloquent, or effective \nspeaker.\n  I was reminded recently by a former staff member of one debate in \nparticular. The issue was the proposed real estate development in \nNorthern Virginia at the site of the Second Battle of Manassas. The \ndebate had stretched into a Friday evening and a larger than usual \nnumber of Senators were on the floor. The manager had made an effective \npresentation when Dale Bumpers, the author of a more restrictive \nversion of the bill rose to speak.\n  Knowing that many of his colleagues love history, Dale Bumpers using \ndetailed maps laid out the story of the Second Battle of Manassas more \nthan a hundred years ago. Every Senator on the floor that night \nlistened with rapt attention. As he reached the climax of his \nperformance, Dale Bumpers said:\n  ``Well, I could go on and on, but I want to just simply say . . . I \nbelieve strongly in our heritage, and I think our children ought to \nknow where these battlefields are and what was involved in them. And, I \ndon't want to go out there ten years from now with my grandson and tell \nhim about the Second Battle of Manassas . . . and he says, ``Grandpa, \nwasn't General Lee in control of this war here--didn't he command the \nconfederate troops.?''\n  ``Yes, he did.''\n  ``Well, where was he?''\n  ``He was up there where that shopping mall is.''\n  Senator Bumpers then said, ``I can see a big granite monument inside \nthat mall's hallway right now: `General Lee Stood On This Spot'. Now if \nyou really cherish our heritage, as I do, and you believe that history \nis very important for our children, you'll vote for my amendment.''\n  Rarely in the modern Senate do we see issues actually decided in \ndebate on the floor. But, I suspect that that night I watched Dale \nBumpers, with that speech, win the ``Third Battle of Manassas''.\n  Dale Bumpers has served in the Senate for four terms. He has been one \nof the most consistent voices for elimination of wasteful government \nspending. We will all miss his leadership in efforts to reform federal \nmining law and grazing fees. His battles against the Clinch River \nBreeder Reactor which he won in 1984, the superconducting super \ncollider which he finally won in 1993 and the space station which he \ndid not win, have become legendary.\n  Dale Bumpers and I both take pride in the fact that we were among the \nfew Senators to vote against the Reagan tax cut and unfunded defense \nbuildup of 1981 which together led to the huge deficits of the 1980's.\n  Dale would have made a great President because he is a person whose \nclarity of expression is matched by the courage of his vision and his \ncommittment to America's working families.\n  Mr. President, when the 106th Congress convenes next year, the Senate \nwill seem an emptier body in the absence of one of its most memorable \nleaders and all of us in the Senate family with miss Dale and Betty \nBumpers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12157-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12157-S12158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DIRK KEMPTHORNE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a colleague and \nfriend who will be leaving the Senate when the 105th Congress adjourns, \nDirk Kempthorne, the junior senator from Idaho.\n  I have served with Dirk Kempthorne on both the Armed Services and \nSmall Business Committees where I have come to respect his \nthoughtfulness, dedication and hard work.\n  Dirk Kempthorne has been a valuable member of the Armed Services \nCommittee where he has served as the Chairman of the Personnel \nSubcommittee. As Chairman, he has demonstrated a commitment to the \nwelfare of our men and women in uniform and their families.\n  Senator Kempthorne joined with Senator Byrd in initiating the \nCongressional Commission on Military Training to examine issues related \nto basic training of men and women which will give its best advice to \nthe Congress\n\n[[Page S12158]]\n\nnext year on whether current practices should be changed.\n  While I didn't agree with Dirk Kempthorne on many of the specifics of \nhis Unfunded Mandate legislation in 1995, I, like many of my colleagues \nin the Senate, was greatly impressed with the manner in which he \nmanaged the bill and his command of the complex details.\n  Mr. Chairman, in the United States Senate we are called upon to work \nwith colleagues of many differing points of view. While Dirk Kempthorne \nand I sit on separate sides of the aisle and sometimes disagree on \nissues before the Senate, it has always been a pleasure to deal with \nhim. He is always an able advocate for his position, and always a \ngracious gentleman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12157-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WHY THE FLAG AMENDMENT DEBATE IS APPROPRIATE NOW\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to make a few very brief \nremarks about our inability to get a time agreement on the flag \namendment, and respond to the assertion that it is somehow \ninappropriate to debate this important issue at this time. I think it \nis entirely appropriate that we debate the constitutional amendment to \nprotect our flag at this time in the year. There is no better time than \nthe present to discuss the values the flag represents: the unity and \ncommon values of all Americans.\n  The flag amendment should, like the flag itself, unite us. And it \ndoes unite Americans of both parties. This amendment is cosponsored by \n61 Members of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats. Senator Cleland, a \nwar hero, who has sacrificed much, and who is a Democrat, is the \nprimary cosponsor.\n  And ultimately, all we supporters of the amendment are asking for is \na chance to let the American people decide whether to protect the flag \nby debating the amendment in ratification debates in each of the State \nlegislatures. And the people clearly want the flag amendment. Forty-\nnine State legislatures have called for the flag amendment. And polling \nhas consistently shown that more than three-quarters of the American \npeople have consistently supported a flag amendment over the years \nsince the Supreme Court's fateful decision in Texas versus Johnson in \n1989.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation not only is vital to \nprotect our shared values as Americans, but this debate is also timely \ntoday as we all strive to recover what is good and decent about our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, we see evidence of moral decay and a lack of standards \nall around us. Behavior that was once found to be shameful is now \nroutinely excused because ``everybody does it.'' Our popular culture, \nincluding movies and television, bombard us with messages of gratuitous \nsex and violence. Even sports figures too often set a terrible example \nfor the young people that follow their every move.\n  And yet here today we have a unique opportunity to do something \nuplifting, something decent, something that will make our country \nproud. We have an opportunity to say to a few exhibitionists and \nanarchists that in pursuit of your fifteen minutes of fame, you may not \ndeface the most sacred embodiment of the virtues of our country. You \nmay not dishonor the memory of those millions of men and women who have \ngiven their lives for America. You may not yet again lower standards of \nelemental decency that all of must and should live by. Today, we will \nsay that our flag, the embodiment of so many of our hopes and dreams, \ncan no longer be dragged through the mud, torn asunder, or defecated \non.\n  Can anyone think of a better message to send to our citizens and to \nour young people than to begin to reclaim appropriate standards of \nbehavior for everyone in this country? Mr. President, there will be \nthose who will decry this discussion as a distraction from ``real'' and \n``important'' matters of taxes and budgets and regulation and other \nFederal programs. These issues are important and the Congress must deal \nwith them. But that should not obscure our inattention to the ``values \ndeficit'' that exists in public life today. We need more public \nconversation about values and standards. We must take every opportunity \nto set the right behavioral standards for our children, lest we become \na nation of cynics who snicker every time someone tries to reinstill \nvirtue into public life.\n  And so, Mr. President, not only is this discussion appropriate today, \nbut it is critical. I can think of no more important conversation we \ncan have in America than how we use American liberty to promote public \nvirtue.\n  Protecting the American flag from physical desecration is a small but \nimportant way to begin this important debate.\n  Now, having said all that, I am disappointed that opponents of the \nflag amendment have rejected a reasonable time agreement, without even \noffering an alternative time agreement. I would be interested to know \nwhat would be acceptable.\n  Finally, if it should be the case that we are not going to debate the \nflag amendment this year, and that is how it appears, I believe we \nshould bring it up early in the new Congress, and debate and vote on it \nat the earliest opportunity next year. I want my colleagues to know \nthat I will be back next year and I will trust that this important \nmatter will be acted on early in the next session. The American people \nwant the opportunity to debate the flag amendment in the States, and I \nbelieve we should listen to the people on this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12158-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12158-S12160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FAILURE TO ACHIEVE JUVENILE CRIME LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss an issue of \ngreat importance to the Senate and the nation--juvenile crime. Over the \npast weeks, we have been working hard to try to reach consensus on \ncomprehensive legislation to address juvenile crime in our nation. I am \ndisappointed to report to my colleagues that we have fallen short in \nthat effort.\n  The sad reality is that we can no longer sit silently by as children \nkill children, as teenagers commit truly heinous offenses, as our \njuvenile drug abuse rate continues to climb. In 1996, juveniles \naccounted for nearly one fifth--19 percent--of all criminal arrests in \nthe United states. Persons under 18 committed 15 percent of all \nmurders, 17 percent of all rapes, and 32.1 percent of all robberies.\n  And although there are endless statistics on our growing juvenile \ncrime problem, one particularly sobering fact is that, between 1985 and \n1993, the number of murder cases involving 15-year olds increased 207 \npercent. We have kids involved in murder before they can even drive.\n  In short, our juvenile crime problem has taken a new and sinister \ndirection. But cold statistics alone cannot tell the whole story. Crime \nhas real effect on the lives of real people. Recently, I read an \narticle in the Richmond Times-Dispatch by my good friend, crime \nnovelist Patricia Cornwell. It is one of the finest pieces I have read \non the effects of and solutions to our juvenile crime problem, and I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me share with my colleagues some of \nwhat Ms. Cornwell, who has spent the better part of her adult life \nstudying and observing crime and its effects, has to say. She says \n``when a person is touched by violence, the fabric of civility is \nforever rent, or ripped, or breached * * *.'' This a graphic but \naccurate description. Countless lives can be ruined by a single violent \ncrime. There is, of course, the victim, who may be dead, or scarred for \nlife. There are the family and friends of the victim, who are \ntraumatized as well, and who must live with the loss of a loved one. \nSociety itself is harmed, when each of us is a little more frightened \nto walk on our streets at night, to use an ATM, or to jog or bike in \nour parks. And, yes, there is the offender who has chosen to throw his \nor her life away. Particularly when the offender is a juvenile, family, \nfriends, and society are made poorer for the waste of potential in \nevery human being. One crime, but permanent effects when ``the fabric \nof civility is rent.''\n  This is the reality that has driven me to work even up to the closing \nhours of the session to address this issue. For nearly a year, the \nSenate has had before it comprehensive youth violence legislation. S. \n10, the Hatch-Sessions Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act, was \nreported out of the Judiciary\n\n[[Page S12159]]\n\nCommittee last year on bipartisan vote, two to one vote. This \nlegislation would have fundamentally reformed the role played by the \nfederal government in addressing juvenile crime in our Nation. It was \nsupported by law enforcement organizations such as the Fraternal Order \nof Police, the National Sheriffs Association, and the National Troopers \nCoalition, as well as the support of juvenile justice practitioners \nsuch as the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, and \nvictim's groups including the National Victims Center and the National \nOrganization for Victims Assistance.\n\n  S. 10 was reported on a bipartisan, two to one vote. Indeed, among \nmembers of the Youth Violence Subcommittee, the vote was seven to two \nin favor of the bill. Our reform proposal included the best of what we \nknow works. It combined tough measures to protect the public from the \nworst juvenile criminals, smart measures to provide intervention and \ncorrection at the earliest acts of delinquency, and compassionate \nmeasures to supplement and enhance extensive existing prevention \nprograms to keep juveniles out of the cycle of crime, violence, drugs, \nand gangs.\n  All too often, the juvenile justice system ignores the minor crimes \nthat lead to the increasingly frequent serious and tragic juvenile \ncrimes capturing headlines. Unfortunately, many of these crimes might \nhave been prevented had the warning signs of early acts of delinquency \nor antisocial behavior been heeded. A delinquent juvenile's critical \nfirst brush with the law is a vital aspect of preventing future crimes, \nbecause it teaches an important lesson--what behavior will be \ntolerated.\n  According to a recent Department of Justice study, juveniles \nadjudicated for so-called index crimes--such as murder, rape, robbery, \nassault, burglary, and auto threft--began their criminal careers at an \nearly age. The average age for a juvenile committing an index offense \nis 14.5 years, and typically, by age 7, the future criminal is already \nshowing minor behavior problems. If we can intervene early enough, \nhowever, we might avert future tragedies. That is why we seek to reform \nfederal policy that has been complicit in the system's failure, and \nprovide states with much needed funding for a system of graduated \nsanctions, including community service for minor crimes, electronically \nmonitored home detention, boot camps, and traditional detention for \nmore serious offenses.\n  And let there be no mistake--detention is needed as well. As Ms. \nCornwell recently wrote, ``our first priority should be to keep our \ncommunities safe. We must remove violent people from our midst, no \nmatter their age. . . . When the trigger is pulled, when the knife is \nplunged, kids aren't kids anymore. We should not shield and give \nexcuses and probation to violent juveniles who, odds are, will harm or \nkill again if they are returned to our neighborhoods and schools.'' I \ncouldn't have said it any better.\n\n  Meaningful reform also requires that juvenile's criminal record ought \nto be accessible to police, courts, and prosecutors, so that we can \nknow who is a repeat or serious offender. Right now, these records \nsimply are not available in NCIC, the national system that tracks adult \ncriminal records. Ms. Cornwell again cogently explains what this means: \n``If a juvenile commits a felony in Virginia, when he turns 18 his \nrecord is not expunged and will follow him for the rest of his days. \nBut were he to commit the same felony in North Carolina, at 16 he'll be \nreleased from a correctional facility with no record of any crime he \ncommitted in that state. Let's say he's back on the street and returns \nto Virginia. Now he's a juvenile again, and police, prosecutors, judges \nor juries will never know what he did in North Carolina.\n  If he moves to yet another state where the legal age is 21, he can \ncommit felonies for three or four more years and have no record of \nthem, either. Maybe by then, he's committed fifteen felonies but is \nonly credited with the one he committed in Virginia. Maybe when he \nbecomes an adult and is violent again, he gets a light sentence or even \nprobation, since it appears he's committed only one felony in his life \ninstead of fifteen. He'll be back among us soon enough. Maybe his next \nvictim will be you.''\n  So the reform we sought also provides the first federal incentives \nfor the integration of serious juvenile criminal records into the \nnational criminal history database, together with federal funding for \nthe system.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we all agree that it is far better to \nprevent the fabric of civility from being rent than to deal with the \naftermath of juvenile crime.\n  I have been involved in this fight for over three years now. Rarely \nhave I found an issue over which interest group opponents were more \ndetermined to block needed reforms through distortions of the record.\n  In no small measure, in my view, this harmful posturing has brought \nus to where we are today--just short of achieving important reform \nlegislation. I believe that we must look to the greater good, and \nlimit--in the interests of our children and public safety--the \nposturing which too often infects criminal justice issues.\n  Let me take just a moment to acknowledge the efforts of members on \nboth sides of the aisle who have worked in good faith to try and \naddress this issue in a responsible manner. Senator Leahy and Senator \nBiden deserve enormous credit. And I want to particularly thank Senator \nSessions, the Chairman of our Youth Violence Subcommittee for his many \nmonths of determined work. We will be back on this issue next Congress. \nIt will not go away, any more than the problem will go away until we \naddress it. So, I will be urging the Majority Leader, when he sets our \nagenda for next year, to make enacting a responsible juvenile crime \nbill among our top legislative priorities in the 106th Congress. Mr. \nPresident, I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                        When the Fabric Is Rent\n\n                         (By Patricia Cornwell)\n\n       There was a saying in the morgue during those long six \n     years I worked there. When a person is touched by violence, \n     the fabric of civility is forever rent, or ripped or \n     breached, whatever word is most graphic to you.\n       Our country is the most violent one in the free world, and \n     as far as I'm concerned, we are becoming increasingly \n     incompetent in preventing and prosecuting cruel crimes that \n     we foolishly think happen only to others. There was another \n     saying in the morgue. The one thing every dead person had in \n     common in that place was he never thought he'd end up there. \n     He never imagined his name would be penned in black ink in \n     the big black book that is ominously omnipresent on a counter \n     top in the autopsy suite.\n       I have seen hundreds, maybe close to a thousand dead bodies \n     by now, many of them ruined by another person's hands. I \n     return to the morgue at least two or three times a year to \n     painfully remind myself that what I'm writing about is awful \n     and final and real.\n       I suffer from nightmares and don't remember the last time I \n     had a pleasant dream. I have very strong emotional responses \n     to crimes that have nothing to do with me, such as Versace's \n     murder, and more recently, the random shooting deaths of \n     Capitol Police Agent John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut. \n     I can't read sad, scary or violent books. I watched only half \n     of Titanic because I cold not bear its sadness. I stormed out \n     of Ann Rice's Interview With A Vampire, so furious my hands \n     were shaking because the movie is such an outrageous \n     trivialization and celebration of sexual violence. For me the \n     suffering, the blood, the deaths are real.\n       I'd like to confront Ann Rice with bitemarks and other \n     sadistic wounds that are not special effects. I'd like to \n     sentence Oliver Stone to a month in the morgue, make him sit \n     in the cooler for a while and see what an audience of victims \n     has to say about his films. I'd like O.J. Simpson to have a \n     total recall and suffer, go broke, be ostracized, never \n     allowed on a golf course again. I was in a pub in London when \n     that verdict was read. I'll never forget the amazed faces of \n     a suddenly mute group of beer-drinking Brits, or the shame of \n     my friends and I felt because in America it is absolutely \n     true. Justice is blind.\n       Justice has stumbled off the rod of truth and fallen \n     headlong into a thicket of subjective verdicts where evidence \n     doesn't count and plea bargains that are such a bargain they \n     are fire sales. I've begun to fear that the consequences and \n     punishment of violent crime have become some sort of mindless \n     multiple choice, a Let's Make A Deal, a Let's microwave the \n     popcorn and watch Court TV.\n       I have been asked to tell you what my fictional character \n     Dr. Scarpetta would do if she were the crime czar or \n     Virginia, of America. Since she and I share the same opinions \n     and views, I am stepping out from behind my curtain of \n     imagined deeds and characters and telling you what I feel and \n     think.\n       It startles me to realize that at age 42, I have spent \n     almost half my life studying crime, of living and working in \n     it's pitifully cold, smelly, ugly environment. I am often \n     asked why people cheat, rob, stalk, slander, main and murder. \n     How can anybody enjoy causing another human being or any \n     living\n\n[[Page S12160]]\n\n     creature destruction and pain? I will tell you in three \n     words: Abuse of power. Everything in life is about the power \n     we appropriate for good or destruction, and the ultimate \n     overpowering of a life is to make it suffer and end.\n       This includes children who put on camouflage and get into \n     the family guns. We don't want to believe that 12, 13, 16 \n     year old youths are unredeemable. Most of them aren't. But \n     it's time we face that some of them have transgressed beyond \n     forgiveness, certainly beyond trust. Not all victims I have \n     seen pass through the morgue were savaged by adults. The \n     creative cruelty of some young killers is the worst of the \n     worst, images of what they did to their victims ones I wish I \n     could delete.\n       About a year ago, I began researching juvenile crime for \n     the follow-up of Hornet's Nest (Southern Cross, January, '99) \n     and my tenth Scarpetta book (unfinished and untitled yet). \n     This was a territory I had yet to explore. I was inspired by \n     the depressing fact that in the last ten years, shootings, \n     hold-ups at ATM's, and premeditated murders committed by \n     juveniles have risen 160 percent. As I ventured into my \n     eleventh and twelfth novels, I wondered what my crusading \n     characters would do with violent children.\n       So I spent months in Raleigh watching members of the \n     Governor's Commission on Juvenile Crime and Justice debate \n     and rewrite their juvenile crime laws, as Virginia did in \n     1995 under the leadership of Jim Gilmore. I quizzed Senator \n     Orrin Hatch about his youth violence bill, S. 10, a federal \n     approach to reforming a juvenile justice system that is \n     failing our society. I toured detention homes in Richmond and \n     elsewhere. I sat in on juvenile court cases and talked to \n     inmates who were juveniles when they began their lives of \n     crime.\n       While it is true that many violent juveniles have abuse, \n     neglect, and the absence of values in their homes, I maintain \n     my belief that all people should be held accountable for \n     their actions. Our first priority should be to keep our \n     communities safe. We must remove violent people from our \n     midst, no matter their age. As Marcia Morey, executive \n     director of North Carolina's juvenile crime commission, \n     constantly preaches, ``We must stop the hemorrhage first.''\n       When the trigger is pulled, when the knife is plunged, kids \n     aren't kids anymore. We should not shield and give excuses \n     and probation to violent juveniles who, odds are, will harm \n     or kill again if they are returned to our neighborhoods and \n     schools. We should not treat young violent offenders with \n     sealed lips and exclusive proceedings.\n       ``The secrecy and confidentiality of our system have hurt \n     us,'' says Richmond Juvenile and Domestic Relations District \n     Court Judge Kimberly O'Donnell. ``What people can't see and \n     hear is often difficult for them to understand.''\n       Virginia has opened its courtrooms to the public, and Judge \n     O'Donnell encourages people to sit in hers and see for \n     themselves those juveniles who are remorseless and those who \n     can be saved. Most juveniles who end up in court are not \n     repeat offenders. But for that small number who threaten us \n     most, I advocate hard, non-negotiable judgement. Most of what \n     I would like to see is already being done in Virginia. But we \n     need juvenile justice reform nationally, a system that is \n     sensible and consistent from state to state.\n       As it is now, if a juvenile commits a felony in Virginia, \n     when he turns 18 his record is not expunged and will follow \n     him for the rest of his days. But were he to commit the same \n     felony in North Carolina, at 16 he'll be released from a \n     correctional facility with no record of any crime he \n     committed in that state. Let's say he's back on the street \n     and returns to Virginia. Now he's a juvenile again, and \n     police, prosecutors, judges or juries will never know what he \n     did in North Carolina.\n       If he moves to yet another state where the legal age is 21, \n     he can commit felonies for three or four more years and have \n     no record of them, either. Maybe by then he's committed \n     fifteen felonies but is only credited with the one he \n     committed in Virginia. Maybe when he becomes an adult and \n     is violent again, he gets a light sentence or even \n     probation, since it appears he's committed only one felony \n     in his life instead of fifteen. He'll be back among us \n     soon enough. Maybe his next victim will be you.\n       If national juvenile justice reform were up to me, I'd be \n     strict. I would not be popular with extreme child advocates. \n     If I had my way, it would be routine that when any juvenile \n     commits a violent crime, his name and personal life are \n     publicized. Records of juveniles who commit felonies should \n     not be expunged when the individual becomes an adult. Mug \n     shots, fingerprints and the DNA of violent juveniles should, \n     at the very least, be available to police, prosecutors, and \n     schools, and if the young violent offender has an extensive \n     record and commits another crime, plea bargaining should be \n     limited or at least informed.\n       Juveniles who rape, murder or commit other heinous acts \n     should be tried as adults, but judges should have the \n     discretionary power to decide when this is merited. I want to \n     see more court-ordered restitution and mediation. Let's turn \n     off the TV's in correctional centers and force assailants, \n     robbers, thieves to work to pay back what they've destroyed \n     and taken, as much as that is possible. Confront them with \n     their victims, face to face. Perhaps a juvenile might realize \n     the awful deed he's done if his victim is suddenly a person \n     with feelings, loved ones, scars, a name.\n       Prevention is a more popular word than punishment. But the \n     solution to what's happening in our society, particularly to \n     our youths, is simpler and infinitely harder than any \n     federally or private funded program. All of us live in \n     neighborhoods. Unless you are in solitary confinement or a \n     coma, you are aware of others around you. Quite likely you \n     are exposed to children who are sad, lost, ignored, neglected \n     or abused. Try to help. Do it in person.\n       I remember my first few years in Richmond when I was living \n     at Union Theological Seminary, where my former husband was a \n     student and I was a struggling, somewhat failed writer. \n     Charlie and I spent five years in a seminary apartment \n     complex where there was a little boy who enjoyed throwing a \n     tennis ball against the building in a staccato that was \n     torture to me.\n       I was working on novels nobody wanted and every time that \n     ball thunked against brick, I lost my train of thought. I'd \n     popped out of my chair and fly outside to order the kid to \n     stop, but somehow he was always gone without a trace, silence \n     restored for an hour or two. One day I caught him. I was \n     about to reprimand him when I saw the fear and loneliness in \n     his eyes.\n       ``What's your name?'' I asked.\n       ``Eddie,'' he said.\n       ``How old are you?''\n       ``Ten.''\n       ``It's not a good idea to throw a ball against the \n     building. It makes it hard for some of us to work.''\n       ``I know.'' He shrugged.\n       ``If you know, then why do you do it?''\n       ``Because I have no one to play catch with me,'' he \n     replied.\n       My memory lit up with acts of kindness when I was a lonely \n     child living in the small town of Montreat, North Carolina. \n     Adult neighbors had taken time to play tennis with me. They \n     had invited me, the only girl in town, to play baseball or \n     touch football with the boys.\n       Billy Graham's wife, Ruth, used to stop her car to see how \n     I was or if I needed a ride somewhere. Years later, she \n     befriended me when I was a very confused teenager who felt \n     rather worthless. Were it not for her kindness and \n     encouragement, I doubt I would be writing this editorial. \n     Maybe I wouldn't have amounted to much. Maybe I would have \n     gotten into serious trouble. Maybe I'd be dead.\n       Eddie and I started playing catch. I gave him tennis \n     lessons and probably ruined his backhand for life. He told me \n     all about himself and amused me with his stories. We became \n     pals. He never threw a tennis ball against the building \n     again.\n       We must protect ourselves from all people who have proven \n     to be dangerous. But we should never abandon those who can be \n     helped or are at least are worthy of the effort. If you save \n     or change one life, you have added something priceless to \n     this world. You have left it better than you found it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12158-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADVANCED AVIONICS SUBSYSTEMS PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I would like to report out from the Finance \nCommittee the Administration's nomination of David C. Williams to be \nthe Inspector General for the Treasury Department. The nomination \nhearing for Mr. Williams was held on September 24, 1998.\n  The Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, grants the \nindependence and authority for an Inspector General to conduct audits \nand investigations to (1) detect waste, fraud or abuse, and (2) promote \neconomy and efficiency in agency programs and operations. I, for one, \ndeeply believe in the IG concept and support the important role an \nInspector General must carry out. It is often a very tough and \ndemanding job.\n  The Treasury Inspector General is an extremely critical position that \nis responsible for overseeing several Treasury agencies, including \nthree law enforcement bureaus, namely, the U.S. Customs Service, the \nU.S. Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. \nThe previous Inspector General resigned as a result of an investigation \nconducted by Senator Susan Collins' Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations (PSI). PSI determined that the IG broke the law twice \nconcerning two contracts and identified significant mismanagement \nwithin the Treasury IG's Office.\n  The Treasury IG's Office has been a very troubled agency because of \nbad leadership. It is, therefore, an absolute requirement for the next \nTreasury Inspector General to be an individual with a proven track \nrecord as a strong, effective manager and leader, one who will engage \nin aggressive--but fair--oversight, and one who will carry out their \nduties with the utmost integrity. Such behavior as demonstrated by the \nprevious Inspector General will not be tolerated. As the watchdog for \nthe Treasury Department, the Inspector General must set a good ethical \nexample.\n  Mr. Williams began his career in the Federal Government in 1975 as a \nSecret Service Agent. In 1979, he went to work for the Labor \nDepartment's Office of Inspector General in the Office of Labor \nRacketeering, where he served as Special Agent in Charge for two field \noffices and later as the Field Director.\n  During that time, Mr. Williams also served on President Reagan's \nCommission on Organized Crime. In 1986, Mr. Williams became the first \nDirector for the Office of Special Investigations for the General \nAccounting Office. In 1989, Mr. Williams was nominated by President \nBush to be the first Inspector General for the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission.\n  In 1995, President Clinton nominated Mr. Williams to be the first \nInspector General for the Social Security Administration; Mr. Williams \nbecame the SSA, IG in 1996. Since June 1998, Mr. Williams has been \nserving as a Senior Advisor at the Treasury Inspector General's Office.\n  Mr. Williams' background as the Inspector General for two Government \nagencies, as well as his investigator background, is clearly \nrepresentative of the qualifications needed to be the Treasury \nInspector General. The Senate Finance Committee intends to monitor the \nprogress of this agency as it gets back on track in accomplishing its \nmandated mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12161-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN GLENN, A TRUE AMERICAN HERO\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a special \ncolleague and a true American hero, John Glenn of Ohio.\n  During his distinguished career, Senator Glenn has used his boundless \nenergy and expertise to work for effective and efficient government and \nworld peace. He is one of our most beloved national figures and a role \nmodel to people of all ages and all backgrounds from all over the \nworld.\n  I was a teenager when the nation watched in awe as John Glenn became \nthe first American to orbit the earth. I never would have guessed \nduring those spectacular early days of the space program that someday I \nwould have an office next to his in the United States Senate. It has \nbeen my great privilege to serve with him and to know him as both a \nfriend and a colleague.\n  Today, he is at Cape Canaveral preparing to visit space again. I know \nmy colleagues share in my admiration and pride for Senator Glenn as he \nboldly goes once more into space. I wish him an exciting journey, a \nsafe return and wonderful retirement.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

The CDA \nstates that licenses may be issued for full or partial settlement of \ntelecommunications services with Cuba, but may not require any \nwithdrawal from a blocked account. Following enactment of the CDA on \nOctober 23, 1992, a number of U.S. telecommunications companies \nsuccessfully negotiated agreements to provide telecommunications \nservices between the United States and Cuba consistent with policy \nguidelines developed by the Department of State and the Federal \nCommunications Commission.\n  Subsequent to enactment of the CDA, the Department of the Treasury's \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) amended the Cuban Assets \nControl Regulations, 31 C.F.R.

A bill to amend the Federal Agriculture Improvement and \nReform Act of 1996 to improve the farmland protection program; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                    farmland protection legislation\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nwhich will assist in the critical effort to preserve our nation's most \nvulnerable farmland. I want to first acknowledge Senator Leahy's \ndecisive leadership on this issue, and recognize him as the author of \nthe original legislation establishing the Farmland Protection Program \nin the 1996 Farm Bill. He has been a tireless advocate for this \nimportant issue, and I look forward to working closely with him in the \nfuture to protect more of our Nation's open spaces.\n  We have heard a lot during the last decade about the dissolution and \ndestruction of the American Family Farm. Indeed, the family farm is \nunder serious threat of extinction. Today, there are 1,925,300 farms in \nthe United States, the lowest number of farms in our Nation since \nbefore the Civil War. The U.S. is losing two acres of our best farmland \nto development every minute of every day. In my State, New Jersey, we \nhave lost 6,000 farms, or 40 percent of our total, since 1959. This \nreduction has serious implications for the environment, the economy and \nour food supply.\n  The threat comes partially from an anachronistic and unfair \ninheritance tax that threatens the generational continuity of the \nfamily farm and partially from the fact that much of America's farmland \nis near major cities. As our cities sprawl into neighboring rural \nareas, our farms are in danger of becoming subdivisions or shopping \nmalls.\n  Last year I strongly supported a significant reduction in the estate \ntax to\n\n[[Page S12165]]\n\nkeep farms in the family, preserve open space and ensure fairness in \nour tax code. This was an important victory for farmers across the \nNation. However, we also need programs like the Farmland Protection \nProgram to reinforce this effort. This critical initiative is designed \nto protect soil by encouraging landowners to limit conversion of their \nfarmland to non-agricultural uses. It has proven so successful that \ndemand for these grants currently outstrips availability of funds by \n900 percent, and the last of its authorized funding was spent during \nfiscal year 1998.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senators Leahy, DeWine \nand Jeffords will provide authorization for additional funding, and \nensure the survival of this important program. Our bill will \nreauthorize the program at $55 million a year through 2002, and will \nbroaden the original legislation to allow non-profit conservation \ngroups to hold these easements. This provision is necessary because \nsome State governments, such as Colorado's, are barred from holding \neasements by their constitution. This legislation will allow non-profit \ngroups to hold these easements in lieu of the state government and this \nwill broaden participation in the program.\n  I hope my colleagues are able to support this legislation and allow \nus to continue building on the success of the past few years, during \nwhich we were able to protect nearly 82,000 acres on more than 230 \nfarms.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI. (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2598. A bill to require proof of screening for lead poisoning and \nto ensure that children at highest risk are identified and treated; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     children's lead prevention and inclusive treatment act of 1998\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today with my colleague from \nNew Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, I introduce the ``Children's Lead \nPrevention and Inclusive Treatment Act of 1998.'' For almost thirty \nyears Congress has focused attention on lead-related issues. In 1971 we \nfirst passed the Lead-based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, and much \nhas been done since that time to identify children with elevated lead \nlevels, to educate parents on the dangers of lead, and to devise means \nof removing or controlling lead in homes. Over the last 20 years, the \nremoval of lead from gasoline, food canning, children's toys, and other \nsources has seen a reduction in national population blood lead levels \nby over 80 percent.\n  Yet recent studies indicate that we are still not doing enough. While \nnational lead levels have dropped over 80 percent, the numbers for \nMedicaid children, and poor children overall, are nothing short of \ndisgraceful. Since 1992 the Health Care Financing Administration, at \nthe behest of Congress, has required that Medicaid children be screened \nfor elevated blood-lead levels at least twice before they reach the age \nof 2. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that \nnationally, 890,000 children between the ages of one and five have \nelevated blood lead levels and have never been tested.\n  Even worse, Mr. President, in a Report to Congress earlier this year, \nthe General Accounting Office reported that almost 79 percent of \nMedicaid children under two years of age have never been screened! This \nmeans that as many as 206,000 Medicaid children between the ages of 1 \nand 2 have not been screened. Considering that in 1991 the U.S. Public \nHealth Service called for a society-wide effort to eliminate childhood \nlead poisoning by the year 2011, it is quite apparent that we are not \nmaking much progress in reaching that goal.\n  A subsequent GAO report further identified poor and minority children \nas being at greatest risk of lead poisoning. GAO reported that the \nprevalence of elevated blood lead levels in Hispanic children aged 1 \nthrough 5 was more than twice that of white children, and for African-\nAmerican children it was more than five times that of white children. \nAdditionally, children in families below 130 percent of the Federal \npoverty level had a higher prevalence of elevated blood lead levels \nthan those children above the Federal poverty level. Yet all these \nchildren continue to be the very ones falling through the cracks!\n  That is why, Mr. President, I am introducing this legislation. The \nChildren's Lead PAINT Act promises to be a three-pronged attack on the \nlead-screening system. First, it will create a ``safety net'' through \nWIC and Early Start to ensure that high-risk children are screened. A \nparent enrolling their child in either of these programs must provide \nproof of screening, within 180 days of enrollment. If a child hasn't \nbeen screened, a parent can request WIC or Early Start to perform the \ntest themselves. Additionally, if WIC or Early Start performs the test, \nMedicaid will be authorized to reimburse the program.\n  Second, we will be putting teeth into the State's screening \nobligation, by setting a Minimum number of Screenings a State must \nperform, or having it face a penalty for failure. Beginning in Fiscal \nYear 2000, States will be required to screen at least 50 percent of \nMedicaid children under age 2. This will increase 10 percent each year \nuntil it hits 90 percent, where it must remain. If States fail to meet \nthese targets, they stand to lose one percent of their Medicaid funds.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we will require any Health Care Provider that \nsigns a State Medicaid contract to agree in that contract to comply \nwith the screening requirements, and to provide follow-up services to \nchildren who test positive. Although States have been required to \nperform these screenings, they are not a mandatory requirement of \nMedicaid health care contracts. Thus, there is no statutory obligation \non the part of physicians to perform the tests. This will ensure that \ndoctors perform the tests and that if a child does test positive that \nan environmental assessment will be done at their home and that follow-\nup testing and evaluations will be conducted.\n  I am especially pleased that I have been joined in this fight by two \nhighly regarded national advocacy groups. The Alliance to End Childhood \nLead Poisoning, a non-profit public interest organization exclusively \ndedicated to the elimination of childhood lead poisoning, has publicly \nendorsed the Lead PAINT Act. Similarly, the Coalition to End Childhood \nLead Poisoning, a non-profit parents and victims organization dedicated \nto educating the public on the dangers of lead poisoning and as well as \nto eradicating this disease, has also publicly endorsed this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, although we have made great progress in lead poison \nprevention techniques, first, by banning lead-based paint in homes and \nmore recently by strengthening our home testing system, the GAO report \nmakes it very clear that we are failing to identify those children with \nlead already in their bodies. It is time we demand accountability. Our \nchildren deserve no less.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation and \nthis issue. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Lead Prevention \n     and Inclusive Treatment Act of 1998'' or the ``Children's \n     Lead PAInT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) lead poisoning remains a serious environmental risk, \n     especially to the health of young children;\n       (2) childhood lead poisoning can cause reductions in IQ, \n     attention span, reading, and learning disabilities, and other \n     growth and behavior problems;\n       (3) children under the age of 6 are at the greatest risk \n     because of the sensitivity of their developing brains and \n     nervous systems;\n       (4) poor children and minority children are at \n     substantially higher risk of lead poisoning;\n       (5) it is estimated that more than 500,000 children \n     enrolled in medicaid have harmful levels of lead in their \n     blood;\n       (6) children enrolled in medicaid represent 60 percent of \n     the 890,000 children in the United States with elevated blood \n     lead levels;\n       (7) although the Health Care Financing Administration has \n     required mandatory blood lead screenings for children \n     enrolled in medicaid who are not less than 1 nor more than 5 \n     years of age, approximately two-thirds of children enrolled \n     in medicaid have not been screened or treated;\n\n[[Page S12166]]\n\n       (8) the Health Care Financing Administration mandatory \n     screening policy has not been effective, or sufficient, to \n     properly identify and screen children enrolled in medicaid \n     who are at risk;\n       (9) uniform lead screening requirements do not exist for \n     children not enrolled in medicaid; and\n       (10) adequate treatment services are not uniformly \n     available for children with elevated blood lead levels.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create a lead \n     screening safety net that will, through medicaid and other \n     entitlement programs, ensure that low-income children at the \n     highest risk of lead poisoning receive blood lead screenings \n     and appropriate followup care.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a \npresumption of service-connection for certain veterans with Hepatitis \nC, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                    hepatitis c veterans legislation\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \naddress a serious health concern for veterans infected with the \nhepatitis C virus. This legislation would make hepatitis C a service-\nconnected condition so that veterans suffering from this virus can be \ntreated by the VA.\n  Specifically, the bill will establish a presumption of service \nconnection for veterans with hepatitis C, meaning that we will assume \nthat this condition was incurred or aggravated in military service, \neven if there is no record of evidence that the condition existed \nduring the actual period of service, provided that certain conditions \nare met.\n  Under this legislation, veterans who received a transfusion of blood \nduring a period of service before December 31, 1992; veterans who were \nexposed to blood during a period of service; veterans who underwent \nhemodyalisis during a period of service; veterans diagnosed with \nunexplained liver disease during a period of service; veterans with an \nunexplained liver dysfunction value or test; or veterans working in a \nhealth care occupation during service, will be eligible for treatment \nfor this condition at VA facilities.\n  I am introducing this legislation today because of medical research \nthat suggests many veterans were exposed to hepatitis C in service and \nare now suffering from liver and other diseases caused by exposure to \nthe virus.\n  I am troubled that many ``hepatitis C veterans'' are not being \ntreated by the VA because they can't prove the virus was service \nconnected, despite that fact that hepatitis C was little known and \ncould not be tested for until recently.\n  Mr. President, we are learning that those who served in Vietnam and \nother conflicts, tend to have higher than average rates of hepatitis C. \nIn fact, VA data shows that 20 percent of its inpatient population is \ninfected with the hepatitis C virus, and some studies have found that \n10 percent of otherwise healthy Vietnam veterans are hepatitis C \npositive.\n  Although hepatitis C is a very serious infection, it was actually \nunknown until recently. Hepatitis C was not isolated until 1989, and \nthe test for the virus has only been available since 1990. Hepatitis C \nis a hidden infection with few symptoms. However, most of those \ninfected with the virus will develop serious liver disease 10 to 30 \nyears after contracting it. For many of those infected, hepatitis C \nleads to liver failure, transplants, liver cancer, and ultimately \ndeath.\n  And yet, most people who have hepatitis C don't even know it and \noften do not get treatment until it's too late. Only five percent of \nthe estimated four million Americans with hepatitis C know they have \nit, but with new treatments, some estimates indicate that 50 percent \ncan have the virus eradicated.\n  Vietnam Veterans in particular are just now starting to show up with \nliver disease caused by hepatitis C. And detection and treatment now \nmay help head off serious liver disease for many of them. However, many \nveterans with hepatitis C will not be treated by the VA because they \ncannot establish a service connection for their condition in spite of \nthe fact that we now know that many Vietnam-era and other veterans got \nthis disease serving their country.\n  Many of my colleagues may be interested to know how veterans likely \nwere exposed to this virus. Many veterans received blood transfusions \nwhile in Vietnam. This is one of the most common ways hepatitis C is \ntransmitted. Medical transmission of the virus through needles and \nother medical equipment is possible in combat. And Medical care \nproviders in the services were likely at increased risk, and may have, \nin turn, posed a risk to the service members they treated.\n  Researchers have discovered that hepatitis C was widespread in \nSoutheast Asia during the Vietnam war, and that some blood sent from \nthe U.S. was also infected with the virus. Researchers and veterans \norganizations, including the Vietnam Veterans of America, with whom I \nworked to prepare this legislation, believe that many veterans were \ninfected after being injured in combat and getting a transfusion or \nfrom working as a medic around combat injuries.\n  Yet, veterans cannot establish a service connection because \nfrequently there were no symptoms when they were infected in Vietnam. \nIn addition, while medical records may show a short bout of hepatitis, \nhepatitis C was not known then and there was no testing to detect the \nhepatitis C infection at discharge.\n  The hepatitis C infected veterans are essentially in a catch 22: the \nVA is reluctant to depart from their routine service connection \nrequirements and veterans cannot prove that they contracted hepatitis C \nin combat because the science to detect it did not exist during the \nperiod of service. Without congressional authority in the form of \nlegislation providing for presumptive service connection, thousands of \nVietnam vets infected with hepatitis C in service will not get VA \nhealth care testing or treatment. I believe the government will \nactually save money in the long run by testing and treating this \ninfection early on. The alternative is much more costly treatment of \nend-stage liver disease and the associated complications, or other \ndisorders.\n\n  I would like to describe some of the research that has led me to the \nconclusion that hepatitis C may be service connected in many veterans. \nA number of studies have established a link between hepatitis C in \nveterans and high risk factors for hepatitis C that are unique to \ncombat or are highly prevalent in combat situations.\n  A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 1980 \nfound that veterans have a higher incidence of hepatitis C compared to \nnon-veterans. The study of veterans receiving liver transplants at the \nNashville, Tennessee VA medical center, which was conducted by \nresearchers at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, found that \nthere ``was a significantly greater incidence of hepatitis C . . . in \nveterans compared with non-VA patients.'' The study claims to confirm \nthat ``veteran patients have a higher incidence of hepatitis C. . .''\n  A study published in Cancer in 1989 found that veterans have \nincreased risk of liver cancer as compared to non-veterans. The study \nfound that there was a 50 percent increase in the rate of liver cancer \namong male veterans using VA medical systems from 1970 to 1982.\n  A study published in Military Medicine in 1997 found that from 1991 \nto 1994, the number of veterans diagnosed with hepatitis C increased \nsignificantly from 6,612 in 1991 to 18,854 in 1994, which is an \nincrease of more than 285 percent. The study notes that ``total \npatients seen nationally . . . increased by only 4.87 percent during \nthe same period.'' Therefore, this increase cannot be explained by \nincreased in workload. Over the subsequent year, this increased to \n21,400 (in 1996), and has since continued to increase.\n  Some will argue that further epidemiologic data is needed to resolve \nor prove the issue of service connection. I agree that we have our work \ncut out for us, and further study is required. However, while the \nresearch being done is providing more and more data on the relationship \nbetween military service\n\n[[Page S12168]]\n\nand hepatitis C, we should not force those who fought for our country \nto wait for the treatment they deserve.\n  It should be noted that some progress has been made in recent years \nin the effort to address this health concern. This is not a new issue.\n  The VA has done some screening and testing for hepatitis C in \nveterans. VA Under Secretary for Health, Ken Kizer, issued a directive \nthat all VA medical centers should test veterans for hepatitis C if \nthey fall into certain risk categories. However, I understand that \nmedical centers are not complying with this directive uniformly. In \naddition, there is no mention of treatment in the Kizer directive. \nTherefore, if the virus is detected, the VA does not necessarily treat \nit.\n  I would also note that the FY98 VA-HUD Appropriations report contains \nthe following language: ``The Committee is concerned that the rates of \nserious liver disease, liver cancer and liver transplants related to \nhepatitis C infection are expected to rise rapidly among veterans \npopulations over the next decade. Veterans health care facilities will \nbear a large part of the treatment cost. Those costs can be reduced \nwith early screening and treatment of veterans infected with hepatitis \nC. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to determine rates \nof hepatitis C infection among veterans receiving health services from \nthe VA and to establish a protocol for screening new entrants to the VA \nhealth care system. The Committee also directs the Department to \nprovide counseling and access to treatment for veterans who test \npositive for hepatitis C. The Department should pay special attention \nto rates of hepatitis C among veterans of Vietnam and more recent \ndeployments.''\n  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, well respected both within \nand outside of the medical profession, has said, ``In some studies of \nveterans entering the Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities, \nhalf of the veterans have tested positive for HCV. Some of these \nveterans may have left the military with HCV infection, while others \nmay have developed it after their military service. In any event, we \nneed to detect and treat HCV infection if we are to head off very high \nrates of liver disease and liver transplant in VA facilities over the \nnext decade. I believe this effort should include HCV testing as part \nof the discharge physical in the military, and entrance screening for \nveterans entering the VA health system.''\n  The VA requires that a veteran demonstrate onset during service or \nwithin requisite presumptive periods with chronic residuals of a \ndisease or injury that had its onset during active military service. \nHow does a veteran prove service connection under these criteria for a \ncondition that did not even have a name until 10 years ago.\n  Veterans have already fought their share of battles--these men and \nwomen who sacrificed in war so that others could live in peace \nshouldn't have to fight again for the benefits and respect they have \nearned.\n  In closing, let me say that we are just now beginning to learn the \nfull extent of this emerging health threat to veterans and the general \npopulation. We still have a long way to go before we know how best to \nconfront this deadly virus. A comprehensive policy to confront such a \nmonumental challenge can not written overnight. It will require the \nlong-term commitment of Congress and the Administration to a \nserious effort to address this health concern.\n\n  I hope this legislation will be a constructive step in this effort, \nand I look forward to working with the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the \nVA-HUD appropriators, Vietnam Veterans of America, and others to meet \nthis emerging challenge.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 2600. A bill to amend section 402 of the Controlled Substances Act \nto reform the civil remedy provisions relating to recordkeeping \nviolations; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             controlled substance civil penalty reform act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Controlled \nSubstances Civil Penalty Reform Act of 1998,'' S. 2600, legislation I \nhave been developing for some months working in conjunction with \nSenator Gregg and the Appropriations Committee, our House colleague, \nBill McCollum, and other interested parties including the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, the National Association of Chain Drug \nStores, and the National Wholesale Druggists Association.\n  This is a ``good government'' bill, legislation which I intend to \ncorrect a situation which has proven to be of great concern to \nAmerica's drug stores, the wholesale community which supplies them, and \nAmerica's consumers.\n  As a House hearing amply documented last month, there have been a \nnumber of cases in which the Drug Enforcement Administration has \nimposed large fines for small, record-keeping errors committed by those \nthe agency regulates, primarily drug stores and their suppliers.\n  The DEA has a critical mission to combat diversion of controlled \nsubstances. This is of great national significance, and the agency \nshould zealously pursue to the limits of the law those who traffic in \nillicit drugs.\n  That being said, there is a difference between going after drug \ndealers and examining the records kept by legitimate wholesalers and \npharmacies. Overzealously throwing the book at above-board businesses, \nwho are doing so much to help America's consumers, for relatively minor \nrecord-keeping violations is not warranted.\n  In 1997, these fines, which may be assessed at up to $25,000 per \nviolation, totaled a substantial $12 million. But given the nature of \nsome of the minor deficiencies, which I am advised are sometimes for \ntrivial matters such as incorrect zip codes, the question must be \nraised whether this particular enforcement activity is operating more \nlife a hidden tax or user fees than a meaningful deterrent to drug \ndiversion.\n  In short, S. 2600 amends the Controlled Substances Act in three \nimportant ways. First, it adds a negligence standard to current law, so \nthat the government must prove that the record-keeping violation was \ndue to a negligent act, rather than an unintended mistake or omission, \nprior to any fines being imposed. Second, it lowers the ceiling on \nthese fines from ``up to $25,000'' per violation, to ``up to $10,000'' \nper violation.\n  The third provision adds a number of needed standards that the \nAttorney General must consider before any fine is imposed. These \ninclude: whether diversion actually occurred; whether actual harm to \nthe public resulted from the diversion; whether the violations were \nintentional or negligent in nature; whether the violations were a first \ntime offense; the time intervals between inspections where no, or any \nserious, violations were found; whether the violations were multiple \noccurrences of the same type of violation; whether and to what extent \nfinancial profits may have resulted from the diversion; and the \nfinancial capacity of registrants to pay the fines assessed.\n  Finally, my proposal makes clear that in determining whether to \nassess a penalty, the Attorney General may take into account whether \nthe violator has taken immediate and effective corrective action, \nincluding demonstrating the existence of compliance procedures, in \norder to reduce the potential for any future violations. The Attorney \nGeneral may also follow informal procedures such as sending one or more \nwarning letters to the violator, as she determines appropriate.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that our time is short for the remainder \nof this session. However, given Senator Gregg's significant interest in \nthis issue, and the abundant work that Representative McCollum and I \nhave devoted to this issue this year, I am hopeful this needed reform \nis something we can accomplish before we adjourn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 2601.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce two education \nlegislative proposals that will increase parental and student choice, \neducational quality, and school safety.\n  A colleague from the Arizona delegation, Representative Matt Salmon, \nis today introducing these proposals in the House of Representatives.\n  The first proposal is the ``Dollars Follow the Student Education \nBlock Grant Act.''\n  This proposal would ensure that education dollars are spent in the \nclassroom on behalf of specific students rather than in bureaucracies \nlike the Department of Education in Washington, D.C.\n  The second proposal is the ``K through 12 Community Participation \nAct'' which would offer tax credits to families and businesses of up to \n$500 annually for qualified K through 12 education expenses or \nactivities.\n  Over the last 30 years, Americans have steadily increased their \nmonetary commitment to education.\n  Unfortunately, we have not seen a corresponding improvement in the \nquality of the education our children receive.\n  Given our financial commitment, and the great importance of \neducation, these results are unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, I believe the problem is not how much money is spent, \nbut how it is spent, and by whom.\n  Our national commitment to education is clear from the ever-\nincreasing sums we spend annually.\n  The problem is the big-government, Washington D.C.-based policies \nthat have squandered these resources on well-meaning but misguided \nprograms that are failing our children and our country.\n  By beginning the debate on these two legislative proposals at the end \nof the 105th Congress, I believe the Congress can build upon the great \nprogress made in the direction of parental choice, educational quality, \nand safety--progress which has been led by Senator Paul Coverdell and \nSenator Slade Gorton, and Senator Tim Hutchinson.\n\n\n     the dollars follow the student education block grant proposal\n\n  As a nation we have long recognized the supreme importance of \neducating our children.\n  It is the foundation for a productive and rewarding future for all \nindividuals and, as Thomas Jefferson noted, ``is essential to the \npreservation of our democracy.''\n\n  The critical issue is whether the taxpayers are getting their money's \nworth for their education tax dollar in light of the disappointing \nconclusions of the recent congressional Education at the Crossroads \nreport.\n  As the report pointed out, the federal government pays only seven \npercent of the cost of education, but imposes 50 percent of the \npaperwork requirements that schools face.\n  Our students are struggling to master just the basics in reading, \nmath, and science. Around 40 percent of our fourth graders can't read, \nwhile the government pays to add subtitles to the ``Jerry Springer \nShow.''\n  It is clear that after more than 30 years of topdown control, \nhundreds of duplicative federal programs and one-size-fits-all policies \nfrom Washington are not working.\n  In fact, according to a recent study by the Heritage Foundation, 20 \ncents of each education tax dollar are lost to administrative and \nfederal compliance costs. I believe these resources would be better \nspent on textbooks or making schools safer than on salaries of, and \nregulations issued by, bureaucrats in Washington.\n  It's clear that we need to get more from our education tax dollars by \nspending more of them in the classroom and less in Washington.\n  This idea--an education block grant--has been successfully promoted \nby Senator Slade Gorton of Washington state. The Gorton block grant \nproposal passed the Senate and the House in 1997, but, at the Clinton \nadministration's insistence, it was stripped from the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education appropriations bill of 1997.\n  As with the Gorton proposal, my bill would consolidate most federally \nfunded K through 12 education programs, except for special education. \nThis money is sent directly to states and local school districts free \nfrom federal mandates or regulations.\n  Under both proposals, each state would choose one of three options: \n1. To have federal block grant funds sent directly to local school \ndistricts minus federal regulations; 2. To have federal block grant \nfunds sent to the state education authority, again without federal \nregulations; 3. Or to continue to receive federal funds under the \ncurrent system of categorizing monies rigidly into specific programs.\n  But my amendment adds a new feature to the block grant idea for \nstates that choose a block grant option. Several years ago, the \nGoldwater Institute, a Phoenix-based educational think tank, began to \nadvocate market-based education finance reform in which a specific \namount of money would follow each child to the school of his or her \nchoice. I believe the time has come for this concept of ``dollars \nfollowing kids'' to be debated and implemented on the national level.\n  Under this proposal, each state electing to have a block grant could \nalso decide to allow parents of children in private schools, public \nschools (including charter schools), and parents of ``home schooled'' \nkids, to receive their ``per capita'' amount directly, rather than \nindirectly through the school district and school. This money would \nliterally ``follow the child'' from school to school, thus creating an \nincentive for the school to muster the best education product possible \nin order to keep the child enrolled.\n\n  I believe the fundamental problem with today's method of federal \neducation funding is that it provides little if any link between the \nquality of a school or school district's educational product and the \neducation funding it receives. The absence of a link between school \nfunding and education quality has led to a loss of accountability and \nto an education product that is, in many ways, severely deficient. \nParents, students, and the nation suffer from this loss of \naccountability.\n  As we all know, under current education-funding procedures, federal \ndollars allocated by the U.S. Department of Education are sent to state \neducation agencies, and then to each school district, and finally, to \neach school. At each level, important education decisions are being \nmade by bureaucrats--and more importantly, not being made by parents. \nAlso, at each level of bureaucracy, additional percentages of the \noriginal education-funding dollar that left Washington is being lost. \nCurrently, fully 20 percent of all federal education dollars never make \nit to the classroom and the student.\n  I believe we need to explore a new education-funding framework that \nis child-centered rather than school, or school district, centered. The \ncurrent system has proven to be inconsistent with the fundamental \nprinciples of parental choice, competition, and education quality.\n  This proposal would implement the fundamental reform needed in our \neducation financing system. I believe we should consider financing \npublic education by linking funding to individual students and \nrequiring that the schools and school districts compete for those \nstudents by providing a quality education. This approach puts the \nchild, rather than the system itself, at the center. With child-\ncentered funding, students are more valuable to schools than the \nbureaucrats who make funding decisions.\n  Simply put, under my plan, the federal money that supports primary \nand secondary education would go directly from the state to parents, \nand only then to the schools in which parents chose to educate their \nchildren.\n  Practically speaking, what does this mean? First, the federal \ngovernment funds about 6.3% of the total amount--$358 billion--invested \nin primary and secondary education each year. If every state chose the \nblock grant, this proposal would result in a block grant of roughly $13 \nbillion sent to the states with greatly reduced regulatory mandates. \n(It is important to note that federal funding through the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Act is exempted from this block grant.)\n  This amount--$13 billion--divided among roughly 50 million students \nresults in $255 dollars that will ``follow'' each student. When one \nconsiders that the average school enrollment is 530 students, this \nblock grant proposal would mean that each school would receive an \naverage of $135,000 in federal dollars and, more importantly, would\n\n[[Page S12170]]\n\nhave the flexibility to sue it to address the specific educational \nneeds of the students in that school.\n\n  Suppose the parents of 50 students decided to remove their children \nbecause they were unsatisfied with the educational product of the \nschool: that school would lose over $12,000 as a result. This would \nmean that each school would have the strong incentive to improve its \ncurriculum, its staff, and its overall performance, since, if parents \nweren't satisfied, they could move their child to another school--and \nthe dollars along with the child.\n  To allay fears that federal funding will be cut if consolidated into \na block grant, this proposal provides that, if federal funding falls \nbelow the levels agreed to in the 1997 budget agreement, it will revert \nback to funding under federally-designated categories.\n  Also, my bill encourages states that choose block grants to adjust \nthe per-student amounts by two factors: The relative cost of living, \ni.e., rural v. urban; and the income of the child's parents.\n  Citizens in the states put their trust in members of Congress to \nrepresent them in the nation's capital. It is time Congress showed the \nsame trust in them and gave them more discretion in how their education \ntax dollars are spent.\n  It comes down to this: Will local schools be improved through more \ncontrol from Washington, or will they be improved by giving more \ncontrol to parents, teachers, and principals? The question needs only \nto be asked to be answered. The K through 12 Community Participation \nAct.\n  Mr. President, the second education legislative proposal I am \nintroducing today is the K through 12 Community Participation Act. This \nproposal addresses the problem of falling education standards by giving \nfamilies and businesses a tax incentive to provide children with a \nhigher quality education through choice and competition.\n  The problem of declining education standards is illustrated by a \nreport just released by the Education and Workforce Committee of the \nHouse of Representatives, Education at the Crossroads. This is the most \ncomprehensive review of federal education programs ever undertaken by \nthe United States Congress. It shows that the federal government's \nresponse to the decline in American schools has been to build bigger \nbureaucracies, not a better education system.\n  According to the report: There are more than 760 federal education \nprograms overseen by at least 39 federal agencies at a cost of $100 \nbillion a year to taxpayers. These programs are overlapping and \nduplicative. For example, there are 63 separate (but similar) math and \nscience programs, 14 literacy programs, and 11 drug-education programs.\n  Even after accounting for recent streamlining efforts, the U.S. \nDepartment of Education still requires over 48.6 million hours worth of \npaperwork per year--this is the equivalent of 25,000 employees working \nfull time.\n  As I mentioned earlier, states get at most seven percent of their \ntotal education funds from the federal government, but most states \nreport that roughly half of their paperwork is imposed by federal \neducation authorities.\n  The federal government spends tax dollars on closed captioning of \n``educational'' programs such as ``Baywatch'' and Jerry Springer's \nsqualid daytime talk show.\n  With such a large number of programs funded by the federal \ngovernment, it's no wonder local school authorities feel the heavy hand \nof Washington upon them.\n  And what are the nation's taxpayers getting for their money? \nAccording to the report, around 40 percent of fourth grades cannot \nread, and 57 percent of urban students score below their grade level. \nHalf of all students from urban school districts fail to graduate on \ntime, if at all. U.S. 12th graders ranked third from the bottom out of \n21 nations in mathematics. According to U.S. manufacturers, 40 percent \nof all 17-year-olds do not have the math skills to hold down a \nproduction job at a manufacturing company.\n  The conclusion of the Education at the Crossroads report is that the \nfederally designed ``one-size-fits-all'' approach to education is \nsimply not working.\n  I believe we need a federal education policy that will: Give parents \nmore control. Give local schools and school boards more control. Spend \ndollars in the classroom, not on a Washington bureaucracy. Reaffirm our \ncommitment to basic academics.\n  As was the case regarding my block grant proposal, my state of \nArizona has led the way with legislation passed in 1997. This state law \nprovides tax credit that can be used by parents and businesses to cover \ncertain types of expenses attendant to primary and secondary education.\n  Mr. President, today, Representative Salmon and I are introducing a \nform of the new Arizona education tax-credit law.\n  The K through 12 Community Participation Education Act would be \nphased in over four years and would impel parents, businesses, and \nother members of the community to invest in our children's education. \nSpecifically, it offers every family or business a tax credit of up to \n$500 annually for any K through 12 education expense or activity. This \ntax credit could be applied to home schooling, private schools \n(including charter schools), or parochial schools. Allowable expenses \nwould include tuition, books, supplies, and tutors.\n  Further, the tax credit could be given to a ``school-tuition \norganization'' for distribution. To qualify as a school-tuition \norganization, the organization would have to devote at least 90 percent \nof its income per year to offering available grants and scholarships \nfor parents to use to send their children to the school of their \nchoice.\n  How might this work? A group of businesses in any community could \njoin forces to send sums for which they received tax credits to \ncharitable ``school-tuition organizations'' which would make \nscholarships and grants available to low income parents of children \ncurrently struggling to learn in unsafe, non-functional schools.\n  Providing all parents--including low income parents--the freedom to \nchoose will foster competition and increase parental involvement in \neducation. Insuring this choice will make the federal education tax \ncode more like Arizona's. It is a limited but important step the \nCongress and the President can--and I believe, must--take.\n  Mr. President, it's clear that top-down, one-size fits all, big \ngovernment education policy has failed our children and our country.\n  This tax-credit legislation, as well as the block-grant legislation I \ndescribed earlier, will refocus our efforts on doing what is in the \nbest interests of the child as determined by parents, and will give \nparents and businesses the opportunity to take an important step to \nrescue American education so that we can have the educated citizenry \nthat Jefferson said was essential to our health as a nation.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 2603. A bill to promote access to health care services in rural \nareas; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              promoting health in rural areas act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, all Americans deserve access to primary \nhealth care and emergency treatment. But in rural America the delivery \nof these services is often difficult, given the vast distances and \nextreme weather conditions that typically prevail. Just as small \ncommunities' transportation, education and housing needs are different \nthan those of urban areas, so too are their mechanisms for delivering \nhealth care.\n  That's why Senator Daschle and I are introducing the Promoting Health \nIn Rural Areas Act of 1998. PHIRA would, among other things: \nreformulate the Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost for Medicare payments \nto managed care; direct Medicare payments to tribally-owned hospitals; \nrebase provisions for Sole Community Hospitals; revise the underserved \ncriteria used by the Office of Personnel Management; and allow \nrecently-closed hospitals to be designated on a Critical Access basis.\n  As you know, 1997 reforms went a long way towards ensuring the \nviability of the Medicare program, including its use by rural \nAmericans. For example, under Section 4201 of the 1997 BBA, Congress \nestablished a rural-friendly\n\n[[Page S12171]]\n\nhospital program. Modeled on a demonstration project conducted in my \nstate of Montana, the new program allows a rural hospital to convert to \na limited-service hospital status, called a ``Critical Access \nHospital,'' or CAH. These hospitals are given flexibility and relief \nfrom Medicare regulations designed for full-size, full-service acute \ncare hospitals. By giving these smaller hospitals greater latitude on \nstaffing and other cumbersome federal regulations, it is easier for \nrural hospitals to organize their staffs and facilities based on \npatient needs.\n  If the demonstration project on which this new program is based is \nany indication (and I certainly hope that it is), Congress can be proud \nof this new law. And rural folks across the country will benefit. They \nwill receive access to quality care in a way that meets their unique \nneeds, and they will be assisted in preserving a way of life that is \nincreasingly threatened by the urban- and sub-urbanization of America.\n  Yet despite many positive developments, it has become clear to the \nMinority Leader and I that much still needs to be done to facilitate \nthe delivery of rural health services. In order to meet those needs, \nthe Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act will do several things. First, \nit will change the Office of Personnel Management's underserved \ndesignation criteria by changing the way the Office of Personnel \nManagement designates rural areas. Back in the 1960s, underserved areas \nwere designated on a state-by-state basis. Now, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services has the sophistication to designate areas by \ncounty, or even sub-county. The bill we are introducing today would \nrequire OPM to designate underserved areas on a county-by-county, not \nstate-by-state, basis.\n  Second, PHIRA would direct Medicare payments to tribally-owned \nhospitals. As you know, Mr. President, a demonstration project \nconducted in Alaska, Mississippi and Oklahoma allowed four tribal \nhealth care providers operating Indian Health Services hospitals to \nbill Medicare and Medicaid directly. The demo project increased \nefficiency and, by allowing providers to directly bill Medicare, \nprovided badly-needed revenue. Our bill would expand the demonstration \nproject nationwide and make it permanent.\n  Mr. President, our bill would also allow recently-closed hospitals to \nbe designated as Criticala Access Hospitals. Under the 1997 law \nestablishing the Critical Access Hospital program, a closed or \ndownsized hospital does not qualify. Our bill would allow a hospital \nthat had closed within the last five years to qualify for conversion to \nCAH status.\n  Our bill also addresses rural needs for Medicare Graduate Medical \nEducation (GME). As you know, BBA mandated a cap on the number of \nresidents a teaching hospital is allowed to train. Because this \nprovision threatens to exacerbate an already serious shortage of \nphysicians in rural America, our bill would allow programs training \nresidents targeted for rural areas to be exempt from the cap.\n  Mr. President, by reforming the way health care is delivered in rural \nareas, we are not only making government more efficient, we are making \nagencies more accountable. And we are preserving a way of life that \nAmerican pioneers established long ago and that rural Americans \ncontinue today. It is in many ways a simpler lifestyle, uncomplicated \nby traffic, smog and a desire to get everything done yesterday. But it \nis also a difficult way of life, characterized by harsh weather, long \ndistances, and the historic tendency of the Federal Government to view \nall areas--rural or urban--through a one-size-fits-all lens. I invite \nsenators to join the Minority Leader and I today, to ensure that our \nrural residents are given proper access to the health care they need. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, with Senator Baucus, I introduce a \nbill intended to improve health care for Americans living in rural \ncommunities. The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1998 would help \nrural communities attract and retain health care providers and health \nplans, improve the viability of sole community hospitals, and make \noptimal use of the advances in medical technology available today.\n  Delivering health care in rural America presents unique challenges--\nissues related to geography, lack of transportation, and reimbursement. \nWith a relatively small population spread over a large area, and health \ncare professionals in short supply, patients often must travel long \ndistances to see a physician or get to a hospital. While these rural \ncommunities strive to improve access through telemedicine and \nrecruitment efforts, they must also struggle to maintain what they \nhave, to ensure that providers who leave their area are replaced, and \nto keep their hospitals' doors open.\n  Rural communities have long had great difficulty recruiting and \nretaining health care providers to serve their needs. Despite great \nincreases in the number of providers trained in this country over the \npast 30 years, rural communities have not shared equitably in the \nbenefits of this expansion. Even though 20 percent of Americans live in \nnon-metropolitan counties, only 11 percent of physicians practice in \nthose counties, and that percentage has been falling for the last 25 \nyears. Currently, 30 towns in South Dakota are looking for family \nphysicians.\n  Telemedicine is a promising tool to provide medical expertise to \nrural communities. Through telemedicine technology, rural patients can \nhave access to specialists they would otherwise never encounter. The \nbenefits of telemedicine extend to rural health professionals as well, \nproviding them with technical expertise and interaction with peers that \ncan make practicing in a rural area more attractive. Yet the potential \nof telemedicine has been limited by reimbursement issues and a number \nof other obstacles.\n  In addition to problems with provider recruitment and limitations \nfacing telemedicine, seniors in rural areas do not have the array of \nhealth plan options available in more urban areas due in part to a \ndisparity in reimbursement. Although the Balanced Budget Act began to \naddress the issue of low payment levels in rural areas, and has been \nsuccessful to some degree, budgetary constraints have prevented the \nexpected increase in rural areas.\n  The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1998 is intended to \naddress some of the basic challenges facing rural health care. It will \nnot address every health problem facing rural America. It is, however, \nintended to take important steps to improve access, increase choice, \nand improve the quality of care provided in more isolated parts of the \ncountry.\n  The bill addresses obstacles in current law to the recruitment and \ntraining of providers in rural areas. One provision in the bill ensures \nthat new rules enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act, regarding \nreimbursement for medical residents, do not discriminate against areas \nthat train residents in rural health clinics or other settings outside \na hospital.\n  The bill also helps medically underserved communities plan and be \nready for the retirement of a physician. Current law effectively \nrequires communities to actually lose a physician before they qualify \nfor recruitment assistance to replace that doctor. Because recruitment \nis rarely less than a 6-month-long process, current policy places a \ncommunity at risk of potentially having no physician available to them \nfor long periods of time. This bill would provide communities with 12 \nmonths of lead time to secure recruitment assistance when they know a \nretirement or resignation is pending.\n  The bill would enhance the economic viability of Sole Community \nHospitals, often the only source of inpatient services that are \nreasonably available in a geographic area, by updating the base cost \nreporting period.\n  The bill would ensure that health plans for Medicare beneficiaries \nwho want to develop in rural counties get the increased reimbursement \npromised in the Balanced Budget Act, while maintaining budget \nneutrality. This provision is important to ensure that beneficiaries in \nrural areas begin to have some of the health plan choices available to \nurban seniors.\n  The bill also places significant focus on the promise of telemedicine \nfor rural areas and attempts to overcome some of the barriers that have \nlimited its potential. The bill would expand reimbursement for \ntelemedicine to all rural areas, not just those designated as health \nprofessional shortage areas. The bill also would allow reimbursement \nfor services currently covered by\n\n[[Page S12172]]\n\nMedicare in face-to-face interactions with health professionals. It \nalso would make telemedicine more convenient, by allowing any health \ncare practitioner to present a patient to a specialist on the other \nside of the video connection.\n  Mr. President, providing health care in rural communities raises \nunique challenges that require targeted responses. Rural America \ndeserves appropriate access to health care--access to providers, access \nto hospitals, access to quality care, and greater choice. The bill we \nintroduce today takes important steps to achieve these ends.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 2604. A bill to provide demonstration grants to local educational \nagencies to enable the agencies to extend time for learning and the \nlength of the school year; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                      extended school legislation\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nauthorizing funding for extended school day and extended school year \nprograms across the country. The continuing gap between American \nstudents and those in other countries, combined with the growing needs \nof working parents and the growing popularity of extending both the \nschool day and the school year, have made this educational option a \nvaluable one for many school districts.\n  Students in the United States currently attend school an average of \nonly 180 days per year, compared to 220 days in Japan, and 222 days in \nboth Korea and Taiwan. American students also receive fewer hours of \nformal instruction per year compared to their counterparts in Taiwan, \nFrance, and Germany. We cannot expect our students to remain \ncompetitive with those in other industrialized countries if they must \nlearn the same amount of information in less time.\n  Our school calendar is based on a no longer relevant agricultural \ncycle that existed when most American families lived in rural areas and \ndepended on their farms for survival. The long summer vacation allowed \nchildren to help their parents work in the fields. Today, summer is a \ntime for vacations, summer camps, and part-time jobs. Young people can \ncertainly learn a great deal at summer camp, and a job gives them \nmaturity and confidence. However, more time in school would provide the \nsame opportunities while helping students remain competitive with those \nin other countries. As we debate the need to bring in skilled workers \nfrom other countries, the need to improve our system of education has \nbecome increasingly important.\n  In 1994, the Commission on Time and Learning recommended keeping \nschools open longer in order to meet the needs of both children and \ncommunities, and the growing popularity of extended-day programs is \nsignificant. Between 1987 and 1993, the availability of extended-day \nprograms in public elementary schools has almost doubled. While school \nsystems have begun to respond to the demand for lengthening the school \nday, the need for more widespread implementation still exists. \nExtended-day programs are much more common in private schools than \npublic schools, and only 18 percent of rural schools have reported an \nextended-day program.\n  This bill would authorize $50 million over the next five years for \nthe Department of Education to administer a demonstration grant \nprogram. Local education agencies would then be able to conduct a \nvariety of longer school day and school year programs, such as \nextending the school year to 210 days, studying the feasibility of \nextending the school day, and implementing strategies to maximize the \nquality of extended core learning time.\n  The constant changes in technology, and greater international \ncompetition, have increased the pressure on American students to meet \nthese challenges. Providing the funding for programs to lengthen the \nschool day and school year would leave American students better \nprepared to meet the challenges facing them in the next \ncentury.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2605. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe establishment of a national program of traumatic brain injury and \nspinal cord injury registries; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n          Traumatic Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Registry Act\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that \nrepresents an important step forward in our national strategy for \naddressing traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI). \nTragically, these injuries have enormous personal and economic costs on \nvictims, their families, and our nation as a whole.\n  Today, an estimated 4.5 million Americans live with a disability as a \nresult of a TBI. Each year, more than two million people suffer a TBI, \n10,000 of whom live in my State of New Jersey. More than 200,000 \nAmericans live with a SCI, with 10,000 new injuries reported each year. \nCollectively, TBI and SCI costs the U.S. more than $35 billion per \nyear.\n  These statistics, however, reveal only a fraction of the problem. In \nthe U.S., we have no standardized system of collecting information on \nthese injuries. Instead, we rely on the work of a few limited State \nprograms and private organizations who often lack the resources to \ncollect complete, timely, and accurate data.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today, the TBI/SCI \nRegistry Act, will allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC) to make grants available to states to establish their own TBI/SCI \nregistries. The CDC and state departments of health will then work as \npartners in establishing and maintaining comprehensive tracking systems \nthat ensures patient privacy.\n  The important information that state registries will be responsible \nfor collecting will include: circumstances of injury and demographics \nof patients; length of stay in hospital and treatments used; severity \nof the injury; outcomes of treatments and services.\n  The benefits will be far-reaching because the collection of accurate \ndata will help identify high-risk populations for future prevention \nprograms and will help link patients to effective treatments and social \nservices. Perhaps most important, the information from these registries \nwill help advocates and legislators justify TBI/SCI as a greater \nfunding priority.\n  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) currently spends \napproximately $60 million for SCI and $52 million for TBI. This \nresearch has contributed to tremendous progress, but we must improve \nour ability to identify innovative research projects and increase our \nfinancial commitment to those efforts.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will ultimately help achieve this \ngoal by creating a foundation for a unified scientific and public \nhealth approach for preventing, treating, and someday finding a cure \nfor TBI/SCI. I am proud that my bill has already received the \nendorsement of the Christopher Reeve Foundation, the American Paralysis \nAssociation, the Brain Injury Association, and the Eastern Paralyzed \nVeterans Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2605\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to approve a mutual settlement of the Water Rights of \nthe Gila River Indian Community and the United States, on behalf of the \nCommunity and the Allottees, and Phelps Dodge Corporation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\nthe gila river indian community--phelps dodge corporation water rights \n                         settlement act of 1998\n\n  Mr. KYL: Mr. President, today I introduce, by request, a bill to \nauthorize an Indian water rights settlement agreement that was entered \ninto on May 4, 1998 by the Gila River Indian Community of Arizona and \nthe Phelps Dodge Corporation.\n  As other Western members well know, any Indian water rights \nsettlement is a difficult, lengthy, and often frustrating process. \nReaching a settlement requires years of hard work and cooperation by \nall parties involved. But the work is worthwhile. By reaching \nsettlement, parties avoid decades of costly litigation and the \nuncertainty regarding water rights that inevitable comes when the \ndetermination of rights and liabilities is delayed. I have been, both \nin my prior career, and in this one, an ardent supporter of the \nsettlement process and I hope that by introducing this legislation, I \ncan give the negotiating parties at home in Arizona some encouragement. \nThere is light at the end of the tunnel.\n  This particular settlement agreement is part of a much larger, \ncomprehensive settlement process that will eventually settle all claims \nof the Gila River Community. I have been involved in several aspects of \nthe Gila negotiations and I am comforted that the negotiations are \nprogressing far enough that the parties are beginning to put their \nagreements down on paper and actually sign their names to those \ndocuments. In reference to his particular\n\n[[Page S12174]]\n\nagreement, I want to note that my introduction of legislation does not \nendorse the May 4, 1994 agreement. Rather, my intention is to endorse \nand encourage the process. The settlement agreement is complex and \nlengthy and contains some elements that all parties in the larger Gila \nnegotiation proceeds, including the federal government, may not agree \nwith. My purpose in introducing a bill this year is to put a document \non the table that will provide an opportunity for all interested \nparties to comment. In addition, a bill introduced this year will help \nmove the process forward next year.\n  I encourage the parties to continue their discussions. Indian water \nsettlements are among the most important bills that Congress passes--we \nin the federal government have a trust responsibility to provide water \nfor tribes and in passing legislation that has been carefully crafted \nto consider the interests of all parties, we are able to take steps \ntoward fulfilling that trust responsibility.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself and Mr. Mack):\n   S. 2609. A bill to ensure confidentiality with respect to medical \nrecords and health care-related information, and for other purposes to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             The Medical Information Protection Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I introduce the Medical Information \nProtection Act of 1998. I know it is late in the 105th Congress and \nthat there will not be time to give this legislation full \nconsideration. However, I feel strongly about this issue and did not \nwant this session to end without the introduction of this legislation. \nI feel that great progress has been made and that the legislation that \nI am introducing addresses many of the concerns that have been \nexpressed. I will include letters and statements of support for the \nRecord from the following groups: American Medical Informatics \nAssociation; Joint Healthcare Information Technology Alliance; \nIntermountain Health Care; Premier Institute; Association of American \nMedical Colleges; American Health Information Management Association; \nHealthcare Leadership Council; Federation of American Health Systems; \nAmerican Hospital Association and Pharmaceutical Research and \nManufacturers of America. It is my intention to reintroduce this \nlegislation early in the 106th Congress and seek for its passage.\n  Most individuals wrongly assume that their personal health \ninformation is protected under federal law. It is not. Federal law \nprotects the confidentiality of our video rental records, and federal \nlaw ensures us access to information about us such as our credit \nhistory. However, there is no current federal law which will protect \nthe confidentiality of our medical information and ensure us access to \nour own medical information. This is a circumstance that must change. \nThis is a circumstance that the Medical Information Protection Act will \ncorrect.\n  At this time, the only protection of an individual's personal medical \ninformation is under state law. These state laws, where they exist, are \nincomplete, inconsistent and inadequate. At last check, there were over \n34 states with each state having its own unique set of laws to protect \nmedical records. In many states there is no penalty for releasing and \ndisseminating the most private information about our health and the \nhealth care that we have received. Many of our local health care \nsystems continue to expand across state lines and are forced to deal \nwith multiple and conflicting state laws. In addition, advances in \ntechnology allow information to be moved instantaneously across the \ncountry or around the world. The majority of providers, insurers, \nhealth care professionals, researchers and patients agree that there is \nan increasingly urgent need for uniformity in our laws that govern \naccess to and disclosure of personal health information.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that if we do not act by August \nof 1999, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of \n1996 (HIPAA) requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) \nto put into place regulations governing health information in an \nelectronic format. Thus, we could have a circumstance where paper based \nrecords and electronic based records are treated differently. I urge my \ncolleagues to work with me to pass legislation that would give HHS \nclear direction and provide each American with greater protection of \ntheir health information.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Pharmaceutical Research and\n\n\n                                     Manufacturers of America,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1998.\n     Hon. Robert F. Bennett,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennett: The Pharmaceutical Research and \n     Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) applauds your introduction \n     of the Medical Information Protection Act of 1998 and your \n     leadership on this issue. This legislation would help \n     patients in important ways. First, it would protect the \n     confidentiality of their medical information. Second, it \n     would help patients with unmet medical needs and their \n     families by facilitating valuable biomedical research leading \n     to the discovery and development of innovative medicines. \n     Third, it would protect and promote health care quality by \n     encouraging the appropriate use of medical information for \n     epidemiological research, pharmaco-economics and outcomes \n     analysis.\n       Your bill provides a sound regulatory framework to help \n     foster biomedical research and the delivery of high-quality \n     care in an increasingly integrated health care system, while \n     at the same time preserving the confidentiality of sensitive \n     medical information identifying patients.\n       PhRMA welcomes the Medical Information Protection Act of \n     1998 as a good prescription to help patients, commends you \n     leadership on this issue, and looks forward to working \n     together.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alan F. Holmer,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Hospital Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 1998.\n\n  AHA Applauds Introduction of Bill That Protects Privacy of Patient \n                          Medical Information\n\n       The American Hospital Association (AHA) applauds the \n     introduction of a new bill which for the first time would \n     establish a federal confidentiality law that protects \n     patients' private health care information.\n       As guardians of patient medical information, hospitals and \n     health systems have long sought strong federal legislation \n     that would establish a uniform national standard to protect \n     patient privacy. The bill, the Medical Information Protection \n     Act of 1998, appropriately balances the need to protect the \n     privacy of confidential patient information with the need for \n     that information to flow freely among health care providers.\n       ``Comprehensive confidentiality legislation is critical to \n     thousands of patients who come through the doors of our \n     nation's hospitals each day,'' said AHA President Dick \n     Davidson. ``It puts in place the safeguards needed to protect \n     the most sensitive and personal information. We commend \n     Senator Bennett for introducing the bill and for his \n     leadership and guidance on an issue that is relevant to \n     everyone.''\n       The Medical Information Protection Act bill:\n       Allows patients in all states access to their records, a \n     right not currently given in some areas.\n       Establishes full federal preemption of all state \n     confidentiality laws--with the exception of some key public \n     health laws--and sets a uniform standard over weaker or \n     stronger state laws so that patient information is equally \n     protected even as providers are linked across delivery sites \n     and state boundaries.\n       Recognizes the need for confidential medical information to \n     move appropriately and timely within groups and systems of \n     providers without impeding the quality of care.\n       Broadly applies not only to providers, payers, and \n     employers, but also to law enforcement agencies. The Bennett \n     bill moves in the right direction on this issue by setting a \n     national standard for how law enforcers can gain access to \n     confidential patient records.\n       Contains language that, for the first time, would put in \n     place federal sanctions against those who inappropriately \n     disclose medical information.\n       ``This is an issue that affects each of us personally,'' \n     Davidson said. ``America's hospitals and health systems look \n     forward to working with Senator Bennett and Congress to help \n     enact legislation to protect the privacy of each and every \n     individual they serve.''\n       The AHA is a not-for-profit organization of health care \n     provider organizations that are committed to the health \n     improvement of their communities. The AHA is the national \n     advocate for its members, which includes 5,000 hospitals, \n     health care systems, networks and other providers of care. \n     Founded in 1898, AHA provides education for health care \n     leaders and is a source of information on health care issues \n     and trends.

Robert F. Bennett,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennett: The American Medical Informatics \n     Association (AMIA) is a national organization dedicated to \n     the development and application of medical informatics in \n     support of patient care, teaching, research, and health care \n     administration. On behalf of AMIA's more than 3,800 \n     physicians, researchers, librarians, information systems \n     managers, and other professionals with expertise in \n     information technologies, I write to commend you on the \n     introduction of the ``Medical Information Protection Act of \n     1998.''\n       AMIA recognizes that the enormous potential of computer and \n     communications technology to improve health care delivery, \n     quality and access cannot be realized unless individuals, and \n     the society-at-large, are reasonably certain that safeguards \n     are in place to protect the confidentiality of personal \n     health information in medical records. Simply, every person \n     must feel that his or her health data is protected against \n     unnecessary disclosure. At the same time, there can be no \n     doubt that the delivery of highest quality health care and \n     advances in medical research cannot proceed without the \n     timely and efficient transfer of health data across the \n     health information infrastructure. Thus, in developing \n     national standards for health information, Congress--as \n     charged by the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act of 1996--must thoughtfully and carefully \n     balance the rights of individuals, the capacity of the health \n     care system to provide needed health care, and the interests \n     of our nation as a whole. We believe that the ``Medical \n     Information Protection Act'' does an admirable job of \n     accomplishing those complex goals.\n       Our association is especially concerned that health \n     information standards allow appropriate access to health data \n     for research, while adequately protecting patient \n     confidentiality. Dr. Don Detmer, Co-Chair of AMIA's Public \n     Policy Committee, was pleased to consult with your staff on a \n     number of occasions to address that issue, and to devise \n     enforcement mechanisms to effectively sanction the misuse of \n     protected health information.\n       The American Medical Informatics Association thanks you for \n     introducing the ``Medical Information Protection Act of \n     1998.'' We look forward to passage of the bill, an essential \n     first step in the development of a national health \n     information strategy to advance the health of our nation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul D. Clayton, Ph.D.,\n       President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Joint Healthcare Information\n\n\n                                          Technology Alliance,\n\n                                                  October 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Robert F. Bennett,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennett: Representing a broad array of \n     medical, information, and technology professionals involved \n     in the development, use, management, and security of \n     healthcare information systems, the organizations of the \n     Joint Healthcare Information Technology Alliance (JHITA) \n     strongly support enactment of federal legislation to protect \n     the confidentiality of medical records. We write today to \n     commend you on the introduction of the ``Medical Information \n     Protection Act of 1998.''\n       The more than 50,000 members of our constituent \n     organizatons--physicians, researchers and other health \n     professionals, medical records professionals and information \n     systems managers and executives, healthcare information \n     technology developers and vendors--believe that computer and \n     communications technologies hold enormous potential to \n     improve healthcare delivery, quality and access, while also \n     reducing costs. Yet, these benefits cannot be realized unless \n     individuals, and society, are confident that safeguards are \n     in place to protect the confidentiality of personal health \n     information. Simply, every person must feel that his or her \n     health data is protected against unnecessary disclosure. At \n     the same time, there can be no doubt of the need for timely \n     and efficient transfer of health data across the health \n     information infrastructure. Thus, national standard for the \n     collection, use and dissemination of healthcare information \n     must thoughtfully and carefully balance the rights of \n     individuals, the capacity of the healthcare system to provide \n     needed services and the interests of our nation as a whole. \n     The JHITA believes that the ``Medical Information Protection \n     Act'' does an admirable job of accomplishing those complex \n     goals.\n       In order for national fair information standards to offer \n     consistent and genuine guidance and protection to healthcare \n     professionals and consumers, and effect significant Federal \n     penalties and sanctions for the misuse of health data, the \n     JHITA believes that federal law must preempt the current \n     patchwork of federal, state and local laws and regulations \n     governing health information. We applaud your commitment in \n     the ``Medical Information Protection Act'' to a uniform and \n     high level of confidentiality for all health information, \n     regardless of the individual's diagnosis or state of \n     residence.''\n       The Joint Healthcare Information Technology Alliance thanks \n     you for introducing the ``Medical Information Protection Act. \n     We look forward to working with you to win passage of the \n     bill, an essential first step in the development of a \n     national health information strategy that will advance the \n     health of our nation and protect the rights of all.\n           Sincerely,\n     Linda Kloss,\n       Executive Vice President & CEO, AHIMA.\n     Carla Smith,\n       Executive Director, CHIM.\n     John Page,\n       Executive Director, HIMSS.\n     Dennis Reynolds,\n       Executive Director, AMIA.\n     Richard Correll,\n       President, CHIME.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       american Health Information\n\n\n                                       Management Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1998.\n     Senator Robert F. Bennett,\n     Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennett: On behalf of the more than 37,000 \n     members of the American Health Information Management \n     Association (AHIMA), thank you for once again being in the \n     forefront of the effort to pass legislation to protect the \n     confidentiality of individually identifiable health \n     information. AHIMA is pleased to offer its strong support for \n     the Medical Information Protection Act of 1998.\n       During the past several years, we have worked with you and \n     your Legislative Director Paul A. ``Chip'' Yost and developed \n     several legislative proposals that have resulted in the \n     current bill. The hard work put into the drafting of this \n     landmark legislation has paid-off. The bill strikes a hard-\n     to-achieve balance between protecting the confidentiality of \n     a patient's health information while not impeding the \n     provision of patient care or the operations of the nation's \n     health care delivery system. One of the most important facets \n     of the Medical Information Protection Act is that it contains \n     strong criminal and civil sanctions to provide remedies \n     against wrongful disclosure of health information. In \n     addition, the legislation will eliminate the current \n     patchwork-quilt of various state statutes and regulations, \n     thus providing all Americans the confidentiality protections \n     that they truly deserve.\n       Senator, AHIMA is pleased to continue working with you and \n     your office on this important issue. Your dedication has kept \n     us encouraged that Congress will pass legislation to \n     establish a uniform national policy for the use and \n     disclosure of individually identifiable health information. \n     As you know from our past association, AHIMA has been a \n     leader in the effort to pass comprehensive confidentiality \n     legislation.

Robert Bennett (R-UT) for introducing \n     the ``Medical Information Protection Act of 1998.''\n       ``This bill protects the confidentiality of patient health \n     information and establishes new federal penalties for its \n     misuse,'' said HLC President Pamela G. Bailey. ``At the same \n     time, the Bennett bill allows for the appropriate use of \n     patient health information to promote a better health care \n     delivery system and protect vital health care research.''\n       Information is the cornerstone of a high quality, \n     innovative health care system,'' Bailey said. ``In fact, it \n     can be an issue of life or death. Without access to patient \n     information, physicians, health plans, hospitals and \n     researchers would be unable to provide the high standard of \n     care that Americans deserve.''\n       As the leading innovators in the health care industry, HLC \n     members support federal rules to ensure patient \n     confidentiality rather than the increasingly confusing \n     patchwork of state laws. ``The Bennett bill would replace \n     this patchwork of state laws with a strong federal law that \n     protects patients and provides a workable, uniform framework \n     that facilitates the delivery of the highest quality health \n     care.''\n       ``In the debate over patient confidentiality, we sometimes \n     lose sight of what most patients want most--to get healthy. \n     Fundamental to the fantastic advances made in treatment of so \n     many diseases is our ability to use patient information \n     throughout our increasingly complex health care system,'' \n     said Bailey.\n       The HLC is committed to working toward final enactment of \n     comprehensive, uniform\n\n[[Page S12176]]\n\n     confidentiality legislation by the August 1999 deadline \n     imposed under the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act.\n       The HLC is a coalition of the chief executive of America's \n     leading health care institutions.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Federation of\n\n\n                                      American Health Systems,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1998.\n\n    FAHS Praises Introduction of Medical Information Protection Act\n\n\n    applauds utah gop senator bennett for his leadership and health \n                       community outreach efforts\n\n       The Federation today praised Sen. Robert Bennett (R-UT) for \n     introducing the Medical Information Protection Act of 1998 \n     and applauded his leadership in drawing upon the input of a \n     broad range of health care organizations in crafting the \n     legislation.\n       ``Although it's a bit like walking a tight-rope, Sen. \n     Bennett's commitment to working with varying interests on \n     this important issue should be commended,'' said Laura \n     Thevenot, Federation Executive Vice President and COO. ``He \n     has approached the task before Congress of passing \n     legislation relating to medical records confidentiality by \n     August of 1999 with openness and a real determination to \n     reach a consensus that protects patients and still allows \n     hospitals and health systems to do their jobs. This \n     legislation establishes a good framework for an issue that \n     will be debated at length when the 106th Congress convenes \n     next January.''\n       Thevenot highlighted a couple of key provisions in the \n     legislation: uniform national confidentiality standards, \n     which would avoid a cumbersome patchwork of state law and \n     regulation, and enhanced security safeguards to ensure \n     appropriate access to patient data.\n       ``As the debate moves forward, one of the Federation's \n     primary concerns is that Congress not tie the hands of \n     hospitals and health systems by putting obstacles in the way \n     of their commitment to provide the necessary treatment and \n     care patients need,'' Thevenot added. ``Our commitment has \n     always been and will remain to serve the patient. Proper uses \n     of information for treatment, payment, quality improvement, \n     and where appropriate, research, are a critical component of \n     that commitment.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Intermountain Health Care,\n\n                              Salt Lake City, UT, October 2, 1998.\n     Hon. Robert F. Bennett,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennett: Intermountain Health Care (``IHC'') \n     applauds the introduction of the ``Medical Information \n     Protection Act of 1998.'' IHC is deeply appreciative of your \n     leadership in developing legislation to establish uniform \n     federal confidentiality standards. IHC also wishes to express \n     its deep appreciation of the hard work and dedication of Chip \n     Yost and Mike Nielsen of your staff.\n       The bill you have crafted reflects a keen understanding of \n     the need to strike an appropriate balance between \n     safeguarding patient identifiable health information and \n     facilitating the coordination and delivery of high quality, \n     network-based health care, such as that provided at IHC. \n     Indeed, striking the right balance is critical to the \n     delivery of the best possible patient care.\n       As you well know, IHC has developed state-of-the-art \n     electronic medical records and common databases which we used \n     extensively not just for treatment and payment but for such \n     fundamental quality enhancing activities as outcomes review, \n     disease management, health promotion and quality assurance. \n     You bill rightly recognizes that all of these efforts are \n     essential to optimizing patient health.\n       In addition, we are particularly pleased that you have \n     called for federal preemption of state law. Health systems \n     like IHC, which operate across state lines, would have \n     enormous difficulty complying with different federal and \n     state standards.\n       As you know, IHC is a large integrated health care delivery \n     system based in Salt Lake City and operating in the states of \n     Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. The IHC system includes 23 \n     hospitals, 33 clinics, 16 home health agencies, and 400 \n     employed physicians. Additionally, our system operates a \n     large Health Plans Division with enrollment of 350,000 \n     directly insured plus 430,000 who use our networks through \n     other insurers. IHC's 20,000 employees are keenly aware of \n     their responsibility to safeguard personal health information \n     and IHC has invested considerable resources in order to \n     develop effective protections and procedures.\n       IHC pledges to work with you toward enactment of this \n     important legislation well in advance of the August 1999 \n     deadline established by the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act of 1996. Please do not hesitate to contact \n     me or IHC's Washington Counsel Michael A. Romansky (202/756-\n     8069) and Karen S. Sealander (202/756-8024) of McDermott, \n     Will & Emery with questions or for further information.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        John T.

Bennett (R-UT) for his \n     leadership in introducing the ``Medical Information \n     Protection Act of 1998.'' ``This legislation protects \n     patients from being subjected to unauthorized or \n     inappropriate use of their medical records and, at the same \n     time, ensures that hospitals and health plans have access to \n     information necessary to do their jobs in serving patients,'' \n     said Scott. ``Senator Bennett creates workable standards that \n     protect patient's confidentiality and assures that medical \n     information is available for the treatment, quality \n     assurance, and research needs that are so important to our \n     health care system and the patients it serves.''\n       The Bennett bill recognizes the many legitimate uses for \n     medical information and provides the right regulatory \n     framework for safeguarding the use and disclosure of \n     protected health information by the health care industry. The \n     bill permits its use for patient treatment, quality enhancing \n     activities, payment for health care activities, and research \n     for the development of life saving pharmaceuticals and new \n     medical procedures. By providing for a singular authorization \n     process when a patient accesses the health care system, the \n     bill avoids costly administrative burdens for health care \n     providers and barriers to the efficient use of information \n     within integrated care networks, hospital systems, physician-\n     hospital organizations, or managed care organizations.\n       The bill also adopts uniform national confidentiality \n     standards. Given the increasingly complex and interstate \n     nature of the way health information flows in today's \n     delivery system, strong preemption of state confidentiality \n     laws protects consumers and minimizes the costs associated \n     with the increasing patchwork of conflicting state laws.\n       Finally, the bill clearly recognizes the value of medical \n     research and does not establish unnecessary barriers to \n     research. It allows for the use of protected health \n     information in research activities while holding medical \n     researchers to confidentiality requirements that protect the \n     identity of the individuals in a medical study. Under this \n     bill, researchers will continue to have access to databases \n     of patient information that are crucial in discovering trends \n     and anomalies that lead to cures for diseases over time.\n       ``Today marks the introduction of an important piece of \n     legislation for the future of our health care system,'' said \n     Scott. ``We look forward to working with Senator Bennett to \n     enact the right patient confidentiality standards into law.''\n       Premier is a strategic alliance of leading hospitals and \n     healthcare systems across the country, representing nearly \n     215 owners and the 800 hospitals and healthcare facilities \n     they operate, and approximately 900 other affiliated \n     hospitals.

Robert Bennett,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Offices Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennett: I write to convey the Association of \n     American Medical Colleges' (AAMC) support for your bill \n     entitled the ``Medical Information Protection Act.'' The AAMC \n     represents the nation's 125 accredited medical schools, \n     approximately 400 major teaching hospitals, and 86 academic \n     and professional societies representing over 90,000 faculty \n     members.\n       We believe the Medical Information Protection Act is a \n     thoughtful effort to address the very important and complex \n     issues surrounding the protection of patient health \n     information. This legislation is a significant step in the \n     right direction as Congress attempts to achieve the delicate \n     balance between the competing goods of individual privacy and \n     the considerable public benefit that results from controlled \n     access to health information that is crucial to our country's \n     continuing ability to deliver high-quality health care and \n     cutting-edge research.\n       Over the past year, the AAMC has advocated for medical \n     information privacy legislation that employees appropriate \n     confidentiality safeguards while ensuring access to patient \n     records and other archival materials required to pursue \n     biomedical, behavioral, and health services research. The \n     AAMC is pleased that the Medical Information Protection Act \n     incorporates many of the major principles articulated by the \n     Association.\n       In particular, the AAMC supports the legislation's clear \n     and workable definitions for ``protected health information'' \n     and ``nonidentifiable health information,'' the creation of \n     appropriate safeguards and stiff penalties to protect patient \n     confidentiality, and the proposed preemption of state privacy \n     laws. While recognizing that preemption is a politically \n     highly-charged issue, the Association believes that, in an \n     era of rapidly emerging information technology and major \n     consolidation of the health care industry, protecting the \n     ability of medical information to flow unimpeded across state \n     lines is essential to the functioning of a high-quality, \n     medically-effective and efficient care delivery system.\n\n[[Page S12177]]\n\n       In addition, the AAMC applauds the bill's affirmation of \n     support for the role of institutional review boards in the \n     disclosure of protected health information for research \n     purposes. We believe that the security of medical information \n     created, maintained and used in the course of medical \n     research would be significantly strengthened by the \n     provisions of this bill.\n       We thank you for your leadership on this issue and look \n     forward to continuing to work with you as this bill is \n     considered by the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Jordan J. Cohen, M.D.\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 2610. A bill to amend the Clean Air to repeal the grandfather \nstatus for electric utility units; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                  the clean electric power act of 1998\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nClean Electric Power Act of 1998, and to be joined by my colleagues \nSenators Dodd, Kerry, Lautenberg, and Torricelli.\n  This legislation would address a gap in the Clean Air Act that \nexempts older power plants from strict environmental standards, \nallowing them to emit more pollutants than newer facilities and \ncontributing to serious environmental problems. This disparity is of \nparticular concern right now as we enter the new world of restructuring \nof the electric utility industry--a world that was never envisioned at \nthe time of any of the Clean Air Act Amendments, including the 1990 \nAmendments. Because most of the older plants don't have to expend the \nsame amount of money on environmental controls that newer plants do, it \nis simple economics that these older plants will benefit under \nderegulation by increasing their generation of power and, therefore, \ntheir emissions of dangerous pollutants into the air. This situation is \nunfair to utilities that generate electricity while meeting stricter \nenvironmental standards, and it is unfair to the public whose health \nwill be endangered.\n  Electricity deregulation carries the promise of enormous benefits for \nthe consumer in terms of reduced electric bills which I strongly \nsupport. But unless we do it right, electricity deregulation also can \nresult in significant adverse environmental and public health effects. \nSome of the early results from the initial efforts at deregulation of \nwholesale power sales, as well as studies containing projections about \nwhat might occur, are very disturbing:\n  In February, EPA projected increases of 553,000 tons of nitrogen \noxides and 62 million tons of carbon by the year 2010 resulting from \nrestructuring, without provisions in restructuring legislation to \naddress pollution increases.\n  THe Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management in January \n1998 found that several large Midwestern power companies substantially \nincreased their wholesale electricity sales between 1995 and 1996. This \nmeant substantially increased generation at several of the companies' \nhighest polluting coal-fired power plants, large increases in the flow \nof power from the Midwest towards the east, and substantial increases \nin emissions from power plants.\n  A 1995 Harvard University Study concluded that electricity \nrestructuring could adversely affect environmental quality for a number \nof reasons, including increasing utilization of older, higher emitting \ncoal facilities.\n  A 1996 Resources for the Future Study examined the regional air \npollution effects that could result from a more competitive market. The \nstudy concluded that in the year 2000, the Nation's NOX \nemissions would increase by about 350,000 tons and the carbon dioxide \nemissions would increase by about 114 million tons.\n  Let me give a little background about how we got to where we are.\n  A series of requirements in the 1970 and 1977 Clean Air Act and \namendments thereto required that utility plants meet new source \nperformance standards for pollutants, including nitrogen oxides and \nsulfur dioxide. The act defines these standards as emissions limits \nreflecting the degree of emission limitation achievable through the \napplication of the best system of emission reduction, taking into \naccount cost, as determined by the Administrator. However, these \nstandards were only imposed on new generating plants, and did not cover \nexisting plants, plants under construction, or in the permitting \nprocess or being planned for, unless they undertook major construction.\n  At the time, the view was that it would be more cost-effective to \nimpose stricter standards on new facilities than existing ones, and \nthat many of the existing facilities would be retiring soon. But for a \nnumber of economic reasons, the anticipated retirement of plants did \nnot occur. More than half of the power plants operating today were \nbuilt before the new source standards went into effect.\n  My legislation would require that power plants that generate \nelectricity that flows through transmission or connected facilities \nthat cross State lines comply with the stricter environmental \nstandards. It would also require EPA to set up a market-based allowance \ntrading program to allow utilities to comply in the most cost-effective \nmanner.\n\n  Electric power generating plants are among the largest sources of air \npollution in the United States. According to EPA reports, power plants \naccount for 67 percent of all sulfur dioxide emissions, 28 percent of \nall nitrogen oxide emissions, 36 percent of all carbon dioxide \nemissions and over 33 percent of mercury emissions. These pollutants \ncontribute significantly to some of the most urgent public health and \nenvironmental problems in the United States, including smog, fine \nparticles acid rain, excessive nutrient loads to important water bodies \nsuch as Long Island Sound, toxic impacts on health and ecosystems from \nmercury emissions, climate change, and nitrogen saturation of sensitive \nforest ecosystems.\n  This is not to say that older plants do not have any pollution \ncontrols. Some controls are required on these plants under older \nstandards, State Implementation Plans, and the requirements under the \nacid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. But in \nmany cases, the controls fall far short of levels that would be \nachieved under the new source performance standards. Some studies show \nthat the older plants emit pollutants at rates that are often four to \nten times higher than the cleanest operating plants, but there is \nsignificantly less disparity in areas where states have imposed tighter \ncontrols under the State Implementation Plans, state laws or regional \nprograms such as California and parts of the Northeast. In addition, \nEPA's new regulation requiring 22 states to reduce \nNOx emissions will result in significant reductions at many \npower plants. The bill makes clear that nothing affects the obligations \nof sources to comply with that new regulation in the timeframe set \nforth by EPA or to comply with any other provision of the Clean Air \nAct.\n  But we still have a situation where there is currently an \nunacceptably high level of power plant emissions and, in many cases, a \ndisparity in emission requirements between different generators. On top \nof this, we have a new era of electricity deregulation and \nrestructuring which we are entering at a rapid pace; in the foreseeable \nfuture, retail consumers all over the country may be able to choose \ntheir supplier of electricity. As I've noted, this era of deregulation \nwas never envisioned at the time of either the 1977 Clean Air Act \nAmendments or the more recent 1990 Amendments. Increasing competitive \nmarkets provide opportunities for relatively low cost generators to \nincrease generation; where cost differentials are due in part to \ndifferences in emission standards this will mean increases in \ngeneration at the highest emitting plants.\n  Mr. President, the good news is that cost-effective technologies are \navailable to meet these stricter standards. For example, the Northeast \nStates for Coordinated Air Use Management and the Mid-Atlantic Regional \nAir Management Association have recently completed a report on the \navailability of controls for NOx and the cost-effectiveness \nof those controls. The report shows that a number of advanced emissions \ncontrol technologies are available that can reduce NOx \nemissions from utilities by 85 percent or more, and that these controls \nare not only feasible but are highly cost-effective. The report looked \nat real world experience with the application of available technology \nat 19 coal fired facilities\n\n[[Page S12178]]\n\nand found that NOx emissions nearly 50 percent stricter than \nEPA's new standard for NOx can be achieved at the vast \nmajority of coal utilities. Of course, under the bill grandfathered \nutilities would have the option of purchasing allowances as an \nalternative method of meeting the performance standards.\n  Mr. President, as we enter the era of deregulation we have a unique \nopportunity to provide great benefits for the consumers and reduce air \npollution, which I strongly support. But we need to ensure that proper \npollution safeguards are in place to rectify the current disparity in \nstandards and to ensure that air pollution does not increase in a \ncompetitive market.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nlegislation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2610\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY \n                   UNITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) older electric utility units are exempt from strict \n     emission control requirements applicable to newer facilities, \n     allowing some older units to emit greater quantities of \n     dangerous pollutants;\n       (2) this disparity in regulatory treatment is of particular \n     concern in the new era of electric utility restructuring, \n     which was never envisioned at the time of enactment of the \n     Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) or amendments to that \n     Act;\n       (3) in an era of electric utility restructuring, utilities \n     that spend less money on environmental controls will be able \n     to increase their generation of power and emissions of \n     dangerous pollutants;\n       (4) this situation results in an unfair competitive \n     disadvantage for utilities that generate electricity while \n     meeting strict environmental standards;

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nenable medicare beneficiaries to remain enrolled in their chosen \nmedicare health plan; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          Medicare Legislation\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, yesterday the President announced his plans \nfor helping Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in health plans \nwhich are not renewing their Medicare contracts for next year. I am \nglad that President Clinton recognizes the problems Medicare \nbeneficiaries are facing and I think it is important that we all work \ntogether to address this issue. But I am concerned that the President \noffered a `tomorrow' solution for today's problem.\n  The problems facing Medicare HMO beneficiaries need attention now and \ncannot wait until next year. The President's proposal is inadequate and \nwe must take immediate action to help Medicare beneficiaries to stay in \ntheir chosen health plans.\n  Across the country, including in my home state of Delaware, thousands \nof Medicare beneficiaries are losing their HMO coverage and being \nforced back into the original Medicare program with expensive Medigap \npolicies. We need to help these beneficiaries today.\n  I am urging my colleagues in the House and Senate to act now to allow \nMedicare managed care plans that have withdrawn from the program to get \nback into Medicare. The legislation I am introducing today, along with \nmy colleagues Senator Liebermann and Senator Mack, would instruct the \nHealth Care Financing Administration to allow these plans to \nrestructure their costs where justified. This would give many of the \nhealth insurance providers the flexibility they need to go back in to \nthese markets. But most critically important, it would give \nbeneficiaries the opportunity to remain in their current plans without \nthe disruption and increased costs that they will otherwise face.\n  I am presenting this legislation today after several attempts over \nthe last month to work with the Administration to allow Medicare+Choice \nplans to update their cost and beneficiary filings for 1999. I had \nhoped to resolve this problem administratively--before these plans made \ntheir final decisions to pull out of 371 counties leaving 220 thousand \nbeneficiaries to find another Medicare option. I sent a letter to HCFA \nhead Nancy-Ann Min Deparle urging HCFA to take immediate action to \nprevent these manage care plans from leaving the Medicare+Choice \nprogram.\n  I find it highly regrettable that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration decided not to allow Medicare+Choice plans to update \ntheir cost and benefit filings for 1999. This decision could undermine \nthe Medicare+Choice program enacted into law just last year and which I \nbelieve holds so much promise for improving Medicare for seniors.\n  HCFA's shortsighted decision will result in large out-of-pocket cost \nincreases, fewer benefits, and fewer choices for hundreds of thousands \nof Medicare beneficiaries. The beneficiaries who will bear the hardest \nbrunt of the Administration's decision are the 455,000 enrolled in non-\nrenewing Medicare+Choice plans in counties where no additional plans \nexist. These beneficiaries will now be left with only a significantly \nmore expensive Medicare option; that is, the original Medicare program \ncombined with a Medigap insurance policy. This is particularly \nunfortunate given that premiums for Medigap insurance policies have \nbeen sharply increasing each year. In fact, the American Association \nfor Retired Persons announced just this week that its Medigap insurance \npremiums will increase by an average of 9 percent nationwide next year.\n\n[[Page S12179]]\n\n  And even in areas where beneficiaries will be left with one or more \nhealth plan options, the plan withdrawal will result in reduced \ncompetition which translates to higher out-of-pocket costs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  I am very concerned by the agency's failure to evaluate potential \nincreased beneficiary cost-sharing when making the critical decision \nnot to allow plans to update their cost and benefit filings. I believe \nthis action demonstrates HCFA's continued resistance to facilitate \nprivate plan choices for Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of the \nconsequence to beneficiaries.\n  I hope that the Congress and President Clinton will fight the \ntemptation to play politics with Medicare and instead do the right \nthing for beneficiaries by taking action before Congress adjourns for \nthe year to help beneficiaries to remain in their current Medicare \nhealth plans if they so choose. Next year, we can work together toward \na more comprehensive solution to this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FORD:\n  S. 2612. A bill to provide that Tennessee may not impose sales taxes \non any goods or services purchased by a resident of Kentucky at Fort \nCampbell, nor obtain reimbursement for any unemployment compensation \nclaim made by a resident of Tennessee relating to work performed at \nFort Campbell; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 fort campbell tax fairness act of 1998\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Fort Campbell Tax \nFairness Act. This legislation is designed to restore some sense of \nbalance and maintain some level of fairness in the taxation of \nindividuals who work at the Fort Campbell military installation in \nKentucky and Tennessee.\n  My colleagues may recall that earlier this month, an unprecedented \nprovision was included in the Defense Authorization bill which granted \nspecial tax status for a single site--Fort Campbell--to Tennessee \nresidents who work on the Kentucky side of the border. Even worse, the \nprovision in the Defense bill preempted State tax law. It preempted the \nability of my State to administer its own tax laws in a fair manner, \nand in a way in which the State determined was fairest and best.\n  The provision adopted in the Defense bill exempts Tennessee residents \nwho work in Kentucky at Fort Campbell from paying Kentucky state income \ntaxes. This special exemption was snuck into the House version of the \nbill, and then maintained in the conference committee. It is extremely \nunfair.\n  Mr. President, the Congress has no business dictating to States how \nthey should administer their own tax laws. This is a matter for the \nStates to determine by themselves. The basic principle of taxation is \nthat income is taxed at the location where it is produced. There are \nexceptions to this rule, but generally they are worked out among and \nbetween States themselves. The only other exceptions of which I am \naware relate to federal employees with a unique interstate aspect to \ntheir jobs, like members of the military or Members of Congress, or \nother employees with a special interstate job situation, like Amtrak \nemployees or those involved in constructing interstate highways.\n  I have never heard of a special State tax exemption for private \nsector employees at a single site. That is, I had never heard of it \nuntil I saw this year's Defense Authorization bill.\n  But Mr. President, the provision in the Defense Authorization bill is \na one way street. It preempts Kentucky state law for Tennessee \nresidents who would otherwise be taxed within Kentucky's borders. But \nthere is no comparable preemption of Tennessee state law for Kentucky \nresidents who are taxed at Fort Campbell within Tennessee's borders.\n  As a matter of basic fairness, if Tennessee residents are to be \ngranted a special tax exemption while on the Kentucky side of Fort \nCampbell, Kentucky residents should be given equal consideration while \non the Tennessee side of Fort Campbell. In addition, it is currently \nthe case that unemployment compensation for any Tennessee residents who \nwork on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell are paid out of Kentucky tax \ndollars. This should no longer be the case now that Tennessee workers \nare being given a special tax status and are exempt from Kentucky laws.\n  My legislation attempts to correct these new inequities created by \nthe passage of this year's Defense Authorization bill. First, it would \ndirect that Tennessee sales taxes imposed on the Tennessee side of Fort \nCampbell apply only to Tennessee residents. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee, in debate on the Defense Authorization bill, asserted \nthat no such taxes are currently collected at Fort Campbell. Therefore, \nhe should have no objection to this provision whatsoever. However, I \nhave been informed that Tennessee sales taxes are in fact collected \nfrom private business operations within the Fort Campbell boundaries. \nSo this provision is badly needed as a matter of fairness.\n  Second, the legislation clearly states that the Commonwealth of \nKentucky has absolutely no obligation to continue paying the \nunemployment benefits of Tennessee residents out of Kentucky tax \ndollars. Since Tennessee residents have been given this special tax \nstatus and preemption of State laws, Kentucky should no longer have any \nliabilities should these workers become unemployed. Those claims should \nbe the responsibility of the State of Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, I have always attempted to fiercely defend the \ninterests of my State during my 24 years in the Senate. The special tax \npreemption provision tucked into the Defense Authorization bill was one \nof the most unfair provisions imaginable, singling out my State for \nunfair treatment. I realize the time is short in the current session, \nand the odds of enacting this legislation are not great in the days \nahead. However, I am introducing this bill to go on the Record in \nadvocating fairness for my State. It is my hope that when the Congress \nreconvenes vigorously pursue efforts to pass this legislation and \ncorrect an unfairness which has been imposed upon my State.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COATS:\n  S. 2614. A bill to amend chapter 96 of title 18, United States Code, \nto enhance the protection of first amendment rights; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                the first amendment freedoms act of 1998\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in 1970, Congress passed provisions known \nas the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, or RICO, as \npart of the larger Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The bill was \ndesigned to help law enforcement officials better address the plague of \norganized crime, and has been a valuable tool in this effort.\n  During drafting of this legislation, concerns were raised by several \nmembers of this body, including my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, that the bill was written so broadly that it might be \nused against organized civil disobedience, including anti-war \ndemonstrators. This was at the height of the Vietnam War, and anti-war \ndemonstrations were taking place across the country. Senator Kennedy, \nalong with Senator Hart of Michigan, submitted their views as part of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee Report on the Organized Crime Control \nAct of 1969.\n  I think their words deserve our attention today. They recognized \nthat, and I quote: ``To combat organized crime, as distinguished from \nother forms of criminal activity, requires procedures specifically \ndesigned for that purpose.'' They continued, ``The reach of this bill \ngoes beyond organized criminal activity. Most of its features propose \nsubstantial changes in the general body of criminal procedures. \nFinally, their statement notes that, ``Amended to restrict its scope \nsolely to organized criminal activity and to assure the protection of \nindividual rights, the bill could contribute important and useful means \nof eradicating organized crime.'' Mr. President, I ask that a copy of \nthis statement from the Judiciary Committee Report be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Individual Views of Messrs. Hart and Kennedy\n\n       To combat organized crime, as distinguished from other \n     forms of criminal activity, requires procedures specifically \n     designed for that purpose.\n\n[[Page S12180]]\n\n       S. 30, the Organized Crime Control Act of 1969, is billed \n     as a means of providing the procedures necessary to eradicate \n     the disease of organized crime and its serious threat to our \n     national security.\n       But the reach of this bill goes beyond organized criminal \n     activity. Most of its features propose substantial changes in \n     the general body of criminal procedures.\n       New rules of evidence and procedure applicable to all \n     criminal jurisprudence are established.\n       Amended to restrict its scope solely to organized criminal \n     activity and to assure the protection of individual rights, \n     the bill could contribute important and useful means of \n     eradicating organized crime.\n       Mr. Coats, in direct response to the legitimate concerns \n     raised by Senator Kennedy, Senator Hart, the ACLU, and \n     others, the language of the Organized Crime Control Act was \n     modified to narrow the definition of racketeering activity. \n     These modifications were seen as adequate, and debate moved \n     on to other issues. It is clear from the record of \n     congressional debate that nobody--not the bill's author, \n     Senator McClellan, not the Judiciary Committee, not the House \n     of Representatives, not my colleague from Massachusetts--\n     nobody was interested in prosecuting civil disobedience as \n     organized crime.\n       Mr. President, our country has a long and distinguished \n     history of political free speech under the First Amendment. \n     At times, political and social protesters have seen civil \n     disobedience as the best manner to bring the message home. \n     From abolitionists of the 18th and 19th centuries to the \n     civil rights demonstrations of Dr. Martin Luther King, non-\n     violent civil disobedience has played a major role in shaping \n     this nation. While civil disobedience is inherently \n     ``disobedient'' to the law, and while such violations of the \n     law have consequences, there is a vast difference between \n     organized crime and organized political protest.\n       Today, this difference is becoming much less noticeable As \n     many of us know, on April 20, 1998, a U.S. District Court \n     jury ruled that anti-abortion leaders had violated federal \n     anti-racketeering statutes by engineering a nationwide \n     conspiracy that involved 21 acts of extortion, mostly the \n     formation of barricades that prevented the use of clinics \n     performing abortions. The defendants were ordered to pay \n     nearly $86,000 in damages. That penalty was automatically \n     tripled under RICO. We are not talking about abortion \n     protesters being charged with political violence--murder, \n     bombing of abortion clinics, or physical violence against \n     patients or employees of the clinics involved. Rather, we are \n     talking about these protesters being charged as racketeers \n     for non-violent forms of civil disobedience.\n       This is not an isolated decision, but rather followed on \n     the heels of a 1994 Supreme Court opinion regarding the scope \n     of RICO. In the case of NOW v. Scheidler, the Supreme Court \n     ruled that the National Orgnaization for Women could bring \n     suit under RICO against a coalition of anti-abortion groups, \n     alleging the defendants were members of a nationwide \n     conspiracy to shut down abortion clinics through a pattern of \n     racketeering activity. Both the U.S. District Court and Court \n     of Appeals had dismissed the suit on grounds that RICO \n     implied an ``economic motive'' for the racketeering activity. \n     The Supreme Court reversed the lower court decisions in \n     finding that the letter of the law in RICO did not require \n     proof that either racketeering enterprise or predicate acts \n     of racketeering be motivated by economic purpose. The Supreme \n     Court then remanded the case to the District Court.\n       The Supreme Court ruling and the subsequent U.S. District \n     Court decision have radically expanded the scope of federal \n     anti-racketeering statues in direct contradiction to the \n     clear intent of Congress in the creation of RICO. The result \n     of the rulings is that civil disobedience is now open to \n     prosecution as organized crime. This is already having a \n     chilling effect on free speech in this country.\n       Mr. President, before going further on this matter, let me \n     make several things very clear. First, this is not an \n     abortion issue. The Senate must continue to wrestle with the \n     morality of the legality of abortion in this country, and my \n     colleagues are well aware of my deep convictions on this \n     matter, but that is not what I am here to discuss. The \n     application of federal anti-racketeering statues to political \n     protest and civil disobedience is not an abortion issue--it \n     is a First Amendment issue. While the catalyst for the \n     expansion of RICO was its application to pro-life \n     demonstrators, the case could just as easily could have \n     involved civil rights advocates, animal rights activities, \n     anti-war demonstrators, or AIDS activists. The issue is not \n     abortion, it is political speech.\n       Let me also make clear that the issue is not whether civil \n     disobedience should be punished: it is, and it should be. \n     This country has a proud history of both the rule of law and \n     the practice of civil disobedience. In a nation under the \n     rule of law, civil disobedience has legal consequences. I am \n     not here to debate whether abortion protesters, AIDS \n     activists, or animal rights demonstrators should abide by the \n     law, or, when they break the law, they should be accountable. \n     There are federal and state laws on the books dealing with \n     trespassing, vandalism, and many other crimes commonly \n     associated with civil disobedience. However, the punishment \n     ought to fit the crime. What we have, in the expansion of \n     RICO, is the application of the heavy rod intended for \n     organized crime, being turned against organized political \n     protest.\n       Finally, let me emphasize that I am not here to debate \n     political violence. Murder, arson, death threats, physical \n     harm--these are not acts of civil disobedience, but of \n     terrorism, and RICO specifically applies to a pattern of such \n     activities. I am not concerned with protecting these actions, \n     whether engaged in by anti-abortion demonstrators or \n     environmental activists.\n       What does concern me deeply, is the prosecution of non-\n     violent civil disobedience as racketeering activity. Under \n     RICO, whoever participates in a commercial ``enterprise'' or \n     an ``enterprise'' which has an impact on commerce, through a \n     pattern of specific criminal ``racketeering'' activity, can \n     be penalized. Typical ``racketeering'' activity includes \n     murder, kidnapping, robbery, arson, bribery, loan-sharking, \n     mail fraud, wire fraud, obstruction of justice, witness \n     retaliation, or extortion. Also included as racketeering \n     activity is violation of the Hobbs Act, which modified the \n     Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934. The Hobbs Act includes a \n     provision which prohibits affecting commerce by ``extortion'' \n     using ``wrongful or threatened force, violence, or fear.''\n       It is this final provision which has been expanded by the \n     Courts to apply to those engaged in civil disobedience. While \n     under common law understanding, ``extortion'' requires the \n     actual trespatory taking of property, the term is now being \n     interpreted as ``coercion,'' which involves compulsion of \n     action. Political and social protest by its very nature \n     attempts to compel a change of actions, whether it be the \n     actions of a logging company cutting old growth forests, a \n     restaurant that will not serve minorities, a business that \n     will not promote women, or a health clinic performing \n     abortions. Such organized efforts to compel action, inherent \n     in civil disobedience, are now captured in the net of RICO.\n       As I stated earlier, Congress did not envision, and could \n     not conceive, of this application of the law, especially in \n     the wake of the modifications undertaken at the time. In its \n     original draft, RICO specified, and I quote, ``any act \n     dangerous to life, limb, or property,'' as predicate \n     offenses. In direct response to concerns raised by several \n     members of Congress, including the Senator from \n     Massachusetts, that this wording could put civil \n     disobedience into jeopardy, the language was redrafted to \n     clearly define RICO's predicate offenses, specifying \n     particular state and federal offenses. No offense remotely \n     related to rioting, trespass, vandalism, or any other \n     aspect of a demonstration that might stray beyond \n     constitutional limits was included as racketeering \n     activity. While state and federal law continues to apply \n     to many of these violations, these were intentionally \n     excluded from the scope of anti-racketeering laws and the \n     increased punishments these entailed.\n       Mr. President, in response to recent Court rulings which \n     have grossly expanded the scope of federal anti-racketeering \n     laws to cover non-violent political protest, I am introducing \n     the First Amendment Freedoms Act today. This legislation \n     restores RICO to its originally intended application of \n     organized criminal activity, and codifies Supreme court \n     opinion regarding the protection of First Amendment rights.\n       Specifically, the bill does two things. First, it narrows \n     the judicially expanded definition of ``extortion'' under \n     RICO, which has allowed for the erroneous prosecution of \n     civil disobedience under this statute. Second, it assures \n     that, in any civil action brought under RICO or any other \n     legal theory, the litigation is conducted consistent with the \n     First Amendment guidelines of the Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S12181]]\n\n       Our nation has a long and distinguished history of non-\n     violent civil disobedience as a legitimate form of political \n     and social protest. Such activity has legal consequences. \n     However, such activity is not the equivalent of organized \n     crime. The prosecution of political and social protest under \n     federal anti-racketeering statutes is entirely contrary to \n     anything Congress foresaw in enacting RICO. Congress should \n     act expeditiously to correct this obvious misapplication of \n     the law.\n       Martin Luther king, Jr., in his acceptance of the Nobel \n     Peace Prize in 1964, said that: ``Nonviolence is the answer \n     to the crucial political and moral questions of our time; the \n     need for man to overcome oppression and violence without \n     resorting to oppression and violence.'' Those who engage in \n     non-violent civil disobedience should not, and it was never \n     the intent of Congress that they would be, prosecuted as \n     criminal racketeers. If the current interpretation of the law \n     had been in effect in the 1950's and 60's, the civil rights \n     movement could easily have been quashed. I trust that \n     Congress will take steps to address this matter in a timely \n     manner.\n  Mr. President, I send my bill to the desk, and I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2615. A bill to study options to improve and enhance the \nprotection, management, and interpretation of the significant natural \nand other resources of certain units of the National Park System in \nnorthwest Alaska, to implement a pilot program to better accomplish the \npurposes for which those units were established by providing greater \ninvolvement by Alaska Native communities, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  Alaska National Interest Legislation\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the legislation that I have \nintroduced today will require the Secretary of the Interior to report \non what he has done, or not done, to implement the requirements of \nsections 1307 and 1308 of the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act. Those provisions sought to mitigate the effect of the \ndesignation of over 100 million acres of land in Alaska for permanent \npreservation on the Alaska Natives who have lived in the areas for \ncenturies. Those provisions required the Secretary to allow those who \nwere already providing visitor services to continue to provide such \nservices and also provided a preference in hiring at those conservation \nunits for local residents.\n\n  Those provisions were intended to accomplish several objectives. \nFirst and foremost, they were designed to ensure that local residents \nwho would assume the costs attendant to the establishment of these \nconservation units as a result of future limitations on economic \nopportunities received some of the benefits from whatever jobs were \ncreated. The provisions also ensured that the rich history and \nknowledge of the area that the local native population possessed was \nmade available to visitors. For a change, Washington could learn from \nthose in the surrounding communities. There would also be an incidental \nbenefit from hiring local residents to the budget of the National Park \nService since they would not have to pay employees to relocate to \nAlaska.\n  Mr. President, while speaking to the issue of benefits, I have been \ntold by several of the residents of Kotzebue that they have assisted in \nthe rescue of Park Service personnel on a number of occasions. It makes \nlittle sense to me to bring someone to the Northwest parks from the \nlower forty-eight who is unfamiliar with the rugged terrain and \ntreacherous weather. It makes better sense to hire an individual who \nstands little chance of getting lost or stranded.\n  This is not a new concept. In various other units of the National \nPark System we have made provisions to take advantage of local \ncommunities, especially where the resource has particular historic or \nreligious significance. At Zuni-Cibola Historical Park, for example, \nsection 4 of Public Law 100-567 specifically authorizes the Secretary \nto enter into cooperative agreements with the Zuni Tribe and individual \ntribal members to provide training for the interpretation, management, \nprotection, and preservation of archaeological and historical \nproperties and in the provision of public services on the Zuni Indian \nReservation to accomplish the purposes for which that unit of the Park \nSystem was established.\n  At the National Park of American Samoa, the Secretary has been \ndirected to establish a program to train native American Samoan \npersonnel to function as professional park service employees and to \nprovide services to visitors and operate and maintain park facilities. \nThe law establishing the park also provided a preference for the hiring \nof local Samoans both as employees and under any contract. The general \nmanagement plan for the park is to be developed in cooperation with the \nGovernor of American Samoa. It is also conceivable, under the \nlegislation, that after fifty years, sole authority to administer the \npark could be turned over to the Governor of American Samoa from the \nSecretary.\n  There are other examples, but I think the time is long overdue for \nthis philosophy to be realized at conservation units in Alaska. The \nDepartment of the Interior, in my view, has been dragging its feet and \nhas failed to take advantage of the rich human resources present in the \nAlaska Native communities that lie in proximity to National Parks and \nRefuges. These units are remarkable and this Nation is not well served \nwhen the Secretary fails to take advantage of the local population.\n\n  In particular, the four northwest Alaska units of the National Park \nSystem would be a good place for the Secretary to begin complying with \nsection 1307 and 1308 of ANILCA and start contracting with the local \npeople for the management of these park units.\n  Bering Land Bridge National Preserve is a remnant of the land bridge \nthat connected Asia with North America more than 13,000 years ago. The \nland bridge itself is now overlain by the Chukchi Sea and the Bering \nSea. During the glacial epoch, this area was part of a migration route \nfor people, animals, and plants whenever ocean levels fell enough to \nexpose the land bridge. Scientists find it one of the most likely \nregions where prehistoric Asian hunters entered the New World.\n  Today Eskimos from neighboring villages pursue subsistence lifestyles \nand manage their reindeer herds in and around the preserve. Some 112 \nmigratory bird species may be seen in the Preserve, along with \noccasional seals, walrus, and whales. Grizzly bears, fox, wolf, and \nmoose also inhabit the Preserve. Other interesting features are rimless \nvolcanoes called Maar craters, Serpentine Hot Springs, and seabird \ncolonies at Sullivan Bluffs.\n  Cape Krusenstern National Monument is comprised of 659,807 acres of \nland and water--a coastal plain dotted with sizable lagoons and backed \nby gently rolling, limestone hills. The Cape Krusenstern area has been \ndesignated an Archeological District in the National Register of \nHistoric Places, and a National Historic Landmark. The core of the \narcheologic district is made up of approximately 114 marine beach \nridges. These beach ridges, formed of gravel deposited by major storms \nand regular wind and wave action, record in horizontal succession the \nmajor cultural periods of the last 4,500 years. The prehistoric \ninhabitants of northwest Alaska occupied the cape seasonally to hunt \nmarine mammals, especially seals. As new beach ridges were formed, \ncamps were made on the ridges closest to the water. Thus, over \ncenturies, a chronological horizontal stratigraphy was laid down in \nwhich the oldest cultural remains were found on the beach ridges \nfarthest from the ocean. The discoveries made at Cape Krusenstern \nNational Monument provided a definite, datable outline of cultural \nsuccession and development in northwest Alaska.\n  The park contains approximately 1,726,500 acres of federal lands and \nencompasses a nearly enclosed mountain basin in the middle section of \nthe Kobuk River in the Northwest Alaska Areas. Trees approach their \nnorthern limit in the Kobuk Valley, where forest and tundra meet. \nToday's dry, cold climate of the Kobuk Valley still approximates that \nof late Pleistocene times, supporting a remnant flora once covering the \nvast Arctic steppe tundra bridging Alaska and Asia. Sand created by the \ngrinding of glaciers has been carried to the Kobuk Valley by winds and \nwater. The great Kobuk Sand Dunes--25 square miles of shifting dunes--\nis the largest active dune field in the arctic latitudes.\n\n[[Page S12182]]\n\n  Native people have lived in the Kobuk Valley for at least 12,500 \nyears. This human use is best recorded at the extensive archeological \nsites at Onion Portage. The Kobuk Valley remains an important area for \ntraditional subsistence harvest of caribou, moose, bears, fish, \nwaterfowl, and many edible and medicinal plants. The slow-moving, \ngentle Kobuk River is tremendous for fishing and canoeing or kayaking.\n  Noatak National Preserve lies in northwestern Alaska, in the western \nBrooks Range, and encompasses more than 250 miles of the Noatak River. \nThe preserve protects the largest untouched mountain-ringed river basin \nin the United States. The river basin provides an outstanding resource \nfor scientific research, environmental education, and subsistence and \nrecreational opportunities.\n  Above the Arctic Circle, the Noatak River flows from glacial melt \natop Mount Igikpak in the Brooks Range out to Kotzebue Sound. Along its \n425-mile course, the river has carved out the Grand Canyon of the \nNoatak. The preserve is in a transition zone between the northern \nconiferous forests and tundra biomes. The river basin contains most \ntypes of arctic habitat, as well as one of the finest arrays of flora \nand fauna. Among the Preserve's large mammals are brown bears, moose, \ncaribou, wolves, lynx, and Dall sheep. Birdlife also is plentiful in \nthe area because of the migrations from Asia and the tip of South \nAmerica. The Noatak River supports arctic char, whitefish, grayling, \nand salmon and is an important resource for fishing, canoeing, and \nkayaking.\n  Mr. President, these are the human and natural resources of Northwest \nAlaska. This legislation will direct the Secretary to finally bring the \ntwo together for the benefit of both Alaska Natives and the \nnation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 2616. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake revisions in the per beneficiary and per visit payment limits on \npayment for health services under the Medicare program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                      health services legislation\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \nChairman, Senator Roth, and other colleagues in introducing a bill to \nimprove the home health interim payment system.\n  Prior to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), home health agencies \nwere reimbursed on a cost basis for all their costs, as long as they \nmaintained average costs below certain limits. That payment system \nprovided incentives for home health agencies to increase the volume of \nservices delivered to patients, and it attracted many new agencies to \nthe program. From 1989 to 1996, Medicare home health payments grew at \nan average annual rate of 33 percent, while the number of home health \nagencies increased from about 5,700 in 1989 to more than 10,000 in \n1997.\n  In order to constrain the growth in costs and usage of home care, the \nBBA included provisions that would establish a Prospective Payment \nSystem (PPS) for home health care, a method of paying health care \nproviders whereby rates are established in advance. An interim payment \nsystem (IPS) was also established while the Health Care Financing \nAdministration works to develop the PPS for home health care agencies.\n  The home health care industry is dissatisfied with the IPS. The \nresulting concern expressed by many Members of Congress prompted us to \nask the General Accounting Office (GAO) to examine the question of \nbeneficiary access to home care. While the GAO found that neither \nagency closures nor the interim payment system significantly affected \nbeneficiary access to care, I remain concerned that the potential \nclosure of many more home health agencies might ultimately affect the \ncare that beneficiaries receive, particularly beneficiaries with \nchronic illness.\n  The bill we are introducing today adjusts the interim payment system \nto achieve equity and fairness in payments to home health agencies. It \nwould reduce extreme variations in payment limits applicable to old \nagencies within states and across states and would reduce artificial \npayment level differences between ``old'' and ``new'' agencies. The \nbill would provide all agencies a longer transition period in which to \nadjust to changed payment limits.\n  Clearly, since the bill may not address all the concerns raised by \nMedicare beneficiaries and by home health agencies, we should revisit \nthis issue next year. A thorough review is needed to determine whether \nthe funding mechanism for home health is sufficient, fair and \nappropriate, and whether the benefit is meeting the needs of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have \ngiven many Medicare beneficiaries the ability to stay home while \nreceiving medical care. An adjustment to the interim payment system and \ndelay in further payment reductions will enable home health agencies to \nsurvive the transition into the prospective payment system while \ncontinuing to provide essential care for beneficiaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

OF \n  THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, AND FOR \n                             OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Mack) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 127\n\n       Whereas November 1998 marks the 50th anniversary of the \n     creation of the National Microbiological Institute (referred \n     to in this resolution as the ``Institute'') under authority \n     of section 202 of the Public Health Service Act;\n       Whereas the Institute was formed through the combination of \n     the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, the Biologics Control \n     Laboratory, the Division of Infectious Diseases and the \n     Division of Tropical Diseases of the National Institutes of \n     Health;\n       Whereas in 1955 Congress renamed the Institute as the \n     National Instituteof Allergy and Infectious Diseases \n     (referred to in this resolution as ``NIAID'') under the \n     authority of the Omnibus Medical Research Act, recognizing \n     the need for a coordinated scientific research program on \n     infectious, allergic and immunologic diseases;\n       Whereas the research portfolio of NIAID encompasses \n     infectious diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency \n     syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, \n     malaria and influenza, immunologic diseases including asthma, \n     allergies and primary immune deficiency diseases, \n     transplantation immunology, and development of new diagnostic \n     therapies and vaccines forinfectious diseases;\n       Whereas research supported by NIAID continues to yield \n     promising advances including the development of vaccines \n     against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and in the \n     identification of effective treatment regimens for childhood \n     asthma;\n       Whereas the continued threat of emerging and re-emerging \n     infectious diseases, like tuberculosis, poses a risk to the \n     health worldwide, NIAID-supported research provides the \n     necessary tools to develop diagnostic tests, new and improved \n     treatments, vaccines and other means to combat the microbial \n     threats of today and those of the future;\n       Whereas NIAID-supported research is making significant \n     progress in understanding the immune system and its disorders \n     including the mechanisms of immune tolerance, which refers to \n     the ability of the immune system to distinguish between cells \n     and tissues that are ``self'' and those that are foreign or \n     ``non-self,'' such as a pathogen, tumor, ortransplanted \n     organ;\n       Whereas such advances are vital to the field of organ \n     transplantation and may prove useful in treating autoimmune \n     diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple \n     sclerosis;\n       Whereas Congress intends that NIAID continue its innovative \n     leadership in delineating pathogenesis, improving diagnosis \n     and treatment, and developing vaccines to prevent infectious \n     and immunologic diseases, thereby contributing to the overall \n     health of the American public and the people of the world: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), that Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the historic significance of the 50th \n     anniversary of theestablishment of the National \n     Microbiological Institute and the creation ofthe Institute \n     that became the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \n     Diseases;\n\n[[Page S12184]]\n\n       (2) recognizes the research scientists, administrative \n     staff, professional societies, and patient groups for their \n     active participation in support of the research programs and \n     goals of the NIAID; and\n       (3) reaffirms its support of the National Institute of \n     Allergy and Infectious Diseases and its commitment to advance \n     knowledge and improve health.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a Senate \nConcurrent Resolution recognizing and honoring the 50th anniversary of \nthe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. An identical \nresolution is being introduced in the House by my distinguished \ncolleague, Representative Northup.\n  As you know I am an ardent supporter of biomedical research and the \nNational Institutes of Health. In this century, great strides have been \nmade in the control of such killer infectious diseases such as polio, \nrubella, measles, cholera, typhoid fever, and diphtheria. Small pox has \nbeen eradicated. We continue to benefit from the development of new \ndrugs and vaccines that contribute enormously to the betterment of the \npublic health.\n  At the forefront of these advances stands the National Institute of \nAllergy and Infectious Diseases. NIAID began as the National \nMicrobiological Institute, formed through the union of the Rocky \nMountain Laboratory, the Biologics Control Laboratory, the Division of \nInfectious Diseases, and the Division of Tropical Disease of the NIH. \nIn 1955, Congress renamed the Institute as the National Institute of \nAllergy and Infectious Diseases, recognizing the need for a coordinated \nscientific research program on infectious, allergic, and immunologic \ndiseases.\n  Research supported by the Institute has led to important advances, \nincluding: the development of vaccines against infectious diseases such \nas meningitis, hepatitis A, whopping cough and the rotavirus diarrhea; \nnew treatments to fight against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); \nand novel interventions to treat childhood asthma.\n  However, despite significant progress, infectious diseases remain the \nworld's leading cause of death, and the third leading cause of death in \nthe United States, and immune-mediated diseases continue to exact a \nconsiderable toll.

Res. 128\n\n       Whereas the United States and Mexico have a long history of \n     close relations and share many economic and security \n     interests;\n       Whereas the democratic and prosperous Mexico is in the \n     interest of the United States;\n       Whereas the United States is providing assistance and \n     licensing exports of military equipment to Mexican security \n     forces for counter-narcotics purposes;\n       Whereas the Department of State has documented human rights \n     violations by Mexican security forces and paramilitary \n     groups;\n       Whereas the conflict in Chiapas, Mexico has resulted in the \n     deaths and disappearance of innocent civilians;\n       Whereas the lack of progress in implementing a preliminary \n     peace agreement signed in 1996 and the presence of tens of \n     thousands of Mexican soldiers, as well as paramilitary and \n     other groups, have contributed to increased political tension \n     and violence in Chiapas and the absence of basic human rights \n     protections;\n       Whereas the persistence of political tension and violence \n     has exacerbated the impoverished conditions of indigenous \n     people in Chiapas;\n       Whereas thousands of indigenous people in Chiapas have fled \n     their homes as a result of the violence and are living in \n     deplorable conditions;\n       Whereas despite President Zedillo's calls for negotiations \n     and repeated visits to chiapas, efforts to negotiate a \n     peaceful resolution of the conflict have been unsuccessful \n     and the National Mediation Commission was dissolved after the \n     resignation of its President, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, due to the \n     lack of progress in the peace process; and\n       Whereas the summary expulsions of United States citizens \n     and human rights monitors from Mexico raise concerns about \n     the commitment of the Government of Mexico to freedom of \n     movement, association and expression. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     Secretary of State should--\n       (1) take effective measures to ensure that United States \n     assistance and exports of equipment to Mexican security \n     forces--\n       (A) are used primarily for counter-narcotics purposes; and\n       (B) do not contribute to human rights violations;\n       (2) encourage the Government of Mexico to reduce political \n     tension and violence in Chiapas by disarming paramilitary \n     groups and decreasing its military presence there;\n       (3) commend the Government of Mexico for inviting the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit \n     Mexico to discuss the Chiapas conflict;\n       (4) encourage the Government of Mexico and the Zapatista \n     National Liberation Army to take steps to create conditions \n     for good faith negotiations that address the social, economic \n     and political causes of the conflict to achieve a peaceful \n     and lasting resolution of the conflict, and to vigorously \n     pursue such negotiations;\n       (5) support efforts to provide relief assistance to \n     displaced persons in Chiapas and adequate monitoring of such \n     assistance; and\n       (6) seek a commitment from the Government of Mexico to \n     respect the rights of United States citizens and human rights \n     monitors in Mexico in accordance with Mexican law and \n     international law.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am today submitting a Concurrent \nResolution expressing the sense of Congress regarding measures to \nachieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the state of Chiapas, \nMexico.\n  This resolution is cosponsored by Senator Dodd, who is the ranking \nmember of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee and among the most \nknowledgeable Members of Congress on Mexican affairs, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Bingaman, Senator Jeffords, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Wellstone, Senator Bumpers, \nSenator Boxer, Senator Kennedy, Senator Durbin, Senator Murray, Senator \nWyden, Senator Harkin, and Senator Mikulski.\n  Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi is today introducing an identical \nresolution in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this resolution is to convey our \nsupport for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Chiapas that has \nbeen simmering since the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Since then, and \ndespite attempts at negotiations, the situation remains explosive. \nScores of innocent people, mostly impoverished Indians, have been \nkilled. Thousands have fled their homes and are living in squalid \nconditions, made unbearable by the recent flooding.\n  This resolution does not attempt to take sides or to dictate an \noutcome. The situation in Chiapas is a complex one that has social, \nethnic, economic and political dimensions. It is a manifestation of \nyears of Mexican history. It is for the Mexican people to resolve.\n  But despite its complexities, there is no doubt that the indigenous \npeople of Chiapas have been the victims of centuries of injustice. Most \ndo not own any land and they live--as their parents and grandparents \ndid--in abject poverty. The Zapatista uprising was a reflection of that \ninjustice and despair, and the political tension and violence of recent \nyears has only exacerbated their plight.\n\n  To his credit, President Zedillo has called for a resumption of \nnegotiations and has visited Chiapas several times. Recently, his \ngovernment invited Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human \nRights, to visit Mexico to discuss the Chiapas situation. I welcome \nthat. But there remains a deep distrust between the two sides, and no \nsign that the government's strategy is working. This resolution calls \non our Secretary of State to encourage the Mexican Government and the\n\n[[Page S12185]]\n\nZapatistas to support negotiations that address the underlying causes \nof the conflict, to achieve lasting peace.\n  Mr. President, this resolution is not meant to embarrass or \ninterfere. It is to convey our concern about the people of Chiapas, and \nthe urgent need for concrete progress to resolve a conflict that has \ncost many innocent lives and which threatens the economic and political \ndevelopment of our southern neighbor.\n  Many Senators may not know the history of the Chiapas conflict. After \nthe 1994 uprising, the Zapatistas and the government tried to resolve \nthe conflict peacefully. Those negotiations collapsed in 1996 when the \nMexican Government walked away from a partial agreement which would \nhave given the inhabitants of Chiapas greater rights.\n  Since then the situation has gotten worse. Last December, Mexican \nparamilitary forces killed 45 unarmed civilians in the village of \nActeal. In June, two police officers and eight villagers died when \nMexican soldiers and police clashed with Zapatista supporters. There \nare now tens of thousands of Mexican soldiers who patrol the roads in \nand out of Chiapas in armored vehicles. They patrol the skies in low \nflying helicopters. They surround the impoverished communities of \nZapatista supporters, who, not surprisingly, see the government as \ntheir enemy. On top of that, there are armed paramilitary groups who \nhave been responsible for some of the worst atrocities.\n  The dissolution of the National Mediation Commission after the \nresignation of its President, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, has further impeded \nefforts to resolve the conflict peacefully.\n  I regularly receive reports of violence or harassment directed \nagainst human rights monitors, including American citizens, who have \nbeen summarily expelled from Mexico for activities that amount to \nnothing more than criticizing the policies of the Mexican Government.\n  One case I have followed closely involves an American priest who \nlived in Chiapas for some 19 years. He was arrested, driven to the \nairport, accused of engaging in illegal political activity on the basis \nof anonymous, unsubstantiated allegations, and summarily expelled. \nEfforts by myself, the American Ambassador, and the Department of State \nto correct this injustice have been entirely unsuccessful. The Mexican \nGovernment has consistently misrepresented the facts in his case.\n  Despite President Zedillo's repeated calls for renewed dialogue with \nthe Zapatistas and their supporters, and despite the fact that the \nZapatistas do not pose a credible threat to the Mexican Government, the \nMexican Government's actions have not improved the situation. The \ngovernment seems to believe that it can solve the problem by \nsimultaneously threatening and holding out promises to Zapatista \nsupporters, even though they live in the same miserable conditions as \ntheir parents, their parents' parents, and their grandparents' \ngrandparents, and they deeply distrust the government.\n  Mr. President, the United States and Mexico share many interests. We \nhave worked together to address concerns on both sides of the border. I \nhave no doubt that the government and the Zapatistas can solve this \nproblem, if they want to. But we must also recognize that violence and \ninstability in Mexico directly affect United States economic and \nsecurity interests, and human rights abuses, wherever and however they \noccur, deserve our attention.\n  This Resolution reflects a balanced approach. Neither side in the \nconflict is blameless. To resolve it peacefully, both must want peace \nand be willing to take steps to create the conditions that make it \npossible for good faith negotiations to succeed, and then sit down at \nthe table together.\n  The Resolution urges the Secretary of State to ensure that the United \nStates is not contributing to the political violence, by reaffirming \ncurrent law which limits assistance and exports of equipment only to \nMexican security forces who are primarily involved in counter-narcotics \nactivities and who do not commit human rights abuses.\n  It calls on the Mexican Government to respect the rights of American \ncitizens and human rights monitors in Mexico.\n  Mr. President, some may ask why we are submitting this Resolution \ntoday, when this conflict has been simmering for years. One reason is \nthat after all this time the problem is no closer to being solved. It \nhas gotten worse, not better. The recent flooding has caused an urgent, \nhumanitarian crisis among displaced people in Chiapas who are \nstruggling to survive. And last week's elections showed, not \nsurprisingly, that fully half the people in Chiapas have no faith in \nthe political process.\n  In short, the status quo is unacceptable. The violence is \nunacceptable. The lack of any meaningful peace process is unacceptable. \nThere is no reason why so many civilians have died. There is no reason \nwhy the causes of the conflict cannot be openly discussed and \neffectively addressed.\n  This Resolution sends a message to the Mexican Government, the \nZapatistas, our own administration and the international community that \nan intensified effort is needed urgently to resolve the conflict \npeacefully.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the other Senators who have \ncosponsored this resolution\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12184-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 294 EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \n TO DEVELOPMENTS IN MALAYSIA AND THE ARREST OF DATO SERI ANWAR IBRAHIM\n\n  Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. \nLieberman, and Mr. Grams) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 294\n\n       Whereas on September 2, 1998, Malaysia's Prime Minister \n     Mahathir Mohamad dismissed Deputy Prim Minister Dato Seri \n     Anwar Ibrahim;\n       Whereas over the past year, Dato Seri Anwar has advocated \n     adopting meaningful economic structural reforms to combat an \n     increasingly deteriorating economy--a view which runs counter \n     to those of Dr. Mahathir;\n       Whereas after being dismissed, Dato Seri Anwar began \n     touring the country and publicly criticizing Dr. Mahathir and \n     the policies of the ruling United Malays Organization Baru \n     (UMNO) party;\n       Whereas in apparent reaction to this criticism Dato Seri \n     Anwar was arrested on September 20, 1998, and held under the \n     provisions of the Malaysian Internal Security Act (ISA);\n       Whereas the ISA removes arrested individuals from the \n     protections afforded criminal defendants under Malaysia's \n     constitution and statutes, and consequently Dato Seri Anwar \n     was held in an undisclosed location without any formal \n     charges being lodged against him;\n       Whereas on September 29, 1998, Dato Seri Anwar was formally \n     charged with nine counts of corruption and sexual misconduct, \n     including four sodomy counts, to which another count was \n     later added;\n       Whereas the vague nature of the charges, as well as the \n     fact that two of the government's ``witnesses'' have already \n     recanted, could reasonably lead to a conclusion that the \n     charges were manufactured by the government for maximum shock \n     value to discredit Dato Seri Anwar and silence him;\n       Whereas when Dato Seri Anwar appeared at his arraignment, \n     he had been beaten by police while in custody; and told the \n     judge that on his first night of detention, while handcuffed \n     and blindfolded, that he was ``boxed very hard on my head and \n     lower jaw and left eye . . . I was then slapped very hard, \n     left and right, until blood came out from my nose and my lips \n     cracked. Because of this I could not walk or see properly'';\n       Whereas to substantiate his claims, Dato Seri Anwar showed \n     the court a large bruise on his arm; his swollen black eye \n     was evident to everyone in the courtroom;\n       Whereas Dr. Mahathir suggested that Dato Seri Anwar \n     inflicted the injuries to himself in order to gain public \n     sympathy;\n       Whereas since its independence Malaysia has been \n     transformed from a divided multi-racial developing nation \n     into a modern, cosmopolitan, economically sophisticated \n     country; and\n       Whereas the government's actions in case of Dato Seri Anwar \n     seriously damage the reputation of Malaysia in the eyes of \n     the rest of the world; Now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That it is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Malaysian government should take every step to \n     safeguard the rights of Dato Seri Anwar, ensure that any \n     charges brought against him are not spurious, afford him a \n     fair and open trial, and fully investigate and prosecute \n     those responsible for his mistreatment while in detention; \n     and that\n       (2) all Malaysians should be permitted to express their \n     political views in a peaceful and orderly fashion without \n     fear of arrest or intimidation.\n\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12185-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12186-S12187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12186]]\nSENATE RESOLUTION 295 TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE \n   DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR ELIMINATING THE USE OF HEROIN\n\n  Mr. COATS (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Coverdell) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources:\n\n                              S. Res. 295\n\n       Whereas heroin use in the United States continues to \n     increase;\n       Whereas drug use among teenagers in the United States is \n     increasing and the number of teenagers that are using heroin \n     for the first time is higher than any other number previously \n     determined;\n       Whereas between 1992 and 1996, heroin use among college-age \n     students increased an estimated 10 percent;\n       Whereas an estimated 810,000 chronic heroin addicts live in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas an estimated 115,000 heroin addicts in the United \n     States are currently participating in methadone programs;\n       Whereas methadone is a synthetic opiate and the use of \n     methadone in treatment for heroin addiction results in the \n     transfer of addiction from one drug to another drug;\n       Whereas heroin addicts and methadone addicts are unable to \n     function as self-sufficient, productive members of society;\n       Whereas methadone addicts who attempt to become drug free \n     experience the same difficult withdrawal process as that \n     experienced by heroin addicts;\n       Whereas the Clinton Administration, through the Office of \n     National Drug Control Policy, is directing the drug policy of \n     the United States toward the wrong goals by announcing a new \n     heroin policy;\n       Whereas that heroin policy would double the number of \n     heroin addicts transferred to methadone addiction, loosen \n     controls with respect to the licensing of methadone \n     dispensers, and promote methadone addiction as the principal \n     means of ending heroin addiction;\n       Whereas no official responsible for that policy has \n     consulted with Congress concerning that policy and the \n     Clinton Administration lacks sufficient statutory and \n     budgetary authority to carry out that policy; and\n       Whereas in promoting methadone addiction as the preferred \n     treatment for heroin addiction, the Clinton Administration \n     has abandoned heroin addicts to a lifetime of Government-\n     sponsored drug dependency: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should adopt a zero-tolerance \n     drug-free policy that has as its principal objective the \n     elimination of drug abuse and addiction, including both \n     methadone and heroin;\n       (2) Congress should conduct a thorough examination of the \n     national drug control policy of the United States to \n     determine the reasons for the failure of methadone and \n     methadone maintenance programs to eliminate heroin addiction;\n       (3) Congress should carefully examine alternative \n     approaches to curing heroin addiction, and focus on \n     treatments that eliminate dependence on, or addiction to, any \n     substance or drug; and\n       (4) Congress should work with the Clinton Administration to \n     develop an effective drug control policy that--\n       (A) includes a clear and comprehensive strategy to provide \n     for a transition to a zero-tolerance, drug-free program that \n     is based on detoxification and the comprehensive treatment of \n     the pathology of drug addiction;\n       (B) addresses other human needs that contribute to \n     recidivism among recovering heroin addicts; and\n       (C) provides opportunities for former addicts to become \n     self-sufficient, productive members of society.\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I am here today with my colleagues, \nSenator Coats and Senator Coverdell, to submit a resolution providing \nmuch needed direction to our nation's battle against heroin addiction.\n  Drug abuse continues to plague our society, destroying families, \nfutures and opportunities for millions of Americans each year. \nAddiction to drugs, particularly devastating drugs like heroin, \nendangers the well-being of all citizens, particularly our children, \nand thus the future of this nation.\n  Recent statistics show dramatic increases in drug use among children \nand pain a chilling image of the obstacles facing our nation before we \ncan claim victory in the battle against drugs. In a 1997 study, almost \n12 percent of children between the ages of 12 and 17 report using an \nillicit drug in the preceding 30 days. The number of children using \nheroin for the first time is at its highest level in 30 years, and \ntoday there are over 810,000 heroin addicts in our country.\n  Clearly, we are still quite far from winning the war drugs.\n  This is why I am concerned and, honestly, frustrated by the policies \nwhich are being promoted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy \n(ONDCP) to combat heroin addiction. Under the direction of General \nMcCaffrey, the ONDCP and the Administration have announced their \ndecision to spend $3.7 billion to double the number of heroin addicts \nin methadone maintenance programs, which ONDCP has unilaterally chosen \nas the preferred treatment for heroin addicts.\n  Mr. President, I have serious concerns about this recently announced \npolicy.\n  First, methadone treatment programs simply transfer addiction from \none drug, heroin, to another drug, methadone. Methadone treatment \nmerely transfers dependency. It does nothing to provide addicts with \nthe training and support necessary to function as self-sufficient, \nproductive members of society. Methadone maintenance programs alone \nforce individuals into a life of government-sponsored drug dependency.\n  Second, ONDCP did not consult with Congress about this significant \nand expensive policy decision. The simple fact is that ONDCP has \nneither the statutory nor budget authority to implement this policy \nwithout Congressional approval. And it is not clear that spending \nnearly $4 billion on expanded methadone maintenance programs is a wise \nor effective use of the resources available to combat drug abuse and \naddiction in this country.\n  Mr. President, eradicating heroin use is a difficult issue which must \nbe addressed with careful deliberation, extensive dialogue and a \nthorough examination. Our policies and programs must be designed to \nfree heroin addicts from their addition, not hook them on another \ngovernment-condoned drug.\n  The resolution we are submitting today calls on Congress to focus on \ndeveloping effective policies and program for ending heroin addiction. \nWe should be looking at all alternatives to methadone treatment, \nespecially those that do not involve transferring addiction or \ndependence on substances. We should also include programs to provide \ntraining and support to former addicts to help them become productive \nmembers of our society. And we should be working to develop drug \nstrategies that will further our goal of a drug-free America.\n  Let me take a moment to thank my dear friend, Dan Coats, for his work \nin putting together this resolution. His thoughtful and caring devotion \nto improving the lives of children and the less fortunate in our \nsociety will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. President, I realize that time is short in this Congress, but I \nstrongly believe that eliminating drug abuse and addiction in America \nshould be a high priority for the Administration and Congress. I urge \nmy colleagues to give careful consideration to this issue and join in \nworking toward that goal in the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I join Senator Coats and Senator \nMcCain in submitting a Senate Resolution renouncing the recent proposal \nby the Administration to expand methadone maintenance programs. \nMethadone is a so-called ``treatment'' for heroin addiction. Heroin is \na highly addictive opiate which leads its users down a path of crime \nand self-destruction, and the prescription of methadone is simply a \nmeans to sustain addiction. My colleagues and I do realize the need for \nhelp, but do not believe the answer is exchanging one addiction for \nanother.\n  The Administration has failed to consult Congress of its plan to \nincrease the number of methadone maintenance programs and to loosen \nregulations of licensed methadone dispensers. We frown upon the idea of \npaying for drug addiction. Our Resolution states the need for \nCongressional hearings in order to compare the Administration's \nproposal with alternative drug-free treatment programs.\n  Alternatives such as the Ready, Willing and Able program have been \nextremely successful in helping Americans who are addicted to drugs, \nhomeless, or in many cases, both. This program is based on community. \nIt provides wages earned from community based jobs in exchange for \nroom, board and positive reinforcement in a drug-free environment. I \nbelieve comprehensive treatment programs such as this are a positive \nstep in our war against drugs.\n  America will have achieved nothing in the fight against drugs if we \nkeep\n\n[[Page S12187]]\n\nfunding programs that allow us to look the other way without looking at \nthe facts. We need to hear from those who are methadone users, those \nwho are previous methadone users, and those who administer methadone. \nWe need to look at statistics, look at current funding, and look at \ncurrent problems within the programs. I don't believe we have solved \nanyone's drug addiction if we can still call them an addict. Methadone \nusers are addicts and they face the same withdrawals as those on \nheroin. Let's find solutions to our Nation's drug problems, not follow \nthe Administration's example, which further feeds and funds drug \naddiction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12186-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 296--EXPRESSING THE SENATE REGARDING THE COMPLETION \n                   OF CONSTRUCTION OF A WWII MEMORIAL\n\n  MR. KERREY submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 296\n\n       Whereas World War II is the defining event of the 20th \n     century;\n       Whereas in World War II, over 16,000,000 American men and \n     women served the Nation, of which nearly 300,000 were killed \n     and over 670,000 were wounded;\n       Whereas in Public Law 103-422 (108 Stat. 4356), Congress \n     approved the location of a memorial to this epic event in \n     Area I of the District of Columbia and its environs, as \n     described in the Act entitled ``An Act to provide standards \n     for placement of commemorative works on certain Federal lands \n     in the District of Columbia and its environs, and for other \n     purposes'', approved November 14, 1986 (40 U.S.C. 1001 et \n     seq.); and\n       Whereas Congress has traditionally provided funding for the \n     memorials commemorating President Thomas Jefferson and \n     President Abraham Lincoln, the monument to President George \n     Washington, and the Korean War Veterans Memorial: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n         Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. FUNDING OF A WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, on completion of \n     construction of a World War II Memorial in Area I of the \n     District of Columbia and its environs, as described in that \n     Act, Congress should provide funding for the maintenance, \n     security, and custodial and long-term care of the memorial by \n     the National Park Service.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have a very simple proposition for the \nSenate. Let's close an accidental tax loophole for the heirs of people \nwho leave estates worth more than $17 million and use the savings to \nhelp self-employed Americans--like the thousands of entrepreneurs on \nNebraska's farms and ranches--afford the soaring cost of health care.\n  Today I am submitting legislation to accomplish that purpose.\n  The facts are very simple. Prior to 1997, when we passed the 1997 \nBalanced Budget Agreement, the first $600,000 of an estate was excluded \nfrom taxes. The old law gradually phased out this exclusion once an \nestate reached $17 million. The 1997 Act increases the value of an \nestate not subject to taxes. But a drafting error in the 1997 Balanced \nBudget Agreement failed to include the accompanying phase out of the \nexclusion on estates over $17 million.\n  Clearly this error needs to be fixed. Letting this mistake stand \nuncorrected will cost the American taxpayers nearly $900 million over \nthe next ten years. To give you an idea of how much this provision does \nto benefit the few, consider that in 1995, the Internal Revenue Service \nestimates that just 300 tax returns were filed on estates over $20 \nmillion.\n  Congress had the opportunity to correct this error during \nconsideration of the IRS Reform bill this year. Regrettably, the \nobjections of a few to making this right overcame the support of the \nmany for doing so.\n  Meanwhile, Mr. President, self-employed Americans are struggling to \ncope with the rising cost of health insurance, which they--unlike \nAmericans employed by others--cannot fully deduct from their taxable \nincome. The face of their struggle is most evident on farms and \nranches. In Nebraska, producers are facing plunging commodity prices at \nthe same time they face soaring costs of living, especially for health \ninsurance. Today they can deduct 40 percent of the cost of their \ninsurance. Under current law, they cannot fully deduct that cost until \n2007.\n  So, my proposal is simple. Let's close the loophole that everyone \nadmits was an accident, and use that money to accelerate the full \ndeductibility of health insurance for the self-employed. It's a clear \nchoice between a loophole that nobody wanted to exist and entrepreneurs \nwho--especially those on our farms and ranches--may not exist much \nlonger if we don't get them some help.\n  While I recognize time is short for passing this bill this year, I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and in \npursuing this goal next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12187-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTIONS 297--AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY AND REPRESENTATION OF \n  FORMER AND CURRENT SENATE EMPLOYEES AND REPRESENTATION OF A SENATOR\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitting the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND ILLINOIS WATERWAY \n                   SYSTEM NAVIGATION MODERNIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) exports are necessary to ensure job creation and an \n     improved standard of living for the people of the United \n     States;\n       (2) the ability of producers of goods in the United States \n     to compete in the international marketplace depends on a \n     modern and efficient transportation network;\n       (3) a modern and efficient waterway system is a \n     transportation option necessary to provide United States \n     shippers a safe, reliable, and competitive means to win \n     foreign markets in an increasingly competitive \n     international marketplace;\n       (4) the need to modernize is heightened because the United \n     States is at risk of losing its competitive edge as a result \n     of the priority that foreign competitors are placing on \n     modernizing their own waterway systems;\n       (5) growing export demand projected over the coming decades \n     will force greater demands on the waterway system of the \n     United States and increase the cost to the economy if the \n     system proves inadequate to satisfy growing export \n     opportunities;\n       (6) the locks and dams on the upper Mississippi River and \n     Illinois River waterway system were built in the 1930s and \n     have some of the highest average delays to commercial tows in \n     the country;\n       (7) inland barges carry freight at the lowest unit cost \n     while offering an alternative to truck and rail \n     transportation that is environmentally sound, is energy \n     efficient, is safe, causes little congestion, produces little \n     air or noise pollution, and has minimal social impact; and\n       (8) it should be the policy of the Corps of Engineers to \n     pursue aggressively modernization of the waterway system \n     authorized by Congress to promote the relative competitive \n     position of the United States in the international \n     marketplace.\n       (b) Preconstruction Engineering and Design.--In accordance \n     with the Upper Mississippi River-Illinois Waterway System \n     Navigation Study, the Secretary shall proceed immediately to \n     prepare engineering design, plans, and specifications for \n     extension of locks 20, 21, 22, 24, 25 on the Mississippi \n     River and the LaGrange and Peoria Locks on the Illinois \n     River, to provide lock chambers 110 feet in width and 1,200 \n     feet in length, so that construction can proceed immediately \n     upon completion of studies and authorization of projects by \n     Congress.\n\n     SEC. 139.

Mr. President, I am both throwing down a gauntlet and \nlaying down a marker on this subject of fishing in Glacier Bay.\n  Native Alaskans have used Glacier Bay to obtain fish and other \nfoodstuffs essential to them for many thousands of years, and not long \nafter the United States acquired Alaska, commercial fishing started \nthere also. In all the time since, fishing has caused absolutely no \nharm to the values that make this area one of America's premier \nnational parks.\n  Parts of Glacier Bay were declared as a national monument in 1925, to \npromote the study of flora, fauna and geology of post-glacial terrain. \nGlacier Bay was ideal for this purpose. When visited by Capt. George \nVancouver in the late 18th century it was closed by a geologically \nrecent glacial advance, but by the time John Muir visited in the \n1880's, Native fishermen had resumed their age-old practice of fishing \nhere every summer.\n  In 1939, the national monument was expanded. In 1980, it was expanded \nagain, and most of it was redesignated as a national park.\n  Mr. President, just as the Federal Government spoke with a ``forked \ntongue'' to Native Americans throughout much of our history, so it has \nspoken to the Tlingits and to the other local residents who rely on \nGlacier Bay for their livelihoods and for their sustenance. Throughout \nthe history of government proclamations, local Natives and commercial \nfishermen have been promised that their activities would be respected--\nyet a few years ago, the government decided to ignore its promises and \nbegan a concerted effort to banish both commercial and subsistence \nfishing.\n  It has been aided and abetted by some of the sleaziest tactics I have \never seen--a network of half-truths and outright lies about the \nfisheries, the fishermen, and about our efforts to save them.\n  Mr. President, this is just plain wrong. It is an affront to every \nAmerican who believes the government's promises should be worth \nsomething, and there are still a few of us left, despite everything.\n  I had hopes that reasonable people could work this issue out. Indeed, \nearlier this year I delayed further action on my own efforts to craft \ncompromise legislation in order to allow additional time to the \nfishermen, State of Alaska representatives and others who have been \ntrying to develop a consensus.\n  Unfotunately, these efforts have been stymied by the refusal of the \nnational environmental organizations to agree to fair treatment of \nthese historical users. For that reason, I supported putting a one-year \nregulatory moratorium into the Interior appropriation, so as to allow \nadditional time to work on this issue at the local level.\n  Regrettably, the Department of the Interior and its allies are not \nwilling to continue working toward a consensus. Instead, they refused \nto accept the moratorium language, and insisted on going forward with \nregulations to put the fishermen out of business.\n\n[[Page S12209]]\n\n  There is a real inconsistency here; in the same bays and inlets where \nthey insist fishing is an unacceptable commercial activity, they are \nonly too happy to allow tour vessels with thousands of visitors.\n  Soon, perhaps within hours, perhaps within a few days, we will pass \nan omnibus appropriation measure that makes one of Washington's insider \n``deals'' on this issue. Under the deal, a minimum payment will be made \nto get some fishermen to disappear altogether, and a handful of others \nwill be told that they will be allowed to fish, but that their current \nright to sell or bequeath their fishing permits to their children has \njust evaporated forever.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, what is happening here is just plain wrong.\n  For that reason, I am today offering an amendment to my earlier bill. \nI will introduce another such a bill in January of next year, and In \nintend to introduce such a bill every January hereafter until justice \nis done. I will also welcome the assistance of the State of Alaska in \nasserting its right of jurisdiction over the management of these \nfisheries.\n  Come what may, I will not stand by and allow these existing small \nfishing operators to be lost in Glacier Bay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12208-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GAYLORD NELSON APOSTLE ISLANDS STEWARDSHIP ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      FEINGOLD AMENDMENT NO. 3808\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill (S. 1966) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to study \nwhether the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore should be protected as a \nwilderness area; as follows:\n\n       On page 4, after line 24, insert the following:\n       (g) Transfer of Appropriated Funds.--\n       (1) In general.--All amounts made available to the Denali \n     Commission for fiscal year 1999 shall be transferred to the \n     Secretary of the Interior for use in carrying out subsections \n     (c) and (d).\n       (2) Unexpended balance.--Any balance of amounts transferred \n     under paragraph (1) that remain unexpended at the end of \n     fiscal year 1999 shall be returned to the general fund of the \n     Treasury of the United States.\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am submitting an \namendment to S. 1966, Gaylord Nelson Apostle Islands Stewardship Act of \n1988, a bill that I introduced on April 22, 1988. In keeping with my \nbelief that progress toward a balanced budget should be maintained, I \nam proposing that a section be added to the bill which offsets the $4.1 \nmillion in authorized spending for the Apostle Islands contained in my \noriginal bill, with the $20 million in funds appropriated in FY 99 to \nthe Denali Commission. The Secretary of the Interior would be required \nto transfer $15.9 million above the money that it needs to take actions \nat the Apostle Islands back to the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, the Denali Commission is not currently authorized. \nAuthorization for this new commission was included in the Senate \nversion of the FY 99 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, but was \nremoved in conference. Nevertheless, the appropriators decided to set \naside $20 million in funds pending the authorization of the Commission. \nWhatever the merits of this proposed commission may be, Mr. President, \nI am concerned that we have set aside such a large amount of money when \nwe have acute appropriations needs at places like the Apostle Islands \nNational Lakeshore, for an unauthorized program.\n  I am further concerned, Mr. President, about creating a new Federal \ncommission to address economic development and other State specific \nissues when Congress is seeking to back away from such commitments. For \nexample, in the same bill that provides funds for the Denali \nCommission, the Congress terminates appropriated funds for the \nTennessee Valley Authority, known as TVA, an action I have had \nlegislation to accomplish since I became a Member of the Senate. I \napplaud congress for acting to end appropriated funds for TVA, but I \nfear we may take a step backward if we create a new entity that we now \nneed to fund.\n  I look forward to Senate Energy Committee consideration of the \nGaylord Nelson Apostle Islands Stewardship Act of 1988, and its \neventual passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12209-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12209-S12210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SONNY BONO MEMORIAL SALTON SEA RECLAMATION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         KYL AMENDMENT NO. 3809\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KYL submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill (H.R. 3267) to direct the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Bureau of Reclamation, to conduct a feasibility study and \nconstruct a project to reclaim the Salton Sea; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring my \ncolleagues' attention to a very exciting expedition. Last month, Mr. \nMichael ``Mick'' Bird completed the second leg of an unprecedented \n24,000 mile voyage around the world. On August 19, 1997, Mick Bird \nstarted rowing out to sea from Fort Bragg, California in his vessel \nReach. After 66 days of rowing, on October 23, 1997, Mick arrived in \nHilo Bay on the Big Island of Hawaii.\n  After putting the Reach in drydock in Hawaii, Mick returned to his \nhome base in California to raise support and prepare for the next leg \nof his historic journey. Mick returned to Hawaii this Summer and put to \nsea in Reach on July 18, 1998 rowing for the Gilbert Islands, about \n2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii and the halfway point between Hawaii \nand Australia. On September 22, 1998, 66 days and more than 2,200 miles \nfrom Hawaii, Mick made land fall on Majuro in the Marshall Islands, a \nbit north of his intended destination in the Gilberts. Mick is now \nhappily home in California with his family preparing for his next leg \nto the north central coast of Australia; another 2,500 mile row.\n  Mick Bird, a former U.S. Air Force officer, is of Pacific Island \ndescent and has family ties to the State of Hawaii. His voyage is more \nformally known as Trans-Oceanic, which is the name of the non-profit \norganization sponsoring this attempt at the world's first solo \ncircumnavigation of the globe by a rowing vessel. The goals of this \nexpedition are, among others, to explore the limits of the human \nspirit, to raise awareness about ocean ecosystems, to be an example of \nindividual achievement as well as teamwork, and to generate support for \nThe National Tuberous Sclerosis Association. The expedition is also \nusing its World Wide Web sites (www.naau.com and www.goals.com/\ntransrow) to create a direct link between Mick's vessel Reach and \neducators and students to share experiences and practical applications \nof math, science and geography.\n  I would like to congratulate Mr. Bird on his very impressive \naccomplishments to this point, and to express my good wishes for the \nsafety and success of the rest of this voyage around the world. I also \nwish to commend him and Trans-Oceanic for enhancing public awareness \nand education. I encourage my colleagues to have a look at Trans-\nOceanic's web sites and share them with educators at home to follow \nalong with this amazing journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12212-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12212-S12214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JUDGE ROBERT I.H. HAMMERMAN\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge the unique \nand extraordinary contributions made to Baltimore and the State of \nMaryland by Judge Robert I.H. Hammerman who, this past summer, retired \nafter thirty-seven years of distinguished service to our citizens and \nlegal system. During his career on the bench, Judge Hammerman was a \nleader in court reform and the efforts to establish an effective yet \ncaring system of juvenile criminal justice. These efforts were directed \nnot only at changing the system, but also at exerting every effort \npossible to give young men in need the opportunity for academic and \nathletic development.\n  His remarkable commitment to the youth of Baltimore is most \nexemplified by the Lancers Boys Club which he founded 50 years ago and \nwhich greatly affected the lives of approximately 3,000 young men of \nall different backgrounds and races. Through his remarkable commitment, \nJudge Hammerman influenced several generations of young men whose \nleadership has affected every facet of State and national life. \n``Bobby'' Hammerman, as he is known by his fellow Baltimoreans, served \nhis community with exceptional dedication as a jurist but also, even \nmore importantly, as a good and caring citizen. I want to take this \noccasion to express my own appreciation for his life of service and ask \nto have printed in the Record several articles from the Baltimore Sun \nand the Baltimore Jewish Times which chronicle his accomplishments.\n  The articles follow:\n\n[[Page S12213]]\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, July 16, 1998]\n\n             With Closing Argument, Judge Ends 37-Year Term\n\n\n     Md.'s Hammerman questions being forced to put down gavel at 70\n\n                           By Dennis O'Brien)\n\n       The longest-serving trial judge in Maryland history hangs \n     up his robes today--and he is not happy about it.\n       ``I'm not retiring. They're retiring me,'' says Baltimore \n     Circuit Chief Judge Robert I.H. Hammerman.\n       After 37 years of deciding other people's fates and \n     distputes, Hammerman says this choice is being made for him: \n     He will turn 70 tomorrow, the mandatory retirement age for \n     judges under Maryland law.\n       He sees little sense to being forced out because of his \n     age, especially since he is fit enough to walk up the five \n     fights of stairs to his countroom two or three times each \n     day, he still needs only four hours of sleep each night, can \n     beat 20-year-old opponents at tennis and plays an hours of \n     squash five times a week.\n       He loves the work routine that begins at 5:30 a.m. and \n     involves listening to hours of arcane legal arguments.\n       ``I feel like every day is a new day, and every day is \n     different. I've never felt tired, or bored at this job,'' he \n     says.\n       Hammerman has asked Court of Appeals Chief Judge Robert \n     Mack Bell to allow him to serve in retirement as much as \n     possible as a part-time judge, a position that would mean \n     ``specially assigning'' him to any courthouse in Maryland \n     where judges are short-handed.\n       Bell says he intends to take Hammerman up on his offer. ``I \n     think he's been a great judge,'' said Bell, who served with \n     Hammerman on the Baltimore Circuit Court in the 1980s before \n     Bell was appointed the state's top judge.\n       It upsets Hammerman that Maryland law will allow him to \n     serve as a part-time judge for only one-third of any calendar \n     year.\n       Hammerman, who is single, gives the impression of being \n     willing to go just about anywhere to hear a case.\n       ``I've always said that when my time is up in this world, I \n     want it to be one of three courts: a court of law, a tennis \n     court or a squash court,'' Hammerman said.\n\n\n                           From the beginning\n\n       Robert Israel Harold Hammerman was born in Baltimore, the \n     son of Herman Hammerman, a lawyer who did mostly real estate \n     work for his older brother, S.L. Hammerman, a prominent \n     Baltimore developer.\n       A graduate of City College, the Johns Hopkins University \n     and Harvard Law School, Hammerman was appointed in 1961 by \n     Gov. J. Millard Tawes to be a judge on the old Baltimore \n     Municipal Court to decide traffic cases, neighborhood \n     disputes and misdemeanor offenses. He was appointed six years \n     later to the Supreme Bench of Baltimore, which became the \n     Baltimore Circuit Court in 1983.\n       He spent his first eight years on the Supreme Bench \n     presiding over the city's Juvenile Court and is credited with \n     bringing the court into compliance with a landmark 1967 \n     Supreme Court case, In Re Gault, that guaranteed juvenile \n     offenders the same right to an attorney as adults.\n\n\n                            In the spotlight\n\n       Over the years, Hammerman has presided over some of the \n     city's most publicized trials, including the 1995 jury trial \n     for John Joseph Merzbacher, then 53, a former Catholic \n     Community Middle School teacher accused of sexually abusing \n     14 students and other teen-agers between 1972 and 1979.\n       Hammerman sentenced the former teacher to four life terms \n     for raping one of the students.\n       In recent years, Hammerman said, the courts have been \n     flooded with criminal cases--particularly drug cases. When he \n     was appointed to the Supreme Bench there were 15 judges, he \n     said. These days there are twice that many judges--and the \n     courts are still swamped, he said.\n       ``The drug culture just permeates everything we do here,'' \n     he said.\n\n\n                          Be on time, or else\n\n       In court, Hammerman developed a reputation as a strict, \n     uncompromising no-nonsense judge, who appeared each morning \n     on the bench at exactly 9 a.m. and expected lawyers to be \n     just as punctual.\n       ``He's very big on punctuality,'' said David Moore, a \n     former law clerk who is now a Baltimore assistant state's \n     attorney.\n       Many lawyers also say that Hammerman is prone to lose his \n     temper, is often quick to make up his mind on a case and will \n     dress down lawyers who either try to argue him out of his \n     position or fail to show proper respect.\n       ``He's never held me in contempt, but he's chewed me out.'' \n     said Curt Anderson, a criminal defense lawyer, former state \n     delegate and a longtime friend. ``It reminded me of being 17 \n     again and being chewed out--it was that bad.''\n       Lewis A. Noonberg, another lawyer and longtime friend, \n     attributes Hammerman's legendary short fuse to his work ethic \n     and his competitive edge.\n       ``He loves sports, and he loves to beat the pants off \n     people half his age. He doesn't get any thrill out of beating \n     me `cause I'm only 10 years younger than him,'' said \n     Noonberg, 60.\n\n\n                         Reputation for honesty\n\n       Hammerman admits to being competitive and to insisting on \n     civility in his courtroom.\n       But more than anything, he says, he values his reputation \n     for honesty. So he says it offended him when he was charged \n     with leaving the scene of an accident after a fender-bender \n     outside the Pikesville library on Reisterstown Road on April \n     5, 1997.\n       The driver of the car who reported the accident, Ronnie N. \n     Albom, said publicly after Hammerman was cleared of the \n     charge on Sept. 22, 1997, that his position as a judge helped \n     him win the acquittal in Baltimore County District Court, a \n     charge that Hammerman vehemently denies.\n       Hammerman said that there was no accident and no damages, \n     that he did not know the judge who acquitted him and that he \n     turned down an offer to have the case dismissed if he would \n     pay the $77 in damages to Albom.\n       ``For one thing, there was no accident. Second, I didn't \n     leave the scene; that's how they got the information that \n     they later used to file these false charges,'' Hammerman \n     said.\n\n\n                         Legacy of the Lancers\n\n       Although as a judge he has often been in the public eye, \n     Hammerman may be best known throughout the city for his work \n     as adviser to the Lancers Boys Club, a high-profile civic \n     organization for teen-age boys established by three childhood \n     friends in 1946. The club, which boasts Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke \n     and numerous other prominent people as members, has been the \n     judge's pet project ever since.\n       Hammerman has used the club to steer 3,000 boys to civic \n     activism through activities such as tutoring in schools, \n     working in soup kitchens and participating in community \n     cleanup drives. The club encourages members to study in \n     school, play sports and strive for success and rewards them \n     with overseas trips, dinners and lectures that have included \n     celebrity guest speakers.\n       In retirement, Hammerman says, he probably will spend more \n     time on club activities, lining up speakers, corresponding \n     with members and making arrangements for trips, dinners and \n     other events.\n       Anderson, who joined the Lancers when he and Schmoke were \n     students at City College, praises Hammerman for his club \n     work.\n       ``You've got to hand it to him,'' Anderson said. ``He's \n     probably touched thousands of lives.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Baltimore Jewish Times, July 10, 1998]\n\n  A Good Way To Leave--Baltimore's Chief Judge Robert I.H. Hammerman \n            Might Be Retiring, But He'll Never Stop Working\n\n                          (By Christine Stutz)\n\n       One can only imagine how crestfallen Chief Judge Robert \n     I.H. Hammerman will feel when his alarm goes off at 3:52 a.m. \n     on July 17, and he remembers he's not due in court.\n       For July 17 is his 70th birthday, which means it's also the \n     first day of his retirement, a status he finds about as \n     appealing as a dip in a frozen lake.\n       ``I'm not retiring,'' Judge Hammerman says, indignantly. \n     ``They're retiring me.''\n       With 37 years of service to the city of Baltimore, Judge \n     Hammerman has the longest tenure of any judge in the Maryland \n     court system. For a man who lives by a strict work ethic and \n     personifies the core values associated with that ethic, every \n     day off the bench will carry a certain emptiness.\n       That's why he's offering to hear cases as a retired \n     ``recall judge'' in whatever local jurisdiction needs him, 12 \n     months a year--even though by law he can only be paid for \n     four months of service.\n       ``I don't know anyone who has tried, and continues to try, \n     harder than he does simply to be a good judge,'' says \n     Baltimore Circuit Court Judge David Ross, a longtime \n     colleague and friend of Judge Hammerman's who retired \n     voluntarily two years ago.\n       ``He gives a lot and he expects a lot,'' says David L. \n     Palmer, a former Baltimore assistant state's attorney who now \n     works in the law offices of Peter Angelos. ``He takes a lot \n     of pride in the courtroom.''\n       At the luncheons and dinners planned in his honor in the \n     coming weeks, the vigorous, whitehaired jurist will be lauded \n     as a man of intellect, industry and integrity. No doubt he \n     also will be teased about his tennis game, his fondness for \n     iced tea and Rold Gold pretzels, and his fastidious nature.\n       On the bench, he is Chief Judge Robert I.H. Hammerman, a \n     stickler for detail and a force to be reckoned with. The \n     first week on the job, every trial lawyer in town learns two \n     cardinal rules about the Hammerman court: be on time and be \n     prepared. Those who have incurred his wrath are probably \n     still smarting from it.\n       In his private life, though, he is Bob Hammerman, a sports \n     enthusiast who attends Smashing Pumpkins concerts and shares \n     his cluttered den with a giant Mickey Mouse doll. At 11:25 \n     every evening, the Harvard Law School graduate opens a pint \n     of Baskin Robbins ice cream and sits down to watch the sports \n     segment on the Channel 2 evening news. About halfway through \n     ``Nightline,'' he reaches the bottom of the container and \n     calls it a night.\n       At precisely 3:52 a.m., his alarm goes off, and he begins \n     another day. He's at the courthouse by 5:30, when even the \n     pigeons are still sleeping.\n       A lifelong member of Reform Har Sinai Congregation in Upper \n     Park Heights, Judge Hammerman blows the shofar, or ram's \n     horn, every Rosh Hashanah. For the past 25 years\n\n[[Page S12214]]\n\n     he also has blown the shofar during Ash Wednesday services at \n     Immaculate Heart of Mary, a Catholic church in Towson.\n       Although he says he never set out to be a role model, Judge \n     Hammerman takes pride in exemplifying certain character \n     traits he holds dear:punctuality, diligence, honesty, \n     respectfulness and generosity. As founder of the Lancers Boys \n     Club in 1946, he has influenced more than 3,000 young men to \n     strive for excellence.\n       A doting father figure to many current and former Lancers, \n     he cheers them on at ballgames, follows their academic \n     progress, and is always available for late-night phone calls \n     when advice or encouragement is needed.\n       With his guidance, countless Lancers have attended \n     prestigious colleges and professional schools and become \n     outstanding business and community leaders. Baltimore \n     Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke, state Del. Samuel I. ``Sandy'' \n     Rosenberg and former Alex. Brown chairman Alvin ``Buzzy'' \n     Krongard are Lancers alumni.\n       ``I believe in discipline everywhere. Discipline is \n     something we haven't enough of in our society,'' says the \n     judge, who graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Johns Hopkins \n     University in 1950.\n       ``It isn't enough to do something that will simply pass \n     muster, that is adequate,'' he tells his proteges. ``You must \n     do it to the very best of your ability.''\n       In his first assignment, to the juvenile court, he took \n     great pains to find something a young offender was interested \n     in and ``use that as a building block,'' he says. One boy, \n     who had brought a loaded gun to school, loved football, but \n     there were no organized teams in his Southwest Baltimore \n     neighborhood.\n       The judge arranged for him to play with the Randallstown \n     Rams, and made attending practices a condition of his \n     probation. The youth became a star of the team, and then--\n     with the judge's help--attended Baltimore Polytechnic \n     Institute and went on to college.\n\n\n                          demanding, but fair\n\n       It's difficult to imagine a profession for which Judge \n     Hammerman is better suited. As a judge, he can use his \n     brilliant mind to serve mankind, but in a secure, controlled \n     environment where he's very much in charge.\n       ``It has allowed me to use the habits I believe in, in \n     constructive ways,'' he says.\n       David Rosenberg, a litigation partner with the Washington, \n     D.C., law firm of Wright, Robinson, Osthimer & Tatum, clerked \n     for Judge Hammerman in 1985-86.\n       ``He really influenced me and had a profound effect on my \n     career,'' says Mr. Rosenberg. ``I was always amazed. He never \n     took the bench without looking at the file completely. And I \n     was always struck by the fact that he let the lawyers have \n     their say.''\n       Even though the judge has been very demanding of his law \n     clerks, they praise him for teaching them what it takes to be \n     a successful lawyer.\n       ``His demands were not so much that Robert I.H. Hammerman \n     was an important person, but the people who went into that \n     courtroom were important people,'' says state Del. Robert L. \n     Frank of Reisterstown, who clerked for the judge in 1984-85. \n     ``In a society of me-first people, he has given far more than \n     he'll ever get.''\n       Judge Hammerman, who never married, lives in the same Park \n     Heights apartment he shared with his mother, the late Belle \n     Greenblatt Hammerman. Every item in the home has a history \n     he's eager to share, and which he recalls in great detail.\n       He opens the glass doors of a secretary to reveal the \n     complete works of Tolstoy, Hugo, Dickens and Hawthorne--\n     classics he says his father, whose family could not afford to \n     send him to college, devoured each night before retiring. \n     Filed among the yellowed pages of those books are all of \n     Judge Hammerman's school report cards.\n       In the same way that he recalls his happy childhood, Judge \n     Hammerman looks back with pride on a stellar career as one of \n     the city's most prominent public figures.\n       ``I feel I have been very privileged, very fortunate, very \n     lucky to have had this job,'' he says. ``I have no regrets. \n     None.\n       ``And it's a good way to leave.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12212-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REAUTHORIZATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN THE WATER \n                   RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last night, the Senate passed the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1998. I wanted to voice my support \nfor this bill. In particular, I appreciate the section that \nreauthorizes the Army Corps' Upper Mississippi River Environmental \nManagement Program, known as EMP. I wish to commend the hard work of \nthe Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Chafee) and the Senator from Montana \n(Mr. Baucus) and their staff members, Dan Delich and Jo Ellen Darcy, in \norder to complete a WRDA bill prior to the adjournment of the 105th \nCongress. I appreciate the time and attention they have paid to \nensuring that EMP is reauthorized in this bill.\n  I also want to extend my sincere thanks to the Senior Senator from \nMissouri (Mr. Bond), who shepherded the EMP provisions through the \nCommittee. I have enjoyed working with him on the reauthorization of \nthis important program. He and his staff have worked along with me and \nmy staff to make sure this section was well crafted and met the needs \nof the Upper Mississippi states and the Mississippi River environment. \nThe manager's amendment makes the necessary changes to the Committee \nlanguage to meet the needs of all interested parties.\n  From its inception, the EMP has been a program that enjoys bipartisan \nsupport. Initially conceived and sponsored in the House by my former \ncolleague from Wisconsin (Mr. Gunderson) and the Congressman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Oberstar), the EMP was originally authorized in the \nWater Resources Act of 1986. At the same time, Congress designated the \nUpper Mississippi River ``a nationally significant ecosystem and a \nnationally significant commercial navigation system.''\n  Since its inception, the EMP has been a cooperative effort between \nthe Corps, the Upper Mississippi states, conservationists, and \ncommercial shipping and other economic interests. The program's purpose \nis to regain and protect significant areas of diverse, productive fish \nand wildlife habitat, to establish long-term resource monitoring which \ngauges dynamic changes and impacts of future developments, and to \nimprove and assess recreational uses so vital in our nation's \nmidsection. The EMP involves extensive federal-state planning, \ncoordination, and cost-sharing.\n  I am pleased that this legislation will prevent termination of this \nprogram in 2001, as provided in the earlier authorizing legislation. \nThis bill will ensure that necessary funding, and approved habitat \nrehabilitation and enhancement projects will continue. I also \nrecognize, with a total ten year authorization of $350 million, that it \nis among the largest program authorizations contained in the bill.\n  I am very pleased that the collegial spirit surrounding work on EMP \nis also well-rooted on the House side. My colleague in the Wisconsin \ndelegation (Representative Kind) is working with Representative \nOberstar in steadfastly pursuing this reauthorization this year.\n  The manager's amendment reauthorizes EMP through 2009 at an increased \ntotal funding level of $33.5 million per year. It also makes some \nimportant changes to the program. It creates an independent technical \nadvisory committee to review habitat projects and monitoring plans. It \nauthorizes the Corps to complete a habitat and natural resource needs \nassessment of the Upper Mississippi Basin within three years of WRDA \nenactment. And, it provides Congress with another comprehensive \nassessment of the program, its projects and effectiveness, by 2005.\n  I believe these to be positive changes to the program. I look forward \nto the Conference on this matter, and I urge my colleagues in the other \nbody to act quickly on this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12214-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12214-S12215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ANNIVERSARY OF IMPORTANT MILESTONES TOWARD ENDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS \n                                TESTING\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I want to recognize the \nanniversaries of some important milestones along the road to ending \nnuclear weapons testing. This month marks some major steps we have \ntaken toward an international ban on nuclear weapons tests, a \ncornerstone of our Nation's nuclear weapons non-proliferation policy. \nThese anniversaries also remind us how much more remains to be done if \nwe are to honor the vision of those who have worked to reduce the \nthreat of nuclear war.\n  On October 11, 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty entered into force \nafter being ratified by the Senate in an overwhelming, bipartisan vote \nof 80-14 just a few weeks earlier. This treaty paved the way for future \nnuclear weapons testing agreements by prohibiting tests in the \natmosphere, in outer space, and underwater. This treaty was signed by \n108 countries.\n  Our Nation's agreement to the Limited Test Ban Treaty marked the end \nof our Nation's aboveground testing of nuclear weapons, including those \nat the U.S. test site in Nevada. We now\n\n[[Page S12215]]\n\nknow, all too well, the terrible impact of exploding nuclear weapons \nover the Nevada desert. Among other consequences, these tests in the \n1950's exposed millions of Americans to large amounts of radioactive \nIodine-131, which accumulates in the thyroid gland and has been linked \nto thyroid cancer. ``Hot Spots,'' where the Iodine-131 fallout was the \ngreatest, were identified by a National Cancer Institute report as \nreceiving 5-16 rads of Iodine-131. The ``Hot Spots'' included many \nareas far away from Nevada, including New York, Massachusetts and Iowa. \nOutside reviewers have shown that the 5-16 rad level is only an \naverage, with many people having received much higher exposure levels, \nespecially those who were children at the time.\n  To put that in perspective, federal standards for nuclear power \nplants require that protective action be taken for 15 rads. To further \nunderstand the enormity of the potential exposure, consider this: 150 \nmillion curies of Iodine-131 were released by the above ground nuclear \nweapons testing in the United States, about three times more than from \nthe Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in the former Soviet Union.\n  It is all too clear that outlawing above-ground tests were in the \ninterest of our Nation. I strongly believe that banning all nuclear \ntests is also in our interests.\n  October also marked some key steps the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nor CTBT. On October 2, 1992, President Bush signed into law the U.S. \nmoratorium on all nuclear tests. The moratorium was internationalized \nwhen, just a few year later, on September 24, 1996, a second step was \ntaken--the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or CTBT, was opened for \nsignature. The United States was the first to sign this landmark \ntreaty.\n  Mr. President, a little more than a year ago, President Clinton took \na third important step in abolishing nuclear weapons tests by \ntransmitting the CTBT to the United States Senate for ratification. \nUnfortunately, the Senate has yet to take the additional step of \nratifying the CTBT. I am hopeful that we in the Senate will debate and \nvote on ratification of the Treaty, and continue the momentum toward \nthe important goal of a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons testing.\n  Many believed we had conquered the dangerous specter of nuclear war \nafter the Cold War came to an end and many former Soviet states became \nour allies. Unfortunately, recent developments in South Asia remind us \nthat we need to be vigilant in our cooperative international efforts to \nreduce the dangers of nuclear weapons.\n  It is especially important that the Senate act before the September \n1999 deadline for ratification by 44 countries. If the United States \nfails to ratify the CTBT, then we will not have a voice in the special \ninternational conference which will negotiate how to accelerate the \ntreaty into force. Yet, as a signatory, we will still be bound by its \nprovisions.\n  The CTBT is a major milestone in the effort to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. It would establish a permanent ban on \nall nuclear explosions in all environments for any purpose. Its ``zero-\nyield'' prohibition on nuclear tests would help to halt the development \nand deployment of new nuclear weapons. The Treaty would also establish \na far-reaching verification regime that includes a global network of \nsophisticated seismic, hydro-acoustic and radionuclide monitoring \nstations, as well as on-site inspection of test sites to deter and \ndetect violations.\n  It is vital to our national security for the nuclear arms race to \ncome to an end, and the American people recognize this. In a recent \npoll commissioned by the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear dangers, nearly 50 \npercent of voters supported ``eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide'' \nand an additional third support ``reducing the number of nuclear \nweapons worldwide''. In addition, a 1997 poll by the Mellman Group for \nthe Henry J. Stimson Center found that 69 percent of voters believe the \ngoal of the United States should be to reduce or eliminate nuclear \nweapons.\n  It is heartening to know that the American people understand the \nrisks of a world with nuclear weapons. It is now time for policymakers \nto recognize this as well. There is no better way to honor the hard \nwork and dedication of those who developed the LTBT and the CTBT than \nfor the U.S. Senate to immediately ratify the CTBT. Our Nation's role \nas the world's only remaining superpower demands no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12214-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AWARD OF EXCELLENCE FOR DR. LINDA ERWIN\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Linda \nErwin of Portland, Oregon, for her career as both a gifted medical \nprofessional and as a tireless and dedicated educator. As one of the \nfirst healthcare professionals in the Pacific Northwest to recognize \nthat gun violence is a public health issue, Dr. Erwin has just been \nawarded the National Crime Prevention Council's Ameritech Award of \nExcellence in Crime Prevention. She is one of only seven people \nthroughout the Nation to receive this honor.\n  Dr. Erwin is currently the Assistant Director of Trauma Services at \nLegacy Emanuel Hospital, and it was through her experiences as a trauma \nsurgeon that she first became aware of the need for increased education \nabout violence--especially gun violence. Dr. Erwin has taken advantage \nof her position, education, and talents to reach beyond the trauma room \nto educate young people throughout the Pacific Northwest.\n  While working in England for two years, Dr. Erwin treated a total of \ntwo patients for gunshot wounds. Upon returning to Portland, she was \nstruck by the high numbers of gunshot wound patients being treated each \nyear at Emanuel Hospital. After speaking with victims and their \nfamilies and friends, she realized that most young people did not \nrecognize or understand the consequences of their risky behavior. Since \nthen, Dr. Erwin has worked as a leading advocate for gun violence \nprevention, intervention and education.\n  One of the keys to Dr. Erwin's success has been her ability to create \npartnerships. Many of the programs that she has initiated bring \ntogether and combine the efforts of the medical, legal, law \nenforcement, and education communities as well as non-profit \norganizations and committed volunteers.\n  Dr. Erwin has successfully spread her message throughout the Portland \ncommunity with such programs as ``Save Our Youth,'' ``Safe Schools Safe \nLives,'' ``Firearms as a Public Health Crisis'' and ``American Epidemic \nPrograms.'' She has also lectured throughout the Pacific Northwest, \ntaking her educational presentations to peer and youth groups \nthroughout the states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.\n  Dr. Linda Erwin is an outstanding example of a professional who has \ngiven her time, resources, and knowledge to the community for the \nbetterment of all. For these reasons, Dr. Erwin has received \nAmeritech's Award of Excellence in Crime Prevention. I would like to \nthank her on behalf of all those whose lives she lives she has touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12215-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12215-S12216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL FIRE PREVENTION WEEK\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week the nation joins in \nmarking National Fire Prevention Week, a time set aside not only to \nremember those who were injured and those who tragically lost their \nlives due to fire, but also to acknowledge the heroic efforts of those \nmen and women who work so hard to prevent and protect us against such \ntragedies.\n  Every year, more than 5,000 Americans die in fires and another 25,000 \nsustain fire-related injuries. The majority of these fires, around 80%, \noccur in the home. Fortunately, many of these deaths and injuries can \nbe prevented by simply planning ahead.\n  The most important function of National Fire Prevention Week is that \nof raising awareness about the dangers of fire and the relatively \nsimple steps we can take to prevent fire-related tragedies.\n  The theme of this year's National Fire Prevention Week, ``Fire \nDrills: The Great Escape,'' serves to encourage the public to practice \nand plan a home escape plan. This involves a number of steps and I want \nto touch on them briefly. According to officials at the United States \nFire Administration (USFA), the first step in developing a home escape \nplan is the installation of smoke alarms on every floor. It is \nestimated that working smoke alarms can\n\n[[Page S12216]]\n\nactually double your chances of survival in the event of fire.\n  Smoke alarms, though, are not the only element of a home escape plan. \nIt is vital that every individual in a household knows and practices at \nleast two escape routes from every room in that home. If confronted by \na fire, one should first escape the burning house and then meet at a \npreviously designated family meeting place outside of the home. Then, \nthe fire department should be notified. Finally, by no means should \nanyone attempt to re-enter a burning home.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the theme of this year's \nNational Fire Protection Week and to encourage the development of as \nmany home escape plans as possible. The fact is that no one is immune \nto the dangers of fire, but if they develop a plan similar to the \nUSFA's their chances of survival are significantly increased.\n  Today, on the anniversary of one of our nation's worst fires, the \nGreat Chicago Fire of 1871, I want to commend the National Fire \nProtection Association for sponsoring National Fire Protection Week and \nto urge my colleagues and all citizens to pay careful attention to the \ntheme and message of this year's National Fire Protection Week, so that \nwe may continue to reduce such preventable losses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12215-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER WARDREP\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJennifer Wardrep, one of my finest employees who has worked for me, in \none capacity or another, for five years. Jennifer came to work for my \npress office when I was the Secretary of State of Georgia. She had \nrecently graduated from East Carolina University where she studied \njournalism and political science. Jennifer had a successful career in \ncollege, working for the student newspaper and rising to become its \neditor.\n  In the Secretary of State's office, Jennifer quickly won my respect \nand that of her coworkers for her hard work and writing skills. She \nspent many long nights working in the Georgia Capitol to make it \npossible for the people of Georgia to receive the news of State \nelections, the new Motor Voter laws and all of the important work \nhandled by that office. Her dedication to me, and that office, is \nsomething for which I am deeply in her debt.\n  In December of 1995, Jennifer left the safety of her ``good \ngovernment job'' for the exciting but temporary life of a political \ncampaign. Once again, Jennifer came to work for me, on my long-shot \nattempt to become a United States Senator. If there ever was a time \nwhen I needed a good press person, it was then. Jennifer was a huge \npart of a successful media campaign that let the voters of Georgia \ndecide for themselves who was best suited to represent them in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I remember one time in particular when we were traveling through \nSouth Georgia talking to several newspapers and many more voters. It \nwas late in the campaign and we were all tired and ready for the \nelection. Jennifer kept me on message as much as humanly possible and \nrewarded me with candy. This creative thinking is typical of Jennifer. \nAs she and I will both affirm, it sometimes takes innovative approaches \nto confine me to one message.\n  I went to bed on election night not knowing for certain if I had won \nthe race. Early the next morning, my phone rang and woke me up. It was \nJennifer and she said ``Good morning, Senator.'' The people of Georgia \nhad heard our message of hope and opportunity, several news \norganizations wanted to interview me and this was my wake-up call. \nJennifer was the first person to call me ``Senator.'' I will never \nforget that moment and I want to thank her very much for that.\n  After the election, I asked Jennifer to come to Washington with me \nwhere she became my Press Secretary. The tenacious media in Washington \nwas no match for her. Although the southern hospitality of Atlanta was \nnothing like the rough and tumble of Washington, Jennifer's experience \npaid off. Jennifer quickly established good relationships with the \nmedia and helped me share with the people of Georgia the work we were \ndoing on campaign finance reform, Georgia's defense operations and \nmany, many more things.\n  Although I have said it many times, I truly believe that I have the \nbest staff on Capitol Hill. And I truly believe I have the best Press \nSecretary on Capitol Hill as well. Jennifer has decided to move on to \nother things and I wish her the best of luck at whatever she does, \nalthough I doubt she will need it. Jennifer has served the people of \nGeorgia well and served me extraordinarily well. Whether it was setting \nup press conferences, sending out news releases, writing PSA's, or \nrecording Internet messages, Jennifer Wardrep is an irreplaceable part \nof my staff and will always be my ``Tiger'' in the press \noffice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12216-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12216-S12217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET SURPLUS\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, September 30 marked the end of fiscal \nyear 1998, and, for the first time since 1969, the news is written in \nblack ink, not red. Although the final numbers will not be available \nfor a few more weeks, it appears that the federal government will end \nthe year with a unified budget surplus of about $70 billion.\n  Mr. President, this is truly a dramatic turnaround. After all, it was \nonly three years ago that President Clinton submitted a budget plotting \n$200 billion deficits well into the next century. I recall that \nskeptics back then often derided a balanced budget as a risky idea, \nsomething that could even threaten Social Security. Now, however, the \nskeptics seem to concede what many of us have been saying all along--\nthat a balanced budget is good for America and good for Social \nSecurity.\n  What does a balanced budget mean for hard-working Americans? For one \nthing, it means lower interest rates. The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate \nmortgage might be as high as 9.5 percent, instead of the current \naverage of about 6.6 percent, had Washington continued to rack up \ndeficits as large as those experienced in the early 1990s.\n  The savings from lower interest rates can be substantial. Just a one \npoint drop on a $100,000 mortgage amounts to monthly savings of $67, or \nmore than $24,000 over the 30-year term of a mortgage. We are talking \nhere, not about just a one point drop, but rates that are two to three \npoints lower than just a few years ago.\n  Lower interest rates on student loans make a college education more \naffordable for young people, and lower rates on car loans mean that \nhard-working men and women all around the country can stretch their \nbudgets a little farther. A balanced budget literally means money in \npeople's pockets.\n  The first thing we should do at the beginning of this new fiscal year \nis commit that we will maintain a balanced federal budget for the \nAmerican people. We can certainly debate what to do with emerging \nbudget surpluses, but there should be no longer be any debate that our \nnational policy ought to be to keep the budget in balance.\n  Mr. President, now that the budget is finally in balance, we have the \nunique opportunity to consider other issues without the cloud of big \ndeficits hanging overhead. For example, we ought to consider whether \ntax rates are at their optimal level, or whether they are too high. By \ndefinition, a budget surplus means that our government is collecting \nmore than is necessary for current operations. People are paying simply \npaying more than they need to.\n  Perhaps, instead of keeping tax rates higher than they need to be, we \nought to reduce income-tax rates across the board--for single people \nand married couples, people with children and those without, young \npeople just getting a start and seniors trying to make ends meet on \nfixed incomes. It seems to me that every taxpaying American deserves a \nbreak.\n  We could also reduce taxes on savings and investment--lower the tax \non capital gains and eliminate the death tax--two things that would \nhelp keep the already lengthy economic expansion from petering out. If \nwe have learned anything from recent experience, it is that a strong \neconomy, more than tax-rate increases or modest spending cuts, is what \nit takes to turn budget deficits into surpluses. The booming economy \nhas been pouring billions of extra tax dollars into the Treasury. If we \nwant that revenue flow to continue, we need to be sure that tax policy \nis conducive to sustained economic growth.\n  But the fact is, tax relief is not going to pass this year. President \nClinton has\n\n[[Page S12217]]\n\nalready indicated he will veto the modest tax-relief bill approved by \nthe House, and we do not have the votes to reach the two-thirds \nmajority that it would take to override a veto. So discussion of tax \nrelief is really academic this year.\n  Aside from tax relief, the surplus gives us a chance to pay down the \nnational debt. Less federal borrowing frees up funds for businesses and \nconsumers, and as I indicated earlier in my remarks, that has already \nled to lower interest rates. Further reductions in the debt would \ncontinue that virtuous cycle. Moreover, it seems to me that we have a \nmoral obligation to relieve our children and grandchildren of some of \nthe burden of paying off the debt that our generation has accrued.\n  Another option is to use the budget surplus for Social Security. We \nall recognize the huge costs that will be associated with getting back \nto what most people thought Social Security was supposed to be--a safe \nand secure account where their contributions could be deposited and \nwhere they could grow to produce a nest egg for retirement. Applying \nthe budget surplus toward those transition costs will make it much \neasier to make the required changes and ensure that Social Security is \nthere for our children and grandchildren.\n  And of course, the surplus we have in the unified federal budget \nreally exists only as a result of the surplus that Social Security \ngenerates anyway. Take Social Security out of the calculation and the \nfederal budget would show not a surplus of $70 billion, but a deficit \nsomewhere in the range of $30 billion.\n  Mr. President, there is some merit in each of these ideas: tax \nrelief, debt repayment, and Social Security reform. The problem is, \nbefore we can even begin the debate about which of these options is \nbest, the budget surplus is being steadily frittered away.\n  Earlier this year, Congress, at the Clinton administration's behest, \ndipped into the surplus, spending about $6 billion on a variety of \nprograms. Within the next day or two, action is expected on another \nClinton request to draw down the surplus by at least another $14 \nbillion--with not a dime going to Social Security. We are talking about \nthe President's request to spend billions of dollars of the surplus on \nBosnia, embassy security, farm aid, and the Year 2000 computer problem.\n  Of course, funding requirements for Bosnia and these other needs were \ncertainly foreseeable and could have been accounted for when the \nPresident sent his budget to Congress eight months ago. After all, \ntroops have been deployed in Bosnia since 1995, and last year, the \nPresident extended their deployment there indefinitely. The need to \nbeef up embassy security was brought up months ago, and we have known \nabout the Year 2000 computer problem for some time. None of these \nthings should have come as a surprise to the White House or anyone \nelse.\n  But by failing to account for them when he submitted his original \nbudget in February, President Clinton was able to inflate spending on \nother programs and claim that his budget still fell within the \nconstraints of last year's budget agreement. Now, the President wants \nall of this declared emergency spending so that it does not have to be \noffset elsewhere in the budget. The reality is that he wants to raid \nthe Social Security surplus to pay for these other things.\n  Many Americans will ask what happened to the pledge President Clinton \nmade in his State of the Union Address earlier this year. That was when \nhe looked the American people squarely in the eye and said:\n\n       I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that \n     is every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the \n     necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system \n     for the 21st century.\n\n  Eight months have passed, and the President has yet to send us any \nplan to protect Social Security. Worse yet, while publicly claiming to \ntry to protect the surplus for Social Security, he has already been out \ndrawing it down for other programs. The House-approved tax-relief bill \nthat the President has criticized would use only $6.6 billion of the \nbudget surplus for tax relief next year. That compares to the $20 \nbillion or more of the surplus that the President wants to spend on \nother programs.\n  If it is wrong to use part of the surplus for tax relief, is it not \nwrong to spend at least three times as much on government programs? It \nseems to me that this is just another example of the President trying \nto have it both ways.\n  Mr. President, it is too bad we did not achieve any consensus about \nwhat to do with the budget surplus this year, because, by default, as \nof October 1, any surplus automatically went to reduce the national \ndebt. If we are really serious about protecting Social Security, as to \nfuture surpluses, we should wall off the Social Security surplus so \nthat it cannot be spent on other programs--not by the President, not by \nCongress.\n  The Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, has one idea about how to do \nthat. As I understand it, funds would be invested in genuine assets, \nnot just government IOUs, under the supervision of the Federal Reserve. \nThe money would be off-limits to Congress and the President, and when \nCongress and the President agree on a plan to save Social Security, it \ncould be put to use for the purpose for which it was collected.\n  In addition to protecting the Social Security surplus, in my opinion, \nwe should provide broad-based tax relief to the American people with \nany other surplus. It is, after all, their hard work and their tax \npayments that have created the surplus we enjoy today. We ought to \nreturn any excess revenue to the people who earned it and paid \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12216-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE PROCLAMATION OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1998 AS POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY FOR \n                          THE STATE OF NEVADA\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, recently, Governor Miller of Nevada, \nin support of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and \nMissing in Southeast Asia, proclaimed September 18, 1998 as POW/MIA \nRecognition Day in the state of Nevada. I am pleased to declare before \nthe Senate my strong support for this proclamation.\n  The proclamation reads as follows:\n\n       Whereas today there are 2,118 Americans still missing and \n     unaccounted for from Southeast Asia, including 3 from the \n     State of Nevada, and their families, friends, and fellow \n     veterans still endure uncertainty concerning their fate; and\n       Whereas we as Americans believe that freedom is precious \n     because it has been won and preserved for all at a very great \n     cost; and\n       Whereas few Americans can more fully appreciate the value \n     of liberty and self-government than those Americans who were \n     interned in enemy prison camps as POWs and those who remain \n     missing in action; and\n       Whereas the courage, commitment, and devotion to duty \n     demonstrated by those servicemen and women who risked their \n     lives for our sake has moved the hearts of all Nevadans; and\n       Whereas, their dignity, faith, and valor reminds us of the \n     allegiance we owe to our nation and its defenders as well as \n     the compassion we owe to those families of the MIAs who daily \n     demonstrate heroic courage and fortitude in the face of \n     uncertainty;\n       Now, therefore, I, Bob Miller, Governor of the State of \n     Nevada, do hereby proclaim September 18, 1998, as POW/MIA \n     Recognition Day.\n       Mr. President, it is of paramount importance that we \n     continue to demand a full accounting of our servicemen and \n     women in foreign countries, in full respect and \n     acknowledgment of their unremitting courage and dedication in \n     placing their lives on the line as members of the United \n     States Armed Forces.\n       The importance of this issue cannot be overstated. The \n     sacrifices of these brave men and women must never be \n     forgotten, and we must continue to strive to account for \n     every one of our missing service members. A full accounting \n     of our missing Americans is absolutely essential, not only \n     for our armed services personnel but for their families and \n     our nation. Similarly, we must see that they, like all our \n     other veterans, are forever recognized for the duty they \n     performed so valiantly when our country needed them.\n       It is with these convictions that I support this \n     proclamation, establishing a Recognition Day for those who so \n     fully deserve our reciprocal dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12217-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12217-S12218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING ALEXANDER C. SCHLEHR\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the young \nmen and women that served bravely in the United States military during \nWWI, and to one veteran in particular, Alexander C. Schlehr. Mr. \nSchlehr, of Buffalo, NY, is one of only 1,800 living veterans of this \nwar. He courageously lived through the perils of European trench \nwarfare and served his country honorably.\n  Due to his strong desire to assist his country in the war effort, \nAlexander\n\n[[Page S12218]]\n\nenlisted in the army at the young age of 19. Immediately, he was \nincorporated into 59th Pioneer Infantry, later to be known as the Corps \nof Engineers. Even before Alex's infantry landed in France, the boat on \nwhich he was traveling was attacked by enemy torpedoes. Thus, he has \nexperienced all aspects of warfare, both on the sea and in the trenches \nof France and in the Argonne forest. For his patriotic and heroic \nservice, Schlehr has been awarded a WWI medal with three Battle Stars \nand is currently being reviewed for the French ``Legion of Honor'' \nmedal. He is also considered a local hero. His service has been exalted \nin his local newspaper, the Amherst Bee, and has been recognized by \nlocal and top government officials, all of whom contacted him on his \n100th birthday.\n  Yet, Alexander Schlehr's desire to serve his country did not end at \nthe close of the war. When the war ended, Schlehr graciously helped in \nhandling the personal belongings of discharged officers. He has raised \nfour children, one of which has served the United States in wartime as \nwell, and prospered as a successful business man. Furthermore, he has \nreceived numerous awards and recognitions denoting his sixty years of \nservice in the American Legion and the Commandeers.\n  I feel it is my duty to recognize the outstanding service Alexander \nSchlehr has given to this country during his 101 years of life. He is \nan example for all Americans through his selfless and courageous \nactions. I thank him for his dedication to our country and wish him a \nHappy 102nd Birthday this coming spring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12217-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12218-S12219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SAM LACY\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is a singular privilege for me \nto rise and acknowledge that this past summer Sam Lacy, one of the \ngiants of American sports journalism, was inducted into the Baseball \nHall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York on July 26. Sam Lacy, like \nBaltimore's great civil rights leaders Thurgood Marshall and Clarence \nMitchell, Jr., was a pioneer in the great struggle to expand the \nparticipation of all Americans in our national life. The path he chose, \nhowever, was not the corridors of legal or political power, nor the \nstreets and sidewalks of protest, but rather the silent and eloquent \npower of his pen.\n  His career in journalism, which spanned over 50 years, began in the \nthroes of a segregated society which deprived talented athletes of \ncolor the right to give their best in the field of competition. Sam \nLacy, using his gift of writing combined with a pleasant but persistent \ndemeanor, helped to break down these barriers thereby enriching \nimmeasurably the quality and equality of our revered ``National \nPastime.''\n  It is a tribute to the talent and determination of Sam Lacy and that \nof baseball pioneers Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby, and the essential \nfairness of our American spirit, that at age 94, Sam Lacy was \nrecognized for his unique contribution to journalism and baseball. Mr. \nPresident, I am most pleased to take this opportunity to congratulate \nSam Lacy personally for his induction into the Hall of Fame and for his \ndistinguished and exceptional contribution to sports journalism. In \nhonoring him, we also pay tribute to those great players of the past \nand present who have given so much to the sport of baseball.\n  I ask that several articles from the Baltimore Afro-American, which \nprovided the forum for Sam's journalistic offerings, and the Baltimore \nSun be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, July 27, 1998]\n\n                      Diverse Paths Cross at Hall\n\n\n      pioneers doby, lacy share dais with sutton on induction day\n\n                           (By Peter Schmuck)\n\n       Cooperstown, N.Y.--They came from different places. \n     Different backgrounds.

Probably because I'm \n     standing in front of these wonderful artists of our game. If \n     you can't feel the aura when you walk through the Hall of \n     Fame, check tomorrow's obituary column . . . because you're \n     in it.''\n       Sutton thanked his father for the work ethic that carried \n     him through 23 major-league seasons. He lovingly acknowledged \n     his late mother, Lillian, his wife, Mary, and his children.\n       He thanked Hall of Fame teammates Sandy Koufax and the late \n     Don Drysdale, who inadvertently ushered him into the major \n     leagues with their dual contract holdout in 1966, then guided \n     him through his first season. He thanked the late Dodgers \n     manager Walter Alston, who took a chance on him in his youth, \n     and former Angels manager Gene Mauch, who stuck with him in \n     the latter stages of his career.\n       But he saved the most credit for his eventual Hall of Fame \n     induction for longtime Dodgers pitching coach Red Adams, who \n     fashioned him into the durable and skillful pitcher who would \n     win 15 or more games 12 times and finish his career ranked \n     fifth all-time with 3,574 strikeouts.\n       ``No person ever meant more to my career than Red Adams,'' \n     Sutton said. ``Without him, I would not be standing in \n     Cooperstown today.''\n       There weren't a lot of dry eyes when Sutton finally pointed \n     out his 20-month-old daughter Jacqueline, who was born 16 \n     weeks premature and given little chance to survive, and \n     credited her with bringing his life and career into \n     perspective.\n       ``Thanks, little girl, for sticking around to be part of \n     this. You make it perfect,'' said Sutton, 53. ``I'm a very \n     blessed man. I have my health. I'm part of a family that I \n     love to be a part of. I've had a dream come true that is a \n     validation of what my father taught me a long time ago. You \n     can have a dream and if you're willing to work for it, it can \n     come true. With apologies to Lou Gehrig, I'm the luckiest man \n     on the face of the earth. I have everything in life I ever \n     wanted.''\n       The makeup of the group of honorees clearly reflected the \n     great progress that baseball--and society--has made during \n     the half-century since Robinson broke through baseball's \n     color barrier in 1947.\n       Doby would soon join Robinson in the major leagues, helping \n     fulfill the dream that Lacy had articulated in countless \n     newspaper columns in the 1930s and early 1940s--a dream that \n     sill seemed very distant when Rogan ended his playing career \n     in 1938. Jarrin would forge a link to the Latino community in \n     Los Angeles a decade later and emerge as the voice of \n     baseball to millions of Hispanic baseball fans in the United \n     States and Latin America.\n       Lacy, 94, gave the crowd a start when he stumbled and fell \n     on his way to the podium, but he collected himself and \n     delivered a poignant, humorous speech that included a call to \n     more fully acknowledge the history and contributions of the \n     black press.\n       ``I hope that my presence here . . . will impress on the \n     American public that the Negro press has a role that is \n     recognized and honored,'' Lacy said.\n       Doby also gave a stirring acceptance speech, recounting a \n     career that began with the four years he spent with the \n     Newark Eagles of the Negro leagues and took a historic turn \n     when Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck purchased his \n     contract and brought him right to the majors on July 5, 1947.\n       ``Everything I have and my family has got has come from \n     baseball,'' he said. ``If someone had told me 50 years ago \n     that I would be here today, I would not have believed it.''\n       Pressed later for details of indignities he suffered as one \n     of the pioneer black players, he responded without rancor or \n     bitterness.\n       ``It's a tough thing to look back and think about things \n     that were probably negative,'' said Doby. ``You put those \n     things on the back burner. You're proud to have played a part \n     in the integration of baseball. I feel this is the proof that \n     we all can work together, live together and be successful \n     together.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Baltimore Afro-American, Aug. 1, 1998]\n\n       Lacy: A Man Who Stands for Something and Falls for Nothing\n\n                            (By Tony White)\n\n       There's an old saying that goes: ``If you don't stand for \n     something, you'll fall for anything.''

Even as he accepted the Spink Award, his mind was on \n     the family members, numerous friends and supporters who had \n     made the trip to up-state New York, to witness his moment of \n     glory. In his acceptance speech, the 94-year-old deflected \n     attention from himself toward the Black press.\n       ``It was a very pleasant experience because of the \n     recognition it gave the Black press,'' said Mr. Lacy. ``The \n     response I got from friends was tremendous. There were about \n     50-60 people who were in Cooperstown last weekend, who would \n     not have been there otherwise.''\n       Along with late Pittsburgh Courier writer Wendell Smith, \n     Mr. Lacy is credited with facilitating the integration of the \n     league that showcased America's favorite pass-time. Mr. \n     Smith, however, joined in a fight that Mr. Lacy had picked \n     with the majors late in the 1930s. Feisty and unabashed, the \n     Washington D.C. native began a writing campaign that drew the \n     nation's attention to the separatism practiced in the league, \n     which earned him significant sayso when the time came for \n     skin color to take a back seat to talent.\n       A decade after Mr. Lacy had written his first column \n     criticizing the segregated majors, Jackie Robinson took the \n     field as a Brooklyn Dodger. Though now highly acclaimed, the \n     break through was not painless for Mr. Lacy.\n       The suggestion of integration coupled with the agitation of \n     Mr. Lacy's writing, drew the ire of White baseball club \n     owners. When he approached Washington Nationals' owner Clark \n     Griffith about hiring Black players for his team, the club \n     executive told Mr. Lacy integrating the majors would kill the \n     institution of Negro Baseball.\n       ``I told him Negro Baseball may have been an institution \n     but it was also a symbol of segregation. The sacrifice would \n     be worth it,'' said Mr. Lacy.\n       That position was less than popular with Black baseball \n     club owners. Mr. Lacy, as usual held his ground but things \n     didn't get any easier. The selection of Mr. Robinson as the \n     first Black player to compete in the major leagues was not \n     based totally upon skill. Mr. Lacy, Mr. Smith and Brooklyn \n     Dodgers owner Branch Rickey knew the player chosen would have \n     to be composed enough to endure the racist flack that would \n     be heaped upon him.\n       Fittingly, Larry Body, a player whom Mr. Lacy had also \n     considered along with Mr. Robinson, was also inducted during \n     Sunday's ceremony. Mr. Doby was the first Black to play in \n     the American League. He acknowledged the significance of \n     following Mr. Robinson into the big leagues.\n       ``We proved that Black and Whites could work together, play \n     together, live together and be successful,'' said Mr. Doby, \n     who played for the Newark Eagles of the Negro Leagues.\n       There were other Negro League players who felt they should \n     have been chosen before Mr. Robinson and Mr. Doby. Pitching \n     sensation Satchel Paige, slugger Josh ``The Big Man'' Gibson, \n     Buck Leonard, who was known as the ``Black Lou Gehrig'', \n     Oscar Charleston and Sam Bankhead were some of the players \n     many felt should have been moved up first.\n       Lacy stood his ground.\n       As Mr. Robinson and Mr. Doby began to experience success in \n     the majors, Negro League attendance begin to fall off. Some \n     players and club owners blamed Mr. Lacy for their misfortune.\n       Meanwhile, Mr. Doby, Mr. Robinson and Mr. Lacy caught hell \n     in the White baseball world. Fans jeered Mr. Robinson and Mr. \n     Doby and players tried to injure them. Lacy was barred from \n     press boxes and they all were barred from fields in certain \n     states. With criticism coming from White and Black quarters \n     and players, Lacy was catching it from all directions.\n       The stand he took on behalf of Black inclusion in major \n     league baseball, was misunderstood and had turned some his \n     fellow African Americans bitterly against him.\n       ``They were a little resentful. They saw the deterioration \n     of their (Negro League) attendance. Black newspapers were \n     easing off coverage of the Negro Leagues and the (Black) \n     stars in the majors were getting the press,'' said Mr. Lacy.\n       ``At the time you had to wonder why they would be jealous \n     of their former teammates. If they (Robinson and Doby) go up \n     and are successful, why couldn't they (other Negro League \n     players) just follow them?''\n       At Sunday's induction ceremony, Mr. Lacy took a tumble on \n     the way to the podium, then in classic fashion, rose to the \n     occasion to make a poignant speech. Those gathered showed \n     they understood and appreciated Mr. Lacy's stand for \n     multicultural baseball. They gave him one standing ovation, \n     then stood and gave him another.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Hall of Fame Lacy\n\n       There seems to be no end to the forms of recognitions being \n     conveyed upon Sam Lacy, our illustrious sports editor. There \n     is, however, no denying that his recent induction into the \n     Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, N.Y. must rank among \n     Mr. Lacy's highest honors.\n       There have been many expressions of adoration used to \n     described Mr. Lacy's invaluable contributions to baseball and \n     sports. The one which seems most often repeated relates to \n     Mr. Lacy's persistance in reminding major league baseball of \n     the atrocity it was committing by continuously excluding \n     African-American athletes.\n       There seem to be a fair number of African Americans who \n     have been enshrined at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Most \n     of them participated in baseball well after Mr. Lacy's \n     efforts helped break down the barriers to Jackie Robinson \n     being admitted into the `big leagues.'\n       The importance of Mr. Lacy's contribution has not \n     diminished one bit as demonstrated in Cooperstown last \n     weekend, when the `ole timers' all stepped back to give Mr. \n     Lacy his long overdue recognition. For a brief moment, \n     everyone remembered what it was like in the old days and in \n     the process applauded Mr. Lacy's contribution to making it \n     better.\n       A bigger job now appears to loom in getting the current \n     major league stars to remember that their arrival in the \n     bright lights of today's big leagues is due to the efforts of \n     the `ole guard,' which now forever includes our Sam \n     Lacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12218-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12219-S12220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO FONTBONNE COLLEGE ON ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nFontbonne College in St. Louis, Missouri. On October 15, 1998, \nFontbonne College will celebrate its 75th anniversary.\n  Fontbonne has served more than 10,000 graduates in pursuit of \nacademic excellence. As Fontbonne moves toward the 21st century, it is \nlooking to continue the ministry of higher education begun by the \nsisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet.\n  Fontbonne's history goes back to seventeenth century France, the \nbeginning of the Sisters of St. Joseph. In LePuy, France in 1647, six \nwomen under the direction of Jesuit priest Father Jean Pierre Medaille \nwere brought together to dedicate their lives to the spiritual and \nmaterial needs of the people. The order was publicly recognized as the \nSisters of St. Joseph on October 15, 1650.\n  Around 1778, Jeanne Fontbonne entered the congregation, received the \nname of Sister St. John Fontbonne, and later became the Mother Superior \nat Monistrol. With the violence of the French Revolution, the sisters \nwere forced to disband. Several were imprisoned and executed. After the \ndeath of Robespierre, the day before Mother St. John was to be \nexecuted, she was released and asked to reform the congregation. In \n1807, 12 women celebrated the rebirth of the Sisters of St. Joseph.\n  Bishop Joseph Rosati of St. Louis asked Mother St. John to send \nsisters to the area to teach the deaf. Six sisters set sail for America \nand established its current home in Carondelet, on the southern border \nof St. Louis. A log cabin built on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi \nRiver became the ``cradle of the congregation of the Sisters of St. \nJoseph of Carondelet.''\n  The sisters opened a day school in the area, a school for deaf and a \ngirl's high school. With these successes, the sisters discussed a new \ntwentieth century idea--higher education of women.\n  Fontbonne College was chartered on April 17, 1917, but the entrance \nof the United States in World War I in that year precluded the \nbeginning of classes. Construction at the Clayton location started in \n1924. The first Fontbonne class began in 1923 at St. Joseph's Academy. \nNew buildings were ready for the fall term of 1925. On June 18, 1927, \nFontbonne conferred its first bachelor of arts degree on eight women.\n  Since its beginnings in 1923, Fontbonne has changed with and been \nahead of the times, but has also kept its identity. Fontbonne admitted \nAfrican American students in 1947, eight years before the Supreme \nCourt's school desegregation decision. Male students were admitted in \nselective majors in 1971, then in 1974 all classes were opened to men \nand women. In the 1980s, Fontbonne created degree programs with \nflexible scheduling to meet the needs of working students. Now \nFontbonne has its first male president.\n  Today Fontbonne is deeply rooted in the tradition and values--\nquality, respect, diversity, community, justice, service, faith and \nCatholic presence--of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet.\n  I commend Fontbonne College staff and students for their dedication \nand perseverance throughout the college's many years of existence and \nhope they\n\n[[Page S12220]]\n\ncontinue to enrich the St. Louis community for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12219-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the Internet, as an growing form \nof communication, commerce, and information exchange, is a powerful \nmedium for all who are able to take advantage of the opportunities it \npresents. The initial version of S. 442, the Internet Tax Freedom Act, \nwould, in my opinion, have provided this already powerful tool with \neven more competitive advantages. Frankly, I believed that the original \nversion was too one-sided in aiding Internet-based businesses at the \nexpense of other interests. However, I was very pleased with the \nwillingness of the authors of this bill to address the concerns raised \nby state and local governments as well as ``Main Street'' business \nowners in such a way that I was able to support the final bill.\n  The final version of S. 442 contains several positive features. Among \nthose is the inclusion of the Hutchinson amendment, which will allow \nthe Commission created by S. 442 to examine the impact of all types of \nremote sales. Every year states lose billions of dollars in revenue \nfrom remote sales, most recently via the Internet but also in catalog \nsales. The Hutchinson amendment, which is faithful to the \nrecommendation of the Finance Committee, makes a proper and relevant \nexpansion of the mandate of the Commission.\n  Not all states and municipalities have imposed taxes on the Internet. \nHowever, those that have should not have their Constitutional right to \nimpose these taxes stripped away by Congress. The grandfathering of \nexisting taxes on electronic commerce contained in the final version of \nS. 442, is consistent with our federalist system and balances the needs \nof interstate commerce with the proper role of states and \nmunicipalities.\n  Although these and other positive provisions in S. 442 allowed me to \nsupport the overall bill, I am hopeful that the initial concerns I had \nwith S. 442 will not arise again when the three year moratorium \nestablished by the bill expires. The purpose of this temporary \nmoratorium is to allow government and industry representatives time to \nwork together to decide the rules for electronic commerce. However, S. \n442 offers no guarantee that the moratorium will not be extended after \nthe three year period. I supported Senator Graham's amendment that \nwould have required a super majority to extend the moratorium, but \nunfortunately, it was defeated.\n  There is a precedent of another ``temporary'' moratorium that never \nexpired. In 1959, Congress enacted Public Law 86-272, which limited \nstate corporate income tax collection on out-of-state corporations. \nLike the goal of the Commission created by S. 442, a moratorium was \nimposed to try to negotiate a uniform standard with regard to the tax \ntreatment of out-of-state corporations. The results of P.L. 86-272 was \nan increase in litigation and a decrease in state and local tax \nrevenue. This precedent explains state and local leaders' skepticism \nabout a temporary Internet tax moratorium. It is my hope that when the \nthree year moratorium expires, Congress will not extend the moratorium. \nThe experience of P.L. 86-272 does not need to be repeated.\n  I fear that a continuation of the moratorium would tilt the scales \nheavily in favor electronic commerce at the expense of local ``Main \nStreet'' businesses. Internet sales should not receive any privileges \nthat are not available to other forms of commerce. Business competitors \nof Internet-based firms should not have to experience such legalized \ndiscrimination.\n  Although the use of computers will certainly continue to grow, there \nwill always be consumers who will not have access to the Internet. If \nattempts are made to extend the three year moratorium, Congress will, \nin effect, be offering a tax break to those who can afford a computer \nand Internet access to the detriment of those who cannot.\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to applaud the efforts that have \nbeen made to address this rapidly emerging form of trade, and I believe \nthat the compromise version of S. 442 is an appropriate balance that \nwill give the Commission time to make a recommendation while not \ngreatly interfering with interstate commerce. However, I urge caution \nby my colleagues, when we revisit this issue in three years, that in \nour zeal to encourage the growth of the Internet and all the promise it \noffers we should not compromise the needs of our states, cities, towns, \nand local merchants. I pledge my efforts to achieve that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12220-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12220-S12221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AUTO CHOICE REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, while I know that the Senate will \nnot take up consideration of S. 625, The Auto Choice Reform Act of \n1997, during the 105th Congress, I wanted to put my views regarding \nthis legislation on the record.\n  S. 625 creates a federally mandated two-tracked automobile insurance \nsystem under which car owners would have the option to enroll in a \n``personal protection system'' or the traditional ``tort maintenance \nsystem.'' Those who select the personal protection system are promised \n``prompt recovery'' of economic loss, regardless of fault. However, \nthey forfeit the right to recover damages for pain and suffering while \nbeing exempted from liability for such damages themselves.\n  I have some strong concerns regarding this type of so-called \n``reform'' legislation.\n  First and foremost, I believe that the argument that ``Auto Choice'' \nwill reduce insurance premiums is unfounded. Over the last few years, \nthe numerous states that have adopted no-fault insurance programs \nsimilar to those in this legislation have had the highest premiums in \nthe country. In fact, in 1995, 6 out of the 10 states with the highest \naverage liability premiums were no-fault systems. In light of the \nfailure of auto choice to lower premium costs, I cannot understand why \nwe are seeking to put such a system into place across the country.\n  I am also greatly troubled by the fact that this bill involves an \nattempt by the federal government to impose a one-size-fits-all \nsolution on the states. While I recognize that some reforms are \nnecessary, I do not believe that federalizing our tort system, is, or \nshould be the solution.\n  For more than 200 years, states have had the power to develop and \nrefine their own tort systems. Supreme Court Justice Powell wisely \nobserved: ``Our 50 states have developed a complicated and effective \nsystem of tort laws and where there have been problems, the states have \nacted to fix those problems.'' Mr. President, federally directed reform \nefforts such as those contained in S. 625 detract from the states' \nabilities to fashion their own initiatives and deny them the \nopportunity to provide solutions to meet their own particularized \nneeds.\n  Furthermore, I am troubled by the fact that this bill allows people \nto waive their right to recover for noneconomic damages. Mr. President, \nsuch a provision could lead to a lifetime of pain and suffering for \nthose who suffer massive injury in a car accident. In fact, that \npossibility is so high, no state, not one, allows its citizens to \nchoose to waive their right of recovery for pain and suffering.\n  Consider the fact that in all likelihood people would ``choose'' to \nwaive these rights when they are sitting in their den, filling out \ntheir insurance forms. Mr. President, I would argue that the timing of \nsuch a choice precludes the possibility of informed consent on the part \nof the consumer. No one can predict the future, people cannot say \nwhether they will need to pursue recovery for some accident. I predict \nthat, many of those who so choose will one day find that they guessed \nwrong. Mr. President, checking off a box on a form could forever cost \nsomeone the ability to seek damages for loss of a limb, blindness, loss \nof a child or permanent disfigurement. This legislation does not \nprovide a choice, it opens people up to take an unnecessary chance.\n  This legislation contains another flaw in that it does not fully \nprotect the rights of those who choose traditional tort protection. \nSomeone who chooses tort law coverage can only seek complete access to \nthe courts if the at-fault driver has also selected traditional tort \nlaw coverage. Thus, a victim in an accident has to hope to be lucky \nenough that the person that hits him has selected the ``right'' type of \ncoverage. Again, what appear to be\n\n[[Page S12221]]\n\n``choices'' in this bill are in effect risky chances.\n  Mr. President, if we revisit this issue in the future, I believe we \nmust closely consider these factors. Ultimately, we must also note that \nwe cannot advance reform without taking our federal system into \nconsideration. What is right in Alabama, may not be proper for \nCalifornia, or North Dakota or Connecticut. States must play the \npreeminent role in setting the course for tort law reform. Common sense \ndemands it, our legal traditions demand it, and our Constitution \ndemands it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12220-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE STRENGTHENING ABUSE AND NEGLECT COURTS ACT\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join Mr. \nDeWine in his introduction of the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect \nCourts Act. I would like to thank Mr. DeWine of this leadership on this \nbill, another example of his ongoing commitment to our Nation's most \nvulnerable children and families. I would also like to thank my good \nfriends Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Chafee for their support of and input on \nthis legislation.\n  Last year at this time, Congress passed and President Clinton signed \ninto law the Adoption and Safe Families Act, the most sweeping piece of \nchild welfare legislation in more than two decades. For the first time, \nthis law establishes that a child's health and safety must be the \nparamount consideration when any decision is made regarding a child in \nthe abuse and neglect system. The law promotes stability and permanence \nfor abused and neglected children by requiring timely decision-making \nin proceedings to determine whether children can safely return to their \nfamilies or whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive \nhomes. More specifically, the law requires a State to move to terminate \nthe parental right of any parent whose child has been in foster care \nfor 15 out of the last 22 months. While essential to protect children, \nthese accelerated time lines increase the pressure on the Nation's \nalready overburdened abuse and neglect courts.\n  Our courts play a vital role in the Nation's abuse and neglect \nsystem. Through my discussions with judges in my state of West Virginia \nand across the country, I have learned that abuse and neglect judges \nmake some of the most difficult decisions made by any members of the \njudiciary. Adjudications of abuse and neglect, terminations of parental \nrights, approval of adoptions, and life-changing determinations are not \nmade without careful and sometimes painful deliberation. Despite the \ncourts' commitment to the fair and efficient administration of justice \nin these cases, staggering increases in the number of children in the \nabuse and neglect system, have placed a tremendous burden on our abuse \nand neglect courts.\n  Many abuse and neglect courts have found creative and effective new \nways to eliminate their backlogs and move children more efficiently and \nsafely through the court system. In West Virginia, Supreme Court \nJustice Margaret Workman and a dedicated group of judges and attorneys \nhave developed a comprehensive plan to increase the accountability and \nefficient administration of abuse and neglect cases. In Cincinnati, \nOhio, Judge Grossman's abuse and neglect courts have implemented state-\nof-the-art computer tracking systems which help them smooth the legal \npaths of children in foster care.\n  The purpose of the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act is to \nhelp remove the burdens on an even greater number of abuse and neglect \ncourts by increasing their administrative efficiency and effectiveness. \nThe bill establishes a program which will provide grants to state and \nlocal courts for the creation and implementation of computerized \ncasetracking systems, similar to the one that has seen such incredible \nsuccess in Ohio. Through the establishment of such systems, courts are \nable to more easily track how long a child spends in foster care and \nthe status of their cases. Such easy-to-access information will allow \ncourts to move children more quickly and efficiently through the foster \ncare system and into adoptive homes and other permanent placements. \nThis grant program will also enable state and local courts to design \nand use similar computer systems and to allow for the replication of \nsimilar models in other jurisdictions. The technical assistance \nprovision in this bill provides additional funds to aid these courts in \nthe design and implementation of their new computer programs.\n\n  Throughout the debate on the Adoption and Safe Families Act, we heard \nfrom dozens of judges who said that the biggest problems facing their \ncourts was the overwhelming backlog of abuse and neglect cases. Without \ncreative ways to eliminate such backlogs, the judges argued, new cases \nwill never move smoothly through the court system. That is why this \nbill also authorizes a grant program to provide State courts with the \nfunds they need to eliminate current backlogs once and for all. For \nsome courts, that might involve the temporary hiring of an additional \njudge, a temporary extension of court hours, or restructuring the \nduties of court personnel. This program will provide grants to those \ncourt projects that will result in the effective and rapid elimination \nof current backlogs to smooth the way for a more efficient courts in \nthe future.\n  The Strengthening the Abuse and Neglect Courts also recognizes the \nneed to improve training, continuing education opportunities, and model \npractice standards for judges, attorneys and other court personnel who \nwork in the abuse and neglect courts. More specifically, the bill \nrequires that abuse and neglect agencies design and encourage the \nimplementation of ``best practice'' standards for those attorneys \nrepresenting the agencies in abuse and neglect cases. The Act also \nextends the federal reimbursement for training currently provided to \nagency representatives to judges, court personnel, law enforcement \nrepresentatives, guardians-ad-litem, and the other attorneys who \npractice in abuse and neglect proceedings. For the first time, such \nreimbursement would help fund specialized cross-trainings between \nagency and court personnel and trainings that focus on vital subjects \nsuch as new research on child development.\n  In addition to the judges, guardians-ad-litem and attorneys in the \nabuse and neglect courts, volunteers for the Court-Appointed Special \nAdvocate (CASA) Program also play a key role in helping abused and \nneglected children in the court system. CASA volunteers are the eyes \nand the ears of the courts, spending time with abused and neglected \nchildren, interviewing the adults involved in their lives, and helping \nto give judges a better understanding of the needs of each individual \nchild. Despite the incredible success of the CASA programs, thousands \nof abused and neglected children do not have the benefit of CASA \nrepresentation. The Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act provides \nCASA with a $5 million grant to expand its programs into under-served \nareas and to improve its ability to recruit, train and supervise \nvolunteers in already existing programs.\n  When we talk about child welfare in this country, abuse and neglect \ncourts are too often left out of the discussion. This is an \nunacceptable mistake, since our courts play a central role in the well-\nbeing of our nation's abused and neglected children. I am confident \nthat the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act will be valuable \nfirst step in making these courts stronger and more efficient than \never, and I ask my colleagues to join us in this important \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12221-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12221-S12222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF MS.

You are probably \n     wondering who these people are. The two Hispanic leaders have \n     no education, not even elementary education, and they live in \n     a low-income neighborhood--they are my parents, Angel and \n     Lupe Calvillo are their names, and in my opinion they are the \n     two most successful Hispanic business leaders. I base this \n     opinion on the description of what I believe ``Hispanic \n     Business Leadership'' is. I believe that a Hispanic leader in \n     business should have the characteristics that are common in \n     the mother and father family figures in Hispanic families. I \n     believe this because running a business is like managing a \n     big family, where the children are the employees and you are \n     there to manage them into becoming successful individuals for \n     their benefit as well as the family, which is a sort of \n     business. My parents were extremely successful in managing \n     their children, or their ``employees,'' into becoming \n     successful individuals. How, you may ask? First of all, I \n     don't think many could argue that Hispanic parents, with \n     their strict and religious way of raising their families, are \n     the most successful at running any kind of family. This is \n     why many Hispanic businesses that are family owned, for \n     instance the explosion of family restaurants, are so \n     successful. The Hispanic businesses are managed with the same \n     leadership skills that my parents had as they were raising \n     their children. The skills my parents embody and that they \n     taught me, in preparation for becoming successful, are summed \n     up in three words; integrity, dignity and faith. Integrity--\n     doing what you say you're going to do, Dignity--meaning your \n     daily actions should bring honor and humility, and Faith--\n     having loyalty to God's teachings and confidence in God's \n     plan for you. Three characteristics needed to be a successful \n     business leader in any community, whether it be Hispanic or \n     not.\n       My parent's climb to success with their own family happened \n     because they are living every day those three characteristics \n     they taught my brothers, sisters and me.\n       My parents came to America in 1963 with hopes of a better \n     future for themselves and their children. They have no \n     education whatsoever and to this day, many years later, \n     barely utter the English language. They were migrant workers \n     in California and Washington. My older siblings vividly \n     remember their childhood when they, too, had to work in the \n     fields, alongside my parents. When my parents first arrived \n     in America, they made a pact with each other that the life \n     they lived was not going to be the destiny of their children. \n     They had arrived in the ``land of opportunity,'' and they \n     would do anything to give their children the best education \n     available to them.\n       This is exactly what they did. My Dad eventually obtained a \n     job as a welder and my Mom as a motel housekeeper. Although \n     together they averaged a meager income, they were able to \n     send all five of my siblings and me to private schools. I \n     know this seems unimaginably hard to do, but my family \n     succeeded because of my parents' immense faith in God, \n     family, and in this country. My siblings and I obtained jobs \n     at young ages so we could help out financially; we understood \n     and accepted why we couldn't go see a movie on weekends, or \n     why in winter we would double layer our clothes and sleep \n     with our jackets on. Yes, we were poor, but I never really \n     knew my family was poor until I went to Bellarmine Prep. High \n     School and visited my friends elegant homes and saw how they \n     lived. However, I still never felt the negative associations \n     that are usually paired with being poor. I was happy, because \n     God gave me more blessings than money could ever give me. God \n     gave me two extraordinary parents who instilled Christian \n     morals in their children and taught us how to live with \n     integrity and dignity in the eyes of God. Because God is \n     guiding my family, He made our experiences make my family \n     strong and united--truly engulfed in love for one another.\n       My parents worked hard, harder than any human being should \n     ever have to. They have gone without, so that we wouldn't . . \n     . the most unselfish human act possible . . . and this is why \n     under all my extreme circumstances I prevail. Looking at my \n     father's leathered hands alone send me soaring. Now it is my \n     turn to help them. I have responsibilities after school that \n     few others have. I must fill out forms, pay bills, send \n     letters, read letters, make phone calls for appointments, go \n     to appointments to translate and much more. I do all of this \n     for my parents because they do not speak English, read or \n     write. Sometimes, I feel like I am the parent. It is \n     frustrating at times when I have a test to study for, but \n     can't because I have to translate for my parents somewhere, \n     at some meeting, or appointment, etc. However, I do it \n     because I love them and like I mentioned before, I know their \n     hands are thick and knotted because of the lifetime of work \n     they have done for their children. This is why I am going to \n     college--to further my education and make myself and my \n     parents proud. I have concluded that all of my parents' \n     dreams and hopes live in their children. When we succeed, \n     they have succeeded.\n       My parents' hard work and the values they instilled in us \n     started to pay-off with my eldest sister--Lorena. She was the \n     first person in my family to even attempt to go to college. \n     She left my parents' home with just her clothes and my \n     parents' blessing. She eventually graduated from Seattle \n     University. I will never forget how my parents felt when they \n     heard my sister's name called out at the graduation. They \n     cried and my Dad cheered wildly, this is something he rarely \n     does. It had been a struggle for her, but finally a Calvillo \n     made it. My sister also set an example for the rest of the \n     family. My twenty-one year old brother is in his second year \n     at Seattle University, my first cousin, Aida Calvillo (whom \n     worked alongside my sister, Lorena, in the fields with her \n     parents), in 1996 graduated from the University of Washington \n     medical school, and the list continues as more Calvillos are \n     graduating from college. This is my second week attending \n     Seattle University and I am relishing every moment of it.\n       My sister utilized her education for others, and preached \n     to her younger siblings the importance of a higher education. \n     She told me my junior year of high school, as I was \n     contemplating college, ``Veronica, you can't determine what \n     you are born into, but you can determine what you will become \n     with the leadership skills our parents gave us.'' I took her \n     advice and have kept, and will keep, moving forward until I \n     become what I have determined I will become: a successful \n     Hispanic business leader.\n       With the help of the Hispanic College Fund Board of \n     Trustees and the generous financial support of Eddie Bauer, I \n     am on my way.\n       Once again, thank you and good evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12221-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nWHITE HOUSE'S CEREMONY HONORING EIGHT NEW YORK CITY POLICE OFFICERS FOR \n                   BEING AMONG THE NATION'S TOP COPS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, I bring to the Senate's attention \nthat October 16 is World Food Day. As the largest international food \naid organization in the world, the United Nations World Food Program \nfeeds 52.9 million people in 84 countries and deserves special \nrecognition.\n\n[[Page S12223]]\n\n  Millions of people have survived civil unrest, famine and other \ndisasters because of a project called Food-for-Life which makes \nemergency operations the primary focus of the World Food Program. Other \nprojects include Food-for-Work which uses food as a tool to encourage \npeople to work within their communities in order to become self reliant \nand Food-for-Growth which distributes food aid at schools, clinics and \nhospitals to help children and pregnant women.\n  I am proud to say that Judy Lewis, a native of Scott County, \nMississippi, and past Director of Organization of my 1978 campaign \nstaff, has been named the World Food Program's Country Director for \nEthiopia. Since 1992, Ms. Lewis has many times endured dangerous \nconditions to participate first-hand in helping to bring food to \nstarving people whose lives were threatened by natural disasters or \narmed conflicts. She has played a key role in many of the World Food \nProgram's biggest emergency and development projects around the world \nin places like Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Somalia. As Country \nDirector for Ethiopia, Ms. Lewis will be managing a $30 million \nemergency and development operation aiming to help over 800,000 people, \nfocusing on refugees, famine relief and urban poverty.\n  I commend Ms. Lewis for her strength and diligence. And I \ncongratulate the World Food Program for all of its good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12222-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RENOX '98\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce today the \nrelease of findings from an important environmental conference held in \nmy home State this summer. RENOX '98 gathered together \nexperts from across the country to focus on the issue of oxides of \nnitrogen (NOX) pollution. NOX is a hazardous \npollutant that is produced primarily by internal combustion engines and \npower generation boilers and furnaces.\n  In 1996, more than 23 million tons of NOX were released \ninto the atmosphere in the U.S. alone. NOX is a key \ncomponent in the formation of ground-level ozone and urban smog. The \nhealth effects of ground-level ozone are well-documented. It \ncontributes to respiratory diseases that cause premature death. It is \nharmful to children who play actively outdoors and damages agricultural \ncrops and natural vegetation.\n  RENOX '98 explored all of these effects and identified \nstrategies and solution for the control of NOX pollution. \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has some NOX \nreduction programs under way in both the transportation and power \ngeneration sectors. However, one of the messages of RENOX \n'98 is that more needs to be done and it needs to be done more quickly \nif we are to make our cities more livable for children and the elderly, \nwho are the most vulnerable to the effects of NOX emissions.\n  For these reasons, I hope that all Members of the Senate and their \nstaff will take some time to read the copy of the RENOX '98 \nproceedings that was mailed to each office last week. After reading it, \nI believe you will see the urgency of this issue. I know the Gunnerman \nFoundation, the lead sponsor of RENOX '98 intends to \naggressively pursue legislation and policy changes that will make \nNOX emissions reductions a higher national priority. Dr. \nJack Gibbons, formerly Science Advisory to the President and one of the \nkeynote speakers and RENOX '98, said: ``We must move the \nNOX problem, which has languished, toward the front of the \nline.''\n  This is an issue worthy of our attention and I urge you to give it a \ncloser look.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12223-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIONAL DAY FOR THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON TAIWAN\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as Americans prepare to \ncelebrate Columbus Day, I notice that there are other celebrations \ngoing on around Washington, including ``National Day'' celebrations in \nChinatown. October 10, 1998 marks the 87th anniversary of the founding \nof modern China. This is a very special day for Chinese people around \nthe world, and especially in Taiwan where October 10 is celebrated as \nNational Day in the Republic of China on Taiwan.\n  Dr. Sun Yat-sen is the father of modern China, and is widely regarded \nand revered both in mainland China and in Taiwan. On October 10, 1911, \nDr. Sun's Revolutionary Alliance succeeded in putting an end to \nimperial rule in China, a date which also marked the formal planting of \nthe seeds of democracy which continue to flourish in Taiwan today.\n  People often speculate as to the real reasons for the ``Taiwan \nMiracle'' and how Taiwan continues to defy the odds today; how this \nisland nation continues to expand economically when nations all around \nher are at an economic standstill or contracting; and they speculate as \nto how Taiwan not only survives politically, but how she has evolved \ninto such a strong democracy despite the pressures by the People's \nRepublic of China (PRC) to isolate her from the international \ncommunity.\n  While there is no easy answer to this question, Taiwan is a \nflourishing and successful society in every sense of the word, and is a \nsource of optimism in an increasingly uncertain world. In this light, \nit gives me particularly great pleasure to wish everyone on Taiwan, and \nChinese people around the world, a very special October 10 National \nDay. And so to all of you, congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12223-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12223-S12224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE DRUG CURRENCY FORFEITURES ACT\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, Mark Twain once said, ``Get your \nfacts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please.'' \nThere has been some distortion and misinformation about my bill, the \nDrug Currency Forfeitures Act, and I appreciate the opportunity to \ndiscuss the facts.\n  First of all, the purpose of my bill is to dismantle the fortunes of \ndrug traffickers by helping law enforcement seize their drug profits. \nIt is all about confiscating the money of drug dealers, drug \ntraffickers, and drug kingpins. It is NOT about seizing the money of \ninnocent, law-abiding citizens, as some have charged. Confiscating the \nmoney of innocent citizens violates the Fourth Amendment of the \nConstitution, and I would oppose such an attempt with every effort at \nmy command. That is why this legislation includes constitutional \nsafeguards which protect innocent Americans against illegal searches \nand seizures.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you why I introduced my bill. There have \nbeen a recent series of court cases which have handed down some very \ndisturbing verdicts. In each case, despite overwhelming evidence to the \ncontrary, the court ruled against seizing the assets of drug \ntraffickers--one of our most effective weapons in the war against \ndrugs. Let me give you just one example.\n  A traveler was stopped in an airport carrying almost $14,000 in cash. \nA trained drug dog responded positively to the presence of drugs on the \nmoney. When asked for an explanation, the drug courier produced a fake \nID and lied about the money's source. He also had a previous drug \narrest on his record. Yet despite the evidence, the court gave the \nmoney back to the trafficker. Why? The court ruled there was sufficient \nevidence to show that the money came from some kind of criminal \nactivity. But the court held there was insufficient evidence to prove \nthat the crime was drug trafficking. United States v. $13,570.00 in \nU.S. Currency, 1997 WL 722947 (E.D. La. 1997).\n  Every year drug sales in this country generate $60 billion in drug \nprofits. Every day drug couriers move huge quantities of this multi-\nbillion-dollar pot out of the U.S. in loads big enough to fill \nsuitcases, trucks, and even airplanes. This movement of drug kingpins' \ncash crop is the most vulnerable part of their drug operation. Yet \ncurrent law allows the drug trafficker and his couriers to say nothing \nat all when their money is seized. That's right, Mr. President. Under \nthe law, the drug trafficker is obliged to give no explanation at all \nas to where his money came from. If the government can only show that \nthe money was involved in a crime--but can't show that it was a drug \ncrime--the drug dealer gets his money back.\n  My legislation proposes a presumption that the money is drug proceeds \nif certain clearly defined circumstances are present--circumstances \nwhich typically are found in drug trafficking cases: the presence of \ndrugs or drug residue; a positive alert by a properly\n\n[[Page S12224]]\n\ntrained dog; packaging of the money in a suspicious and highly unusual \nmanner; false statements made to the police; previous drug trafficking \nconvictions.\n  Let me take just a moment, Mr. President, to answer those critics who \ndiscount the positive alert by a properly trained dog. These critics \nsay that so much of our currency is tainted with drug residue that a \npositive dog alert is meaningless. Yet these critics fail to take into \naccount the scientific evidence that shows that the drug dogs are NOT \nalerting to the presence of cocaine--which may or may not contaminate a \nlarge fraction of all U.S. currency. Instead, the scientific evidence \nshows that the dogs are alerting to methyl benzoate, a highly volatile \nchemical by-product of the cocaine manufacturing process that remains \non the currency only for a short period of time. The bottom line is \nthat the dogs are alerting only to money that has recently, or just \nbefore packaging, been in close proximity to a significant amount of \ncocaine. This research explains why these dogs do not routinely alert \nto currency.\n  To repeat: These clearly defined circumstances in my bill are \nsafeguards to protect the innocent. More important, my bill establishes \nonly a presumption that the money is drug money. Individuals have every \nopportunity to rebut the government's claim and get their money back. \nCriminals, however, will no longer be able to play dumb and recover \ntheir drug money without having to provide an explanation of where that \nmoney came from.\n  To those critics who maintain that my bill violates the rights of \ninnocent citizens, let me say loud and clear: My bill takes effect only \nAFTER a determination has been made that the money in question is from \nan illegal source. This is how the process works.\n  A police officer or federal agent assigned to an airport task force \nseizes the money of a traveler based on ``probable cause.'' The \ntraveler, for example, has exhibited suspicious, counter-surveillance \nbehavior, such as signaling to seemingly unrelated travelers who, in \nfact, are traveling with him. He has concealed a large quantity of \nmoney in his carry-on bag along with odor-disguising items like fabric \nsoftener sheets to throw off the drug dog. He produces a fake ID and \noffers a false explanation for the money. Someone whose name he doesn't \nremember packed the bag, and he had no idea there was any money in it.\n  Let me repeat: There must be probable cause for the government to \nseize the money. Once the money is seized, notice of the seizure must \nbe published in the newspaper on three successive weeks and direct \nnotice must be given, in writing, to the person from whom the money was \nseized as well as to any other person known to have a potential legal \ninterest. The notice explains the procedure for filing a claim to the \nmoney. In 85 percent of all federal cases, no one files a claim. To my \ncritics, let me repeat: In 85 percent of the cases, the individual \nnever contests the seizure.\n  If an individual does file a claim, the agency which has seized the \nmoney must refer the case to the United States Attorney, who then makes \nan independent determination of the merits of the case. If the U.S. \nAttorney does not believe the government can establish that the money \nwas drug proceeds, the case is rejected and the money is returned. On \nthe other hand, if the U.S. Attorney believes the case has merit, he or \nshe must file a civil forfeiture complaint in federal district court. \nThe claimant is granted a certain number of days to renew his claim and \nfile an answer to the government's complaint.\n  The case is then litigated in the district court. In each and every \ncase, the burden of proof is on the government. In each and every case, \nthe government has the burden of establishing--to the satisfaction of \nthe district court--that there is probable cause to believe that the \nmoney is drug money and therefore subject to forfeiture. Only if the \ngovernment successfully overcomes this hurdle is the case scheduled for \na jury trial where the claimant is required to offer his explanation \nfor the legitimate source of the money. If the jury accepts this \nexplanation, and the government is unable to rebut it with admissible \nevidence, the claimant will prevail and will recover the money. \nOtherwise, the court will enter judgment for the government and order \nthe forfeiture of the money.\n  Mr. President, the federal forfeiture laws are carefully written to \nprovide due process to the innocent and the guilty alike. My bill \nconforms to these high standards while closing a legal loophole that \nbenefits only the guilty. In the court cases which my bill addresses, \nthe cases are dismissed before the claimant ever has to go before a \njury to explain the source of the money. My bill addresses this problem \nby creating a presumption that if certain factors are present, the \nmoney is drug proceeds, and thereby allows the case to move forward to \nthe next stage.\n  To those who have expressed concern with the concept of rebuttable \npresumption, let me emphasize this fact: The presumption does not lead \ninevitably to the forfeiture of the money. Its role is only to force \nthe claimant to come forward with an explanation for a legitimate \nsource of the money. Therefore, my bill in no way infringes upon a \nproperty owner's rights under law.\n  To those who have expressed concern over the possible impact of my \nbill, let me cite these facts. In fiscal year 1995--a time period prior \nto most of the court decisions which have limited the use of drug asset \nseizures--the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service made 35,000 seizures of \nforfeitable property. Of the 35,000 cases, more than 85 percent were \nuncontested. Of the 5,250 contested cases, the U.S. Attorney declined \nto prosecute 3,057. Of the 2,193 complaints filed, the government lost \nin only 48 cases. These statistics are similar for the prior three \nyears. There is therefore little evidence of actual abuses of drug \nasset forfeitures in the past, and there is even less likelihood of \nsuch abuses under the enhanced safeguards in my proposal.\n  In closing, let me state once again: The Drug Currency Forfeitures \nAct goes after drug money only. Drug trafficking is a business, and \ndrug traffickers are in this business for one reason--money. Their \nmulti-billion-dollar war chests allow drug lords to have some of the \nworld's most sophisticated airplanes, boats, and communications \nequipment. Because of their war chests, drug cartels possess weapons in \nquantities that rival the capabilities of some legitimate governments. \nIf we want to make our streets safer, if we hope to make our children's \nlives drug-free, it is not enough just to apprehend the drug \ntrafficker. Throw the drug kingpin in jail, and he continues his drug \noperations from behind prison walls. As evidence, just look at the \nleaders of the most powerful international organized crime group in \nhistory--Colombia's notorious Cali cartel. Even now, the Rodriguez-\nOrejuela brothers are able to run their drug trafficking business from \nprison through the use of private quarters and telephones.\n  Critics of my proposal talk about the need to protect innocent \nvictims. If we want to talk about innocent victims, look at the \nchildren who are being sold drugs at increasingly younger ages. Mr. \nPresident, I'm proud to be the sponsor of the Drug Currency Forfeitures \nAct. It hits the drug cartels where it hurts the most--their wallets. \nThe ability of law enforcement to confiscate drug money hinges on the \ngovernment's ability to prove that the money is drug proceeds, and not \nthe proceeds of some other form of unlawful activity.\n  My bill is endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, and the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association. The Drug Currency Forfeitures Act closes a legal \nloophole that benefits only the guilty. At the same time, it upholds \nthe Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which protects the innocent \nagainst unlawful searches and seizures. I worked very closely with the \nDepartment of Justice in crafting this legislation. It is a positive--\nand needed--step forward, and at the appropriate time I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12223-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12224-S12226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SENATE QUARTERLY MAIL COSTS--THIRD QUARTER\n\n Mr. WARNER.

  VET CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Readjustment Counseling \nService (RCS) within the Department of Veterans Affairs recently named \nfive Vet Centers--from 206 across the country--as ``Vet Centers of \nExcellence.'' I note with great pride that the Morgantown Vet Center, \nin my State of West Virginia, was one of the Vet Centers selected for \nthis distinguished award.\n  RCS Vet Centers, mandated by Congress in 1979, are community-based \nservice centers staffed by highly qualified professionals. Vet Center \nservices include individual and group counseling, family/marital \ncounseling, sexual trauma counseling, substance abuse counseling, \nvocational and employment assistance, VA claims and benefits \ninformation, help for the homeless, and social service and health care \nreferrals. They provide readjustment counseling to combat veterans and \ntheir families--veterans who served during Vietnam, Korea, and World \nWar II--as well as veterans involved in combat hostilities in Panama, \nGrenada, Lebanon, Somalia, and the Persian Gulf.\n  Mr. President, many veterans suffer from psychological injuries as a \nresult of their service in the Armed Forces, especially service in \ncombat. But unlike those injuries that can be bandaged, sewn, or cast, \npsychological battle wounds are typically unseen and left untreated. \nMany veterans struggle for years to find peace within themselves, often \nturning to VA for help years after they've come home from war.\n  So, the work being done at our Vet Centers is enormously important. \nAnd Vet Center services become even more vital when they are the only \nVA presence for hundreds of miles, as is the case in some parts of the \ncountry.\n  The criteria used in selecting the ``Vet Centers of Excellence'' \nincluded quality of clinical care, administrative management, outreach \nto high-risk veteran populations, and cost effectiveness.\n  I am truly delighted that the Morgantown Vet Center has been \nrecognized among those which best represent the spirit and mission of \nRCS. The Morgantown Vet Center catchment area is mostly rural, with a \nwidely dispersed population covering 16 counties in North Central West \nVirginia and two counties in Pennsylvania. Since opening its doors in \n1982, it has provided service to over 7,000 veterans. To the Morgantown \nVet Center staff--Johnny Bragg, Melody Johns, Ronald Jones, and Sandra \nCalvert--I say thank you for a job well done, and for always going \nabove and beyond what is required in your positions. I am very proud of \nyou.\n  In addition, I congratulate the staff of the other Vet Centers \nselected as ``Vet Centers of Excellence''--Vista, California; Tucson, \nArizona; Atlanta, Georgia; and White River Junction, Vermont.\n  But I also want to note my appreciation for the other Vet Centers in \nWest Virginia, and those others around the country. All provide a vital \nservice--in many cases, literally a lifeline to troubled vets. I am \nreminded of the many times my Senate staffers have contacted a Vet \nCenter employee somewhere in the country after hearing from a veteran \nin crisis--or a family member--and been able to secure the help needed \nto avert an emergency. And I am reminded of the number of veterans and \nfamily members in my State of West Virginia who tell me how positively \ntheir lives have changed after contact with a Vet Center.\n  So, to all 206 Vet Centers and the dedicated staff who work there--\nyour good deeds have not gone unnoticed. Keep up the good work. Our \nNation's combat veterans are lucky to have you, and I am enormously \nproud of what you have been able to accomplish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12227-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12227-S12228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RICHARD K. BOYD\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDick Boyd, who will retire at the end of October after 32 years of \nservice to the Westvaco Corporation. For over thirty years, Dick has \nhelped establish Westvaco and the Fine Papers mill into fixtures of \nWickliffe, Kentucky. Though not originally from Kentucky, Dick became a \nvalued member of the Wickliffe community, raised his family there and \ncontinues to have close ties to Kentucky.\n  In 1966, Dick joined Westvaco as the Assistant Public Relations \nManager at the Fine Papers Division in Luke, Maryland. The next year, \nWestvaco announced that Wickliffe, Kentucky would be the site of a new \n$80 million mill. It was while assisting in the public relations \ndetails of this announcement that Dick began his long association with \nthe community of Wickliffe. Later that year, Dick, his wife Malinda and \ntheir two daughters moved to Wickliffe. Dick became Public Relations \nManager for Fine Papers in 1970.\n  Dick held that job until 1988. During that time, he played an \nintegral role as the Fine Papers mill became the bedrock of the \nWickliffe community. After a brief stint during 1988 in the Kentucky \nState Government as Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet for Economic \nDevelopment, Dick returned to Westvaco as Regional Public Affairs \nManager, a position he held until 1991. At that time he moved to \nWashington to become Westvaco's Director of Public Affairs, a position \nhe continues to hold today.\n  Since the 1966 announcement that the plant would be built in Western \nKentucky, Westvaco has spent more than half a billion dollars to create \na state-of-the-art papermaking facility in Wickliffe. Today, Westvaco \nemploys over 750 men and women in Kentucky, and makes an annual \ncontribution of $134 million to the local economy. The growth of the \nmill and the company's great relationship with the community are a \nlegacy of Dick's career at Westvaco and his 24 years in Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, I have worked closely with Dick on several issues of \ngreat importance to both Westvaco and my constituents in the Wickliffe \narea. His hard work and dedication have allowed Westvaco to become an \nimportant part of the Wickliffe community. I have enjoyed working with \nhim, thank him for all his efforts on behalf of Westvaco\n\n[[Page S12228]]\n\nand the people of the Wickliffe community, and wish him the best \nwherever his future endeavors may take him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12227-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          65TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UKRAINIAN FAMINE OF 1932-33\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor \nS.Con.Res. 122, introduced by my distinguished colleague, Senator \nLevin, commemorating the 65th anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine of \n1932-33. It is timely once again for us to join together to call the \nworld's attention to this cold act of mass murder, to remember its \nvictims, and to pledge ourselves to prevent hunger from being used as a \nweapon of genocide. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nresolution.\n  The Ukrainian Famine ranks among the most devastating human tragedies \nof all time, with an estimated loss of life exceeding 7 million men, \nwomen and children. Millions of Ukrainians died not from natural \ncauses, but from policies designed to eradicate Ukraine's cultural and \npolitical identity and to punish the Ukrainian people for resisting the \nforced collectivization of agriculture. As such, the Famine is a \ndramatic testament to the brutality of the imperial Soviet system, \nresponsible for the destruction of tens of millions of lives over the \ncourse of its 70-year existence.\n  The Ukrainian Famine was a crime of epic proportions. In the 1980's \nthe U.S. Commission on the Ukraine Famine painstakingly documented \nevery aspect of this genocide, collecting an impressive body of \nmaterial documenting the tragedy inflicted upon Ukrainians by their \nSoviet masters. Members of the Famine Commission from this body and \nfrom the House of Representatives held hearings around the country in \nwhich elderly eyewitnesses recounted the consequences of Stalin's \ngenocidal policies in starkly human terms, giving poignant and often \ngruesome accounts of the horrors they, their families, friends and \nfellow countrymen faced. The Famine Commission's final report to \nCongress confirmed the man-made nature of the Famine, specifically, the \ncomplicity of Joseph Stalin and those around him in its conception and \nexecution.\n  Clearly, the Ukrainian Famine occurred within the context of a Soviet \nsystem which denied and vigorously opposed democratic values, the rule \nof law, and any respect for elementary human rights. Now that Ukraine \nis free from foreign domination and is moving towards full respect for \nhuman rights, democratic values and the rule of law, the likelihood of \na similar catastrophe, at the present time, appears remote.\n  Nevertheless, I strongly agree with the resolution's assertion that \nit is essential that the United States continue to assist Ukraine as it \nproceeds towards democracy, a free-market economy, and full respect for \nhuman rights. It is imperative for America and for the West to support \nindependence and democracy in Ukraine to ensure that Ukraine never \nagain experiences domination by a foreign power hostile to Ukraine's \nvery identity as a people and as a nation.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I once again urge my colleagues to join \ntogether in support of this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12228-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH ``BETTIE'' MOHART FOR HER SERVICE TO THE UNITED \n                             STATES SENATE\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nElizabeth ``Bettie'' Mohart for her outstanding service to the United \nStates Senate. Bettie was the Chief Clerk on the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business, of which I am Chair. In the three and a half years that \nshe was with the Committee, she helped to make it run smoothly and \nefficiently.\n  When Sam Rayburn said ``you cannot be a leader, and ask other people \nto follow you, unless you know how to follow too,'' he could have been \ntalking about Bettie Mohart. She started her service in 1969 with \nSenator Stuart Symington as a Staff Assistant, and then went to work \nfor Senator Robert Byrd as a Staff Assistant in 1972. In 1974, Bettie \nleft the Senate to pursue other endeavors, only to return in 1985 to \nwork for Senator Jack Danforth. She was hired as a Staff Assistant for \nSenator Danforth's personal office and was later moved to the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, when he became Chair. He then asked Bettie to \nreturn to his personal office, as Office Manager, where she stayed \nuntil his retirement. In 1994, I was fortunate enough to be able to \nhire her for the Committee on Small Business where she remained until \nher departure.\n  By the time Bettie came to work for me she had worked in just about \nevery capacity, in the Senate, with the exception of Chief of Staff and \nSenator, which no doubt she could have handled. This experience made \nher, not only an asset to my Committee, but it also gave her the wisdom \nto manage the Small Business Committee office with a just hand. I thank \nBettie for her many years of service to myself and to the United States \nSenate, and wish her the best of luck in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12228-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12228-S12229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN RECOGNITION OF THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WEST VIRGINIA COALITION \n            AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CENTRAL SERVICE OFFICE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nrise today to share my warmest congratulations to the West Virginia \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence Central Service Office on its 10th \nAnniversary celebration. Through its around the clock support, \neducational outreach and a network of safe shelters, the WVCADV Central \nService Office providers mothers and children with the information and \nresources necessary to produce ``Peacemaking Partnerships''--statewide \ncooperation to eliminate domestic violence.\n  Offering support on a 24-hour basis with an exceptionally educated \nfull time staff, corps of volunteers and Americorps workers, the WVCADV \nhas been able to help prevent, and in many cases help heal the scar of \ndomestic violence in the state of West Virginia. Such commitment is \nessential in the campaign to stop domestic violence which has grown in \nstaggering proportions. Statistics reflect that a woman is assaulted by \nher husband or intimate partner every fifteen seconds in the United \nStates. Without effective mechanisms for intervention, this number will \nonly continue to grow.\n  The WVCADV plays a vital role in encouraging victims of domestic \nviolence to come forward and tell their stories. Through community \neducation, seminars and conferences designed to broaden public \nawareness of warning signs and other violence-related issues, the \nWVCADV is changing the past protocol of `looking the other way' into \nempowerment, response and prevention.\n  Through the myriad of support services WVCADV has made available, the \nnetwork of thirteen safe shelters in West Virginia provide a place for \nwomen and children as they begin the process of leaving violence-filled \nhomes. With nearly seventy-five percent of fatal attacks occurring \nafter separation, such safe shelters are essential to protect women and \nchildren from their abusers. These shelters not only provide a secure, \nstable environments with educational programs, but also offer direct \ncontacts with legal advocates and law enforcement to ensure the safety \nof these women and children after they leave.\n  Furthermore, through their collaboration with advocates and policy \nmakers, the WVCADV fosters legislation which is essential to counter \ndomestic violence--setting up mechanisms not only to protect abuse \nvictims but also to increase and provide accountability for abusive \nbehavior. In 1994, I proudly cosponsored the Violence Against Women \nAct, the first comprehensive piece of Federal legislation to address \nthis important issue. I will continue to work with my collegues in \nCongress and with the staff of the WVCADV to ensure that the most \nvulnerable families get the support that they need to remain safe, \nstable and free of violence.\n  Throughout the month of October, the WVCADV will hold events \nthroughout the State to celebrate the progress they have made in \nfighting domestic violence. On November 6th a statewide event titled \n``In Celebration of Peacemaking Partnerships: Looking Back and Moving \nAhead'' will demonstrate the 10 years of success and goals. I cannot \nthink of a more fitting title for this anniversary celebration which \nrecognizes the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence \nCentral\n\n[[Page S12229]]\n\nService Office's leadership in forging model partnerships throughout \nWest Virginia and across the nation.\n  Again, Mr. President, I want to express my sincerest congratulations \nto the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence Central \nService Office for the work it has done and for all that it will \ncontinue to do in the future. Also, I would like to express my \nappreciation for all the WVCADV staff and volunteers. Such commitment \nand dedication that always inspires me in the work that I do on behalf \nof West Virginia children and families.

I am a co-sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  The Auto Choice Act proposes the development of a ``no fault \ncompensation system'' to provide an option to drivers who do not want \nto pay for services they do not want and will not use. This legislation \nwould allow for the recovery of economic losses, but not for the \nrecovery of non-economic damages like pain and suffering. Those who \nchoose to stay insured under the tort system would retain the right to \nsue and be sued for economic and non-economic losses, while those who \nchoose the ``no fault'' system would be able to sue or be sued for \neconomic damages only. And that is what the Auto Choice Act is really \nabout, Mr. President. Choice for the driving public.\n  All drivers are currently insured through a system that requires them \nto pay for insurance on the assumption that if they are involved in an \naccident then they will sue or be sued for more than economic damages. \nThe majority of drivers are never involved in a suit for pain and \nsuffering, yet they pay for this coverage every single month.\n  Between 1987 and 1994 the cost of automobile insurance increased by \n44%. This extraordinary increase was due in large part to excessive \nclaims made by accident victims for pain and suffering, that is, for \ncompensation beyond the costs of automobile damages and medical bills. \nFor every $1 in actual economic loss generated by this system, $3 are \npaid out for non-economic damages. Rampant abuse of the insurance \nindustry attempts to turn people's misfortune into a sweepstakes.\n  This sweepstakes is particularly beneficial for attorneys who collect \n40 cents of every dollar paid for bodily injury. Twenty-eight cents \nfrom every premium dollar goes to attorneys. According to the Joint \nEconomic Committee, lawyers earn between $15 and $17 billion a year \nunder the current tort system and lawyers on both sides of a dispute \nmake almost two times the amount of money that injured parties receive \nfor actual economic loss. This is abuse of a system that exists to \nprotect people from the genuine financial costs of misfortune and \ntragedy.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that such excessive \nlegal and medical claims, combined with outright fraudulent claims, \nhave added $200 in unnecessary premiums for every household in America. \nThat's a $200 increase for every family--regardless of what type of \ncoverage that family may want. That's $200 that will not be spent on \ngroceries, clothing for children, or tucked away into savings for \neducation.\n  This system becomes more inequitable when the burden on low-income \nand urban drivers is considered. These drivers pay a disproportionate \namount of their income for auto insurance. In my home state of Colorado \nwe have the 14th highest insurance rates in the nation. The effects of \nthe high cost of driving in Colorado are particularly noticeable along \nthe more densely populated front range. Last week Denver Mayor \nWellington Webb testified before the Senate Commerce Committee \nconcerning the effects of high premium costs on a large urban \npopulation. Mayor Webb testified that not only do the urban poor pay a \npremium disproportionate to their income, but high premium costs can \nalso deter drivers from purchasing insurance at all. Dr. Robert Lee \nMaril testified to the disproportionate cost of insurance stating that \nnationally households spend 2% of their annual income on automobile \ninsurance. The upper 50% of people living below the poverty line, \nhowever, spend a staggering 14% of their income on automobile \ninsurance.\n  Mayor Webb also testified that this is not just an issue for the \npoor. Middle-income families spend on average 150% more on auto \ninsurance than they do on education, and in the City of Denver alone \nresidents would see their premiums reduced by as much as 40%.\n  In July the Joint Economic Committee released a report that \ndemonstrates the benefits of Auto Choice for businesses. In addition to \nthe relief this bill provides for individual drivers, the JEC reports \nthat nearly 40% of all tort cases against businesses are auto-related. \nThe incentives that drive the tort system increase the cost of doing \nbusiness. In 1994 businesses spent $21 billion on auto liability \ninsurance. Just as families are forced to spend money on high premiums \nthat could be better spent on food or education, businesses are forced \nto dedicate resources to liability insurance instead of payroll and \ncapital investments. The JEC report concluded that the Auto Choice Act \nwould result in an average 27% savings on commercial auto insurance, \npotentially saving American businesses $41 billion over five years.\n  The Insurance Commissioner from my state of Colorado has endorsed \nthis legislation, however, I realize that in spite of the expected \nbenefits of this legislation, some states prefer their current system. \nTherefore, this bill provides a choice for the individual states. Under \nthis legislation, state legislatures are able to opt-out of Auto Choice \nfor any reason. Furthermore, the bill clearly states that it will not \npreclude a State or State Official from fully exercising their \nregulatory authority concerning policy rates, consumer protection or \ncarrying out the requirements of this act. The Auto Choice Reform Act \nwill leave the ultimate regulation of auto insurance to the states.\n  The implementation of The Auto Choice Act would cause the average \ninsurance policy to decrease by $243 annually, saving drivers an \nestimated $45 billion nationwide. By providing greater choice to the \ndriving public, without cost to the government, the driving public \nwould save $246 billion over five years. That's an enormous savings for \nsimply providing an option to the consumer. This is a bill about \nchoice, it is a bill about savings, and it is a bill about equitable \ncompensation for the American driver.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12229-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12229-S12230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NIH EARMARKS\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to speak today about a \nmatter which concerns me greatly--the process by which funds are \nallocated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n  The National Institutes of Health is one of the finest institutions \nof medical research in the World. A commitment to providing the best \npossible health care has driven the NIH's recruitment of preeminent \nphysicians and medical researchers across the breadth of the medical \ndisciplines.\n  Having created such an impressive resource, it is disheartening that \nCongress, through legislative earmarks and other mandates, often \nundertakes to second-guess the considered opinions of these experts.\n  The practice of earmarking disease-specific funds results mainly from \nlobbying pressure directed to Senators or our staffs. As a result of \nthis pressure, Senator's introduce language which sets aside sums of \nmoney--often very large sums of money--to be used exclusively for one \nspecific disease.\n  In September of last year, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill, which \ncontained a provision for an in-depth study to examine the priority \nsetting process at NIH. The amendment which incorporated this study was \noriginally sponsored by myself and Senator Frist, and directed the \nInstitute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct this study with utmost priority.\n  The intent of this research was to understand how priorities \nregarding specific research programs are determined, how levels of \nfunding for these research programs are established, and how new \norganizational entities within the NIH are created.\n\n[[Page S12230]]\n\n  This study grew out of Senator Frist and my concerns that Congress \nwas unduly influencing the process by which priorities are set at NIH \nthrough the practice of the earmarking of funds for disease-specific \nresearch. We were concerned that the priority setting process at NIH \nwas becoming less science-based and more politically drive. It was \nclear that our concern was shared by the majority of the Senate, as \nthey voted to include this amendment in the appropriations bill.\n  In July of this year, IOM completed its work and reported its \nfindings to Congress. The study cited the need for greater public \ninvolvement, specifically, and I quote, ``The director of NIH should \nestablish and appropriately staff a Director's Council of Public \nRepresentatives, to facilitate interactions between NIH and the general \npublic'' and that, ``* * * public membership of NIH policy and program \nadvisory groups should be selected to represent a broad range of public \nconstituencies.'' unquote. It is interesting to note that both these \nrecommendations focus public input directly to NIH, rather than to \nCongress.\n  This is very much in line with another recommendation; quote, ``The \nU.S. Congress should use its authority to mandate specific research \nprograms, establish level of funding for them, and implement new \norganizational entities only when other approaches have proven \ninadequate.'' unquote.\n  The findings of this study are clear. For the purpose of priority-\nsetting, public input-including organized input via lobbying efforts--\nare most appropriately directed to NIH, where it can be evaluated by \nappropriate science-based criteria. Only when there is evidence that \nNIH is unable or unwilling to apply this input appropriately to their \npriority-setting process and criteria, should Congress influence the \nprocess through legislative mandates. It is my contention that if the \nlitmus test were applied to all earmarks, most would be stripped from \nlegislation.\n  The message is clear: Congress should avoid the practice of \nearmarking within NIH appropriations. The findings of the research \nconducted by the independent and impartial experts clearly indicates \nthat the concern regarding the pricess of priority setting at NIH was \nwarranted.\n  As the Senate considers the future appropriations and authorization \nlegislation for NIH, I would urge my colleagues to consider, with a \ncritical eye, any disease-specific earmarks. I would urge my colleagues \nto ask themselves whether there is evidence that NIH has somehow failed \nto appropriately consider and apply science-based priority-setting \ncriteria. In the absence of such evidence, I would urge my colleagues \nto not impose earmerks or other legislative mandates on the \nNIH.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12229-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH PINGA\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to the late Joseph Pinga, a community leader \nwho passed away on September 1st, in West Warwick, Rhode Island. Mr. \nPinga was best known for his community giving and his vigilance that \nhelped to reform the West Warwick town government.\n  Mr. Pinga served honorably in the U.S. Navy and worked to establish \nhis business, Westcott Baking Company, of which he was the owner and \noperator for over forty years. In this capacity, Mr. Pinga was regarded \nnot only as a local pioneer, but also as a defender of rights for small \nbusiness owners. In fact, in 1978, Time Magazine recognized Joe's \nperseverance in an article about his struggle with the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration.\n  Joseph Pinga certainly was a believer in community involvement. \nNumerous charitable organizations could always count on Mr. Pinga's \ngenerosity without ever requesting any public acknowledgement. In \naddition, Joe ran for mayor of West Warwick in 1990 and was a member of \nthe local Elks Lodge.\n  Mr. President, I join with all Rhode Islanders in extending to Mr. \nPinga's family our sympathy and best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12230-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING WALTER SELLERS\n\n Mr. DeWINE.

For 32 years, he was a member of the Kiwanis \nClub in Xenia, Ohio. In 1990, he was elected to the Kiwanis \nInternational Board of Trustees. he served as Vice President and \nTreasurer before becoming President.\n  All Ohioans are proud of Mr. Sellers' outstanding stewardship of one \nof the largest service clubs in the world. But we also know that his \nservice to our community extends beyond his work with the Kiwanis \norganization. He has served as President of the Xenia Board of \nEducation and President of the Ohio School Boards Association.

We are all \nextremely grateful for his efforts and I ask my colleagues to join me \nin wishing him all the best in his next endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12230-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12230-S12231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE FUTURE OF FAMILY FARMING AND RANCHING\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I rise to express--in very \nstark terms--my deep and increasing concern for the future of family \nfarming and ranching in this country. The truth is, our country's \nfamily farmers and ranchers are under increasing economic pressure from \nconcentration in agriculture--concentration in meatpacking, \nconcentration in food-retailing, concentration in rail and other forms \nof transportation, concentration in banking, concentration in the \ngrain-trading companies, and concentration in production itself.\n  The strands of these varied concentrations are tightening around the \nthroats of family farmers and ranchers, threatening not only the \nfarmers and ranchers themselves, but also their families, the small-\ntown businesses that depend on them, their schools, their churches, and \nthe very social fabric that makes rural America such a special and \nwonderful place to live--the reasons why we should do whatever we can \nto preserve and promote our system of family farming and ranching.\n  But there is more at stake here than just our farmers and ranchers \nand their families, critically important as they are. What's also at \nstake is the very system that produces our food, that gives us life. \nStudy after study shows that family agriculture is the most efficient \nway, the most environmentally safe way, to produce our food. And that \nis another reason why we should do whatever we can to preserve and \npromote our system of family farming and ranching.\n  But, frankly, there is a troubling movement in our country toward the \ncorporatization of family agriculture. Look at the pork industry--it \nhas become increasingly dominated by giant corporate hog factories, a \nfact which has gone hand-in-glove with lower and lower prices for hogs, \nto the point that many family pork producers can't make a living at it \nanymore, and have simply given up.\n  A case in point is the state of North Carolina, which has seen the \nbiggest influx of corporate hog factories in the United States. In \n1984, there were 24,000 hog farmers in that state, just before the \ngrowth of hog factories skyrocketed. Now, there are 7,000 hog farmers \nin North Carolina, almost all of them working on contract, little more \nthan hired hands working for outside corporate investors. However, at \nthe same time that independent family hog producers have almost \ndisappeared in North Carolina, the number of hogs produced there has \ntripled, thus leading to enormous environmental problems--fish kills \nnumbering in the tens of millions, rapidly rising nitrates in \ngroundwater used for drinking, increasing levels in airborne ammonia, \nstench that makes the eyes water, and a corresponding and unsurprising \ndrop in tourism. The North Carolina experiment has clearly not worked.\n  What has happened in North Carolina, and what is happening in many \nother states, is nothing less than a human tragedy. My ancestors, and \nthe ancestors of many people here today, left Europe to escape the \nfeudal system of agriculture, a system of inequality and unfairness \nwhere a baron controlled the land and the peasants worked for him as \nlittle better than slaves.\n\n[[Page S12231]]\n\n  I do not want to return to a ``new feudalism'' in which the baron is \nreplaced by out-of-state corporate investors, nor do I believe that the \npeople of my state desire to do so, either. It is for that reason that \nI have opposed the concentration in agriculture at all levels, because \nit ultimately is fair to neither food producers nor food consumers.\n  And it is also the reason that I plan to vote for ``Amendment E,'' an \ninitiated measure that will appear on the November 3rd, 1998 South \nDakota general election ballot. This measure corresponds very closely \nto a similar measure in Nebraska, which has been deemed constitutional \nby the United States Supreme Court, and has allowed Nebraska to \nmaintain both market share and number of producers much better than its \nneighboring states, including South Dakota. I'm not telling any South \nDakotan how to vote on this or any other issue, but I do want to add my \nvoice to those who believe the move toward the corporatization of our \nfamily farming system has gone too far. We have far too much at stake \nto simply sit silently by while the best food producing system ever \ndevised by humankind is allowed to die a slow and painful \ndeath.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12230-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12231-S12233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE VA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND DR. KENNETH W. KIZER\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks \nconcerning the VA health care system, a system that is currently \nundergoing dramatic changes and reorganization. I would note that these \nchanges, in turn, to include managerial reforms, facility \nconsolidations, and reallocation of resources, all initiated by the \nUnder Secretary for Health, Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer M.D., M.P.H., are \nhaving a dramatic impact on when, where, and how VA is providing for \nour veterans, many of whom are in my home state of Alabama.\n  The private health care sector is likewise undergoing massive \nmanagerial and resource changes. We saw evidence earlier this week of \nthe erosion in care for elderly Americans, for instance, when a number \nof HMO's decided not to participate any further in Medicare+Choice. \nOver at the VA, using managed care models, Dr. Kizer also shifted \ninpatient care to outpatient care and heightened the focus of primary \ncare at the expense of specialty care and specialized services. So \nelderly veterans, and those in speciality care programs around the \ncountry, are under the same stresses as their civilian neighbors.\n  Dr. Kizer apparently likes decentralized decision making, and I \ncannot say that I necessarily disagree with that style. It can be very \neffective at times and in certain organizations. He has given local VA \nmanagers incentives and authority to design and run their own health \ncare operations independent of VA's National Headquarters. In many \nrespects these reforms have been beneficial, even bold I am told, \nparticularly at a time when the VA budget is under severe stress.\n  However, I expressed my personal concern to Dr. Kizer in a phone call \nearlier this week that there is one area where I believe \ndecentralization and certainly the shifting of resources is having a \nvery negative effect on one of the VA's core missions, and that is, the \nprovision of specialized services for veterans with spinal cord injury \nand dysfunction.\n  Mr. President, the Congress mandated in P.L. 104-262 that the VA \nwould maintain its capacity to provide specialized services, such as \ncare given in VA's 23 Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) centers. Many have \nwondered, and rightly so I believe, that budget pressures, \nreorganization and decentralization of management have created the \nincentive for local managers to downgrade these expensive specialized \nprograms, generally shifting resources and staff out of one area to \nmake up for shortfalls in others areas. Costs are thereby reduced at \nthe expense of the care for the veterans who need it the most.\n  Specialized programs, including blind rehabilitation, amputation \ncare, specialized health programs, as well as spinal cord injury care, \nare core disciplines of the VA health care system. They, least of all, \nshould be subject to re-engineering until all aspects of that care have \nbeen analyzed from a headquarters perspective. I don't think allowing \nnumerous mangers to make that kind of decision is in the national \ninterest or in the interest of our veterans.\n  Former Senator Alan Simpson from Wyoming, then Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, presided over the passage of the \nlegislation protecting specialized services. Addressing this particular \nprovision, he said: ``VA is required to maintain special programs (such \nas treatment of spinal cord dysfunction, blind rehabilitation, \namputation and mental illness) at least at the current level. On a per \ncapita basis, these services are expensive to provide and it is not the \nintent of the Committee to allow VA to reduce them in order to pay for \nother kinds of routine care.''\n  Mr. President, I am afraid what Senator Simpson and the Congress \nfeared could happen to specialized programs in general and spinal cord \ninjury programs specifically under VA's current reorganization \ninitiatives is, in fact, happening.\n  Nearly a month ago, I had a visit from Mr. Aubrey L. Crockett, the \nPresident of the Mid-South Chapter of Paralyzed Veterans of America. \nAubrey represents the health care interests of 1830 spinal cord \ndysfunctional veterans in Alabama. As he sat confined to his wheel \nchair, he raised serious concerns that the VA was not maintaining the \nquality and quantity of its specialized health care services for the \nover 120,000 veterans nationwide with spinal cord dysfunction.\n  Last month, Gordon Mansfield, the National Executive Director of the \nParalyzed Veterans of America addressed the same subject from a \nnational perspective during hearings on the Hill. PVA's leadership has \nexpressed its concerns to me as well. Over 75 percent of their \nmembership, a larger percentage than any other veterans service \norganization, rely on the VA for all or part of their specialized \nhealth care needs. For these individuals with chronic and catastrophic \ndisabilities, any erosion in the care they require can be life \nthreatening. Aubrey indicated that something as simple as a pad for a \nwheel chair can make a big difference for a veteran.\n  I have come to believe that PVA's concerns need to be addressed. I \nfurther believe that any erosion in staffing, bed availability or the \nquality of care at our nations VA Spinal Cord Injury Centers cannot \nstand without a review of the underlying reasons, and that the VA must \ndirect the resources to fix the problems in order to comply with the \nintent of Congress as mandated in the statutes.\n  In an era of tight budgets, local hospital administrators and \nmanagers don't see these programs, such as the Spinal Cord Injury \nprograms, as being ``National Programs.'' Ignoring the national \nmandates, local managers acting under Dr. Kizer's administrative \ndecentralization guidelines have been left to do whatever they felt was \nwarranted. We may disagree on the numbers of reported beds and staff in \nSCI centers, but even GAO has criticized the inaccuracy of VA data \ncollection efforts. So, it should not be surprising that a number of \nSenators have questioned VA's procedures and policies as applied to \nmanaging its specialized programs. Paralyzed veterans, I think, are the \nonly true judges of the state of the health care they receive. They are \nthe reason the VA health care system exists. If paralyzed veterans have \na concern then the Congress must listen, and more importantly, if \nwarranted we must act on their behalf.\n  On September 29, 1998, I wrote to my colleague from Pennsylvania \nVeterans Committee Chairman Arlen Specter expressing my concerns in \nthis matter. I indicated that ``I will consider placing a hold on the \nre-nomination'' of Dr. Kenneth Kizer, ``until my concern regarding the \nmaintenance of specialized services within the Veterans Health \nAdministration is adequately addressed.''\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Specter, and the Committee \nfor its support in this matter. The Committee met every request I had \nin a timely fashion. Moreover, it helped coordinate a solution \nacceptable to all parties. America's veterans owe Senator Specter a \ndebt of gratitude for his hard work on their behalf.\n  The solution I had in mind when I wrote to Dr. Kizer was to bring the \nreins of control for SCI programs back to the National Headquarters \nlevel and\n\n[[Page S12232]]\n\nin the process elevate the controls over policy and resources and \nrestore a greater degree of national guidance and oversight. In doing \nso, I hoped we would be guaranteeing for some time to come that these \nchanges would meet the needs of our paralyzed veterans and conform to \nthe mandated statutes.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to report that Dr. Kizer has responded to \nmy concerns with a suggested list of administrative and policy changes \nthat would bring additional control over the spinal cord injury \nprogram.\n  I request that my letter to Dr. Kizer dated October 5, 1998, and his \nletter of policy recommendations dated October 8, 1998 be printed in \nthe Record immediately following this statement.\n  I believe I have Dr. Kizer's commitment to a series of positive \nimprovements to our specialized programs. I look forward to seeing the \nfruits of his labor and those of the departments he supervises. \nSimilarly, and with the help of the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I intend to keep a close watch on these policy changes and the \nSpinal Cord Injury Program in particular. I have no intention of \nletting Aubrey or the other 1830 Spinal Cord dysfunctional veterans in \nAlabama down. This body needs to make certain that the VA is \nmaintaining its capacity to provide specialized health care services \nand that it is doing as much as it can to care for all our 26 million \nveterans--all the time. That has always been the intent of Congress and \nI am certain it always will be.\n  The letters follow:\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 1998.\n     Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, M.D.,\n     Special Assistant to the Secretary, Department of Veterans \n       Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Kizer; I am glad we had a brief chance to speak \n     this afternoon. As I told you, I am ready to remove my hold \n     on your re-nomination for the position of Under Secretary for \n     Health once you clarify for me in writing what action(s) you \n     and the Department intend to take to comply with the \n     statutory mandates for the specialized treatment and \n     rehabilitative needs of disabled veterans (including veterans \n     with spinal cord dysfunction, blindness, amputation and \n     mental illness) identified in section 1706, Title 38 U.S.C. \n     and staffing requirements in section 7306 (f), Title 38 \n     U.S.C.\n       VA's massive reorganization efforts coupled with chronic \n     budget pressures have placed great stress on management and \n     patients alike. While many of my colleagues have complimented \n     you on your management initiatives, Alabama's paralyzed \n     veterans are concerned that in the VA's haste to re-engineer \n     itself, managers are shifting vital resources and staff out \n     of specialized programs. I think we would both agree that \n     SCI, blind rehabilitation, amputation care, and special \n     mental health programs are the core of the VA health care \n     system. Alabama veterans over and over again have told me \n     that this type of care cannot be matched anywhere outside VA. \n     Hence, you can well understand why I am interceding on their \n     behalf.\n       In order for me to release my hold on your re-nomination, I \n     would appreciate your response as soon as possible. In \n     addition to my overall compliance concerns, I would \n     appreciate it if you would specifically address the \n     establishment of a centralized operational authority for the \n     SCI program; the resources and authority necessary to run \n     that program office to include such oversight as treatment \n     guidelines, staffing and bed modeling; relationship to local \n     and regional managers, and compliance reporting procedures or \n     other actions the Department deems necessary to comply with \n     this management structure.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                                Jeff Sessions,\n\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Department of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 1998.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: I wanted to follow-up with you in \n     writing to underscore my commitment to maintaining capacity, \n     improving access, and enhancing coordination of care to meet \n     the specialized needs of our most vulnerable veterans. I \n     believe that we do not differ in our views that maintaining \n     the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) specialized \n     programs is of paramount importance.\n       As I have said on several occasions, I believe VHA's \n     programs and services for certain special disability groups \n     are the heart of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) \n     health care program. These special VA programs include those \n     for veterans with spinal cord injury, blindness, traumatic \n     brain injury, amputations, serious mental illness and post \n     traumatic stress disorder. It would be unthinkable for VHA to \n     retreat from its commitment to the specialized needs of \n     veterans who rely on VA for these services. Further, it is my \n     intent to take advantage of opportunities to improve and \n     provide better services, as science and new technologies \n     advance.\n       I share your interest in ensuring that VA is in compliance \n     with current laws related to specialized programs. It is my \n     understanding that the Department currently is in compliance \n     with the law, as outlined below. Additionally, I intend to \n     implement additional measures should I be confirmed for a new \n     4-year term.\n       As required by legislation, the Department has submitted \n     two reports to Congress on maintaining our capacity for these \n     specialized programs--one in May 1997 and one in June 1998. \n     Our reports to Congress document compliance with 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1706, which requires the maintenance of capacity for \n     specialized services. Nationally, the number of veterans \n     treated in the six programs was maintained or increased for \n     all categories but amputation, which declined by 2%. (Of \n     note, this latter statistic is, in fact, a positive finding \n     since it reflects the greater emphasis that has been placed \n     on preserving limbs, and better management of veterans at \n     risk for amputation, which has resulted in fewer amputations \n     per year.) Still, we recognize that VA's data gathering and \n     validation can be improved and that the multiple data sources \n     and different ways of interpreting data have given rise to \n     several issues and concerns related to reporting capacity. In \n     early December 1998, VA will convene a national data summit \n     to review and find solutions to address these issues, and we \n     are inviting to participate in this conference a wide \n     array of stakeholders (e.g., veterans service \n     organizations, Congress, and the Inspector General) who \n     review our data to assess quality and system improvements.\n       I understand that you also are concerned about compliance \n     with 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7306, which addresses the expertise of \n     VHA Headquarters staff in specialized services. VHA \n     Headquarters staff includes highly qualified representation \n     in all specialized programs: Chief Consultant, Mental Health \n     Strategic Healthcare Group; Chief Consultant, Prosthetics and \n     Sensory Aids Strategic Healthcare Group; Clinical Program \n     Manager, Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders Strategic \n     Healthcare Group; and Director, Blind Rehabilitation Service. \n     These individuals have substantive expertise and policy \n     guidance and provide critical oversight of these specialized \n     programs. In response to a wholly separate inquiry from that \n     raised by your concerns, I have been advised that the VA's \n     General Counsel confirmed VHA's compliance with 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7306 in an August 14, 1998, memorandum.\n       Effective management of our specialized programs is a VHA-\n     wide responsibility. VHA has a management structure that \n     physically places personnel in a decentralized manner, as \n     appropriate. In our experience, we have found that we often \n     get better program leadership when individuals remain \n     clinically active. In the case of the Chief Consultant, \n     Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders, Dr. Margaret Hammond, a \n     national SCI expert, serves in this capacity from the Seattle \n     VA Medical Center. Dr. Hammond's efforts have been widely \n     praised, including by many members of the Paralyzed Veterans \n     of America.\n       While VA is in compliance with current law, I believe that \n     some additional measures could be taken to reinforce our \n     ongoing commitment to SCI programs. Accordingly, I intend to \n     take the following steps to strengthen Headquarters' role in \n     these matters, should I be reconfirmed for a full term as \n     Under Secretary for Health.\n       First, decision-making authority for any SCI-related \n     mission changes, construction, staffing, or bed level \n     proposals will be centralized to Headquarters. In the future, \n     before a VISN will be allowed to make changes, it must have \n     the approval of the Under Secretary for Health, following \n     consultation with the Chief Consultant, SCI/D and Chief \n     Officer, Patient Care Services. A directive to all network \n     offices and facilities will be issued to effect this.\n       Second, national guidelines will be developed so that \n     patient referral procedures are uniform across the VA \n     healthcare system and to ensure that complex specialty care \n     is provided at the appropriate site. Additionally, SCI health \n     care Circular M2, Part 24 will be revised and updated. Dr. \n     Margaret Hammond, Chief Consultant, SCI/D, will lead these \n     efforts, which will involve the full range of stakeholders in \n     the process.\n       Third, some weeks ago I directed VHA's Chief Officer, \n     Patient Care Services to contract with an outside consultant \n     to look at capacity and quality of VA care for veterans with \n     spinal cord dysfunction. Until this study has been \n     undertaken, reviewed, and evaluated, the expired directive \n     related to nurse staffing levels for SCI units will be \n     reissued. Additionally, to improve oversight and management, \n     the SCI/D Strategic Healthcare Group staff will be increased. \n     The Chief Network Officer will also be asked to identify a \n     single individual among his Headquarters staff to coordinate \n     local SCI issues with the Chief Consultant SCI/D and the \n     Under Secretary for Health.\n       Finally, SCI operating beds will be removed from the \n     performance measure for bed occupancy that is contained in \n     network directors' performance contracts, or the measure will \n     be dropped altogether. The following performance indicators \n     related to SCI/D are already in place for fiscal year 1999, \n     and the network directors' accountability for these will be \n     closely scrutinized: admission within 24 hours for acute \n     care; an appointment with a specialist in 7 days; and \n     transfer of semi-emergent care to an SCI unit within two \n     weeks.\n\n[[Page S12233]]\n\n       In summary, I believe VA services for SCI are already \n     second to none, but we continue to seek opportunities to \n     improve. Currently, VA cares for veterans with spinal cord \n     dysfunction in 23 SCI centers, 29 SCI support clinics, and \n     120 primary care teams at non-SCI center facilities. With \n     respect to capacity, from fiscal year (FY) 1996 to FY 1997, \n     VA treated 4% more SCI patients and applied 3% more dollars \n     to SCI care, although the number of beds and staff were \n     decreased. A notable improvement in timeliness from FY 1996 \n     to FY 1997 also was achieved for SCI patients. For acute \n     care, meeting the ``timeliness for admission' standard (one \n     day) improved from 41% to 91%, and for routine care meeting \n     the `timeliness of appointments' standard improved from 87% \n     to 100%. It is my intent that the new program enhancements \n     will build upon these measures, resulting in improved \n     clinical outcomes and enhanced quality of care.\n       Again, thank you for sharing your commitment to VA's \n     services for special veteran populations--a commitment with \n     which I fully concur. Please do not hesitate to contact me if \n     you wish to meet or further discuss these matters.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kenneth W. Kizer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12231-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12233-S12236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A PLAN TO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, countless hours will be spent in \nthis country, and even on this Senate floor, debating the issues that \ntoday fill the front pages of our newspapers. Some of the talk \ntitillates, some of it disgusts--and Mr. President, it's clear that \nsome of it requires the very serious attention of this Senate.\n  But the tribulations of public life in America today do not provide \nus sufficient excuses for inaction when it comes to addressing the \ncrises in this country that don't make the front pages, but should. And \nthere can be no excuses for any of us--or for anyone in this country--\nfor our failure to do something to help the 50 million children in our \npublic schools today--children whose reading scores show that of 2.6 \nmillion graduating high school students, one-third are below basic \nreading level, one-third are at basic, only one-third are proficient \nand only 100,000 are at a world class reading level; children who edge \nout only South Africa and Cyprus on international tests in science and \nmath, with 29 percent of all college freshmen requiring remedial \nclasses in basic skills.\n  Mr. President, we know that public education is in trouble--so much \ntrouble that some argue it could implode from the weight and pressure \nof bloated bureaucracy, stagnant administration and inadequate \nclassroom resources.\n  These statistics speak not just of a crisis--they speak of our \ncollective failure to come together and do what it takes to give every \nchild in this country a real chance at success. We are stuck both \nnationally and locally--unable or unwilling to answer the challenge, \ntrapped in a debate that is little more than an echo of old and \nirrelevant positions with promising solutions stymied by ideology and \ninterest groups--both on the right and on the left.\n  Nowhere more than in the venerable United States Senate, where we \npride ourselves on our ability to work together across partisan lines, \nwe have been stuck in a place where Democrats and Republicans seem to \ntalk past each other. Democrats are perceived to be always ready to \nthrow money at the problem but never for sufficient accountability or \ncreativity; Republicans are perceived as always ready to give a voucher \nto go somewhere else but rarely supportive of investing sufficient \nresources to make the public schools work. It's the reason why we spent \nweeks debating a bill this past spring--the major elementary and \nsecondary education legislation of this 105th Congress--that would put \n$7 into the pocket of the average public school student in this \ncountry--and we called that reform.\n  No wonder parents are losing faith in our ability to reform public \neducation. No wonder they're looking elsewhere: in too many of our \ndebates, whichever side wins, on whichever bill, our children continue \nto be the losers. We all need to change that outcome and I respectfully \nsuggest there is a different road we can meet on to make it happen.\n  That is why I will be introducing in the next Senate the kind of \ncomprehensive education reform legislation that I believe will provide \nus a chance to come together not as Democrats and Republicans, but as \nthe true friends of parents, children, teachers, and principals--to \ncome together as citizens--and help our schools reclaim the promise of \npublic education in this country. We need to ask one question: ``What \nprovides our children with the best education?'' And whether the answer \nis conservative, liberal, or simply practical, we need to commit \nourselves to that course.\n  As we being to chart that new course, I would remind this body of a \nconviction shared by all of us: no one in America wants the federal \ngovernment trespassing on a cherished local prerogative. But the \nfederal government can and should leverage resources to schools \neverywhere; it can help teachers, parents, administrators, and \ncommunity leaders take up the work they all agree is so badly needed. \nTo say that there is no federal role in education is to call upon the \nfederal government to abandon 50 million children.\n  I believe this Senate will reject that notion and accept instead \nlegislation to help every school make a new start on their own, an \ninvitation to all parties in the name of saving public education in \nAmerica. My bill will be built on challenge grants for schools to \npursue comprehensive reform and adopt the proven best practices of any \nother school funds to help every school become an accountable charter \nschool within the public school system; the incentives to make choice \nand competition a hallmark of our school systems; and the resources to \nhelp schools fix their crumbling infrastructure, get serious about \ncrime, end social promotion, restore a sense of community to our \nschools, and send children to school ready to learn.\n  My legislation will begin the Voluntary State Reform Incentive Grants \nso school districts that choose to finance and implement comprehensive \nreform based on proven high-performance models can bring forth change. \nWe will target investments at school districts below the national or \nstate median and leverage local dollars through matching grants. This \ncomponent of the legislation will aim to make every public school in \nthis country essentially a charter school within the public school \nsystem--giving them the chance to quickly and easily put in place the \nbest of what works in any other school--private, parochial or public--\nwith decentralized control, site-based management, parental engagement, \nand high levels of volunteerism--while at the same time meeting high \nstandards of student achievement and public accountability. I believe \npublic schools need to have the chance to make changes not tomorrow, \nnot five years from now, not after another study--but now--today.\n  And my legislation will help us restore accountability to public \neducation by injecting choice and competition into a public school \nsystem badly in need of both. We are not a country that believes in \nmonopolies. We are a country that believes diversity raises quality. We \nwouldn't accept one source, one company, one choice of food, or \nclothing or cable television. It is time we end a system that restricts \neach child to an administrator's choice and not a parent's choice where \npossible. It is time we adopt a competitive system of public school \nchoice with grants awarded to schools that meet parents' test of \nquality and assistance to schools that must catch up rapidly. That is \nwhy I'll be proposing that we create an incentive for schools all \nacross the nation to adopt public school choice to the extent \nlogistically feasible.\n\n  So if schools will embrace this new framework--every school a charter \nschool in the public school system, choice, competition, and \naccountability--what then are the key ingredients of their excellence?\n  My legislation will allow our schools to strip away the bureaucracy \nthat stifles creativity and remember that what counts in any public \nschool is how our students fare academically. You don't identify a good \nschool by the number of administrators you hire. In fact, we impose so \nmany rules and regulations on our schools ``from above'' that we forget \nteaching happens ``on the ground''--in a school building, in a \nclassroom. But you won't find accountability there because it's been \nfractured and scattered in hundreds of different offices and titles. We \nneed to restore leadership and accountability and\n\n[[Page S12234]]\n\nput our faith in our principals--holding them accountable for the way \ntheir teachers teach and the way ultimately, their students learn.\n  That means we need to do better in guaranteeing that every one of our \nnation's 80,000 principals have the capacity to lead--the talents and \nthe know-how to do the job; effective leadership skills; the vision to \ncreate an effective team--to recruit, hire, and transfer teachers and \nengage parents. Without those abilities, the title of principal and the \nfreedom to lead means little. I'll be proposing an ``Excellent \nPrincipals Challenge Grant'' which would provide funds to local school \ndistricts to train principals in sound management skills and effective \nclassroom practices. This bill helps our schools make being a principal \nthe great calling of our time.\n  But as we set our sights on recruiting a new generation of effective \nprincipals, we must acknowledge what today's best principals know: \nprincipals can only produce results as good as the teachers with whom \nthey must work. To get the best results, we need the best teachers. And \nwe must act immediately to guarantee that we get the best as the United \nStates hires 2 million new teachers in the next ten years, 60% of them \nin the next five years. I will be offering legislation that empowers \nour states and school districts to find new ways to hire and train \noutstanding teachers: a Teacher Recruitment Incentive Grant, to raise \nteachers' salaries and attract a larger group of qualified people into \nthe teaching profession; a Ongoing Education Grant to provide continued \ntraining for our nation's teachers.\n  This legislation will allow states to reconfigure their certification \npolicies and their teaching standards to address the reality that our \nstandards for teachers are not high enough--and at the same time, they \nare too rigid in setting out irrelevant requirements that don't make \nteaching better; they make it harder for some who choose to teach. We \nknow we need to streamline teacher certification rules in this country \nto recruit the best college graduates to teach in the United States. \nToday we hire almost exclusively education majors to teach, and liberal \narts graduates are only welcomed in our country's top private schools. \nMy legislation will allow states to rewrite the rules so every \nprincipal has the same right as headmasters at private schools--to hire \nliberal arts graduates as teachers and measure their competency; while \nat the same time allowing hundreds of thousands more teachers to \nachieve a more broad based meaningful certification--the National Board \nfor Professional Teaching Standards certification with its rigorous \ntest of subject matter knowledge and teaching ability.\n  My legislation will build a new teacher recruitment system for our \npublic schools--providing college scholarships for our highest \nachieving high school graduates if they agree to come back and teach in \nour public schools.\n  I hope to build support for this legislation around the consensus \nthat we share a common obligation to build a system where every \nprincipal and every teacher in every school can be held accountable. \nEvery parent wants that; every child deserves it. And we should all be \nheld accountable if we are unwilling to make those changes. But I also \nhope to build a consensus in this Senate that recognizes that you can't \nhold someone accountable if they don't have the tools to succeed.\n  I also want to help our schools close the resource gap in public \neducation: helping to fix our crumbling schools with a federal tax \ncredit so that 5,000 school districts can rebuild and modernize their \nbuildings; helping to eliminate the crime that turns too many hallways \nand classrooms into areas of violence by giving school districts \nincentives to write discipline codes and create ``Second Chance'' \nschools with a range of alternatives for chronically disruptive and \nviolent students--everything from short-term in-school crisis centers, \nto medium duration in-school suspension rooms, to high quality off-\ncampus alternatives; helping every child come to school ready to learn \nby funding successful, local early childhood development efforts; and \nmaking schools the hubs of our communities once more by providing \nsupport for after school programs where students receive tutoring, \nmentoring, and values-based education--the kind of programs that are \nopen to entire communities, making public schools truly public.\n  Mr. President, I am not just asking Democrats and Republicans to meet \nwhere our students are and where our children are educated. I will be \noffering legislation that helps us do it, that forces not just a \ndebate, but a vote--yes or no, up or down, change or more of the same. \nTogether we can embrace new rights and responsibilities on both sides \nof the ideological divide and admit that the answer to the crisis of \npublic education is not found in one concept alone--in private school \nvouchers or bricks and mortar alone. We can find answers for our \nchildren by breaking with the past in every respect--breaking with the \ninstinct for the symbolic, and especially the notion that a speech here \nand there will make education better in this country. It can't and \nwon't. But our hard work together in the coming year--Democrats and \nRepublicans together--can make a difference. Education reform can work \nin a bi-partisan way. We know that Congressman Obey and Porter in the \nHouse have succeeded in establishing promising demonstration projects \non comprehensive reform--they know this isn't a partisan issue. And \nthere is no shortage of good ideas or leadership here in the Senate--\ntireless leadership from Senator Moseley-Braun on the question of \ncrumbling schools; bi-partisan creativity from Senator Coats and \nSenator Lieberman with regard to charter schools; and the leadership \nand passion, of course, of the senior Senator from my state, Senator \nKennedy, who has led the fight in this Senate to reauthorize the Higher \nEducation Act and has provided this body with over 30 years of \nunrivaled leadership and support for education. I have already begun \ntalking about this legislation with colleagues from both sides of the \naisle and the response thus far has been positive. Today I will release \na detailed outline of the legislative proposals I am developing, and I \nlook forward to working with all of my colleagues here in the Senate to \nshape legislation that we can all support--bold legislation that sends \nthe message--finally--to parents and children struggling to find \nschools that work, and to teachers and principals struggling in schools \nsimultaneously bloated with bureaucracy and starved for resources--to \nprove to them not just that we hear their cries for help, but that we \nwill respond not with sound bites and salvos, but with real answers.\n  Mr. President, I ask a brief summary of my education plan be printed \nin the Record.\n  The summary follows:\n\n                  A Plan to Educate America's Children\n\n\n            title i--voluntary state reform incentive grants\n\n       If education reform is to succeed in America's public \n     schools, we must demand nothing less than a comprehensive \n     reform effort. The best public school districts are \n     simultaneously embracing a host of approaches to educating \n     our children: high standards and accountability, sufficient \n     resources, small class sizes, quality teachers, motivated \n     students, effective principals, and engaged parents and \n     community leaders. We must not be half-hearted in our efforts \n     to make reform feasible for every school in this country. We \n     cannot address only one challenge in education and ignore the \n     rest. We must make available the tools for real comprehensive \n     reform so that every aspect of public education functions \n     better and every element of our system is stronger.\n       So let us now turn to a bold answer: Let's make every \n     public school in this country essentially a charter school \n     within the public school system. Let's give every school the \n     chance to quickly and easily put in place the best of what \n     works in any other school--private, parochial or public--with \n     decentralized control, site-based management, parental \n     engagement, and real accountability.\n       Several schools across the country have devised ways to \n     accomplish this by raising standards to improve student \n     achievement, lowering class size, improving on-going \n     education for teachers, and reducing unnecessary middle-level \n     bureaucracy. Numerous high-performance school designs have \n     also been created such as the Modern Red Schoolhouse program, \n     the Success for All program, and the new American Schools \n     program. The results of extensive evaluations of these \n     programs have shown that these designs are successful in \n     raising student achievement. Studies show that these many of \n     these successful programs cost less than the national median \n     of basic education revenues per pupil for K-12 school \n     districts. If we brought all schools up to the spending level \n     of the national median, all schools could finance these high-\n     performance school designs. Therefore, we should raise \n     spending to the\n\n[[Page S12235]]\n\n     state or the national median, whichever is higher, thereby \n     allowing every school district to finance and implement \n     comprehensive reform based on proven high-performance models \n     and teach students to the highest standards (58 percent of \n     school districts are below either the national or their state \n     median). Although money alone will not solve the problems in \n     poor school districts, it is impossible to solve without \n     adequate resources. Rather than piecemeal, fragmented \n     approaches to reform, the Comprehensive School Reform program \n     is intended to foster coherent schoolwide improvements that \n     cover virtually all aspects of a school's operations.\n       To ensure that the vast majority of school districts could \n     engage in comprehensive school reform, Title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) should also be \n     fully funded. Title I is the primary federal help for local \n     districts to provide assistance to poor students in basic \n     math and reading skills. Title I currently provides help to \n     local school districts for additional staff and resources for \n     reading and math, curriculum improvements, smaller classes, \n     and training poor students' parents to help their children \n     learn to read and do math. However, Title I only reaches two-\n     thirds of poor students because of inadequate funding. Since \n     90 percent of school districts receive at least some Title I \n     funds, fully funding Title I and allowing school districts to \n     use these additional funds for comprehensive reforms would \n     give schools the ability to implement comprehensive reforms \n     so that all students reach the highest academic standards.\n       Most poor school districts lack the resources to meet the \n     vital educational needs of all of their students. A well-\n     crafted program with the federal and state governments \n     working in close cooperation with one another could make \n     major studies in closing these gaps and improving student \n     performance.\n       Comprehensive school reform will help raise student \n     achievement by assisting public schools across the country to \n     implement effective, comprehensive school reforms that are \n     based on proven, research-based models. No new federal \n     bureaucracy would be established--the program would be \n     implemented at the state level. Furthermore, no funds could \n     be used to increase the school bureaucracy. School districts \n     would implement a comprehensive school reform program and \n     evaluate and measure results achieved. Schools would also \n     provide high-quality and continuous teacher and staff \n     professional development and training, have measurable goals \n     for student performance and benchmarks for meeting those \n     goals, provide for meaningful involvement of parents and the \n     local community in planning and implementing school \n     improvement, and identify how other available federal, state, \n     local, or private resources will be utilized to coordinate \n     services to support and sustain the school reform effort.\n       The funding for the program would move towards the goal of \n     providing every school district in the country enough funds \n     to implement a high quality, performance-based model of \n     comprehensive school reform at a cost of $4,270. This would \n     mean providing enough funds to bring every district up to the \n     state or the national median, whichever is higher (it is \n     estimated that $30 billion annually would be needed to bring \n     the per-pupil expenditure of every school district up to the \n     national or state average). To move towards this goal, the \n     federal government would provide funds and states would match \n     this money (states would provide 10 to 20 percent with poorer \n     states providing a smaller match). To receive these funds, \n     states would have to provide a minimum spending effort based \n     on state and local school spending relative to the state's \n     per capita income. Funding would be $250 million in FY99, \n     $500 million in FY2000, $750 million in FY2001, $1 billion in \n     FY2002 and $4 billion in FY2003.\n       Fully fund Title I so almost all school districts would \n     receive some funds to implement compressive school reform (90 \n     percent of all local school districts receive Title funds). \n     Funding would be $200 million in FY99, $400 million in \n     FY2000, $600 Million in FY2001, $1 billion in FY202, and $4 \n     billion in FY2003.\n\n\n       Title II--Ensure That Children Begin School Ready To Learn\n\n       Recent scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates that \n     enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and \n     intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits. \n     Many local communities across the country have developed \n     successful early childhood efforts and with additional \n     resources could expand and enhance opportunities for young \n     children. We must enhance private, local, and state early \n     successful support programs for young children by providing \n     resources to expand and/or initiate successful efforts for \n     at-risk children from birth to age six.\n       Provide funds to States to make grants to local early \n     childhood development collaboratives. States would fund \n     parent education and home visiting classes and have great \n     flexibility to decide whether to also support quality child \n     care, helping schools stay open later for early childhood \n     development activities, or health services for young \n     children. Communities would be required to document their \n     unmet needs and how they would use the funds to improve \n     outcomes for young children so they begin school ready to \n     learn. Funding would be $100 million in FY99, $200 million in \n     FY2000, $300 million in FY2001, $400 million in FY2002, and \n     $1 billion in FY2002.\n\n\n            Title III--Excellent Principals Challenge Grant\n\n       Principals face long hours, high stress, and too little \n     pay. To overcome these obstacles, principals in successful \n     schools must have effective leadership skills. However, too \n     few principals get the training they need in management \n     skills to ensure their school provides an excellent education \n     for every child. Attracting, training, and retaining \n     excellent principals is essential to helping every local \n     school district become world class.\n       Establish a grant program to states to provide funds to \n     local school districts to attract and to provide professional \n     development for elementary and secondary school principals. \n     Activities would include developing management and business \n     skills, knowledge of effective instructional skills and \n     practices, learning about educational technology, etc. \n     Funding would be $20 million per year. States and local \n     school districts would contribute 25 percent of the total \n     although poor school districts would be exempt from the \n     match.\n\n\n  Title IV--Establish ``Second Chance'' Schools for Troubled Students\n\n       Parents, students, and educators know that serious school \n     reform cannot succeed without an orderly and safe learning \n     environment. The few students who are unwilling or unable to \n     comply with discipline codes and make learning impossible for \n     the other students need behavior management programs and high \n     quality alternative placements. Suspending or expelling \n     chronically disruptive or violent students is not effective \n     in the long run since these students will fall behind in \n     school and may cause additional trouble since they are \n     frequently completely unsupervised; these students need \n     alternative placements that provide supervision, remediation \n     of behavior and maintenance of academic progress. Although \n     some may resist this program for fear that it will be used to \n     isolate disabled students, the purpose is to provide \n     additional interventions for troubled students, not to change \n     disciplinary actions against disabled students.\n       Add a new title to the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act (ESEA) to establish a competitive state grant program for \n     school districts to establish ``Second Chance'' programs. To \n     receive the funds school districts must enact district-wide \n     discipline codes which use clear language with specific \n     examples of behaviors that will result in disciplinary action \n     and have every student and parent sign the code. \n     Additionally, schools may use the funds to promote effective \n     classroom management; provide training for school staff and \n     administrators in enforcement of the code; implement programs \n     to modify student behavior including hiring school \n     counselors; and establish high quality alternative placements \n     for chronically disruptive and violent students that include \n     a continuum of alternatives from meeting with behavior \n     management specialists, to short-term in-school crisis \n     centers, to medium duration in-school suspension rooms, to \n     off-campus alternatives. Funding would be $100 million per \n     year and distributed to states through the Title I formula.\n\n\n  Title V--Teacher Recruitment and On-going Education Incentive Grant\n\n       Approximately 61,000 first-time teachers begin in our \n     nation's public schools each year. Since the average starting \n     salary for teachers is a little more than $21,000 per year, \n     we need to raise their compensation to attract a larger group \n     of qualified people into the teaching profession. Since the \n     average student loan debt of students graduating college who \n     borrowed money for college is $9,068, the most effective way \n     to provide federal assistance to states to raise teachers' \n     salaries is to provide loan forgiveness. In addition, \n     scholarships ought to be available to the most talented high \n     school students in every state in return for a commitment to \n     teach in our public schools (North Carolina has successfully \n     recruited future teachers from within public high schools \n     with the lure of college scholarships).\n       States would be given funds to provide poor school \n     districts the ability to raise teacher salaries to attract \n     and retain the best teachers. Funding would be provided \n     through the Title I ``targeted grant'' formula (the minimum \n     threshold would be 20% poor children or 20,000 poor \n     children). Funding would be $500 million for FY 99, $500 \n     million in FY 2000, $1 billion in FY 2001, $1 billion in FY \n     2002, and $2 billion in FY 2003. Additionally, full-time \n     state certified public school teachers who teach in low-\n     income areas or who teach in areas with teacher shortages \n     such as math, science, and special needs would have 20 \n     percent of their student loans forgiven after two years of \n     teaching, an additional 20 percent after three years, an \n     additional 30 percent after four years, and the remaining 30 \n     percent after five years. The program would be funded at $50 \n     million each year. Finally, an additional $10 million would \n     be provided as grants to states that wish to provide signing \n     bonuses for first-time teachers who teach in low-income areas \n     or areas with teacher shortages.\n       Provide $10 million in grants for states to establish a \n     program to provide college scholarships to the top 20 percent \n     of SAT achievers or grade point average in each state's high \n     school graduating class in return for a commitment to become \n     a state certified teacher for five years. States would \n     contribute 20 percent of the funds for the scholarships. Five \n     percent of the total funds could\n\n[[Page S12236]]\n\n     be used by local school districts to hire staff to recruit at \n     the top liberal arts, education, and technical colleges \n     (districts would be encouraged to establish a central \n     regional recruiting office to pool their resources). One \n     percent of the total funds would be used by the Secretary of \n     Education to create a national hotline for potential teachers \n     to receive information on a career in teaching.\n\n\n              Title VI--Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants\n\n       We need to provide on-going education in teaching skills \n     and academic content knowledge, establish or expand \n     alternative routes to state certification, and establish or \n     expand mentoring programs for prospective teachers by veteran \n     teachers (according to the National Commission on Teaching \n     and America's Future, beginning teachers who have had the \n     continuous support of a skilled mentor are more likely to \n     stay in the profession).\n       Establish Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants, a competitive \n     grant awarded to states to improve teaching. The grants would \n     have a matching requirement and must be used to institute \n     state-level reforms to ensure that current and future \n     teachers possess the necessary teaching skills and academic \n     content knowledge in the subject areas they are assigned to \n     teach. In addition, establish Teacher Training Partnership \n     Grants, designed to encourage reform at the local level to \n     improve teacher training. One of the uses of these funds \n     would be for states to establish, expand, or improve \n     alternative routes to state certification for highly \n     qualified individuals from other occupations such as business \n     executives and recent college graduates with records of \n     academic distinction. Another use would be to mentor \n     prospective teachers by veteran teachers. Provide $100 \n     million per year for these new teacher training programs so \n     that states can improve teacher quality, establish or expand \n     alternative routes to state certification for new teachers, \n     and mentor new teachers by veteran teachers.\n\n\n   Title VII--Invest in Community-based Schools and Community Service\n\n       As many as five million children are home alone after \n     school each week. Most juvenile involvement in crime--either \n     committing crime or becoming victims themselves--occurs \n     between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Children who attend quality after-\n     school programs, however, tend to do better in school, get \n     along better with their peers, and are less likely to engage \n     in delinquent behavior. Expansion of both school-based and \n     community-based after-school programs will provide safe, \n     developmentally appropriate environments for children and \n     help communities reduce the incidents of juvenile delinquency \n     and crime. In addition, many states and localities such as \n     Maryland and the Chicago public school system require high \n     school students to perform community service to receive a \n     high school diploma. The real world experience helps prepare \n     students for work and instills a sense of civic duty.\n       Expand the 21st Century Learning Centers Act by providing \n     $400 million each fiscal year to help communities provide \n     after-school care. Grantees will be required to offer \n     expanded learning opportunities for children and youth in the \n     community. Funds could be used by school districts to \n     provide: literacy programs; integrated education, health, \n     social service, recreational or cultural programs; summer and \n     weekend school programs; nutrition and health programs; \n     expanded library services, telecommunications and technology \n     education programs; services for individuals with \n     disabilities; job skills assistance; mentoring; academic \n     assistance; and drug, alcohol and gang prevention activities.\n       Provide $10 million in grants to states that have \n     established or chose to establish a state-wide or a district-\n     wide program that requires high school students to perform \n     community service to receive a high school diploma. States \n     would determine what constitutes community service, the \n     number of hours required, and whether to exempt some low-\n     income students who hold full-time jobs while attending \n     school full-time. The grants would be matched dollar for \n     dollar with half of the match coming from the state and local \n     education agencies and half coming from the private sector.\n\n\n    Title VIII--Expand the National Board Certification Program For \n                                Teachers\n\n       The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, \n     which is headed by Gov. Jim Hunt, established rigorous \n     standards and assessments for certifyuing accomplished \n     teaching. To pass the exam and be certified, teachers must \n     demonstrate their knowledge and skills through a series of \n     performance-based assessments which include teaching \n     portfolios, student work samples, videotapes and rigorous \n     analyses of their classroom teaching and student learning. \n     Additionally, teachers must take written tests of their \n     subject-matter knowledge and their understanding of how to \n     teach those subjects to their students. The National Board \n     certification is offered to teachers on a voluntary basis and \n     complements but does not replace state licensing. The \n     National Commission on Teaching for America's Future called \n     for a goal of 105,000 board certified teachers by the year \n     2006 (since the exam began recently, only about 2,000 \n     teachers are currently board certified). Since the exam costs \n     $2,000, many teachers are currently unable to afford it.\n       Provide $189 million over five years so that states have \n     enough money to provide a 90% subsidy for the National Board \n     certification of 105,000 teachers across the country.\n\n\n       Title IX--Help Communities to Modernize America's Schools\n\n       More than 14 million children in America attend schools in \n     need of extensive repair or replacement. According to a \n     comprehensive survey by the General Accounting Office (GAO) \n     requested by Senator Moseley-Braun, Sentor Kerry and others, \n     the repair backlog totals $112 billion. Researchers at \n     Georgetown University found that the performance of students \n     assigned to schools in poor condition fall by 10.9 percentage \n     points below those in buildings in excellent condition.\n       To help rebuild modernize, and build over 5,000 public \n     schools, provide federal tax credits to school districts to \n     pay interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds at a cost of $5 \n     billion over five years.\n\n\n                Title X--Encourage Public School Choice\n\n       Many public schools have implemented public school choice \n     programs where students may enroll at any public school in \n     the public school system. In contrast to vouchers for private \n     schools, public school choice increases options for students \n     but does not use public funds to finance private schools \n     which remain entirely unaccountable to taxpayers.\n       Provide $20 million annually in grants to states that \n     choose to implement public school choice programs. School \n     districts could spend the funds on transportation and other \n     services to implement a successful public school choice \n     program. Up to 10 percent of the funds may be spent by a \n     school district to improve low performing school districts \n     that lose students due to the public school choice \n     program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12233-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12236-S12238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CAMBODIA: WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nlatest developments in Cambodia and my thoughts on how the United \nStates should respond to these developments.\n  Over the past decade the United States has contributed hundreds of \nmillions of dollars towards peace in Cambodia. What benefit has been \nachieved as a result of this assistance? Is Cambodia better off now \nthan it was 10 years ago? I would argue that recent political \ndevelopments have undercut most gains this assistance may have \nprovided--and worse, our own policies have contributed to the most \nrecent deterioration considerably.\n  On July 26 of this year, the Cambodian people turned out in \noverwhelming numbers to vote in parliamentary elections. The ruling \ngovernment pointed to this impressive turnout and claimed it was \nrepresentative of a free and fair process. In fact, the election was \ntermed by one American observer as the ``Miracle on the Mekong.'' With \nall due respect, I question how any informed observer could make that \nevaluation. For one to believe this appraisal, one must completely \nignore the events dating from the 1997 coup.\n  In truth, the events which lead up to the July 26 balloting made the \nprospects for free and fair elections impossible. The opposition \nparties infrastructure had been completely dismantled following the \nJuly 1997 coup d'etat, orchestrated by Hun Sen and his Cambodian \nPeoples Party (CPP). As many as 100 opposition party members were \nreported killed, and those who remained in Cambodia were forced to \ncampaign in fear if they dared speak out at all. The CPP controlled \naccess to media and thereby prevented opposition candidates from \neffectively getting their message out. The National Election Commission \n(NEC), which had oversight of the election process, was stacked almost \nentirely with CPP party loyalists. Each of these factors on their own \nwould be troubling, but when looked at collectively they are an \noutrageous example of a government which acts with impunity and has no \nregard for democratic principles.\n  Despite this reality, the Clinton Administration joined many in the \ninternational community, including the so-called ``Friends of \nCambodia,'' in pushing the parties to participate in the July 26 \nelections. I thought then, and I continue to believe now, that this was \na mistake. To use an old phrase--with ``Friends'' like these, who needs \nenemies? How could we ask these brave men and women to risk their lives \nand take part in a process which was doomed to failure? To make matters \nworse, the U.S. Government now seems bent on ignoring the reality of \nthe flawed election. Rather, it is pushing opposition leaders to \nparticipate in a parliament at the mercy of a brutal dictator who has \nno regard for the rule\n\n[[Page S12237]]\n\nof law. So, in the end, the United States has invested hundreds of \nmillion of dollars and the Cambodian people have little to show for our \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, since July 26th, the environment has actually \ndeteriorated rather than improved. Opposition leaders filed hundreds of \nprotests with the National Election Commission, only to see each of \nthese complaints dismissed without consideration. Legitimate claims of \nfraud have been ignored as the CPP seeks to cement its claim to so-\ncalled ``legitimate'' authority. Let's examine a few of these problems:\n\n  Prior to the July ballot, the NEC secretly and without debate changed \nthe formula by which parliament seats would be assigned. Only after the \nvotes were tabulated was this new formula announced. To no one's \nsurprise, the result was an additional five seats for Hun Sen's party, \nthereby preventing CPP from being in the minority. Had the original \nformula been in place, the parties of Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy \ncould have combined their seats to form a majority of parliament.\n  Only July 27, as ballots were being processed, the NEC ordered the \ncounting stopped. According to a senior member of the NEC, this halt in \nthe proceedings occurred because the opposition parties had taken the \nlead. Not surprisingly, when counting was renewed, CPP regained control \nand went on to be credited with 41 percent of the total vote.\n  Finally, the violence continues. Immediately following the election, \nlargely peaceful demonstrations broke out in downtown Phnom Phen. CPP \narmed thugs and soldiers broke up the demonstrations and dismantled the \nsymbolic ``democracy square'' located near the National Assembly. \nOpposition leaders were subject to a travel ban and intimidation \ntactics. Finally, and most alarmingly, several Buddhist monks were \nmurdered and reportedly tortured.\n  Mr. President, the question must be asked, how should the United \nStates proceed in the face of these developments? I believe there are \nseveral concrete steps we can and must take to send the signal that we \nwill not tolerate Hun Sen's brutal disregard for his own nation and \npeople.\n  Number one, we must continue to withhold direct assistance to the \nCambodian Government. This year's foreign operations appropriations \nbill will do just this. Only when each of the election disputes have \nbeen dealt with could aid be released.\n  Number two, we must not appoint an Ambassador to succeed Ambassador \nQuinn. Many in the opposition have already spoken out against the \ncurrent nominee and I share their concerns. However, regardless of the \nnominee, we should send a strong signal to Hun Sen that we will not \nrecognize his illegitimate government. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to insert a letter from Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam \nRainsy, leaders of the two most active opposition parties. In this \nletter, they detail not only the election disputes, but their \nopposition to the current nominee to be ambassador to Cambodia.\n  Number three, the United States should identify Hun Sen for what he \nis, a criminal. Congressman Rohrabacher has introduced a resolution in \nthe House which calls on the United States to assist in the collection \nof information that would lead to trying Hun Sen before an \ninternational tribunal for violation of human rights. I think \nCongressman Rohrabacher should be commended for his leadership, and I \nam hopeful similar legislation will pass in the Senate this year.\n  Finally, we should oppose the current Cambodian government being \nallowed a seat at the United Nations.\n  These steps are essential to staking out America's position as a \ndefender of democracy and rule of law in Cambodia. Strong actions by \nthe U.S. Government can give hope to the heroic members of the \nopposition as they continue to strive for democracy in the face of \nrepression.\n  Before I yield the floor, I will ask unanimous consent that remarks \nfrom opposition leader Sam Rainsy be printed in the Record. Mr. Rainsy \nwas invited and prepared to appear before the subcommittee on East \nAsian and Pacific Affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nearlier this week, but at the last minute was not allowed to testify \ndue to objections raised by some on the committee. Mr. President, this \nis a shame.\n  Sam Rainsy, along with Prince Ranariddh and Son Soubert represent the \nleaders of those who are working to establish democracy and respect for \nhuman rights and rule of law. Had this not been the final hectic week \nof our Congressional session I would have welcomed the opportunity to \nhost Sam Rainsy before the Foreign Operations Committee. Absent that \nopportunity, I believe it is important that the Senate have the ability \nto review Mr. Rainsy's statement, and accordingly I renew my request \nthat his remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n       Dear Senator Helms: This letter is an appeal to you and \n     your Committee to take immediate action in condemning the \n     recent bloodshed in Cambodia caused by soldiers and police \n     loyal to Hun Sen. Over the past few days, many protestors \n     have been injured and Buddhist monks killed as these forces \n     have tried to silence the Cambodian people. We ask you what \n     kind of government murders Buddhist monks?\n       We do not recognize the results of the July election. The \n     Cambodian People's Party's (CPP) domination of the \n     Constitutional Council and the National Election Committee \n     have created a grossly uneven playing field. Our appeals and \n     complaints of vote fraud and counting irregularities have \n     been dismissed out of hand and in violation of law. Make no \n     mistake, Cambodia is a country ruled by a single man intent \n     on destroying any and all political opposition. Since last \n     year's coup d'etat, scores of our supporters have been \n     murdered, beaten, and intimidated by Hun Sen's loyalists.\n       It is imperative that the United States continue to take a \n     principled stand in Cambodia. To this end, we ask that the \n     U.S. Congress continue to suspend official assistance to the \n     current government--formed by a coup--until the current \n     crisis is resolved. More than anything, if Hun Sen were to \n     succeed in securing international legitimacy and the \n     resumption of aid, it would be nothing less than a reward for \n     his lawless and repressive ways. We ask that the U.S. \n     Congress and Administration condemn the use of violence in \n     the strongest of terms. Too many people have died in the \n     hands of reckless Cambodian leaders, like Hun Sen and Pol \n     Pot. Finally we urge you not to replace Ambassador Kenneth \n     Quinn after his term expires in Phnom Penh, and certainly not \n     with Kent Wiederman who we believe may be less than \n     supportive of the cause of democracy in Cambodia. The \n     position should be left vacant as a message to Hun Sen that \n     there are no rewards for corruption, manipulation of \n     elections, and violence. We know a precedent exist for such \n     action in neighboring Burma.\n       We thank you for your consideration of our views, and we \n     remain committed to bringing about peaceful, democratic \n     change in Cambodia.\n           Yours Sincerely,\n     Prince Norodom Ranariddh,\n       President, FUNCINPEC.\n     Sam Rainsy,\n       President, The Sam Rainsy Party.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Remarks by Sam Rainsy, President, Sam Rainsy Party, Cambodia--\n  Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Senate Committee on \n                   Foreign Relations, October 2, 1998\n\n       Mr. Chairman, it is a distinct and unique pleasure for me \n     to appear before you today. I am honored to inform this \n     Subcommittee of the political situation in Cambodia following \n     the July parliamentary elections and to highlight the \n     important role the United States can play in bringing \n     democracy, the rule of law, and lasting peace to my country.\n       The last few months, weeks, and days have been among the \n     most difficult of my life, and it has been equally trying for \n     all Cambodians who support democracy. I know this \n     Subcommittee is familiar with the brutal crackdown of pro-\n     democracy demonstrators in Phnom Penh by forces of the \n     Cambodian People's Party (CPP). Buddhist monks and students \n     have been found tortured and murdered, and many continue to \n     be missing. I know you are familiar with the illegal and \n     unconstitutional travel ban that prevented me and all \n     opposition members from leaving Cambodia one week ago--a ban \n     that was personally instituted by Hun Sen. And I know that \n     you are aware of the CPP-biased election machinery that \n     denied opposition parties due process in the counting of \n     ballots and resolution of election complaints.\n       There is no one more disappointed and saddened by the total \n     failure of the July elections than myself. However, the \n     opposition in Cambodia warned from the very beginning that \n     democracy cannot be built on an undemocratic foundation that \n     lacks the rule of law. Throughout the electoral process--even \n     before we returned to Phnom Penh from exile in Bangkok--we \n     pointed out to the international community many serious flaws \n     in the political environment and in election preparations. \n     For example, our party structures and property had been \n     totally destroyed or looted during Hun Sen's July 1997 coup \n     d'etat, and our membership was traumatized. I could not agree \n     more with the characterization of the pre-election period as \n     ``fundamentally flawed.''\n\n[[Page S12238]]\n\n       Mr. Chairman, we were reluctant participants in this \n     election and at one point even withdrew from the process. But \n     under heavy pressure, we accepted the assurances of the \n     international community that the elections would be \n     assessed fairly. We were wrong in accepting these \n     assurances, and today Cambodia is on the brink of \n     affirming the rule of man, not instituting the rule of \n     law. I know this to be true, as I spent ten days under the \n     protection of the United Nations in Phnom Penh because of \n     Hun Sen's pointed threats.\n       The United Nations and many other sponsors and observers of \n     the election did not effectively challenge the conditions \n     that made a fair election impossible. Throughout the \n     campaign, our activists were harassed, threatened, and killed \n     with complete impunity. While the United Nations has done a \n     commendable job in documenting the abuses of the Cambodian \n     government, not one human rights violator has been \n     prosecuted. And the killings and torture continue.\n       Other shortfalls in the elections included limited and \n     unequal access to state controlled media, an election \n     framework that was biased and that lacked transparency, a \n     recounting process that failed to conduct recounts, a \n     reluctance to reconcile all ballots, and an illegal change in \n     the method for seat allocation that gave the ruling party a \n     majority of seats with only 41 per cent of the official vote.\n       The burden of proof that this election was legitimate no \n     longer lies with the opposition--as some asserted immediately \n     after the polls closed--it is now the responsibility of Hun \n     Sen and the CPP.\n       The Cambodian people are confused, frustrated and angry. \n     They don't understand why many in the international community \n     are supporting the announced election results and pressuring \n     the opposition to join a coalition. Why isn't the Cambodian \n     government pressured into obeying Cambodian laws and its \n     Constitution?\n       If the opposition is forced into a coalition without being \n     able to resolve underlying problems, Cambodia will continue \n     to be under the complete control of Hun Sen. History has \n     shown that he will do whatever it takes to stay in power. \n     Over the past five years, under Hun Sen's leadership, \n     Cambodia has had unrestrained corruption, human rights \n     violations, and environmental destruction. He kept his \n     political opposition in check while building up his own \n     political and military machine, in part, by making deals with \n     some of the worst Khmer Rouge leaders and incorporating them \n     into the government. Anyone who thought Hun Sen was the \n     solution to Cambodia's problems or that he offered \n     ``stability'' should know better by now.\n       I understand all of Cambodia's problem cannot be solved at \n     once, and the opposition has demonstrated its willingness to \n     compromise. However, there are some issues where compromise \n     is impossible, such as the resolution of election related \n     disputes before a coalition government is formed and the \n     development of an independent judiciary that enforces and \n     protects the rights of all citizens, not only members of the \n     CPP.\n       Without proper and full resolution of election complaints, \n     the elections will have no credibility among the Cambodian \n     people. For better or for worse, the Cambodian people look to \n     the United States as the standard-bearer of democracy and the \n     conscience of the world. It was the United States that took \n     Hun Sen's coup seriously last year and the U.S. Congress that \n     acted so swiftly to restrict official foreign assistance to \n     Cambodia. The reaction of Congress was one of the few times \n     that Hun Sen has received a message from the international \n     community other than one of accommodation.\n       Hun Sen expect that the world will legitimize his rule \n     through these elections and cloak his dictatorial behavior in \n     the mantle democracy. Cambodian democrats are asking the \n     United States to be the standard-bearer again while there is \n     still a chance to get Cambodia back on the road to democracy. \n     We call upon the United States to: make it clear that it will \n     refuse to recognize any Cambodian government that is formed \n     prior to the resolution of election-related complaints filed \n     by opposition parties, or any government formed under duress; \n     strongly condemn the Cambodian government for its human \n     rights abuses and ongoing intimidation of opposition \n     activists; continue to withhold official aid, as it is \n     currently doing, and to oppose IMF and other multilateral \n     lending. Let me make clear that humanitarian and demining \n     assistance should continue; vote to keep Cambodia's UN seat \n     vacant and to oppose other international recognition; leave \n     the U.S. ambassador's post vacant after the departure of \n     Ambassador Kenneth Quinn until a credible government is \n     formed and to ensure that next U.S. ambassador is someone \n     with strong credentials as a supporter of democrats; \n     intensify efforts to deter the Cambodian government's role \n     in illegal logging, drug-trafficking, money-laundering and \n     acts of terrorism such as the grenade attack on march 30, \n     1997 that killed at least 16 people; and, make public the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation's report into the March \n     1997 grenade attack.\n       Mr. Chairman, as a target of assassination in 1997 and \n     again just a few weeks ago outside of the Ministry of \n     Interior, I know how dangerous Cambodian politics can be. The \n     United States has an opportunity to make an historic \n     contribution to Cambodia's future by demonstrating its \n     leadership and supporting democracy and human rights. Today, \n     I look to you for hope and assistance.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to testify.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12236-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12238-S12239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENT'S BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, because of my schedule I was \nunable to attend the vote to table the Patients' Bill of Rights. The \ntabling of this legislation was wrong. We are telling the American \npeople that the insurance industry is more important than the patients. \nWe must not let the insurance companies take the place of family \nphysicians in deciding what is appropriate care for patients.\n  Let me share with my colleagues a situation that occurred in South \nCarolina. Ms. Lisa Baughman lives in Charleston. She has a type of \ncancer called ``multiple myeloma.'' Her doctors at the Medical \nUniversity of South Carolina are the best in the country at treating \nher particular condition, and they gave her chemotherapy in preparation \nfor a bone marrow transplant.\n  That is not a light matter, Mr. President. Anyone who has ever \nwatched a friend or relative fight cancer knows it is serious and takes \ncourage, prayer, and all the support you can find to go through that.\n  Her doctors did what doctors have to do now. They called the \ninsurance company and got ``pre-approval'' that the bone marrow \ntransplant would be covered.\n  But the day before the operation, the insurance company said she \ncould not have the operation in her home town with her expert doctors. \nShe would have to fly to another state because the insurer had a \ncontract with a different hospital that was cheaper. This was literally \nthe day before the operation. Can you imagine the mental anguish of \ngoing through chemotherapy, coming to the day before a bone marrow \ntransplant, and then being told ``not now, not with your doctor, not in \nyour state, not in your home town, who knows when''--all with your life \nhanging in the balance?\n  Her doctors protested that she was too weak and needed immediate \ntreatment. The hospital in Charleston offered to do the operation for \nequal or less payment than the out-of-state hospital. But the insurer \nwould not yield and tried to fly her alone, holding her medical files \nin her wheelchair, to the other hospital. She got them to approve a \nrelative to accompany her.\n  When she arrived, there was no one to meet her at the airplane with a \nwheelchair, no hotel room reservation, indeed, no ``room at the inn.'' \nThese things had been promised.\n  So she eventually showed up at an appointment with the new doctor \nchosen by the insurance company to learn about her case. He said he \ncouldn't do the operation for another three weeks, but that she should \nbe getting her care in Charleston, South Carolina at the Medical \nUniversity because they had the best people. In fact, he had been \ntaught by the surgeon in Charleston.\n  She had no choice but to fly home. She contracted pneumonia in her \nweakened condition and is in the hospital right now, trying to recover. \nBecause of the delay, she has to go through chemotherapy again before \nshe can have the operation.\n  That should not happen in America. No one should be forced to go \nthrough chemotherapy twice because an insurance company overrides an \nexpert surgeon's orders and delays critical medical treatment. It \nshould not happen, and there is no one in this world who can do \nanything about it except the United States Congress.\n  Because of a Federal statute insurers cannot be sued for making \ninjurious medical decisions and are not accountable to many state \nrequirements. I do not know what we tell someone like Lisa Baughman if \nwe go home this year without fixing this problem we created.\n  Congress has stood by and watched while ``managed'' health care has \ntaken over. Perhaps that was the wisest course for a while, because we \ndo not have all the solutions. But if we do not agree on basic \ngroundrules for fairness, patients have no protection and it is a race \nto the bottom. We cannot blame HMO's, insurance, or anything else if \nthe Congress continues to refuse to act.\n  Let me list some of the groundrules that we should enact with the \nPatients' Bill of Rights:\n\n[[Page S12239]]\n\n  People trained in medicine, not accountants should make life and \ndeath medical decisions. Every patient should know their doctor is free \nto give his or her best advice and decide the best course of treatment, \nwithout restriction from the insurance company.\n  Every patient should know that specialty care is available if needed.\n  Citizens should know when they go to the emergency room, that their \ninsurance will pay instead of haggling over the bill and denying \npayment afterwards. The last thing someone needs while rushing a sick \nchild to the emergency room is a gnawing worry about payment.\n  Women should be able to visit their OB/Gyn without going through a \ngatekeeper.\n  People with longterm illnesses also should be able to see their \nspecialists without getting a referral every time. People pay premiums \nto get health care, not a runaround.\n  Some people say this is radical socialized medicine, but I think \npeople see through that. This argument is an old red herring and it is \nstarting to smell.\n  What we are talking about with this Patients Bill of Rights is just \nthe health care we always thought we had, but now it is being taken \naway. I have spent decades pushing medical research and building the \nmedical research base in South Carolina. I was trying to build \nexpertise in life-saving treatments in my home state so my constituents \ncould be cared for, not so they could be denied and sent somewhere else \non a day's notice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12238-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BEST WISHES TO DR. DAVID A. SPENCER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. \nDavid A. Spencer, President and CEO of Walsh College, on his new \nappointment as president of the newly formed Michigan Virtual \nUniversity.\n  Dr. Spencer has brought new ideas, enthusiasm, and a love for \ninnovative learning to Walsh College. His vision of the future of Walsh \nCollege had no limits. And while he helped make Walsh College a world-\nclass business institution, he made sure to showcase the brilliance and \ninnovation of the students and faculty. This is a man who is not only \ncreative and thoughtful, but willing to share credit that he deserves \nwith many, many others.\n  I, personally, will hate to see David leave Walsh College. He has \nbeen an invaluable partner to me and my office in our efforts to reach \nout to and learn more about the Michigan business community. We worked \nhand-in-hand on an annual small business conference through which I \nhave gathered extremely valuable information about the needs of the \nbusiness community. On many occasions, I have been able to use the \ninformation I gathered at these conferences as examples during \nlegislative debates. These conferences have also helped illustrate to \nme the most important legislative priorities of the business community. \nDavid Spencer was invaluable in putting together these innovative, \ninformative conferences.\n  David is one of those people who believes anything is possible \nthrough technology. I am confident that he is the right person to lead \nthe Michigan Virtual University. Walsh College will surely miss him. My \nstaff and I will miss having him here, but I am hopeful that his new \nposition as president of the Michigan Virtual University we will have \nmany new opportunities to work together.\n  I wish Dr. David Spencer much continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12239-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12239-S12240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONCERN OVER RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAQ\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, along with Senators McCain, \nLieberman, Hutchison and twenty-three other Senators, I am sending a \nletter to the President to express our concern over Iraq's actions and \nurging the President ``after consulting with Congress, and consistent \nwith the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions \n(including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi \nsites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to \nend its weapons of mass destruction programs.''\n  At the outset, I believe it would be useful to review the events that \nled up to the requirement for the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction programs. At the time that Iraq unlawfully invaded and \noccupied its neighbor Kuwait, the UN Security Council imposed economic \nand weapons sanctions on Iraq.\n  After Iraqi forces had been ousted from Kuwait by the U.S.-led \ncoalition and active hostilities had ended, but while coalition forces \nwere still occupying Iraqi territory, the UN Security Council, acting \nunder Chapter VII of the UN Charter, conducted a review of Iraq's \nhistory with weapons of mass destruction and made a number of decisions \nin April 1991 to achieve its goals, including a formal cease fire.\n  With respect to Iraq's history, the Security Council noted Iraq's \nthreat during the Gulf War to use chemical weapons in violation of its \ntreaty obligations, Iraq's prior use of chemical weapons, Iraq's use of \nballistic missiles in unprovoked attacks, and reports that Iraq \nattempted to acquire materials for a nuclear weapons program contrary \nto its treaty obligations.\n  After reviewing Iraq's history, the Security Council decided that \n``Iraq shall unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or \nrendering harmless, under international supervision'' of its weapons of \nmass destruction programs and all ballistic missiles with a range \ngreater than 150 kilometers and conditioned the lifting of the economic \nand weapons sanctions on Iraq's meeting its obligations, including \nthose relating to its weapons of mass destruction programs.\n  To implement those decisions, the Security Council authorized the \nformation of a Special Commission, which has come to be known as \nUNSCOM, to ``carry out immediate on-site inspection of Iraq's \nbiological, chemical and missile capabilities, based on Iraq's \ndeclarations and the designation of any additional locations by the \nSpecial Commission itself'' and requested the Director General of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to carry out similar \nresponsibilities for Iraq's nuclear program. Additionally, the UN \nSecurity Council decided that Iraq shall unconditionally undertake not \nto use, develop, construct or acquire weapons of mass destruction and \ncalled for UNSCOM to conduct ongoing monitoring and verification of \nIraq's compliance. The detailed modalities for these actions were \nagreed upon by an exchange of letters in May 1991 that were signed by \nthe UN Secretary General, the Executive Chairman of UNSCOM and the \nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Iraq.\n  Thus, Iraq unconditionally accepted the UN Security Council's demands \nand thereby achieved a formal cease-fire and the withdrawal of \ncoalition forces from its territory.\n  Mr. President, UNSCOM has sought to carry out its responsibilities in \nas expeditious and effective way as possible. UNSCOM Executive Chairman \nRichard Butler and his teams, however, have been confronted with Iraqi \nobstacles, lack of cooperation and lies. As UNSCOM has noted in its own \ndocument entitled ``UNSCOM Main Achievements'': ``UNSCOM has uncovered \nsignificant undeclared proscribed weapons programmes, destroyed \nelements of those programmes so far identified, including equipment, \nfacilities and materials, and has been attempting to map out and verify \nthe full extent of these programmes in the face of serious efforts to \ndeceive and conceal. UNSCOM also continues to try to verify Iraq's \nillegal unilateral destruction activities. The investigation of such \nundeclared activities is crucial to the verification of Iraq's \ndeclarations on its proscribed weapons programmes.''\n  Mr. President, I will not dwell on the numerous instances of Iraq's \nfailure to comply with its obligations. I would note, however, that in \naccepting the February 23, 1998 Memorandum of Understanding that was \nsigned by the UN Secretary General and Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister, \nthat ended Iraq's prior refusal to allow UNSCOM and the IAEA to perform \ntheir missions, the UN Security Council warned Iraq that it will face \nthe ``severest consequences'' if it fails to adhere to the commitments \nit reaffirmed in the MOU. Suffice it to say that on August 5, 1998, \nIraq declared that it was suspending all cooperation with UNSCOM and \nthe IAEA, except some limited monitoring activities.\n\n[[Page S12240]]\n\n  In response, on September 9, 1998, a unanimous UN Security Council \ncondemned Iraq's action and suspended its sanctions' reviews until \nUNSCOM and the IAEA report that they are satisfied that they have been \nable to exercise their full range of activities. Within the last week, \nIraq's Deputy Foreign Minister refused to rescind Iraq's decision. \nThroughout this process and despite the unanimity in the UN Security \nCouncil, Iraq has depicted the United States and Britain as preventing \nUNSCOM and the IAEA from certifying Iraqi compliance with its \nobligations.\n  To review, Iraq unlawfully invaded and occupied Kuwait, it's armed \nforces were ejected from Kuwait by the U.S.-led coalition forces, \nactive hostilities ceased, and the UN Security Council demanded and \nIraq accepted, as a condition of a cease-fire, that its weapons of mass \ndestruction programs be destroyed and that such destruction be \naccomplished under international supervision and permanent monitoring, \nand that economic and weapons sanctions remain in effect until those \nconditions are satisfied.\n  Mr. President, by invading Kuwait, Iraq threatened international \npeace and security in the Persian Gulf region. By its failure to comply \nwith the conditions it accepted as the international community's \nrequirements for a cease-fire, Iraq continues to threaten international \npeace and security. By its refusal to abandon its quest for weapons of \nmass destruction and the means to deliver them, Iraq is directly \ndefying and challenging the international community and directly \nviolating the terms of the cease fire between itself and the United \nStates-led coalition.\n  Mr. President, it is vitally important for the international \ncommunity to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal \nto allow UNSCOM and the IAEA to carry out their missions. To date, the \nresponse has been to suspend sanctions' reviews and to seek to reverse \nIraq's decision through diplomacy.\n  Mr. President, as UN Secretary General Kofi Annan noted when he \nsuccessfully negotiated the memorandum of agreement with Saddam Hussein \nin February, ``You can do a lot with diplomacy, but of course you can \ndo a lot more with diplomacy backed up by fairness and force.'' It is \nmy sincere hope that Saddam Hussein, when faced with the credible \nthreat of the use of force, will comply with the relevant UN Security \nCouncil Resolutions. But, I believe that we must carefully consider \nother actions, including, if necessary, the use of force to destroy \nsuspect sites if compliance is not achieved.\n  Mr. President, the Iraqi people are suffering because of Saddam \nHussein's noncompliance. The United States has no quarrel with the \nIraqi people. It is most unfortunate that they have been subjected to \neconomic sanctions for more than seven years. If Saddam Hussein had \ncooperated with UNSCOM and the IAEA from the start and had met the \nother requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions, including \nthe accounting for more than 600 Kuwaitis and third-country nationals \nwho disappeared at the hands of Iraqi authorities during the occupation \nof Kuwait, those sanctions could have been lifted a number of years \nago. I support the UN's oil-for-food program and regret that Saddam \nHussein took more than five years to accept it. In the final analysis, \nas the Foreign Ministers of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia \nand the United Arab Emirates, comprising the Gulf Cooperation Council \nstated at the time of the February crisis: ``responsibility for the \nresult of this crisis falls on the Iraqi regime itself.''\n  I ask that the letter to the President be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 1998.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our concern \n     over recent developments in Iraq.\n       Last February, the Senate was working on a resolution \n     supporting military action if diplomacy did not succeed in \n     convincing Saddam Hussein to comply with the United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions concerning the disclosure and \n     destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This \n     effort was discontinued when the Iraqi government reaffirmed \n     its acceptance of all relevant Security Council resolutions \n     and reiterated its willingness to cooperate with the United \n     Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a Memorandum of Understanding \n     signed by its Deputy Prime Minister and the United Nations \n     Secretary General.\n       Despite a brief interval of cooperation, however, Saddam \n     Hussein has failed to live up to his commitments. On August \n     5, Iraq suspended all cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA, \n     except some limited monitoring activity.\n       As UNSCOM Executive Chairman Richard Butler told us in a \n     briefing for all Senators in March, the fundamental historic \n     reality is that Iraq has consistently sought to limit, \n     mitigate, reduce and, in some cases, defeat the Security \n     Council's resolutions by a variety of devices.\n       We were gratified by the Security Council's action in \n     unanimously passing Resolution 1194 on September 9. By \n     condemning Iraq's decision to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM \n     and the IAEA, by demanding that Iraq rescind that decision \n     and cooperate fully with UNSCOM and the IAEA, by deciding not \n     to conduct the sanctions' review scheduled for October 1998 \n     and not to conduct any future such reviews until UNSCOM and \n     the IAEA, report that they are satisfied that they have been \n     able to exercise the full range of activities provided for in \n     their mandates, and by acting under Chapter VII of the United \n     Nations Charter, the Security Council has sent an unambiguous \n     message to Saddam Hussein.\n       We are skeptical, however, that Saddam Hussein will take \n     heed of this message even though it is from a unanimous \n     Security Council. Moreover, we are deeply concerned that \n     without the intrusive inspections and monitoring by UNSCOM \n     and the IAEA, Iraq will be able, over time, to reconstitute \n     its weapons of mass destruction programs.\n       In light of these developments, we urge you, after \n     consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. \n     Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, \n     if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraq \n     sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's \n     refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.\n           Sincrely,\n         Carl Levin, Joe Lieberman, Frank R.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate one \nof North Carolina's good corporate citizens for receiving two \nprestigious international awards this week. Nortel Networks is a global \nsupplier of telecom and data networking solutions and has been an \nemployer in North Carolina since 1974. They employ over 9,000 people in \nthe Raleigh-Durham area, over 32,000 employees across the United States \nand approximately 80,000 people in over 150 countries. Over 40 percent \nof Nortel Networks' worldwide revenues are generated from their \nfacilities in Raleigh-Durham.\n  Nortel Networks' CEO John Roth received ``The Emerging Markets CEO of \nthe Year Award,'' which acknowledges companies whose expansion into \nemerging markets has contributed significantly to the corporation and \nhas benefitted the countries involved. This award was presented at a \nspecial event during the IMF/World Bank annual meeting this week in \nWashington.\n  Nortel Networks was also recognized this week as ``The World's Most \nGlobal Company'' in the electricals sector, by the editors of Global \nFinance, a magazine known for its reporting of world financial matters. \nOther companies who have received this award in the past include IBM, \nCitibank, Reuters, and Avon.\n  These awards are well deserved. A country's communications \nstructures, capabilities and services--its ``infostructure''--is \ndirectly linked to its standard of living. The network technologies \nNortel Networks has brought to emerging markets has helped improve the \nstandard of living for the citizens of these countries, providing them \na much faster ascent into the 21st Century. Advanced network \ntechnologies promise greater opportunities to improve their education \nand health care, as well as expand business and employment.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating this world leader \nwhich also happens to be a stellar North Carolina corporation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12240-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12241]]\n                   MISS MICHIGAN SHANNON GRACE CLARK\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Shannon \nGrace Clark, who was crowned as Miss Michigan USA 1999 on Sunday, May \n24, 1998.\n  I am very proud to have her represent the State of Michigan, for \nShannon is a shining example of service above self. Through her \ndedication to family, church and local community, she has made a \ntremendous impact on helping those who are less fortunate in society, \nenabling them opportunities of self-sufficiency.\n  Her role has enabled her many opportunities, however, Shannon has \nshared them with homeless women and children throughout the State of \nMichigan. She has tirelessly dedicated herself to directly assisting \nthose in need and to heightening public awareness to the importance of \nhelping people facing unfortunate circumstances.\n  Shannon's platform ``People Helping People,'' comes to her naturally \nbecause she comes from a family dedicated to the importance of family, \nchurch and local community. Her parents, the Reverend and Dr. Pam Clark \nrun the Pontiac Rescue Mission, a homeless and rehabilitation center in \nPontiac, Michigan, which helps reclaim and rehabilitate the downtrodden \nof society.\n  Through the program, Reverend and Doctor Clark designed and \nimplemented, many individuals have reclaimed their lives, strength, \npride, character, their children and themselves. They have developed \ninto productive members of society, and loving families, free from the \nchains of addiction and destructive lifestyles.\n  To build upon the accomplishments of her parents, she has formed a \ncommittee to raise additional financial support for the women and \nchildren program at the Pontiac Rescue Mission. Her efforts indeed are \na fine model of leadership and selfless dedication that will help those \nin need as well as serving as an example for those to follow.\n  I want to express my congratulations to Shannon Grace Clark and wish \nher luck in the Miss USA pageant in February. Most importantly, I would \nlike to thank her for her commitment to those who are less fortunate in \nsociety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12241-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12241-S12242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WALTER SONDHEIM, JR.\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this past July Walter Sondheim, \nJr., one of Maryland's most distinguished citizens, celebrated his 90th \nbirthday with family and friends in Baltimore. It is an accomplishment \nfor anyone to reach this chronological milestone, but in this instance, \nWalter's nine decades have marked an extraordinary record of \nunparalleled public service to Baltimore and the State of Maryland.\n  As a successful business executive, Walter Sondheim has served in \n``volunteer'' public service positions on important state and local \nboards and commissions and as an advisor to Mayors and Governors for \nthe last half century. His grace, good humor, extraordinary \nintelligence, and dedication have been powerful and good influences for \nprogress and unity in Maryland.\n  Achieving 90 years of age for most ``normal'' individuals, with rare \nexception, implies retirement or reduced activity. But among the \nseveral articles I am inserting in today's Congressional Record is an \nannouncement in the July 30 edition of the Washington Post that Walter \nwas unanimously elected to become the new President of the Maryland \nBoard of Education. This public demonstration of confidence is a \ncontinuing vindication of his effectiveness in undertaking difficult \ntasks.\n  I am also including an article from the July 25 Baltimore Sun which \ndescribes Walter's exceptional and inspiring life of service. I know I \nexpress the deep appreciation of his fellow Marylanders for his many \ndecades of commitment and their best wishes in his latest and most \nsignificant assignment. I ask that these articles be inserted at this \npoint in the record, and I yield the floor.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, July 25, 1998]\n\n                         Not The Retiring Type\n\n                         (By M. Dion Thompson)\n\n       Walter Sondheim is on the phone, trying to get out of being \n     interviewed. He can't understand why the city's newspaper is \n     coming around, yet again, to get the tale of his life. Who \n     cares, he says.\n       Yes, he is turning 90, and that is worth remarking on. But \n     all this fuss, the parties, the inquiring journalist. Is it \n     really necessary? Still, after only the slightest bit of \n     nudging, he relents, which is to be expected because, after \n     all, Walter Sondheim is a nice guy.\n       On the scheduled day, he takes a seat behind the desk of \n     his 15th floor office at Baltimore's Legg Mason Tower and \n     makes one last halfhearted try.\n       ``Why waste the time? It really is embarrassing, because I \n     think my friends who know me well figure. `There he goes \n     again,' '' he says, then gets down to business. ``Now, what \n     do you want? . . . What's on your mind? I feel sorry for \n     you.''\n       He is painfully modest, sometimes excruciatingly so. For 50 \n     years he has been the consummate citizen, advisor to mayors \n     and governors, a steady presence in his city's decades-long \n     resurgence. He led the school board during desegregation. He \n     was chairman of Charles Center-Inner Harbor Management, the \n     organization that oversaw the renewal of downtown.\n       If he were a different kind of man, he could walk you down \n     Charles Street, tug at your sleeve and say, ``See, I made \n     that happen. And over there, Me. again.'' He could stand at \n     the Inner Harbor and go on about how he, Jim Rouse and others \n     turned this town around. He is not that kind of man, not one \n     to revel in yesterday's glory to seek accolades for past \n     successes. There is too much to be done today.\n       Every workday he's up early, dressed in a suit and tie and \n     out the door as he has been for nearly 70 years. These days \n     is senior adviser to the Greater Baltimore Committee. He used \n     to be president.\n       He could be anywhere. He has the money. He career with \n     Hochschild, Kohn & Co. ended with his retirement at senior \n     vice president and treasurer. Soon after, investor Warren \n     Buffet brought the department store company.\n       Money doesn't bring him to this downtown office with its \n     view of the towering NationsBank building, the one old-timers \n     remembers as Maryland National. It isn't a yearning for fame \n     that has him fielding calls, hustling to meetings, offering \n     his considered judgment on public policy.\n       Then why is he here, when he could be in Aruba, Martha's \n     Vineyard, the Cape?\n       ``Well, you know, you touch on a real issue there, I'd get \n     restless if I weren't doing anything,'' he says. ``I think \n     about it every now and then because I have no reason not to \n     retire. I'm not doing anything that obviously someone else \n     couldn't do. But waking up in the morning and not having a \n     job just doesn't appeal to me.''\n       Bring up the Golden Years, and Sondheim likely turns a deaf \n     ear. There's this crazy idea about retirement, as if people \n     can easily walk away from what has sustained them. Retire, \n     and do what? Sometimes there is a consuming hobby or \n     passion waiting. Sometimes, the work is its own passion.\n       Sally Michel, a longtime friend, notes how work can fuel a \n     person's life. Think of the great pianist Artur Rubinstein, \n     practically blind and giving recitals at 89; or jazz \n     trumpeter Adolphus ``Doc'' Cheatham swinging at 91; or George \n     Burns at 100 with his cigars and wisecracks. Now, think of \n     Walter Sondheim.\n       ``You see that when people have a purpose, a real serious \n     purpose to their lives, that they stay alive a lot longer. \n     Retirement is not a good thing,'' says Michel.\n       Yet Sondheim knows longevity has its downside. He says he \n     can remember looking down the table in many board rooms and \n     seeing three or four emeritus members sitting there, ``every \n     one of them sure that he could do the job better than I \n     could, and they were probably right.''\n       Now, he's Mr. Emeritus. The position doesn't sit well with \n     him. ``You can't vote, and an emeritus means you're not a \n     participant anymore,'' he says.\n       He wonders if he has stayed too long. Maybe he's in the \n     way. If his wife were alive, she would tell him.\n       But Janet dies six years ago come September. They were \n     married 58 years. He still wears his wedding ring.\n       ``We never had a fight in 58 years. My daughter said it was \n     because we were both too lazy,'' he says and smiles a bit, \n     then talks about his loss. ``To me it has been one continuous \n     period. I don't mean a continuous period of mourning, but I \n     think about her often. . . . Missing her is institutionalized \n     in me.''\n       Without her, he turned to his closets friends, asking them \n     to send him an anonymous letter if they thought he was \n     slipping.\n       ``I thought it was incredible, an incredible thing to do, \n     to make that suggestion,'' says Michel, who received one of \n     the letters. ``I was just very moved by it.''\n       Abell Foundation President Robert C. Embry, Jr., whose \n     friendship with Sondheim goes back nearly 30 years, also \n     received one.\n       ``I know that he worries and has expressed this publicly. \n     `Has he overstayed his welcome? Is he losing his acuity? Are \n     people humoring him?' '' says Embry. ``But the opposite is \n     true.''\n       Sondheim is on 24 boards and foundations. That sounds \n     impressive, overwhelming, but some meet once a year, some \n     once a month, he says. When officials from elsewhere call the \n     GBC about Baltimore and its redevelopment, they get Walter. \n     He still talks to the mayor, the governor. He was chairman of \n     the ad hoc committee that picked the Hippodrome for an \n     expanded center of performing arts.\n\n[[Page S12242]]\n\n       ``Walter is the quintessential public servant,'' says Mayor \n     Kurt L. Schmoke. ``He remains an important adviser in \n     business and political activities in this community. I just \n     met with him as recently as this week to talk about downtown \n     development.''\n       It all started long before he was appointed to the ``Jewish \n     slot'' on the city school board in 1948. It started July 25, \n     1908, in the front room, second floor of 1621 Bolton St. \n     That's where he was born. He graduated from Park School in \n     1925, then went on to Haverford College. There were 81 \n     graduates in the class of '29. A dozen remain.\n       On his yearbook page, the editors wrote: ``By \n     simultaneously preserving his pride and refusing to take \n     himself seriously, he has practically forced us to consider \n     him seriously as one of the prides of the class.''\n       Not much has changed in 70 years. In the mid-1950s, his \n     calm approach made Baltimore the first school district south \n     of the Mason-Dixon Line to respond to the Supreme Court's \n     landmark ruling outlawing ``separate but equal'' education. \n     Some one burned a cross on the lawn of his Windsor Hills \n     home, but it didn't stop him.\n       During the 1960s Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro III sought his \n     help.\n       ``His calling card is integrity and, as I said before, he \n     has no hidden agenda,'' says D'Alesandro. ``My whole concept \n     of Walter was that he was a cut above.''\n       He does not have a ``typical'' day. It depends on where he \n     is needed. Just the other day, he showed up for the Maryland \n     Art Place's dedication of its miniature golf course at Rash \n     Field. He called himself ``Tiger Wouldn't.''\n       ``Me, who's opposed to all exercise,'' he says, of what \n     turned into an awful day. He tripped and fell on the 17th \n     hole. ``I ripped my suit beyond repair. I went to get my car, \n     it had a $20 ticket on it.''\n       He still drives his black Acura Legend, and walks when \n     there is a purpose. Not too long ago he walked from his \n     Harborview apartment to a dinner party on Federal Hill. The \n     hosts were very concerned.\n       ``You know, you shock people if you drive. You shock people \n     if you walk,'' he says.\n       At 90, he goes where he wants, when he wants. He does \n     acrostics for fun, and surprises himself by still being able \n     to recite the Keats he learned at Haverford.\n       ``I've had a lucky life,'' he says, pale blue eyes shining \n     behind his glasses. ``It's not because of me. I've been lucky \n     to be in places.''\n       Now there are rumors that he's the odds-on favorite to be \n     the next state school board president. He says he doesn't \n     want the job. Yes, he has been involved with education for 50 \n     years, but he doesn't consider himself an expert.\n       ``I don't think it would be wise for them to pick me,'' he \n     says, wondering aloud how it would look, a 90-year-old man.\n       So often in the past people have come to him, seeking his \n     perspective, his gift of compromise. He has said ``yes'' \n     probably more times than he can remember. His resume lists 78 \n     committees, boards and foundations he once served.\n       ``My wife, who used to chastise me for saying `Yes,' said, \n     `It's your curiosity,' '' he says. ``The truth is, I'm a \n     little bit of a sissy. I don't like to say `No.' . . . That's \n     not a strength, you known. That's a weakness.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 30, 1998]\n\n                 Sondheim to Head Maryland School Board\n\n                          (By Ellen Nakashima)\n\n       At 90, Walter Sondheim Jr. protested that he was too old to \n     head the influential board that sets education policy in \n     Maryland. Just Friday he insisted, ``You don't get wiser with \n     age.''\n       But other members of the Maryland Board of Education would \n     not hear of it. Yesterday, they unanimously elected the self-\n     deprecating Baltimorean--the godfather of the state's school \n     reform efforts--as their new president.\n       A man who has urged friends to write him anonymously when \n     they felt it was time for him to ``hang up the spikes,'' \n     Sondheim is now the oldest person in the country to lead a \n     statewide education board.\n       ``I'm very grateful to all of you,'' he told his colleagues \n     yesterday. ``It's a nice thing to do to an old man.''\n       Although it's a part-time job with no pay, heading the \n     state board requires an ability to smooth out the ripples \n     created by 12 strong personalities. In the past months, board \n     members have clashed over such issues as whether to require \n     teachers-in-training to take reading courses and how to \n     institute new high school exams for graduation. And Sondheim, \n     a consensus-maker par excellence, was the best candidate to \n     keep the board on a fast track to education reform, board \n     members said. He replaces Rose LaPlaca, whose term has \n     expired.\n       ``This is a man who's a cut above everyone,'' said State \n     Superintendent Nancy S. Grasmick, herself a recognized leader \n     in school reform. ``Very few people have intelligence coupled \n     with integrity. He is as intellectually sharp as someone half \n     his age. Most people have lost more gray matter in their \n     thirties than he has in his lifetime.''\n       Sondheim has a wry sense of humor that is almost always \n     directed at himself. (A Navy lieutenant in World War II, he \n     never served overseas--``It could possibly be why we won the \n     war.'' What did he do in the Navy? ``I didn't interfere.'')\n       He was appointed president of the Baltimore City school \n     board in 1954 on the same day the U.S. Supreme Court handed \n     down the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education desegregation \n     decision. He has headed the state's Higher Education \n     Commission. And in 1987, then-Gov. William Donald Schaefer \n     tapped him to head to Governor's Commission on School \n     Performance, which in 1989 released what has come to be known \n     as the Sondheim Report--or the blueprint for school reform in \n     Maryland.\n       They are all posts he says he did not seek.\n       ``I've just lived a long time,'' he said, shrugging off his \n     achievements. ``You will find that the older you get, the \n     nicer people are to you.''\n       Sondheim, born and bred in Baltimore, serves on 24 boards \n     and foundations and works full time as a consultant to the \n     Greater Baltimore Committee, a booster group he once headed. \n     He chaired Charles Center-Inner Harbor Management, which \n     sparked the revival of downtown Baltimore. Today, he works on \n     the 15th floor of the Legg Mason Tower, a few blocks from the \n     state board office. His dress is impeccable, from buttondown \n     shirt to wingtip shoes.\n       ``I don't know anything about his genes, except his \n     remarkable physical ability,'' said Schaefer, 76, who \n     declares himself ``just a child beside Walter.'' Said \n     Schaefer: ``He's got the stamina of a man 55 years old. He's \n     amazing. He can outwork guys in their fifties, sixties.'' And \n     he doesn't exercise.\n       ``Oh, God forbid!'' Sondheim exclaimed. ``I'm opposed to \n     it. I don't believe in exercise. It's partly because I've \n     never done any form of athletics very well. I'm not an \n     athletic type. I get kidded about that a lot.''\n       He stood for two hours Tuesday night at a birthday party in \n     his honor despite having fallen and hurt his leg. About 100 \n     of his closest friends served him up a three-foot-long cake \n     with 15-inch-high candles. According to Schaefer, he blew \n     them out with one puff and declared: ``No presents. No \n     speeches. No exceptions.''\n       Sondheim, whose wife, Janet, died six years ago and who has \n     two children and two grandchildren, gets asked all the time \n     when he'll retire.\n       ``I have no idea,'' he said. ``Somebody may tell me it's \n     time to do it. I keep a watchful eye out for being past my \n     time. And I have some friends I expect to tell me when my \n     time has come.''\n       But Schaefer believes Sondheim will never hang up his \n     spikes. ``He'd be bored to death,'' Schaefer said. ``He \n     couldn't retire. He just couldn't. Besides, nobody wants him \n     to.''\n       Sondheim's agenda for the coming year is simple.\n       ``I think what I hope to do in the next year,'' he said, \n     ``is wake up every morning.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12241-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE SCHUYLKILL TRAINING & TECHNOLOGY CENTER PRACTICAL \n                            NURSING PROGRAM\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of one \nof the finest public servants ever to have served the citizens of New \nMexico, Mr. Frank Horan. Mr. Horan, who served a quarter of a century \nas the city attorney of Albuquerque, passed away last Saturday, October \n3, 1998. His loss will be deeply felt by countless friends and family--\n-two sons, a daughter, and seven grandchildren---who will always \nremember his dedication to public service, his deep affection for his \ncommunity, his abiding love for his family, and his legendary sense of \nhumor.\n  Frank Horan was in a sense one of the founding fathers of modern \nAlbuquerque, moving to the city during the early 1940s, and serving as \ncity attorney during the first years of the city's\n\n[[Page S12243]]\n\nmayor-council form of government. He played a key role in designing the \ncity's governmental structure and establishing its relationship to \nother jurisdictions within the state. His early professional investment \nin city government serves as a foundation of today's Albuquerque, a \nmodel of good government under the current leadership of Mayor Jim \nBaca, a longtime schoolmate of Mr. Horan's son, Tom. Tom Horan, \nfollowing in his father's footsteps, currently practices law in \nAlbuquerque and works with the state legislature.\n  Following his years in service to the citizens of Albuquerque, Frank \nHoran served in the House of Representatives in the State of New Mexico \nfrom which he retired in 1982. His dedication to public service, \nhowever, did not stop when he retired. In recent years, he devoted his \nlife to volunteer causes, including Meals on Wheels and Encino House, a \nretirement center located in Albuquerque. Tom Horan reports that his \nfather pursued those activities because, in Frank Horan's words, he was \n``building his resume.'' I am certain that Frank's ``resume'' will \nabide favorably in the hereafter. I also know that his spirit and \ncontributions will live on among the citizens of Albuquerque and New \nMexico. The people of New Mexico will miss him very much. And so will \nI. Thank you Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12242-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CFA 6TH ANNUAL DINNER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ntragedy that continues to unfold in the Province of Kosovo. I cannot \nstress to my colleagues enough how serious I believe the Kosovo \nsituation has become. What we are witnessing in Kosovo now is \npotentially the most dangerous conflict in the Balkans since 1991. For \nmore than seven months, President Milosevic and his Serb police forces \nhave been engaged in an offensive against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo \nthat can only be characterized as ``ethnic cleansing''.\n  The Congress must put aside election year politics and speak with one \nvoice in support of the United States utilizing all necessary means to \nput an end to these atrocities that threaten a wider war in the \nBalkans. For that reason, I hope that the Republican leadership will \nallow a vote in the Senate to signal our strong support for the use of \nair power against Serbian targets in the coming days.\n  Clearly no one on the other side of the aisle can assert that the new \nescalation of fighting in Kosovo has not been very destabilizing to the \nregion. The evidence clearly indicates that it has--over a quarter of a \nmillion of Kosovans have been displaced, many of whom have fled beyond \nthe borders of Kosovo and Serbia to Albania and the Former Yugoslav \nRepublic of Macedonia.\n  Similarly the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) has sought refuge and \nmaterial support from Albanian populations in other countries--such \nactions could draw others into an ever widening civil conflict.\n  But it is not only the conflict's disastrous potential that cries out \nfor action. The status quo in Kosovo is a human catastrophe. According \nto some estimates, already more than 1,000 people have been killed \nsince the end of February, when Serbian paramilitary police began their \ncrackdown on villages in Kosovo believed to be strongholds of the \nKosovo Liberation Army. Many more have been driven from their homes.\n  Fearful women and children are hiding from the Serb police and other \nSerb armed forces in the hills around Kosovo without adequate food, \nwater, or shelter. Nightly temperatures are already falling near \nfreezing at night and it is clear that with the advent of winter their \nfate is doomed. Mr. President, we cannot let this humanitarian and \nhuman rights catastrophe continue.\n  The deep concern about the current crisis is a shared one--it is \nbipartisan. Many of the members of this body have recently had an \nopportunity to hear from a former colleague and Majority Leader Senator \nBob Dole who at the behest of President Clinton traveled to Kosovo and \nBelgrade to make a first hand assessment of the situation. He was \naccompanied on that visit by Assistant Secretary of State for \nDemocracy, Human Rights and Labor, John Shattuck.\n  Senator Dole and Assistant Secretary Shattuck returned to Washington \nwith a shared assessment of what has been transpiring in Kosovo in \nrecent weeks.\n  They have both spoken of atrocities being perpetrated against the \ncivilian population--ninety percent of whom are ethnic Albanians. \nSenator Dole again confirmed what many of us in this body have been \nsaying over the last seven months, namely that ``Milosevic is again on \nthe warpath. . . . and, there should be no doubt that Serbia is engaged \nin major, systematic attacks on the people and territory of Kosovo.''\n  The United States has been assertive in condemning Serbian \naggression. The Clinton administration has spoken out repeatedly \nagainst Serb human rights abuses in Kosovo, and has stated that it will \nnot let Serbs follow through with their ethnic cleansing. The Congress \ntoo has felt it extremely important to go on record to denounce \nYugoslav President Milosevic and the Serbian military and security \nforces under his direction. We in the Senate also called upon the \ninternational community to act forcefully if Serbian armed aggression \ncontinued. Sadly Serbian aggression has continued. Innocent Kosovans \nhave lost mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles.\n  There is a time for words and a time for force. Ambassador Richard \nHolbrooke has been trying as I speak to convince Milosevic to alter \ncourse. The latest information indicates that these efforts are \nunlikely to produce positive results. To my mind, that means that the \ntime for words is over. Our entreaties to Milosevic to do the right \nthing have fallen on deaf ears. Milosevic and his Serbian forces have \nbeen mocking the international community by declaring one thing and \ndoing another.\n  The time has come for the international community to confront the \nobvious contradictions between the words and deeds of Milosevic and the \nSerbian security forces under his command--saying on the one hand that \na unilateral cease fire has been established and continuing on the \nother hand with his attacks on ethnic Albanian villages. The Serbian \nSeptember 26, cease-fire declaration was pure theater. Frankly so was \nlast weekend's ``withdrawal'' of Serbian forces. At the very moment \nthat Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic publicly declared that the \nseven-month offensive against the militant separatists was over, \nfighting continued in southern Kosovo.\n  Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past and give Milosevic another \nchance to mislead the international community. Russian objections to \nthe use of force by NATO should carry no weight at this juncture. NATO \nhas given Milosevic its final ultimatum--to comply immediately with all \nUN and NATO demands to end the crackdown in Kosovo, withdraw government \nforces and open meaningful political negotiations with the ethnic \nAlbanians.\n\n[[Page S12244]]\n\n  NATO's military options both to stop fighting and to enforce a \npossible peace settlement have been planned in detail over the past \nmonths. NATO's military staff is prepared to act. All that is needed is \nthe political will upon the part of NATO governments to give the green \nlight. We can no longer afford to show any more patience for the \nindecision of our Allies. In my view the internationally community has \nalready waited too long to put an end to the human suffering that is \nbeing inflicted on innocent men, women and children. After seven years \nof watching Milosevic play cat and mouse games with United States and \nEuropean leaders, I believe that the only language this individual will \nrespond to is the sound of missiles hitting and crushing strategic \ntargets in his proverbial backyard.\n  Mr. President, yesterday NATO Foreign Ministers met in Brussels. In \nreporting on the outcome of that meeting, Secretary of State Madeleine \nAlbright reported that NATO was united and ready to authorize bombing \nin Serbia. Earlier this week, President Clinton assured members of the \nSenate that any air strikes conducted by NATO against Serbia would not \nbe ``pinprick\" strikes but would ``send a very clear signal'' that we \nmean business.\n  We in the United States need to lead by example. We cannot wait any \nlonger--for humanitarian reasons, for human rights reasons, and for \ngeo-political reasons. If the international community fails to respond \nto Milosevic's continued assaults on Kosovo with force if necessary, \nthen shortly there will be few if any ethnic Albanians left to protect \nin Kosovo and stability in the greater Balkans will be at risk.\n  Mr. President, I know that many of my colleagues share my views. I \nbelieve the American people as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12243-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE 1968 AND 1998 BASEBALL SEASONS\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks about \na fellow Nebraskan and to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his \nlegendary baseball season.\n  ``Let us go forth a while and get better air in our lungs. Let us \nleave our close rooms. The game of ball is glorious.''--Walt Whitman.\n  Indeed, this year baseball has been ``glorious.''\n  The highlight of my job is traveling our state and going into \ncommunities to listen and learn. These learning discussions reflect the \ndiverse and varied needs of our state, but this summer there has been \none constant in all of my meetings. From Omaha to Ogallala, from \nBellevue to Beatrice, everywhere throughout the State, Nebraskans have \nbeen talking baseball--specifically, the heroics of Mark McGwire and \nSammy Sosa.\n  This year's heroics have left me reminiscing about the 30th \nanniversary of another magical summer, this one in 1968, when the eyes \nof the world were trained on a native Nebraskan--the great Bob Gibson. \nThe St. Louis Cardinal unleashed onto the baseball world quit possibly \nthe best season a pitcher has ever thrown.\n  Nebraskans have come together to watch McGwire and Sosa pursue the \nnumber 61 in a way no one thought possible. It was as if these two \nhitting giants entered a zone unknown to us mortals. Before this \nseason, it seemed unheard of to even mention the numbers 70 and 66. \nAllowing us to follow in their chase was like joining two explorers on \nthe verge of discovering a new world.\n  The highlight of many a long day this season was to watch the nightly \nedition of ESPN's Sportcenter and see which man was setting history \nthat day. At a time when divisions were tugging at the seams of our \npolitical system, baseball brought us together. Every American--\nRepublican or Democrat, right, left or center--found common ground in \nwatching these baseball pioneers explore a new sports frontier.\n  For me, only Bob Gibson's 1968 heroics match up with this season's, \n1998 was as enjoyable as 1968 because of the tremendous season Bob \nGibson had. As a New York Yankee fan, I have earlier, unhappier \nmemories of Gibson. It was the 1964 World Series and the Cardinals were \nfacing a tough Yankees lineup featuring Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle, and \nWhitey Ford. I was convinced the Bronx Bombers would win out. It was \nnot to be. The determined Gibson won twice and finished off the series \nwith a victory in the seventh and final game, earning the Most Valuable \nPlayer award.\n  In 1968, Gibson was coming off another World Series MVP award as the \nCardinals defeated Carl Yastrzemski's Red Sox the previous year. Gibson \nstarted that season with some hard luck losses and did not get going \nuntil late spring. But once he got going, there was no stopping this \ntrain.\n  That summer I was in SEAL Team training in San Diego. A lot of people \nthere were snarling, but none of them could match the menace Gibson \nwore on his face when he ascended the mound. When Gibson came to the \nmound, everyone in the park could feel his intensity. As his catcher, \nTim McCarver, would say, he had the ``Look.'' It seemed as though \nGibson could ``Look'' a strikeout before he even began his pitching \nmotion. He was a command pitcher who mastered the edge he needed for \neach batter who dared to engage him in combat. His renowned discipline, \nhis pure intimidation and his intellect for the game created a master \ncraftsman in the art of pitching. Whether it be his blazing fastball or \nhis snapping slider, the sight of Gibson with his right leg ominously \nmoving from beginning to end, while unraveling his cannon of a right \narm, exploding the unhittable white ball into the leather of the \ncatcher's paws was a sight for all.\n  In the beginning of June of 1968, Gibson began to unveil a \nperformance so dominating, so powerful, it seemed as though the mystery \nof pitching had finally been solved and only Gibson had the blueprints, \nhand-delivered from the creators of the game. Starting in early June \nand finishing in early August, Gibson had thrown an astounding 10 \nshutouts. If not for one earned run against the Dodgers, Gibson would \nhave finished with 71 straight scoreless innings, easily surpassing the \nrecord of 59 Orel Hershiser set in 1988. At one point, Gibson had \npitched 95 innings, which is almost a half season for today's pitchers, \nand allowed only 2 earned runs, for an unheard-of ERA of 0.19.\n  This season, Randy Johnson led baseball with six shutouts. In 1968, \nGibson had 13, shutting out every team but the Dodgers. The end of Cal \nRipken's streak this year reminded us of the value of baseball's work \nethic. In 1968, Gibson was also a dominating workhorse, completing 28 \nof his 34 starts and going into the eighth inning in all but two. Led \nby his fastball and slider, Gibson was the league champion in \nstrikeouts with 268.\n  Recounting Gibson's 1968 season, Chicago Cubs Hall of Famer Billy \nWilliams would say many right-handed batters suffered ``Gibbyitis''--a \nmysterious malady that would somehow take batters ill on the day their \nteam faced Gibson.\n  Gibson finished the 1968 season with a 1.12 ERA--which is the record \nfor over 300 innings pitched, besting Walter Johnson's 1.14 in 1913. He \nwon both the Cy Young Award and the MVP of the 1968 season, while also \nearning another Golden Glove Award for his strong fielding. His \nrecordsetting exploits did not end in the regular season, as he set \nanother Herculean record when he mercilessly fanned 17 Detroit Tigers \nin the World Series.\n  Bob Gibson dominated 1968. While doing so, he marveled America with a \nperformance so strong, so masterful, so historic, that it should be \nremembered at a time 30 years later when two others stunned the country \nwith their mythical skills. Nebraskans should be proud that one of us \ncould produce such a season. I want to thank baseball for 1968 and \n1998, both `glorious' years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12244-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12244-S12245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n APPRECIATION FOR DEDICATED STAFF OF THE CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President. In these closing days of \nthe 105th Congress, I would be remiss if I did not pay tribute to those \nwho toil everyday behind the scenes to make our lives easier. I am \nspeaking of the very dedicated and professional group of public \nservants who comprise the Congressional Research Service.

It is \nthis type of dedicated service that government employees all too often \nperform, and no one hears anything about it. This is a group of people \nwho take their commitment to the Congress and the American people very \nseriously. And they deliver.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Research Service provides a truly \nunique and indispensable service to the Congress. It has certainly made \nmy first term as a U.S. Senator easier and more productive. I \ncongratulate all of the workers there on their fine work and extend to \nthem my heartfelt thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12244-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BIRMINGHAM ROTARY CLUB 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nBirmingham Rotary Club on the occasion of their 75th Anniversary of \nservice to the community.\n  The Birmingham Rotary Club was organized on March 19, 1924, by \nfifteen of the community, business and professional leaders. The club \nhas an illustrious past with many local activities attributed to or \nbegun by the Rotary Club including The Halloween Parade. At Seaholm \nHigh School, they dedicated the Rotary Memorial in 1950 to those who \nhave died in service to our country, sculpted by Marshall Fredericks, \nalso a Birmingham Rotarian and in 1992, a baseball scoreboard. The J.B. \nHowarth City Park was dedicated and named for a Birmingham Rotarian. \nKenning Park is named for Bob Kenning (Retired City Manager of \nBirmingham), also a Birmingham Rotarian and past club president.\n  The Club has made numerous contributions to the community from \nfurnishing the Rotary Room at the Baldwin Library and computer system \nat the Community House to the elevator and picnic shelter at Springdale \nPark. In addition, they support numerous schools, community groups and \nthose who are less fortunate during Thanksgiving and the holiday \nseason. Rotary has hosted international exchange students and has \nsponsored local students to go abroad through the International Rotary \nScholarship Foundation.\n  Currently, the Birmingham Rotary Club is helping establish an \nInteract Club at Seaholm High School to involve high school age \nstudents in ``Service Above Self''. They are also supporting Polio \nPlus, to eradicate Polio worldwide by the year 2000, with a sizeable \ndonation from all of the membership.\n  Over the past 75 years, the Birmingham Rotary Club has had a positive \ninfluence in the community and around the world. Through the tireless \ndedication and leadership of their 140 person membership, the Club's \ninfluence will only continue to grow and benefit those in the community \nand those who are less fortunate.\n  As one of Michigan's finest examples of volunteerism, I want to \nexpress my congratulations to all members of the Birmingham Rotary Club \nin recognition of their 75th Anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12245-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF ROBERT MARTIN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take the opportunity \ntoday to honor Robert (Bob) Martin for his years of hard work and \ncommitment to the people of South Dakota. I would also like to extend \nmy warmest wishes and congratulate Bob on his upcoming retirement.\n  Bob, a native of Estelline, South Dakota, graduated from high school \nin 1952. After his graduation Bob joined the United States Navy and \nproudly served from 1952-1956. Following his military service, he \nattended Dakota State University in Madison, South Dakota receiving a \nbachelors degree in 1960. With a degree in hand, Bob became a welcomed \naddition to the faculty in the Madison School System where I am certain \nhe inspired many students to pursue their dreams.\n  In 1965, Bob joined KEM Electric Cooperative, in Linton, North \nDakota, serving as Public and Member Relations and Power Use Director. \nComing back to his South Dakota roots, Bob returned to Madison in 1970 \nto become Member Service Director for East River Electric Power \nCooperative and eventually Assistant to the General Manager at East \nRiver, a position he held until 1983. Ultimately, Bob became Manager of \nthe Member Services and Public Affairs Division and remained in this \nposition until 1990. In 1990, Bob left East River Electric to become \nGeneral Manager of Rushmore Electric Power Cooperative located in Rapid \nCity, South Dakota.\n  Bob's lifetime of service to rural electric cooperatives is \nimpressive and reflects his commitment to public power and the \ncritically important role rural electric cooperatives play in rural \nAmerica. Bob has been a leader on many different issues important to \npublic power and rural electrics, from preventing the privatization of \nthe Power Marketing Administrations to helping further rural water \nefforts in South Dakota. Rural electric cooperatives are an important \nfactor in the economic development of their communities and in many \ncases, they are the best equipped to work to ensure small communities \nremain viable and continue to keep medical facilities, schools and \nother services available. I am convinced the importance of rural \ncooperatives will continue to grow, but it will require the dedication \nof more individuals like Bob Martin to ensure the future of public \npower.\n  Today, Bob is a member of the South Dakota School of Mines and \nTechnology Citizens Advisory Committee; a Director on the Board of the \nMid-West Electric Consumers Association; chairs the Rapid City Chamber \nof Commerce Agriculture Committee; and is Chairman of the Pennington \nCounty Extension Board.\n  In addition to his military, scholastic, and professional \nachievements Bob and his wife, Kay have four grown children and five \ngrandchildren. Again, I would like to thank Bob for all he has done to \nbetter South Dakota and I would like to wish him best of luck in his \nretirement. Although I imagine that keeping up with five grandchildren \nis not exactly retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12245-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12245-S12246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MICELL TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to commend a rising \ncompany in the Tarheel State and use its positive example to encourage \nmy colleagues to recognize and support the role environmental \ntechnologies are playing in our economy.\n  Micell Technologies of Raleigh has made great strides in improving \ncarbon dioxide cleaning methods which may soon revolutionize the dry \ncleaning, metal finishing and textile industries. This company's \nenvironmentally friendly and energy efficient innovation, which is the \nresult of research by a prominent professor and students at the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has recently earned \nrecognition by R magazine as one of the top 100 innovations of 1998.\n  I would also like to share a column authored by Anna Vondrak that \nappeared recently in the Greensboro News & Record calling for the \nfederal government to provide more research and development funding to \nstimulate environmental discoveries as well as tax and other incentives \nfor polluting, less energy efficient companies to seek alternative \nmanufacturing processes.\n  I respectfully request that this statement and accompanying article \nby Ms. Vondrak by printed in the Record.\n\n          [From the Greensboro News & Record, Sept. 27, 1998]\n\n  N.C. Firm Shows the Power of ``Green'' Research; Government Should \n         Encourage More Environmental Research and Development.\n\n                           (By Anna Vondrak)\n\n       Congress is notorious for its tendency to divert money for \n     research and development to well-larded pork projects.\n       The federal government is spending $74 billion on R this \n     year. But more than half of that goes to defense. A third of \n     the rest goes to medical research, which consumes a rising \n     share of federal research dollars.\n       In today's rapidly changing world, however, technological \n     innovation by small firms will become increasingly important \n     in ensuring economic success and environmental protection. \n     Improved technologies can help industries move from dirty, \n     energy-\n\n[[Page S12246]]\n\n     guzzling manufacturing processes to clean, energy-efficient \n     ones.\n       An example of seemingly mundane but significant \n     environmental innovation comes from Micell Technologies, a \n     start-up firm based in North Carolina, in the heart of the \n     famed Research Triangle.\n       Formed in 1995 by three scientists--Joseph DeSimone, \n     Timothy Romack and James McClain--Micell employs just 26 \n     people. This small team is on the verge of solving one of \n     this nations' most pervasive environmental problems.\n       Today, most dry cleaners rely on toxic solvents, such as \n     percholoroethylene, or PERC, which can contaminate ground \n     water and may cause cancer in humans after long-term \n     exposure. While liquid carbon dioxide has long been seen as \n     an environmentally positive alternative, it has not fared \n     well in the marketplace because it simply cannot clean \n     garments to acceptable standards by itself.\n       Led by DeSimone, a soft-spoken chemistry professor who  co-\n     invented the process with his students, scientists at UNC-\n     Chapel Hill, developed new detergents that dissolve in \n     liquid CO2.\n       Not only is the toxic substance PERC removed from the dry \n     cleaning equation, but Micell's two new cleaning systems, \n     Micare and Miclean, separate and recover the CO2 and \n     detergents they use. Those waste products can then be \n     recycled--an important factor in preventing run-off pollution \n     from reaching sensitive waterways.\n       Just as important, Micell's innovation also will play a \n     major role in protecting the health of tens of thousands \n     employees in America's dry cleaning industry--and quite \n     likely millions of their customers as well.\n       The firm's accomplishment caught the eye of R Magazine, \n     which named it a winner of its annual R 100 Awards, long \n     regarded as the ``Oscars of Invention.''\n       Thus, a humble dry cleaner joins the fax machines, antilock \n     brakes, and the ubiquitous ATM created by far larger \n     corporations as a leader in cutting-edge technology.\n       Micell's experience shows that academic research and small \n     company entrepreneurship may be the fastest--and greenest--\n     path to the marketplace.\n       Congress should speed the discovery process by establishing \n     new R tax credits and low-interest loans to encourage small \n     businesses and universities to expand research activities.\n       The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recently \n     pledged to double funding for the National Institutes of \n     Health over five years--for starters--increasing NIH funding \n     by $2 billion this year. Experts in the medical community \n     believe the funding increase will pay huge public health \n     dividends.\n       Similarly, significant increases in federal funding that \n     supports research for new environmental technologies also \n     will produce big benefits for Americans--less pollution-\n     driven disease, a greener planet and new industries that \n     create jobs and enhance prosperity.\n       Continuing technological innovation is the key to America's \n     economic and environmental health as it enters the 21st \n     century. Congress should move quickly to bolster R and tax \n     incentives in this key area. The time to act is now, while \n     the U.S. still enjoys global economic dominance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12245-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNITION FOR RID-REMOVE INTOXICATED DRIVERS\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, 1998 marks the 20th anniversary of \nRID-Remove Intoxicated Drivers. Formed in 1978 by Doris Aiken in New \nYork, the organization has focused its efforts on educating the public \non the impact of abusive alcohol use, offering support for the victims \nof drunk drivers and advocating for stricter laws on DWI.\n  RID has lobbied for the enactment of laws that will eliminate plea \nbargains for repeat offenders and funds for anti-DWI enforcement. With \nall their hard work, RID is able to claim credit for high safety \nratings experienced in New York State. RID has also advocated for the \nlowering of the blood alcohol content from .1% to .08% as well as \nenhanced penalties for drunk drivers whose passengers are minors.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety recognized the accomplishments of \nRID and awarded them the 1998 Public Service Award for their effective \ncampaign to deter drunk driving. Their efforts contributed to New York \nbeing selected as having one of the safest records against drunk \ndriving in the Nation for the fifth year.\n  In 1996, over 17,000 people died in drunk driving accidents, \naccounting for 41% of the total traffic fatalities of that year. While \nthere was a 29% reduction from the alcohol related fatalities in 1986, \nit is still high--17,126 people too high. The senseless death of these \nindividuals, the pain and anguish experienced by the family and friends \nand the hundreds of thousands who were injured can never truly be \nexpressed through statistics.

The vigil \nrecognizes survivors, family members, and those who have lost their \nlives to domestic violence, in addition to educating the community \nabout the resources available to the victims of domestic violence.\n  The Bay County Women's Center reaches out to survivors of physical, \nemotional, and sexual abuse. It provides a safe, supportive, non-\njudgmental environment for survivors to make decisions about their \nlives and families. In addition to offering extensive counseling, the \nCenter goes so far as to assist with job search skills, housing \noptions, and child care services.\n  The Vigil and Speakout draw attention to a problem that is all too \ncommon in hopes that we can work together toward a solution. It will \njoin citizens, groups of professionals, and community leaders in an \neffort to stress to the Bay community that violence is inexcusable and \nwill not be tolerated. Because the tragedy of domestic violence affects \nfar too many American families, I commend the tireless work of the Bay \nCounty Women's Center in helping reverse domestic violence statistics \nand assist the victims of violence. The Center is truly an invaluable \nasset to Michigan's families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12246-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF PHILIP AND MARGE ODEEN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

They have given freely to non-profit organizations in terms \nof time and money, have consistently taken the lead in getting others \ninvolved, and most importantly have positively affected the lives of \nnumerous men, women, and children in the Washington area.\n  I would like to commend the Odeens for their numerous contributions \nto the Northern Virginia Community; their community leadership serves \nas a model for the citizens of both Virginia and South Dakota to \nemulate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12246-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12246-S12249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE CHARTER SCHOOL EXPANSION ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am pleased with the passage by UC \nof the bipartisan substitute amendment to HR 2616, the Charter School \nExpansion Act. Senator Lieberman and I introduced this bill last \nNovember to help further expand the charter school movement which is so \nsuccessfully providing new educational opportunities\n\n[[Page S12247]]\n\nfor children all around this country. This bill passed unanimously out \nof the Labor Committee and was unanimously approved by the Senate last \nnight.\n  This important bill builds upon the great success of the original \ncharter school legislation which Senator Lieberman and former Senator \nDurenberger introduced in 1994. The Federal Charter School Grant \nProgram provides seed money to charter school operators to help them \npay for the planning, design and initial implementation of a charter \nschool. Since this program's inception, the number of charter schools \nhas tripled, with over 1100 charter schools now operating in 33 States \nand the District of Columbia.\n  Charter schools are independent public schools that have been freed \nfrom onerous bureaucratic and regulatory burdens in order to pursue \nclear objectives and goals aimed at increasing student achievement. To \nincrease student achievement, charter schools are able to design and \ndeliver educational programs tailored to meet the needs of their \nstudents and their communities.\n  It is the individualized education available to students through \ncharter schools that makes this a desirable educational alternative for \nmany families. Charter schools give families an opportunity to choose \nthe educational setting that best meet their child's needs. For many \nlow-income families in particular, charter schools provide their first \nopportunity to select an educational setting which is best suited for \ntheir child.\n  Parents and educators have, in turn, given these programs \noverwhelmingly high marks. Broad-based studies conducted by the \nDepartment of Education and the Hudson Institute show that charters are \neffectively serving diverse populations, particularly disadvantaged and \nat-risk children, that traditional public schools have struggled to \neducate.\n  With results like these, it is no wonder that some of the strongest \nsupport for charter legislation comes from low-income families. Not \nonly do these parents now have real educational choices, but they are \nactually needed in the charter school environment for everything from \nvolunteering to coaching, fundraising, and even teaching. This direct \ninvolvement of families is helping to build small communities centered \naround the school.\n  Charter schools can be started by anyone interested in providing a \nquality education: Parents, teachers, school administrators, community \ngroups, businesses and colleges can all apply for a charter. And, \nimportantly, if these schools fail to deliver a high-quality education, \nthey will be closed--either through a district or State's \naccountability measures or from lack of students. Accountability is \nliterally built into the charter school process--the school must comply \nwith the provisions in its charter, and unhappy parents and students \ncan leave if they are not satisfied.\n  Additionally, a survey conducted last fall by the National School \nBoards Association (NSBA) found that the charter movement is already \nhaving a positive ripple effect that is being felt in many local public \nschool districts. The NSBA report cites evidence that traditional \npublic schools are working harder to please local families so they \nwon't abandon them to competing charter schools, and that central \nadministrators often see charters as ``a powerful tool'' to develop new \nideas and programs without fearing regulatory roadblocks.\n  Several other studies have recently been released highlighting the \nsuccess of charter schools around the country. Among other things, \nthese studies have shown that charter schools have successfully met and \nsurpassed the standards outlined in their charters, attracted \nsignificant proportions of minority and low-income students, and have \nhigher parental approval rates than public schools.\n  The results of these studies point to important ways to improve and \nreinvent public education as a whole. The implications from the success \nof charter schools indicate that public schools should be consumer-\noriented, diverse, results-oriented, and professional places that also \nfunction as mediating institutions in their communities.\n  The purpose of this bill is to further encourage the growth of high-\nquality charter schools around the country. This bill provides \nincentives to encourage States to increase the number of high quality \ncharter schools in their State. To qualify for funding under this bill, \nStates must satisfy two criteria. First, they must provide for review \nand evaluation of their charter schools by the public chartering agency \nat least once every five years to ensure that the charter school is \nmeeting the terms of its charter and meeting its academic performance \nrequirements. And second, States meet at least one of three priority \ncriteria:\n  The State has demonstrated progress in increasing the number of high \nquality charter schools that meet clear and measurable objectives for \nthe educational progress of their students;\n  The State provides an alternative to the local educational agency as \nthe public chartering agency through either another authorized public \nchartering agency or an appeals process; or\n  The State ensure that each charter school has a high degree of \nautomony over the charter school's budgets and expenditures.\n  These priority criteria were included to encourage States to develop \ncharter school laws that promote diversified educational opportunities \nbalanced with high expectations, clear objectives, and strong \naccountability measures.\n  This bill continues the primary focus of charter school grants for \nthe planning, design and implementation costs of new charter schools. \nThis bill adds another purpose for which grants can be used by States--\nStates may now reserve up to 10 percent of their grant funds to support \nthe dissemination activities of successful charter schools. These \ndissemination grants can go to charter school operators to help \nencourage education reform by spreading the lessons learned by \nsuccessful charter schools and assist in the creation of new charters \nand the reform and reinvigoration of other public schools.\n  To help ensure that the amount of the federal grants are proportional \nto the level of charter school activity in the State, this bill directs \nthe Secretary to take into consideration the number of charter schools \nin operation, or that have been approved to open.\n  During drafting of this bill, the single greatest concern I heard \nfrom charter school operators related to their ability to access their \nfair share of federal education funding. And so, to ensure that charter \nschools have enough funding to continue once their doors are opened, \nthis bill provides that charter schools get their fair share of federal \nprograms for which they are eligible, such as Title 1 and IDEA. The \nbill also directs States to inform their charter schools of any Federal \nfunds to which they are entitled.\n  This bill also increases the financing options available to charter \nschools and allows them to utilize funds from the Title VI block grant \nprogram for start-up costs.\n  Because it is so important that charter schools are held accountable \nin return for the flexibility they are given from Federal, state and \nlocal laws and regulations, this amendment includes several significant \nprovisions which strengthen accountability. First, under the priority \ncriteria, States must review and evaluate their charter schools at \nleast once every five years to ensure that they are meeting the terms \nof their charter and their academic performance requirements. They are \nrewarded for increasing the number of high quality charter schools that \nare ``held accountable in their charter for meeting clear and \nmeasurable objectives for the educational progress of their students.''\n  The definitions section of the bill also stresses accountability by \nrequiring a written performance contract with the authorized chartering \nagency in the State. These written performance contracts include \nclearly defined objectives for the charter school to meet in return for \nthe autonomy they are given. The performance objectives in the contract \nare to be measured by State assessments and other assessments the \ncharter wishes to use.\n  I am confident that this amendment will build on and contribute to \nthe success of the charter school movement. This bill stresses the need \nfor high quality, accountable schools which are given autonomy they \nneed to provide the best educational opportunity for their students.\n  With the passage of this bill, a strong signal will be sent to \nparents and\n\n[[Page S12248]]\n\nteachers all across this country that they are not alone in their \nstruggle to improve education. We hope to ease their struggle by \nenabling new charter schools to be developed. More charter schools will \nresult in greater accountability, broader flexibility for classroom \ninnovation, and ultimately more choice in public education. I urge my \ncolleagues to increase educational opportunities for all children by \nsupporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Lieberman for his \ntremendous leadership in the area of educational reform. He and I have \nworked closely on a number of issues over the last several years, and I \nwant to commend him, in particular, for his strong support and \nleadership on issues concerning increasing educational opportunities \nfor low-income children. He understands so clearly the fundamental \nimportance of providing a high quality education in a safe environment \nto our neediest children. In addition to this charter schools bill, \nwhich will help to increase educational opportunities for low-income \nchildren, Senator Lieberman and I have worked closely for the last 4 \nyears to gain support for publicly-funded scholarships for low-income \nchildren. I want to thank him for his unwavering commitment to this \nissue and his vitally important leadership. His efforts have done much \nto win bipartisan support for both charter schools and low-income \nscholarships and I thank him for his strong commitment to our country's \nneediest children. With the passage of this charter schools bill, \nSenator Lieberman and I have the pleasure of seeing the first of our \njoint educational reform initiatives move closer to becoming law.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a summary of the study results to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  The summary follows:\n\n              Findings From Key Studies on Charter Schools\n\n       The Department of Education released its first formal \n     report on its study of charter schools in May 1998. Key \n     first-year findings include:\n       The two most common reasons for starting public charter \n     schools are flexibility from bureaucratic laws and \n     regulations, and the chance to realize an educational vision.\n       In most states, charter schools have a racial composition \n     similar to statewide averages or have a higher proportion of \n     minority students.\n       Charter schools enroll roughly the same proportion of low-\n     income students, on average, as other public schools.\n       The Hudson Institute has also undertaken its own two-year \n     study of charter schools, entitled ``Charter Schools in \n     Action.'' Their research team traveled to 14 states, visited \n     60 schools, and surveyed thousands of parents, teachers, and \n     students. Some of this study's key findings include:\n       Three-fifths of charter school students report that their \n     charter school teachers are better than their previous \n     school's teacher.\n       Over two-thirds of parents say their charter school is \n     better than their child's previous schools with respect to \n     class size, school size, and individual attention.\n       Over 90 percent of teachers are satisfied with their \n     charter school's educational philosophy, size, fellow \n     teachers, and students.\n       Among students who said they were failing at their previous \n     school, more than half are now doing ``excellent'' or \n     ``good'' work. These gains were dramatic for minority and \n     low-income youngsters and were confirmed by their parents.\n       Most of the top charter schools are not only meeting the \n     high standards they have set for themselves, but surpassing \n     them.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, last night the Senate \nunanimously approved H.R. 2616, the Charter School Expansion Act, a \npiece of legislation that Senator Coats and I, along with many others, \nhave been working on for the better part of the past two years. the \nHouse is expected to pass this bill today under suspension and send on \nto the President, who has pledged to sign it into law.\n  I rise today to express my deep appreciation to our colleagues for \ntheir strong bipartisan support of this bill, and to add a few brief \nwords about the significance of its passage, which I am afraid may get \nlost amidst the last-minute flurry of activity this week before \nCongress adjourns.\n  It would not be too difficult to overlook this legislation. Compared \nto some of the high-profile education bills we have considered \nrecently, this is a modest and largely anonymous proposal, which will \nstrengthen our support for charter schools and encourage states to \ncreate more of these innovative, independent programs. It will not fix \nall or even much of what ails our public education system. It will not \nsinglehandedly sate the demands of parents for safer schools, better \nteachers, smaller classes, and smarter students. Nor will it settle the \nlongstanding and often inflammatory debate over education reform that \nhas divided the parties and effectively stymied the efforts of this \nCongress to respond to the public's growing concerns.\n  But nevertheless, I believe that this may turn out to be one of the \nmost important and constructive bills that we enact into law during \nthis season. What we have agreed to do today will help take the charter \nschool model from novelty to the norm in this country, and thereby \nbolster the most promising engine of education reform at work in \nAmerica today. The Charter School Expansion Act will spur the growth of \nhundreds of high-quality and highly-accountable schools of choice, \nwhich in the next few years will expand the educational opportunities \navailable to thousands of American children, and could over the long \nhaul help to reshape the public school for the 21st Century.\n  Perhaps just as noteworthy as what this legislation will do, though, \nis the simple fact that we agreed to do it. As my colleagues are well \naware, we have struggled throughout this Congress to reach a consensus \non how to improve our schools, fighting a series of pitched partisan \nbattles that have bogged down several thoughtful proposals from both \nsides, and leaving the public to question our ability to address these \ncritical issues. By adopting this bill with unanimous support, I think \nwe have made an important statement that we can get things done, that \nwe can find common ground to strengthen the common school. And I am \nhopeful, despite the deep policy differences still dividing many of us, \nthat this bill will lay the groundwork for more bipartisan cooperation \nnext year as we prepare to reauthorize the massive Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act and proceed with what may be the most \nconsequential education debate of our lifetime.\n  In marking this accomplishment, I want to thank Senator Coats, who I \nhave had the great pleasure of working on many education reform \ninitiatives over the last few years, and our fellow cosponsors, \nSenators Kerrey of Nebraska, D'Amato, and Landrieu, who made this a \nbipartisan effort from the start. I will sorely miss Senator Coats' \npartnership next year as this great education debate continues, but I \nam glad that, after many years of frustratingly close votes we have \nendured together, he can leave on a resounding note of success.\n  I particularly want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nLabor Committee, Senators Jeffords and Kennedy, for their leadership in \nshepherding this bill to the floor. I know there were some difficult \nissues that had to be resolved to bring our proposal out of committee, \nand I am grateful to my colleagues from Vermont and Massachusetts for \nthe time and energy they devoted to getting that done. We simply could \nnot have beat the legislative clock were it not for their persistence \nand skilled bridge-building.\n  I also want to pay tribute to our former colleague, Senator \nDurenberger, whose vision and creativity made this legislation possible \nin the first place. In 1992 and 1993, a band of pioneering teachers and \nparents in Minnesota founded the nation's first charter schools, and \ntheir efforts inspired Senator Durenberger to propose a national pilot \nprogram to help other communities around the country experiment with \nthis progressive reform model. I was proud to join with Senator \nDurenberger four years ago in cosponsoring the bill authorizing this \npilot program, now known as the Federal Charter School Grant Program. \nCongress approved this initiative with strong bipartisan majorities, \nand in the years since it has provided $75 million to help new charters \nto defray the burdensome cost of starting a school from scratch.\n  Today, thanks in part to this Federal seed money, the charter school \nmovement has quickly spread throughout the nation. As of this fall, \nmore than 1,100 charters are operating in 26 states, including my home \nstate of Connecticut, as well as the District of Columbia, quadrupling \nthe number that were in business just four years ago. In the past nine \nmonths alone, four additional states passed new charter laws, and more \nthan a half dozen\n\n[[Page S12249]]\n\nothers strengthened their laws and significantly expanded their \nprograms. In California, for example, the state legislature broadly \nsupported a move to raise the state cap on charters from 100 to 250 of \nthis year and allow the creation of 100 additional schools each \nsucceeding year. And just last month in Texas, the state board of \neducation approved the creation of 85 new schools, more than doubling \nthe existing number.\n  This is truly a grass-roots revolution, led by parents and teachers \nand community activists, which is seeking to reinvent the public school \nand take it back to the future, reconnecting public education to some \nof our oldest, most basic values--ingenuity, responsibility, \naccountability--and refocusing its mission on doing what's best for the \nchild instead of what's best for the system.\n  The results so far have been quite encouring. Parents of charter \nschool students overwhelmingly give their programs high marks, \nparticularly for their responsiveness and the sense of community they \nfoster. Also, broad-based studies done by the Hudson Institute and the \nEducation Department show that charters are effectively serving diverse \npopulations, especially many of the disadvantaged and at-risk children \nthat traditional public schools have struggled to educate. And while \nit's too soon to determine what impact charter schools are having on \noverall academic performance, the early returns suggest that charters \nare succeeding where it matters most, in the classroom.\n  A survey done last fall by the National School Boards Association \nfound that the charter movement is already having a positive ripple \neffect that is being felt in many local public school districts. The \nNSBA report cites evidence that traditional public schools are working \nharder to please local families so they won't abandon them to competing \ncharter schools, and that central administrators often see charters as \na ``a powerful tool'' to develop new ideas and programs without fearing \nregulatory roadblocks.\n  The most remarkable aspect of the charter movement may be that it has \nmanaged to bring together citizens, educators, business leaders and \npoliticians from across the political spectrum in support of a mutual \ngoal to better educate our children through more choice, more \nflexibility and more accountablity in our public schools. In these \ngrass-roots, as I suggested above, may lie the roots of a consensus for \nrenewing the promise of public education and ending the left-right \nstalemate that has too often impeded the reform debate.\n  We want to build on that broad agreement at the local and state level \nand do what we can at the Federal level to support and encourage the \ngrowth of this movement, which is just what the legislation we approved \ntoday will do. It starts by revamping the charter grant program to \nfocus it more on helping states and local groups create new schools and \nmeet the President's goal of creating 3,000 charters by the year 2000.\n  Specifically, it calls for gradually increasing the grant funding \nover the next several years, and then better targeting those additional \ndollars to the states that are serious about expanding their charter \nprogram. It would do so by establishng several ``priority'' criteria \nthat would give preference in awarding start-up grants to those states \nthat show real progress in creating high-quality, highly-accountable \ncharters. Our hope is that these changes will give states that have \nbeen slow to embrace the charter movement an incentive to get on board. \nThe intent is not to punish those states that are moving cautiously, \nbut instead to reward the ones that are prepared to harness this \nprogressive force for change and encourage others to do the same.\n  The CSEA would also tighten some unintended loopholes in the original \nstatute that have hampered the effectiveness of the program, ensure \nthat charter schools receive their fair share of funding from the major \nFederal categorical grant programs, and take some initial steps to \nwiden the pool of funding sources for those charters that are \nstruggling to stay alive. And to enhance the potential for all children \nto benefit from charter successes, this legislation directs the \nSecretary of Education to work with the states to in effect establish \nan ``innovation pipeline'' that would share information about what is \nworking in charter schools to public school districts around the \ncountry.\n  That, in the end, is really what this bill and the charter school \nmovement in general are all about, which is improving the whole of our \npublic education system. As Norman Atkin, a founder and director of the \nNorth Star Academy Charter School in Newark, has said, charter schools \nhave the potential to serve as the ``R arm'' of public education, \nincubating new ideas that could benefit millions of students. And in \ntime hopefully every public school will put into practice the \nprinciples undergirding the charter model, and every public school will \nbe liberated from some of the top-heavy bureaucracy that too often \nsuffocates them and in turn pledge to meet high standards of \nachievement for which they will be held strictly accountable, and every \npublic school will benefit from the positive forces of choice and \ncompetition.\n  For now, we have taken an important step toward that goal today, and \npassed a piece of legislation that I am confident will make a real and \nimmediate difference in the lives of many children in this country. I \nagain want to thank my colleagues for their broad vote of confidence in \nthe charter movement, and I look forward to working with them next year \non new blueprint for education reform that will incorporate the \nsubstance and spirit of what we have achieved today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12246-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION CONTINUING \n                           GOVERNMENT FUNDING\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Res. 296\n\n       World War II is the defining event of the 20th century;\n       Whereas in World War II, over 16,000,000 American men and \n     women served the Nation, of which nearly 300,000 were killed \n     and over 670,000 were wounded;\n       Whereas in Public Law 103-422 (108 Stat. 4356), Congress \n     approved the location of a memorial to this epic event in \n     Area I of the District of Columbia and its environs, as \n     described in the Act entitled ``An Act to provide standards \n     for placement of commemorative works on certain Federal lands \n     in the District of Columbia and its environs, and for other \n     purposes'', approved November 14, 1986 (40 U.S.C. 1001 et \n     seq.); and\n       Whereas Congress has traditionally provided funding for the \n     memorials commemorating President Thomas Jefferson and \n     President Abraham Lincoln, the monument to President George \n     Washington, and the Korean War Veterans Memorial: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. FUNDING OF A WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, on completion of \n     construction of a World War II Memorial in Area I of the \n     District of Columbia and its environs, as described in that \n     Act, Congress should provide funding for the maintenance, \n     security, and custodial and long-term care of the memorial by \n     the National Park Service.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed to \nthis Sense of the Senate Resolution which would provide funding for the \nmaintenance, security, custodial and long-term care of the memorial by \nthe National Park Service. This is a significant step forward in \nbringing the World War II Memorial to fruition. What this resolution \ndoes is put the Senate on record as supporting public funding of some \nsort for the World War II Memorial which will be placed on the National \nMall--our nation's front yard.\n  I felt this resolution necessary because of the continued structural \nproblems confronting the Korean War Veterans Memorial, which lies in \nthe same flood plain that the World War II Memorial will call home. I \nfelt it necessary that the Senate take on some precautionary \nresponsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of what will be the most \nprominent memorial on the Mall.\n  Next year, I intend to introduce legislation to fund not only \nmaintenance, security, custodial and long-term care, but also \nconstruction costs to assist the Honorable Bob Dole in his fund-raising \nendeavor.\n  I would again like to thank my colleagues, especially Senators \nMurkowski and Bumpers for their support and assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12249-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXPRESSING SENSE OF SENATE RELATIVE TO LOUISVILLE FESTIVAL OF FAITHS\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Res. 278\n\n       Whereas many of the nations throughout the world, and \n     especially within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de \n     los Ninos'' on the 30th of April, in recognition and \n     celebration of their country's future--their children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas children are the center of American families;\n       Whereas children should be nurtured and invested in to \n     preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the \n     American spirit;\n       Whereas Latinos in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on this day, and wish to \n     share this custom with the rest of the Nation;\n       Whereas one in four Americans is projected to be of \n     Hispanic descent by the year 2050, and there are now 10.5 \n     million Latino children;\n       Whereas traditional Latino family life centers largely on \n     its children;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and we rely on \n     children to pass on these family values, morals, and culture \n     to future generations;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 children drop out of school each \n     year and Hispanic dropout rates are unacceptably high;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and encourage children to explore, develop \n     confidence, and pursue their dreams;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the Nation will help affirm for the people of the United \n     States the significance of family, education, and community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition of \n     children of the United States will provide an opportunity to \n     children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     dreams and aspirations, and find comfort and security in the \n     support of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the country to declare April 30 as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''--a day to bring together \n     Latinos and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children; and\n       Whereas the children of a nation are the responsibility of \n     all its citizens, and citizens should be encouraged to \n     celebrate the gifts of children to society--their curiosity, \n     laughter, faith, energy, spirit, hopes, and dreams: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates the 30th of April of \n     1999, as ``Dia de los Ninos: Celebrating Young Americans'' \n     and requests that the President issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to join with all children, \n     families, organizations, communities, churches, cities, and \n     States across the Nation to observe the day with appropriate \n     ceremonies, beginning April 30, 1999, that include--\n       (1) activities that center around children, and are free or \n     minimal in cost so as to encourage and facilitate the \n     participation of all our citizens;\n       (2) activities that are positive, uplifting, and that help \n     children express their hopes and dreams;\n       (3) activities that provide opportunities for children of \n     all backgrounds to learn about one another's cultures and \n     share ideas;\n       (4) activities that include all members of the family, and \n     especially extended and elderly family members, so as to \n     promote greater communication among the generations within a \n     family, enabling children to appreciate and benefit from the \n     experiences and wisdom of their elderly family members;\n       (5) activities that provide opportunities for families \n     within a community to get acquainted; and\n\n[[Page S12253]]\n\n       (6) activities that provide children with the support they \n     need to develop skills and confidence, and find the inner \n     strength--the will and fire of the human spirit--to make \n     their dreams come true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12252-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WAIVING CERTAIN ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4337 received from the \nHouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4337) to authorize the Secretary of the \n     Interior to provide financial assistance to the State of \n     Maryland for a pilot program to develop measures to eradicate \n     or control nutria and restore marshland damaged by nutria.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this legislation authorizes the \nSecretary of Interior to provide assistance to the State of Maryland in \ncontrolling a non-native rodent--nutria--which is destroying wetlands \nand valuable habitat at and around Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge \non the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Sponsored by my colleague \nRepresentative Gilchrest, the legislation establishes a three year \ndemonstration program of methods of manage nutria populations and to \nrestore marshlands damaged by the destructive creature.\n  Mr. President, Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge is one of the real \ntreasures and showplaces of our National Wildlife Refuge system. \nEstablished in the early 1930s to help preserve migratory waterfowl, \nthe 20,000 acre refuge has become one of the chief wintering areas for \nCanada geese along the Atlantic Flyway. It is also home for the \nendangered Delmarva Fox Squirrel and more than 200 species of birds. As \nall who visit the refuge quickly discover, Blackwater is a very special \nplace: a haven for fish and wildlife , a land of exceptional beauty, \nand a vital part of the natural heritage and quality of life that we \nenjoy in Maryland.\n  Unfortunately the Refuge and surrounding wetlands are being \nthreatened by the prolific and highly invasive nonindigenous species \nnutria which are destroying the tidal marshes and even displacing other \nnative species. Over the past three decades, the population of nutria \nin Maryland has grow exponentially from about 150 to as many as \n150,000--a thousand fold increase. During that same period, Blackwater \nNational Wildlife Refuge has lost more than 40 percent of its marshes--\napproximately 7,000 of 17,000 acres--due, in large part, to nutria. As \nnutria population densities continue to increase, so does the range of \nthe creature and its associated ecological damage.\n  In order to respond to this threat, the Maryland Department of \nNatural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USDA Animal \nand Plant Health Inspection Service, the University of Maryland and \nmore than a dozen other partners have joined together to develop a plan \nto address march loss and control of nutria. The goal of this three \nyear pilot program is to develop methods for intensive control of the \nnutria populations and to restore damaged marsh habitats. This \nlegislation authorizes the Federal funds necessary to carry out the \nprogram. I urge adoption of the legislation.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a \nthird\n\n[[Page S12254]]\n\ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill appear at the appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thought it was a very gracious and \nwonderful thing the Senator did. It was really nice.\n  I must say, I will miss you here in the Senate, Dan.

You have been a great human being to \nwork with. We will miss you. I will miss you, personally. All of my \nfriends who have left said there is a life beyond the Senate. Quite \nfrankly, it is probably a lot better, considering we are here at 7:30 \non a Friday night.\n  Mr. President, I just want to explain why I object to this bill. This \nis the bill\n\n[[Page S12255]]\n\nthat would have increased the number of H-1B visas from 65,000 per year \nto 115,000 for next year and the year after, then drop down to 107,500 \nin 2001 and back down to 65,000 thereafter.\n  Now, ostensibly, the reason for doing this, and why this came up in \nthe last couple of years, is that there was projected to be a big \nshortage in computer programmers. Thus, there was this big push to \nincrease the number of H-1B visas, to get these computer programmers.\n  It turns out that has, indeed, not happened. In fact, I have three \nrecent articles. One is from the San Jose Mercury News dated October 6, \n1998. It says:\n\n       High-tech Layoffs are Accelerating.\n\n  They pointed out in the article:\n\n       Computers ranked second in total job-cut announcements, \n     with 44,000. That represented nearly three times the number \n     from last year.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The changing job market can be seen at the Career Action \n     Center, a career resource center in Cupertino, where \n     counselors are seeing more people come in. Job searches are \n     taking more time, companies are taking longer to make their \n     hiring decision, and some businesses have even enacted hiring \n     freezes, said Betsy Collard, the center's strategic \n     development director.\n       While the center posted 10,000 jobs in August, that was \n     down from 13,500 it posted a year earlier.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the San Jose Mercury News, Oct. 6, 1998]\n\n                   High-Tech Layoffs Are Accelerating\n\n                        (By Jonathan Rabinovitz)\n\n       High-technology industries have cut four times as many jobs \n     nationally in 1998 as they did in the same period last year, \n     imposing more layoffs than almost every other sector of the \n     economy, according to a report released Tuesday by an \n     international outplacement firm.\n       The survey of job-cut announcements was yet another signal \n     of the slowing of economic growth both in Silicon Valley and \n     nationally. It attributed many of the reductions to the \n     global financial crisis, particularly the recession that has \n     gripped much of Asia.\n       And while the labor market in the San Jose area remains \n     tight--the 3.4 percent unemployment rate in August was down \n     from last year--one of the authors of the study said that \n     this year's downsizing tend has already dimmed the rampant \n     optimism that once pervaded Silicon Valley.\n       ``People used to say that you don't have anything to worry \n     about, but that's not the case any more,'' said John A. \n     Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas \n     Inc., the Chicago-based company that compiles the monthly \n     survey. ``The ice seems a little bit thinner right now.''\n       Still, Silicon Valley and the state continue to add \n     thousands of jobs, at a pace that outstrips the rate of \n     layoffs, though job growth has slowed both here and \n     nationally.\n       The layoffs in high-tech companies come against a backdrop \n     of increased job-cut announcements across the country. The \n     September figure for job-cut announcements was the highest \n     reported by the survey since January 1996. The amount has \n     generally increased each month this year.\n       And the total number of job cuts for all industries was up \n     53 percent--about 150,000 job-cut announcements--from the \n     amount for the first nine months of 1997.\n       But perhaps the most striking change was in the high-tech \n     industries. While electronics, computers and \n     telecommunications were not among the top five industries in \n     job-cut announcements last year at this time, all three \n     industries were now in that category.\n       Electronics, which includes chip manufacturing, had more \n     announcements than any other industry. The number had \n     increased to nearly 70,000, eight times more than the first \n     nine months of last year, according to the Challenger survey.\n       Computers ranked second in total job-cut announcements, \n     with 44,000. That represented nearly three times the number \n     from last year.\n       Telecommunications was placed fifth. It increased to nearly \n     29,000, four times the amount in 1997.\n       The changing job market can be seen at the Career Action \n     Center, a career resource center in Cupertino, where \n     counselors are seeing more people come in. Job searches are \n     taking more time, companies are taking longer to make their \n     hiring decision and some businesses have even enacted hiring \n     freezes, said Betsy Collard, the center's strategic \n     development director.\n       While the center posted 10,000 jobs in August, that was \n     down from the 13,500 it posted a year earlier.\n       But, Collard stressed, ``It is still a very good job \n     market.''\n       Indeed, the Challenger survey should not inspire panic in \n     Silicon Valley. Its findings reveal only a small and recent \n     dent in an economic miracle that has included phenomenal job \n     growth.\n       Another report, issued this week by the American \n     Electronics Association, showed how Silicon Valley extended \n     its reach throughout California from 1990 to 1996.\n       While Santa Clara County added almost 25,000 high-tech jobs \n     during that period to reach a total of 221,000 technology \n     jobs--a 12 percent increase--other California metropolitan \n     areas had substantial employment growth in the tech \n     industries.\n       The Sacramento area, for instance, had 30,000 high-tech \n     jobs by 1996, a 56 percent jump from six years earlier. San \n     Mateo, San Francisco and Marin Counties had a total of about \n     49,000 high-tech jobs, up 37 percent over the same period. \n     And Alameda and Contra Costa Counties had 53,000, a 14 \n     percent increase from 1990.\n       Still, the continued growth had a new facet this year, it \n     was accompanied by a spate of down-sizing efforts that \n     approach the scope of the deepest cuts of the decade in 1993, \n     Challenger said.\n       Over the last year, many of Silicon Valley's most revered \n     companies have announced layoffs. Santa Clara-based Applied \n     Materials has eliminated almost one out of every four \n     positions. Scotts Valley-based Seagate said in January it \n     would reduce its work force by 10,000 employees worldwide. \n     And San Jose-based Adobe Systems said it would cut anywhere \n     between 240 to 300 jobs.\n       The Challenger Survey has been conducted since 1993. It is \n     based entirely on public reports of job cuts and calculates \n     all reductions announced by U.S.-based companies.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Another recent article from Computer World, dated October \n5, 1998, talked about the same subject:\n\n       The year 2000 retention drama is playing out differently \n     from what was expected. The widely anticipated programmer \n     shortage never quite materialized, but another shortage has \n     proved far more dangerous.\n       ``We'd always heard the industry speak of demand for \n     programmers, but the more critical and unexpected demand is \n     for project managers,'' says Irene Dec, vice president of \n     information systems at the Prudential Insurance Company of \n     America in Newark, NJ.\n\n  The article pointed out, quite frankly, that the programmers are in \nfine shape. What they are really looking for are program managers. I \nunderstand the H-1B visa does not in any way address that problem at \nall.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Computerworld, Oct. 5, 1998]\n\n                      The Millennium's Superstars\n\n\n year 2000 project managers are worth their weight in gold. how do you \n                               keep them?\n\n                         (By Kathleen Melymuka)\n\n       The year 2000 retention drama is playing out differently \n     from what was expected. The widely anticipated programmer \n     shortage never quite materialized, but another shortage has \n     proved far more dangerous.\n       ``We'd always heard the industry speak of demand for \n     programmers, but the more critical and unexpected demand is \n     for project managers,'' says Irene Dec, vice president of \n     information systems at The Prudential Insurance Company of \n     America in Newark, N.J.\n       ``Those are the people that make the different between \n     success and failure,'' says Chas Snyder, who heads the year \n     2000 project at Levi Strauss & Co. in San Francisco. ``If \n     somebody is experienced at running an effort like this for a \n     large company, the knowledge they develop is invaluable.''\n       Keeping programmers ``has not been as big a problem as \n     people thought it was going to be,'' says Jim Jones, managing \n     director of the year 2000 group at the Information Management \n     Forum in Atlanta. ``It's not the worker-bee folks they're \n     hurting for; it's project managers.''\n       An August survey of 100 contracting and consulting firms by \n     the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) \n     showed that the ``overwhelming majority'' have more \n     programmers than they can use. The ITAA called the \n     anticipated programmer shortage ``a marketplace failing to \n     live up to its prior billing.''\n       The supply of year 2000 programmers has been bigger than \n     expected because many corporations outsourced coding to \n     offshore companies, vendors developed year 2000 tools that \n     automated much of the coding process, and schools and \n     training facilities graduated a bumper crop of programmers \n     geared to the job.\n       With programmers available, companies realized where the \n     real crunch would be. ``Even the best programmers in the \n     world can't make it happen if no one is managing,'' Dec says.\n       Depending on the organization, year 2000 project managers \n     may be found at every level--and every salary--from corporate \n     vice presidents through division managers, business \n     functional team leaders and department honchos. There may be \n     one project manager, or there may be a pyramid of project \n     managers--from each division or business unit, for example--\n     reporting to a chief. But wherever they are found, they are \n     hard to keep. ``We know that our people are being called [by \n     headhunters] because they tell us,'' says\n\n[[Page S12256]]\n\n     Gael Hanover, senior director of human resources for \n     information systems at Sears. Roebuck and Co. in Hoffman \n     Estates, Ill. ``Consulting firms can dangle pretty big \n     salaries, and we can't.''\n       In fact, some consulting firms are so desperate for project \n     managers that they are willing to pay them at the rate they \n     bill customers for their services. ``The projects can't get \n     done without project managers, so if they bill [companies] at \n     $125 an hour, they're willing to give [project managers] $125 \n     an hour,'' Jones says. ``No corporation can do that.''\n       But corporations have come up with other strategies to keep \n     their year 2000 project managers on the job through the \n     millennium. Some strategies rely on the lure of money and \n     perks, but most are based on the understanding that retention \n     has to be a long-term effort because the need for project \n     managers won't go away after 2000.\n\n\n                        RECOGNITION AND ROTATION\n\n       At Kraft Foods, Inc. in Northfield, Ill., where the overall \n     IS turnover rate is 5%, Chief Information Officer Jim Kinney \n     has been very careful to make year 2000 a high-profile, high-\n     recognition temporary job. ``We've chosen very good people \n     for project teams,'' he says. Most work only on the \n     application set for which they're normally responsible. \n     ``Once that's finished, they rotate back to their regular \n     assignment,'' Kinney explains.\n       Smart companies are making sure their year 2000 project \n     managers don't stagnate during the project. ``Folks focused \n     on year 2000 are being sent to appropriate training and \n     conferences and classes so they can stay up with \n     technology,'' Dec says. She has lost only five of the 60 to \n     80 people in her year 2000 program management team.\n       Keane, Inc. in Boston, a provider of year 2000 services, \n     has established an internal organization to look after the \n     career development of its project managers, says David \n     Pollard, Keane's director of recruiting.\n       ``Rather than simply throw cash at the issue, we tapped \n     into meeting their development objectives and getting [them] \n     the right training so they can be successful in the long \n     haul,'' he says. Turnover has declined 30% since the \n     development organization was founded last year.\n\n\n                                 MONEY\n\n       There's nothing wrong with money judiciously deployed, and \n     bonuses of 20% of salary aren't uncommon. Sears is offering \n     year 2000 project managers and selected other periodic cash \n     bonuses through April 2000.\n       ``If we lost one of these folks, we would be hurting more \n     than if we lost 10 other people. So rather than spread [the \n     money] to everyone, we do more for some,'' Hanauer says.\n\n\n                              BE PREPARED\n\n       Nothing can guarantee that you will retain the people \n     crucial to your year 2000 effort. Knowing that, Snyder \n     planned for the worst. ``My biggest fear was to lose people \n     in high leverage points,'' he says. ``So for my core four or \n     five managers, I designed responsibilities to be shared. That \n     way, if I lost one, we could cover the responsibility \n     easily.''\n       He did lose one, he says, ``but we were able to pick up the \n     slack running.''\n\n\n                            the BIG PICTURE\n\n       Unlike year 2000 programmers, who know their peak earning \n     time is limited, project managers have the luxury of a long \n     view. If your company's view is the same, you have an \n     advantage. ``Year 2000 is a short-term brass ring,'' Snyder \n     says. ``There might be enough in a year or two to make it \n     worthwhile for some people to leave, but if you're thinking \n     long term, it's not enough. The people I have are long-term \n     Levi's employees, and they plan on staying here.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I think this bill, at the time it came up, \nwas probably well intentioned.\n  Another article I want to have printed in the Record is an article \nfrom Labor Relations Week, dated September 30, 1998:\n\n       The latest data from the Challenger report showed that so \n     far this year, electronics industry job reductions \n     announcements have totaled 60,845, and those in the computer \n     industry totaled 40,642.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From Labor Relations Week, Sept. 30, 1998]\n\n   Layoff Reports Outpacing Level Seen Last Year; High-Tech Hit Hard\n\n       With high-technology industries particularly hard hit, the \n     pace at which U.S. corporations are announcing workforce \n     reductions remained brisk through August, according to the \n     latest figures from the international outplacement firm \n     Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n       In August, U.S. companies announced that they plan to make \n     job cuts totaling 37,717, the Challenger report, released \n     Sept. 8, said. That figure, while it was smaller than \n     reported in July, put the total for the first eight months of \n     this year at 358,394--which is 37 percent higher than the \n     total for the comparable period of 1997.\n       In fact, the January-to-August total for this year is only \n     11 percent lower than the total reported by Challenger for \n     the same period in 1993, the year that the firm began its \n     layoff survey.\n       ``There have been a significant number of downsizing \n     announcements in 1998, reflecting a number of factors that \n     include the global situation, especially in Asia.'' John \n     Challenger, executive vice president of the firm, told BNA. \n     He said that given the increased pressure on some U.S. \n     industries due to the Asian economic crisis, there are likely \n     to be more layoff announcements in the industries most \n     affected.\n       The latest data from the Challenger report showed that so \n     far this year, electronics industry job reductions \n     announcements have totaled 60,845, and those in the computer \n     industry totaled 40,642.\n       ``We've seen the 10 largest mergers in [U.S.] history all \n     announced since last fall,'' Challenger said, citing another \n     indication of labor market flux. In many cases, companies are \n     reducing their workforces in one area at the same time that \n     they are adding employees in other areas, he said.\n       While Challenger said that he does not expect 1998 to \n     surpass 1993 in total layoff announcements, he said that the \n     fact that the total for the first eight months of this year \n     is so close to 1993 total indicates that ``companies are \n     quicker to respond to changes in the marketplace.''\n       Layoff announcements tracked by the Challenger firm are \n     based on publicly released estimates of planned workforce \n     reductions that could take place immediately or over an \n     extended period of time, the firm said. Announcements of job \n     reduction plans are verified by the Challenger firm, and the \n     tallies are revised only if companies announce that they have \n     changed their plans, the firm said.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I object because I think while this maybe \nhad some legitimacy at some time because of the projected shortage in \ncomputer programmers, every indication is that has not happened.\n  Obviously, we don't need to pass this bill right now. I think we can \ntake another look at it next year to see if, in fact, there is any \nproblem. We can always come back and look at this again next year, but \nright now it does not appear that the demand is there that they \nanticipated a couple of years ago.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Iowa \nfor his kind comments. We have served together in the Labor Committee \nfor a 10-year period of time. While we have had our disagreements, we \nhave also agreed on a number of things. I have enjoyed working with \nhim.\n  I understand, but regret, the objection of this unanimous consent \nrequest. There obviously is a difference of opinion as to the need for \nsupport in the technology industry, the computer industry, particularly \nwith the Y2K problem. That issue will have to be resolved. There is \nhonest disagreement here. We will pick the issue up in the next \nCongress.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to turn my attention briefly \nto the issue which was discussed by the Senator from Iowa in raising \nobjection to proceeding with the legislation aimed at trying to expand \nthe number of H-1B entries as permitted on an annual basis to be \nemployed by American businesses.\n  The Senator focused on a very narrow issue in raising his objection--\nspecifically, the argument based on several newspaper stories that \nthere is not a shortage of skilled workers in the high-tech industries.\n  Virtually every study that I have seen--and as the principal sponsor \nof the legislation when it was in the Senate, I made most of those \navailable as part of the Record--indicates that, indeed, we have a very \nsevere shortage in these high-tech worker job slots. Virginia Tech \nUniversity conducted a recent study which indicated over 340,000 \nvacancies in information technology positions that exist today in this \ncountry. Our Department of Commerce conducted a study which revealed it \nis anticipated that in each of the next 10 years we will generate over \n130,000 new information technology jobs and yet the combined resources \nof our colleges, universities, and job training programs and high \nschools is only likely to fill a fraction of those every year. This is \na severe problem, and it is especially severe at this time.\n  The Senator from Iowa talks about moving us to next year. Well, next \nyear just happens to be the last few months prior to the year 2000. By \nthe time this legislation might be brought back before us, we will be \nin a situation where the Federal Government as well as the companies \nfrom one end of America to the other are going to be confronted with \nthe final crisis stages of trying to prepare our high-tech systems for \nthe Year 2K problems that we have all been raving so much about.\n\n[[Page S12257]]\n\n  If we do not pass this legislation, it is going to be Senators such \nas the Senator who raised this objection and others who have impeded \nthe progress in this legislation who are going to have to explain to \nall of those whose systems break down why it is that happened, because \none of the problems we are having confronting the Year 2K problems is \nan inadequate number of people to perform all of the various \ninformation technology jobs required to be conducted for those problems \nto be fixed. That is just one aspect of it. It is late in the evening \nso I am not going to go into all of the many others, but I think that \nany study that has been conducted by serious researchers reveals that \nthere not only exists, but will continue to be, an ever larger number \nof vacancies in this area.\n  This legislation that was stopped tonight not only covers increasing \nthe number of high-tech workers, it also is a very important piece of \nlegislation to our academic institutions--in two respects. First, \nregarding many of the high-tech jobs, many of the H-1B visa users are \nin fact employed on our campuses teaching American kids how to perform \nthese high-technology jobs so we can meet the demand in this area in \nthe future. If we do not have these scientists, these educators, we are \ngoing to continue to fail to meet the challenge.\n  In addition, our academic institutions were relying on the passage of \nthis legislation to address a very serious problem created by the \nHathaway decision with regard to the prevailing wage they must pay \npeople who come in under the H-1B Program. So this does not just affect \nthe private sector, it affects our academic institutions as well.\n  In addition, the Senator from Iowa and others who question the \nproblem do not need to just listen to people on our side of the aisle. \nThey can listen to the President of the United States who, I believe \njust 2 weeks ago this evening, was in Silicon Valley in California \nbefore a group of executives from the high-tech industries there \ntalking about this issue. The day after his staff and my staff and I \nreached agreement on the legislation that has been blocked this \nevening, he took credit for the ability, that we were then apparently \ngoing to have, to move forward to it and acknowledged the need for the \nlegislation in taking credit for the settlement and agreement we had \nreached.\n  Obviously, whether it is the White House, the Department of Commerce, \nVirginia Tech University, or any one of a number of other sources, \nthere is an acknowledged existence of a problem here that has to be \naddressed. I am extremely disappointed at what has transpired this \nevening.\n  I would just say, in conclusion, we have not, obviously, reached the \nend of this session. There is still some time, hopefully, for \nreconsideration by the Senator from Iowa and any others who may have \nconcerns. I hope they will rethink this. I hope they will realize, in \nundermining this legislation, in stopping it at this time, they are \ngoing to be hurting not just the business sector and the information \ntechnology sector, but the academic sector. They are also going to \nprevent us from instituting a whole new array of job training programs \nand scholarship programs that were going to be launched by this \nlegislation. So I hope they will take a look at that, reconsider, and \nif they look at the numbers a little more closely, I think they will \nreach the same conclusions we have.\n  Mr. President, I close by saying I hope the Senator from Iowa, and \nothers who might share his position, again will look closely at the \nstatistics I have talked about tonight, examine all the other aspects \nof this legislation and what it will mean if it does not move forward \nin all the different contexts I have outlined and the many others I \nhave not had time for, rethink whether or not it is appropriate to put \nthis off to some future date, and think about the consequences, whether \nit is in the context of the Y2K problems or the current economic \nconditions we have in the world marketplace where America's high-tech \nindustries' growth is essential to the maintenance of our economic \nstrength, and reconsider their position.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12254-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12257-S12265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PROTECTION OF CHILDREN FROM SEXUAL PREDATORS ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, I am pleased to note the passage of H.R. \n3494, the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine ``Protection of Children from Sexual \nPredators Act of 1998.'' I want to thank Senators Leahy and DeWine for \ntheir cooperation in drafting and advocating the passage of this \nimportant piece of legislation. I also want to commend Congressman \nMcCollum for his determined efforts in marshaling H.R. 3494 through the \nHouse.\n  Although it was necessary to make some changes to the House version \nin an effort to achieve bipartisan support in the Senate, the final \nproduct is a strong bill which goes a long way toward improving the \nability of law enforcement and the courts to respond to high-tech \nsexual predators of children. Pedophiles who roam the Internet, \npurveyors of child pornography, and serial child molesters are \nspecifically targeted.\n  The Internet is a wonderful creation. By allowing for instant \ncommunication around the globe, it has made the world a smaller place, \na place in which people can express their thoughts and ideas without \nlimitation. It has released the creative energies of a new generation \nof entrepreneurs and it is an unparalleled source of information.\n  While we should encourage people to take full advantage of the \nopportunities the Internet has to offer, we must also be vigilant in \nseeking to ensure that the Internet is not perverted into a hunting \nground for pedophiles and other sexual predators, and a drive-through \nlibrary and post office for purveyors of child pornography. Our \nchildren must be protected from those who would choose to sexually \nabuse and exploit them. And those who take the path of predation should \nknow that the consequences of their actions will be severe and \nunforgiving.\n  How does this bill provide additional protection for our children? By \nprohibiting the libidinous dissemination on the Internet of information \nrelated to minors and the sending of obscene material to minors, we \nmake it more difficult for sexual predators to gather information on, \nand lower the sexual inhibitions of, potential targets. By prohibiting \nto possession of even one item or image containing child pornography, \nwe are stating in no uncertain terms that we have ``zero tolerance'' \nfor the sexual exploitation of children. And by requiring electronic \ncommunication service providers to report the commission of child \npornography offenses to authorities, we mandate accountability and \nresponsibility on the Internet.\n  Additionally, law enforcement is given effective tools to pursue \nsexual predators. The Attorney General is provided with authority to \nissue administrative subpoenas in child pornography cases. Proceeds \nderived from these offenses, and the facilities and instrumentalities \nused to perpetuate these offenses, will be subject to forfeiture. And \nprosecutors will not have the power to seek pretrial detention of \nsexual predators prior to trial.\n  Federal law enforcement will be given increased statutory authority \nto assist the States in kidnapping and serial murder investigations, \nwhich often involve children. In that vein, H.R. 3494 calls for the \ncreation of the Morgan P. Hardiman Child Abduction and Serial Murder \nInvestigative Resources Center.\n\n[[Page S12263]]\n\nThat center will gather information, expertise and resources that our \nnation's law enforcement agencies can draw upon to help combat these \nheinous crimes.\n  Sentences for child abuse and exploitation offenses will be made \ntougher. In addition to increasing the maximum penalties available for \nmany crimes against children and mandating tough sentences for repeat \noffenders, the bill will also recommend that the Sentencing Commission \nreevaluate the guidelines applicable to these offenses, and increase \nthem where appropriate to address the egregiousness of these crimes. \nAnd H.R. 3494 calls for life imprisonment in appropriate cases where \ncertain crimes result in the death of children.\n  Protection of our children is not a partisan issue. We have drawn \nupon the collective wisdom of the House as well as from Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle to draft a bill which includes strong, \neffective legislation protecting children. Once again, I urge the House \nto act quickly to pass this bill so that we can get it to the President \nfor his signature this session. Protection for our children delayed is \nprotection denied.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad that we have been able to achieve \npassage of a bill that will help protect children from sexual \npredators.\n  As the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is the \nresponsibility of Chairman Hatch and myself to schedule legislation for \nconsideration by the Committee and to draft changes, if warranted. Many \nbills never are scheduled for committee votes, and as the legislative \nsession draws to a close, it becomes increasingly important that any \nbills brought to the Senate Floor adequately address concerns raised, \nto improve their chances for enactment. At this stage of the \nlegislative process, even one senator can prevent passage of an ill-\nconsidered or controversial bill. Passage today of the Hatch-Leahy-\nDeWine substitute to H.R. 3494 is due to the efforts of those members \nwho have worked to resolve the legitimate concerns raised by the \noriginal bill we received from the House.\n  In the case of H.R. 3494, the Chairman and I, joined by Senator \nDeWine. worked hard to bring forward a bill that was both strong and \nsensible and that would have a chance to win enactment in the short \ntime remaining in the legislative session.\n  Unlike some who may just want to score political points, we actually \nwant to enact this bill to protect children, something that I worked \nhard to do as a prosecutor, when I convicted child molesters in the \nstate of Vermont. We wanted to bring forward a bill that could pass.\n  The problem area is the original House bill as it reached the \nCommittee centered on its unintended consequences for law enforcement, \nregulation of the Internet, and important privacy rights that have \nnothing to do with child pornography.\n  As I have said before, the whole world watches when the United States \nregulates the Internet, and we have a special obligation to do it \nright.\n  The goal of H.R. 3494, and of the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute, is \nto provide stronger protections for children from those who would prey \nupon them. Concerns over protecting our children have only intensified \nin recent years with the growing popularity of the Internet and the \nWorld Wide Web. Cyberspace gives users access to a wealth of \ninformation; it connects people from around the world. But is also \ncreates new opportunities for sexual predators and child pornographers \nto ply their trade.\n  The challenge is to protect children from exploitation in cyberspace \nwhile ensuring that the vast democratic forum of the Internet remains \nan engine for the free exchange of ideas and information.\n  The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine version of the bill meets this challenge. \nWhile neither version is a cure-all for the scourge of child \npornography, the substitute is a useful step toward limiting the \nability of cyber-pornographers and predators from harming children.\n  The bill has come a long way since it was passed by the House last \nJune. Significant objections were raised by civil liberties \norganizations and others to provisions in the original H.R. 3494, and \nwe worked hard on a bipartisan basis to ensure that this bill would \npass in the short time remaining in this Congress.\n  I thank the Chairman and Senator DeWine, and other members of the \nCommittee, for working together to address the legitimate concerns \nabout certain provisions in the House-passed bill, and to make this \nsubstitute more focused and measured. Briefly, I would like to \nhighlight and explain some of the changes we made, and why we made \nthem.\n  As passed by the House, H.R. 3494 would make it a crime, punishable \nby up to 5 years' imprisonment, to do nothing more than ``contact'' a \nminor, or even just attempt to ``contact'' a minor, for the purpose of \nengaging in sexual activity. This provision, which would be extremely \ndifficult to enforce and would invite court challenges, does not appear \nin the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute. In criminal law terms, the act of \nmaking contact is not very far along the spectrum of an overt criminal \nact. Targeting ``attempts'' to make contact would be even more like \nprosecuting a thought crime. It is difficult to see how such a \nprovision would be enforced without inviting significant litigation.\n  Another new crime created by the House bill prohibited the \ntransmittal of identifying information about any person under 18 for \nthe purpose of encouraging unlawful sexual activity. In its original \nincarnation, this provision would have had the absurd result of \nprohibiting a person under the age of consent from e-mailing her own \naddress or telephone number to her boyfriend. The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine \nsubstitute fixes this problem by making it clear that a violation must \ninvolve the transmission of someone else's identifying information. In \naddition, to eliminate any notice problem arising from the variations \nin state statutory rape laws, the Senate bill conforms the bill to the \nfederal age of consent--16--in provisions regarding the age of the \nidentified minor. The Senate bill also clarifies that the defendant \nmust know that the person about whom he was transmitting identifying \ninformation was, in fact, under 16. This change was particularly \nimportant because, in the anonymous world of cyberspace, a person may \nhave no way of knowing the age of the faceless person with whom he is \ncommunicating.\n  Another provision of the House bill, which makes it a crime to \ntransfer obscene material to a minor, raised similar concerns. Again, \nthe Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill lowers the age of minority from 18 to 16--\nthe federal age of majority--and provides that the defendant must know \nhe is dealing with someone so young. This provision of the Senate bill, \nlike the House bill, applies only to ``obscene'' material--that is, \nmaterial that enjoys no First Amendment protection whatever--material \nthat is patently offensive to the average adult. The bill does not \npurport to proscribe the transferral of constitutionally protected \nmaterial.\n\n  The original House bill would also have criminalized certain conduct \ndirected at a person who had been ``represented '' to be a minor, even \nif that person was, in fact, an adult. The evident purpose was to make \nclear that the targets of sting operations are not relieved of criminal \nliability merely because their intended victim turned out to be an \nundercover agent and not a child. The new ``sting'' provisions \naddressed a problem that simply does not currently exist: No court has \never endorsed an impossibility defense along the lines anticipated by \nthe House bill. The creation of special ``sting'' provisions in this \none area could unintentionally harm law enforcement interests by \nlending credence to impossibility defenses raised in other sting and \nundercover situations. At the same time, these provisions would have \ncriminalized conduct that was otherwise lawful: It is not a crime for \nadults to communicate with each other about sex, even if one of the \nadults pretends to be a child. Given these significant concerns, the \n``sting'' provisions have been stricken from the House Leahy-DeWine \nsubstitute.\n  Another concern with the House bill was its modification of the child \npornography possession laws. Current law requires possession of three \nor more pornographic images in order for there to be criminal \nliability. Congress wrote this requirement into the law as a way of \nprotecting against government overreaching. By eliminating this numeric\n\n[[Page S12264]]\n\nrequirement, the House bill put at risk the unsuspecting Internet user \nwho, by inadvertence or mistake, downleaded a single pornographic image \nof a child. While we support the concept of zero tolerance for child \npornography, the inevitable result of the House language in overriding \nthe earlier congressional definition would be to chill the free \nexchange of information over the Web by making users fearful that, if \nthey download illegal material by mistake, they could go to jail.\n  More importantly, this provision could also inadvertently harm law \nenforcement interests by chilling those who inadvertently or mistakenly \ncome upon child pornography from bringing the material to the attention \nof law enforcement officers. Technically, under the House-passed bill, \nthese law-abiding citizens would be subject to criminal liabiilty.\n  Efforts to avoid these unintended consequences, while promoting zero \ntolerance of child pornography, could not be resolved in the time \nconstraints facing the Committee. However, our bipartisan efforts to \ndraft workable language have borne fruit. The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-\nSessions amendment accommodates the objective of ``zero balance'' for \nchild pornography, but permits a narrow affirmative defense for certain \ndefendants who, in good faith, destroyed the prohibited material or \nreported it to law enforcement authorities. With this amendment, we \nhave achieved zero tolerance without unintended consequences for \ninnocent Internet users and for law enforcement.\n  The House bill would have given the Attorney General sweeping \nadministrative authority to subpoena records and witnesses \ninvestigations involving crimes against children. This proposed \nauthority to issue administrative subpoenas would have given federal \nagents the power to compel disclosures without any oversight by a \njudge, prosecutor, or grand jury, and without any of the grand jury \nsecrecy requirements. We appreciate that such secretary requirements \nmay pose obstacles to full and efficient cooperation of federal/state \ntask forces in their joint efforts to reduce the steadily increasing \nuse of the Internet to perpetrate crimes against children, including \ncrimes involving the distribution of child pornography. In addition, we \nunderstand that some U.S. Attorneys' Offices are reluctant to open \ngrand jury investigations when the only goal is to identify individuals \nwho have not yet, and may never, commit a federal (as opposed to state \nor local) offense.\n\n  The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute accommodates these competing \ninterests by granting the Department a narrowly drawn authority to \nsubpoena the information that it most needs: Routine subscriber account \ninformation from Internet Service Providers (ISPS), which may provide \nappropriate notice to subscribers.\n  The new reporting requirement established by H.R. 3494 would also \ncreate new problems. Under current law, ISPs are generally free to \nreport suspicious communications to law enforcement authorities. Under \nH.R. 3494, ISPs would be required to report such communications when \nthey involve child pornography; failure to do so would be punishable by \na substantial fine.\n  In addressing this issue, the Chairman, Senator DeWine and I are \ncommitted to eradicating the market of child pornography, believing \nthat child pornography is inherently harmful to children. ISPs that \ncome across such material should report it, and, in most cases, they \nalready do. We must tread cautiously, however, before we compel private \ncitizens to act as good Samaritans or to assume duties and \nresponsibilities that are better left to law enforcement following \nstatutory defined procedures to safeguard privacy and ensure due \nprocess.\n  The ISPs have cooperated in refining this provision of the House bill \nto make it more workable. Particular consideration was given to the \nappropriate standard for triggering a duty to report. We wanted to make \nthe bar sufficiently high to discourage ISPs from erring on the side of \nover-reporting every questionable image. Over-reporting would overwhelm \nlaw enforcement agencies with worthless investigative leads and make it \nmore difficult for them to isolate the leads worth pursuing. Over-\nreporting would also jeopardize the First Amendment rights of Internet \nusers, while needlessly magnifying the administrative burden of the \nISPs.\n  Under H.R. 3494, ISPs have a duty to make a report to law enforcement \nauthorities only when they obtain knowledge of material from which a \nviolation of the federal child pornography laws ``is apparent.'' While \nthe committee-reported bill required ISPs to make a report only when \nthey had ``probable cause'' to believe that the child pornography laws \nwere being violated, the substitute passed today adopts an ``is \napparent'' standard. The latter standard is stricter than the \n``probable cause'' standard and so will reduce any incentive for over-\nreporting. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from America Online \nregarding the ``is apparent'' standard be included in the record.\n  If the ``is apparent'' standard is met, an ISP must expeditiously \nfile a report with law enforcement authorities. This report is to \ninclude the ``facts or circumstances'' from which a violation of the \nlaw is apparent, so that law enforcement agencies can determine whether \nor not further investigation or prosecution is called for. Information \nin the ISP's files identifying the name of a subscriber does not fall \nwithin this description, since child pornography offenses will either \nbe apparent or not, without regard to the name of a party to an image \ntransmission or other violative act. If law enforcement determines that \nfurther investigation is warranted, it may subpoena, the ISP for any \nidentifying information that the ISP may possess. The new \nadministrative subpoena power should expedite this process.\n  The substitute also refines the reporting requirement in other ways:\n  First, by providing that there is no liability for failing to make a \nreport unless the ISP knew both of the existence of child pornography \nand of the duty to report it (if it rises to the level of probable \ncause).\n  Second, by making clear that we are not imposing a monitoring \nrequirement of any kind: ISPs must report child pornography when they \ncome across it or it is brought to their attention, but they are not \nobligated to go out looking for it, which raises significant privacy \nconcerns and conflicts with other laws.\n  Third, by adding privacy protections for any information reported \nunder the bill.\n  Fourth, to protect smaller ISPs who could be put out of business for \na first offense, by lowering the maximum fine for first offenders to \n$50,000; a second or subsequent failure to report, however, may still \nresult in a fine of up to $100,000.\n  Thus, improved, the reporting requirement will accomplish its \nobjectives without violating the privacy rights of Internet users, \nunduly burdening the ISPs, or inundating law enforcement with a lot of \nworthless information.\n  In conclusion, I commend Senators Hatch and DeWine for their efforts \nto address the terrible problem of child predators and pornographers. I \nam glad that we were able to join forces to construct a substitute that \ngoes a long way toward achieving our common goals.\n\n\n                                          America Online Inc.,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee, US Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to follow up on the letter \n     of September 18 on the ISP reporting provisions of H.R. 3494, \n     to which America Online was a signatory.\n       In discussions preceding markup, there was an ISP request \n     for a tighter standard for the duty-to-report screening test, \n     to avoid unnecessary and counter-productive reporting. In \n     response, the committee used a ``probable cause'' standard. \n     While we are grateful for your intent, there has remained \n     some uncertainty about the effect of the original ``is \n     apparent'' standard and, thus, about which standard is \n     actually more limiting of the material covered, and thus more \n     workable for ISP's. Subsequently, a number of ISP's have \n     analyzed and discussed the question, and it is our collective \n     judgment that the ``is apparent'' standard is preferable. \n     This is the basis for our request that the language be \n     changed.\n       To elaborate: under proposed 227(b)(1) of the Victims of \n     Child Abuse Act, as added by Sec. 604 of H.R. 3494, Internet \n     and online service providers (ISP's) would have a duty to \n     report to a law enforcement authority any child pornography \n     of which it gains knowledge in the provision of its service. \n     In each case the ISP must judge whether material is covered \n     under this duty or not. The test it\n\n[[Page S12265]]\n\n     uses in this process of analysis is the subject of our \n     request. Based on our review of the history of the ``is \n     apparent'' standard, we believe it to result in a narrower \n     reporting scope than ``probably cause,'' which at best calls \n     for an uncertain ``more likely than not'' judgment.\n       A more workable approach is to trigger the duty when the \n     ISP receives knowledge of ``facts or circumstances from which \n     a violation of [applicable law] is apparent****'' While the \n     ISP has no duty to monitor its users, in essence this \n     language creates a ``red flag:'' if the ISP in the operation \n     of its service obtains knowledge of material which is clearly \n     child pornography, a red flag should be raised. Such material \n     must be reported to the authorities. It is not, the ISP may \n     be heavily fined--it ignores the red flag at its peril.\n       As you are aware, this standard originated in Title II of \n     the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, developed in the \n     Judiciary Committee and passed 99-0 by the Senate earlier \n     this summer. For material present on ISPs' servers or \n     material to which ISP's link on the Internet, committee \n     desired to create a standard of liability triggered by \n     disregard of any ``red flags''. It sought a test falling \n     between the familiar ``should have known, could have known'' \n     standard, which was deemed too broad in its coverage, and \n     absolute certainty of infringement, which was deemed too \n     narrow. ``Apparent'' has more the meaning of ``clear on its \n     face,'' and is a higher standard of evidence of illegality \n     than ``probable cause'', which implies ``more likely than \n     not, based on all the circumstances.''. As the bill's \n     extensively-negotiated ``Section by Section'' written \n     analysis states: ``Under this standard, a service provider \n     would have no obligation to seek out copyright infringement, \n     but it would not qualify for the safe habor if it had turned \n     a blind eye to `red flags' of obvious infringement.''\n       Again, given this history and understanding of the ``is \n     apparent'' standard, we believe it will be a significant \n     improvement over ``probable cause'' in H.R. 3494's duty-to-\n     report provisions.\n       In conclusion, thank you for your willingness to continue \n     working with us on this point. Your sensitivity, and that of \n     the Chairman, have once again been crucial in laying down a \n     workable legislative road map for the Internet/online medium.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                               Jill A. Lesser,\n\n                                    Director, Law & Public Policy,\n                                        Assistant General Counsel.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we live in a world where it is \nincreasingly difficult to protect our children. The advent of \nsophisticated computer technology has made it too easy for depraved \ncriminals to gather information about children and prey upon them. And \nnothing is more heinous and reprehensible than the brutalization of a \nchild. We cannot be too vigilant in the battle against child predators.\n  I am pleased that today, with the passage of the Child Protection and \nSexual Predator Punishment Act, the Senate is marching forward in this \nfight. This legislation will provide tough punishment for those who \nwould sexually abuse the youth of our Nation.\n  This measure contains an important provision, the Joan's Law Act, \nthat Senator Torricelli and I originally introduced as a separate bill. \nThis measure is based on a New Jersey law, which was named after a 7-\nyear-old-girl, Joan D'Alessandro. Tragically, Joan was raped and killed \nin 1973. Although her murderer was convicted of the crime and sentenced \nto 20 years in State prison, he has become eligible for parole and \ncontinues to seek his release.\n  Joan's family has repeatedly had to fight against parole for this \nvicious killer. They have been forced to relive this tragedy again and \nagain, as they try to ensure that others are protected from the \nterrible horror they have suffered.\n  Joan's law will spare other families from these battles. It provides \nthat, unless the death sentenced is imposed, any criminal convicted of \na sexual offense that results in the death of a minor under the age of \n14 will be sentenced to life imprisonment. With this effort, we will \nensure that cold-blooded murderers who abuse our children will be kept \nbehind bars for the rest of their lives.\n  Mr. President, I wish that we could do more to alleviate the pain and \ntrauma suffered by the D'Alessandro family. With profound courage and \ndignity, they have endured so much for so long. Their relentless battle \nfor justice, and their tireless efforts to protect others is an \ninspiration to us all. I am deeply heartened that Congress has passed \nthis legislative memorial to Joan.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about my \nstrong support of the Mississippi Sioux Tribes Judgment Fund \nDistribution Act.\n  In 1967, the Indian Claims Commission rendered a judgment in favor of \nthe Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe (now the \nSpirit Lake Nation), and the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribe of Fort Peck, \nto satisfy land compensation claims. In 1968, Congress appropriated \n$5.9 million for this settlement.\n  In 1972, Congress passed legislation to provide for the distribution \nof this award to the three Tribes. Twenty-five percent ($1.5 million) \nwas set aside for lineal descendants who are not tribal members. Funds \nwere distributed to the Devils Lake Sioux and the Sisseton-Wahpeton \nSioux in 1974, and a partial distribution was made to the Assiniboine \nand Sioux Tribe in 1979. However, because the original judgment did not \ninclude shares for the lineal descendants, the issue has been tied up \nin litigation and the lineal descendants' share of the funds has \nremained undistributed since the passage of distribution legislation in \n1972. Since that time, the interest on the fund has grown to nearly $15 \nmillion. The bill we have approved today will distribute 71.6005 \npercent of these funds to the lineal descendants, and 28.3995 percent \nto the Tribes.\n  I say again, as I have said on numerous occasions, this situation has \ngone on long enough. Neither the Tribes nor the lineal descendants \nbenefit from these funds being tied up in court. The Indian Affairs \nCommittee has worked with the Tribes, the Department of the Interior, \nand representatives of the lineal descendants to craft the compromise \nembodied in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased by the passage of this legislation, which \nhelps finalize a judgment made three decades ago. This legislation is a \nfair compromise, one that will help break the stalemate that has \nprevented the distribution of these judgment funds. I thank my \ncolleagues for their support and assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12257-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       AMENDING THE ARMORED CAR INDUSTRY RECIPROCITY ACT OF 1993\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, S. 391, the Mississippi Sioux Judgment \nFund Distribution Act is a bill intended to resolve a longstanding \nproblem with respect to a judgment fund distribution to Sisseton and \nWahpeton tribes in the Dakotas and Montana. The bill would distribute \nan additional 7.1 percent of the funds, plus accrued interest, awarded \nby the Indian Claims Commission in 1967 to the Sisseton and Wahpeton \nMississippi Sioux Tribes. This legislation is cosponsored by Senators \nBaucus, Burns, Conrad, Daschle, and Johnson.\n  In 1972, Congress enacted legislation that authorized the Secretary \nof the Interior to distribute 75 percent of the $5.9 million judgment \naward to the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe of North Dakota (now known as the \nSpirit Lake Tribe), the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of North and \nSouth Dakota, and the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Council of the \nAssiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana. \nThe remaining 25 percent was to be distributed to individuals who could \ntrace their lineal ancestry to a member of the aboriginal Sisseton and \nWahpeton Mississippi Sioux, the predecessor to the three modern-day \ntribal entities. The judgment was compensation for the 27 million acres \nof land taken from this aboriginal tribe in the 19th century.\n  Congress made the decision to allocate 25 percent of the original \njudgment to the lineal descendants at the urging of the Department of \nthe Interior. The Department, in 1972, felt that historical events \nwarranted a departure from precedent which was to make awards to tribes \nand not to individuals. In fact, the 1967 Indian Claims Commission \njudgment awarded compensation only to the successor tribes to the \naboriginal Sisseton and Wahpeton Mississippi Sioux tribe, not to \nindividual lineal descendants.\n  The three Sisseton and Wahpeton tribes received their respective \nshares of the judgment award by the mid-1970's. To date, though, the \nfunds allocated for the lineal descendants have not been distributed. \nThis has resulted in a situation where the accrued interest on the \noriginal principle of approximately $1.5 million has now grown to more \nthan $15 million.\n  If the 1,988 lineal descendants identified to date by the Department \nof the Interior receive the $15 million in per capita payments, they \nwould receive more than 18 times what the 11,829 enrolled members \nreceived in the 1970's. Moreover, since these identified lineal \ndescendants comprise only 14 percent of the total number of tribal and \nnon-tribal member descendants, the 25 percent allocated for lineal \ndescendants in the 1972 act would permit each lineal descendant to \nreceive almost twice as much as did the enrolled tribal members who \nwere compensated in the 1970's, not counting interest.\n  In 1987, the three Sisseton and Wahpeton tribes filed suit in federal \ncourt to challenge the constitutionality of the lineal descendancy \nprovisions of the 1972 Act. When this legislation failed, in 1997 the \ntribes filed a new suit in federal court challenging these provision on \nconstitutional grounds. This second suit is currently on appeal. In \n1992, Congress enacted legislation which authorized the Attorney-\nGeneral to settle these cases on any terms agreed to by the parties \ninvolved. However, the Department of Justice has refused to proceed \nwith any settlement negotiations and has taken the position that the \n1992 law did not authorize the Department to settle these cases on any \nterms other than those laid out in the original 1972 act. While I \nbelieve that this interpretation flies in the face of congressional \nintent, the Department has been unwilling to pursue the issue.\n  S. 391 represents a reasonable solution to this matter and a \nsubstantial compromise on the part of the tribes. In the past, the \ntribes have sought complete repeal of the lineal descendancy provisions \nof the 1972 act.\n\n[[Page S12268]]\n\nIn 1986, a bill was reported out by the Select Committee on Indian \nAffairs which would have achieved this goal. The Department of the \nInterior supported this bill, explaining in a letter to the then \nChairman of the Select Committee: ``As a general rule, we believe that \neach distribution of the Indian judgment funds should benefit the \naggrieved historic tribe for which the award was made. If the historic \ntribe is no longer in existence, we believe that judgment funds should \nbe programmed, to the greatest extent possible, to the present-day \nsuccessor tribe(s) to the historic tribe.''\n  In this Congress, the tribes supported legislation that would have \nretained the undistributed principal for the lineal descendants and \ndistributed the accrued interest to the three tribes. S. 391, as \noriginally introduced, adopted this approach. H.R. 976, an identical \nbill introduced in the House, passed last year.\n  After the House acted on this legislation, the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs held a hearing last October on H.R. 976 and another \nhearing last July on an S. 391 substitute. The bill before us today is \nthe product of exhaustive negotiations between the parties involved and \nthe subject of frequent consultations between congressional staff and \nrepresentatives of the Departments of Interior and Justice that \noccurred in the past 12 months. Every effort has been made to consider \nand accommodate the concerns of these Departments while making sure \nthat the tribes receive an additional distribution of at least 7.1 \npercent of the judgment award.\n  While I believe that this legislation is a fundamentally fair \nsolution to a problem that has remained unsolved for 30 years and that \nwould persist for many more years without congressional intervention, \nnone of the parties is entirely satisfied with the legislation. The \ntribes accept the legislation for what it provides but continue to \nmaintain that they have a constitutional right to all of the \nundistributed funds. Certain persons seeking lineal descendant status \nhave alleged that this legislation deprives them of their property.\n  Because it is in the best interests of the United States and the \nother parties to bring an end to this problem, the bill provides that \nif the lineal descendants do not challenge the constitutionality of the \nbill's distribution to the tribes within one year following enactment, \nthey are barred from bringing such a challenge in the future. On the \nother hand, if the lineal descendants do bring a timely challenge to \nthe tribal distribution, the bill provides that the tribes have a right \nto intervene to challenge the constitutionality of the distribution \nmade to lineal descendants. This provision would enable a federal court \nto finally and conclusively determine on the merits the respective \nconstitutional claims of these parties and permanently put to rest what \nhas been an endless legal dispute.\n  Even after these legal disputes are settled, the Department of the \nInterior will continue, pursuant to a federal court order, to identify \nnew lineal descendants who did not receive adequate notice in the \n1970's of their right to participate in the judgment distribution. I am \nconcerned about the determination of eligibility to participate of any \nnewly identified lineal descendants. The 1972 act requires that \neligibility be based on an individual's ability to trace ancestry to a \nlineal ancestor who was a member of the Sisseton and Wahpeton \nMississippi Sioux Tribe. In their litigation the tribes alleged that \nonly 65 of the 1,988 identified lineal descendants met this \nrequirement. The government did not contradict this allegation but \nargued that the issue was irrelevant because the 1972 act allows the \nSecretary to identify ancestors on 20th century rolls. S. 391 changes \nthis provision of the 1972 act to require the use of rolls as \ncontemporaneous as possible to the existence of the aboriginal Sisseton \nand Wahpeton Mississippi Sioux Tribe in order to assure, consistent \nwith the 1972 act, that a specific lineal ancestor from that tribe can \nbe identified. Finally, it bears reemphasizing that the reason for this \nlegislation is to correct an injustice suffered by the three tribes as \na result of the 1972 act. The tribes, not individuals, were wronged by \nthe taking of 27 million acres of treaty-protected lands owned by their \naboriginal predecessor. In my view, in 1972 no amount of the judgment \nawarded for the taking of these lands should have been allocated to \nlineal descendants. Allocations to lineal descendants from Indian \nClaims Commission judgments long ago became a discredited policy and \nwere generally abandoned. However, since 26 years have passed since the \nenactment of the 1972 act, I believe that the lineal descendants should \nreceive a portion of the judgment. S. 391 would distribute about 30% of \nthe undistributed funds to the tribes and about 70% to the unaffiliated \nlineal descendants.\n  This split of the undistributed funds would equalize the distribution \nbetween tribal lineal descendants and the non-tribal member class of \nlineal descendants. Capping the non-tribal member class at 600 persons \nmore than the 1,988 already identified lineal descendants was the \nmethod the Committee adopted for calculating the percent of the \nundistributed funds to be allocated to lineal descendants regardless of \nthe final identified number. The split is not an attempt to achieve \nperfect parity among all lineal descendants, both tribal members and \nnon-tribal members. I recognize that there is some chance that the \nfinal identified number of lineal descendants may exceed 2,588. \nWhatever the final number may be, those lineal descendants will equally \nshare the 70% allocation.\n  However, the distribution split is justified because the tribes \nshould be the primary beneficiaries of the judgment they won after 17 \nyears of litigation before the Indian Claims Commission. They were \nunder compensated in the 1972 act based on their numbers and it is \nimportant that these judgment funds, to the greatest extent possible, \nbe used to support tribal government programs and services. Moreover, \nthe split is based on actual identified lineal descendants plus a \nreasonable additional number who may be identified in the future and \nrepresents a reasonable and long overdue resolution of this issue.\n  Finally, I want to clarify the intent of a portion of subsection (f) \nof section 8, a subsection added to S. 391 in the last few days. The \nreference in subparagraph (2)(B) of that subsection to ``any such \nclaims'' includes any claim that may be brought in intervention by a \ncovered Indian tribe.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt S. 391.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to, bill as amended be considered read \nthe third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable and that any statements relating to the bill appear at this point \nin the Record.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 391), as amended, was considered read the third time, \nand passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12266-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12268-S12270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS BLOOD \n                                SERVICES\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Res. 119, \nand the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 119) recognizing the \n     50th anniversary of the American Red Cross Blood Services.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the American Red Cross Blood Services. The Red Cross \nBlood Services has been saving lives since its inception during World \nWar II. Today, in a rapidly changing health care environment, with ever \nincreasing challenges, the Red Cross continues to serve patients \nthroughout our country.\n  The Red Cross is America's first nationwide, volunteer blood \ncollection and distribution system. During World War II, the Red Cross \nsaved soldiers' lives by collecting and distributing blood. This led to \nthe first National Civilian Blood Program, with the opening\n\n[[Page S12269]]\n\nof the first blood center in 1948. Today, the Red Cross serves over \n3,000 hospitals nationwide by supplying almost half of the nation's \nblood for transfusion. This life-giving service is made possible by \nvolunteers who generously donate nearly six million units of blood each \nyear.\n  In 1991, the Red Cross began a comprehensive technology and systems \nreview, to ensure the organization entered the next century with state-\nof-the-art programs, systems, and facilities. This program, entitled, \n``Transformation,'' is a $287 million modernization of every aspect of \nblood collection, processing, and distributing. According to Red Cross \nPresident Elizabeth Dole, it is the most ambitious project that the Red \nCross has ever undertaken. Transformation's goals included the creation \nof a new centralized management structure, a new information system, \nand a program of the highest quality. Without objection, I'd like to \nsubmit a copy of Mrs. Dole's remarks at the 50th Anniversary \nBicentennial Celebration of the Red Cross, which includes comments on \nTransformation, for the record.\n  Transformation successfully consolidated 50 individual, non-\nstandardized labs operated by local Blood Regions into eight state-of-\nthe-art National Testing Laboratories that perform 70 million \nlaboratory tests each year. These new labs serve the Red Cross as well \nas several non-Red Cross blood centers. As part of this Transformation, \nthe American Red Cross has undertaken a Manufacturing and Computer \nStandardization initiative. This program has integrated 28 different \ncomputer systems into one national system, linking Red Cross Blood \nRegions across the nation to the world's largest information database \nfor transfusion medical research.\n  In addition, Transformation has led to standardized manufacturing \nprocesses throughout the Red Cross system, thereby promoting a \nconsistent standard of high quality blood services. A centrally managed \nblood inventory system operated by the Red Cross was designed to \nfacilitate consistent availability of blood in every region of the \ncountry. Transformation has also created the Quality Assurance Program \nand a new Charles Drew Biomedical Institute which provides training and \nother education to personnel, using state of the art technology which \ndoes not require staff and volunteers to travel for training. \nInstructors can now train personnel in a wide range of fields across \nthe country.\n  Through the American Red Cross Jerome H. Holland Laboratory, a \npremiere blood research facility, significant progress has been made in \nimproving transfusion safety, and fostering the development of new \nblood products. Red Cross has shared the knowledge and expertise gained \nthrough studies conducted by Holland Laboratory scientists and \nphysicians with the transfusion services of countries throughout the \nworld. The Red Cross translates research into life-saving products for \npatients because of its tremendous investment in research and \ndevelopment. Let me just note that the risk of becoming infected with \nHIV through a blood transfusion has been reduced from one in 220,000 in \n1991, to one in 676,000 today--a tremendous improvement in the safety \nof the blood supply.\n  I congratulate the 32,000 paid staff and 1.3 million volunteers on \ntheir first fifty years of providing blood services, and especially \nwant to recognize Mrs. Elizabeth Dole and her tremendous management \nteam for their vision in the implementation of the Transformation \nprogram.\n  In recognition of their accomplishments, I am introducing the \nfollowing bill, with ten of my colleagues, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Lott, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Coats, Ms. Murray, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Harkin, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Bingaman, to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the American Red Cross Blood Services.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements related to the resolution \nappear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 119) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 119\n\n       Whereas the American Red Cross is a nonprofit humanitarian \n     organization of 32,000 paid staff, 1,300,000 volunteers, and \n     4,300,000 blood donors which considers its role in the \n     provision of blood services to be a public trust;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross Blood Services began by \n     collecting and distributing blood to help save the lives of \n     soldiers on the battlefields of World War II, and has evolved \n     to become a leader in the healthcare industry;\n       Whereas following World War II the American Red Cross \n     created the first national civilian blood program, opening \n     its first blood center in 1948;\n       Whereas through the generosity of over 4,300,000 voluntary \n     blood donors the American Red Cross is able to provide half \n     the Nation's blood supply, and everyday, in communities \n     throughout this country, many thousands of people receive \n     lifesaving blood in the 3,000 hospitals served by the 38 \n     American Red Cross Blood Regions;\n       Whereas in May 1991, the American Red Cross announced its \n     ambitious ``Transformation'' program, a 7-year, $287,000,000 \n     comprehensive modernization of every aspect of the American \n     Red Cross Blood Services blood collection, testing, \n     processing, and distribution systems;\n       Whereas one of the most massive undertakings of \n     Transformation was the Manufacturing and Computer \n     Standardization (MACS) initiative which integrated 28 \n     different computer systems into a single, national system \n     linking American Red Cross Blood Regions nationwide to the \n     world's largest blood information database for transfusion \n     medicine research, and standardized manufacturing processes;\n       Whereas under Transformation the more than 50 individual, \n     nonstandardized laboratories operated by local American Red \n     Cross Blood Regions were replaced by 8 state-of-the-art \n     National Testing Laboratories, which effectively implement \n     the latest medical technology to perform the testing of \n     approximately 6,000,000 units of blood annually, serving both \n     American Red Cross blood centers and several non-American Red \n     Cross blood centers as well, and are located in Atlanta, \n     Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dedham, Massachusetts; \n     Detroit, Michigan; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Portland, \n     Oregon; St. Louis, Missouri; and St. Paul, Minnesota;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross Blood Services has created a \n     Quality Assurance program recognized throughout the world as \n     a leader in assuring quality in the manufacture of blood \n     products;\n       Whereas the creation of the Charles Drew Biomedical \n     Institute has allowed the American Red Cross to provide \n     training and other educational resources to American Red \n     Cross Blood Services' personnel through ``One Touch'' which \n     is an interactive, distance learning system that allows \n     instructors to train personnel across the country from the \n     institute's location at American Red Cross Biomedical \n     Headquarters in Rosslyn, Virginia;\n       Whereas Transformation saw the development of a centrally \n     managed blood inventory system to ensure the consistent \n     availability of blood and blood components in every American \n     Red Cross Blood Services Region throughout the country, and \n     the creation of the new centralized organizational structure \n     within American Red Cross Blood Services;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross Jerome H. Holland Laboratory \n     in Rockville, Maryland, is the world's premiere blood \n     research facility, consistently contributing to the progress \n     of biomedical science, especially transfusion safety and new \n     blood products, and shares its expertise with a number of \n     countries around the world;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross manages an almost \n     $30,000,000 investment in research and development, which \n     includes $8,000,000 in Federal research grants, and is \n     committed to working with others in the biotechnology field \n     to ensure that this pioneering research is translated into \n     lifesaving products available for patient use as quickly as \n     possible;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross is investigating and \n     implementing the newest technologies to ensure blood safety, \n     including Genome Amplification Technology to test for the \n     human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and for hepatitis C virus \n     (HCV), solvent detergent treated fresh frozen plasma, virus \n     inactivated plasma for transfusion, use of iodine in plasma \n     filtration, and inactivation of viruses in cellular products \n     (such as red blood cells) through a light-activated dye \n     called 491;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross is in the constant process \n     of modernization and improvement and at the forefront of new \n     product development, and is prepared to enter the 21st \n     century as a cutting-edge organization providing safe, high \n     quality blood and blood products to the hundreds of thousands \n     of patients in need;\n       Whereas Congress and the American Red Cross join in \n     celebrating the phenomenal success in the reduction of HIV \n     infection through the use of blood and blood products as \n     evidenced by the fact that in 1991 an American's risk of HIV \n     transmission through a blood transfusion was 1 in 220,000 and \n     today the risk is 1 in 676,000, nearly nonexistent; and\n\n[[Page S12270]]\n\n       Whereas Congress and the American Red Cross encourage \n     healthy Americans to donate blood by calling the American Red \n     Cross: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) joins with the American Red Cross in celebration of the \n     50th anniversary of American Red Cross Blood Services and the \n     impact of their efforts on modern medicine; and\n       (2) looks forward to the tremendous possibilities and \n     potential for discovery and innovation as the American Red \n     Cross Blood Services enters the next 50 years of providing \n     the Nation with a safe blood supply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12268-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1998\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Before he leaves the floor, I would like to pay tribute, \nas several of our colleagues have, to our distinguished friend, the \nSenator from the State of Indiana, Dan Coats.\n  Obviously, his career in the Senate is coming nearly to the end here, \nbut those of us who have had the chance to serve with him and who are \nfriends of his will miss him greatly in this body.\n  When I came to the Senate 4 years ago, I thought about the kinds of \npeople whose advice and counsel I wanted to have. And the first name on \nthe list as I was planning my first trip to the Senate after the \nelection was Dan Coats. From that point on, he has been a friend, a \nmentor, somebody whose judgment and advice I have respected as highly \nas anyone's in this Chamber.\n  He has served his State with great distinction, but those of us who \nlive in Michigan have a special fondness for him because, of course, he \nis a native of our State. He grew up in Jackson, MI, so although he \nrepresents Indiana in the Senate, to many Michiganites and many of my \nconstituents when I am in the southern portion of my State, they look \nat Dan Coats as their third Senator.\n  So he has not only been a great friend to Michigan as a native but \nalso as a Senator who has worked closely with us. I wish to say to him \nbefore he leaves the floor how much I value his friendship, how much I \nlook forward to working with him in the future on other causes, and how \nmuch I hope that, at whatever point I bring my career in the Senate to \nan end, I will be thought of even half as fondly and with half as much \nrespect as he has, because I think all of us who serve here hold him in \nthe very highest of esteem.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/09/senate-section/article/S12270-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL TOMORROW\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
