FORD NATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n                                  1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of H.R. 4057, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4057) to amend title 49, United States Code, \n     to reauthorize programs of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 20 \nminutes for debate, equally divided between the majority and minority \nleaders, prior to the vote on passage.\n\n\n                              section 606\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to point out to the Chairman \nthat Section 606 contains a provision that appears to grant priority \nstatus to a single carrier at Chicago O'Hare for the return of slots \npreviously withdrawn for international service. If it is the intention \nof this provision to give one carrier at O'Hare preference in slot \nallocation, the Senate conferees must act in conference to remove this \nprovision.\n  This provision appears to hand over roughly 35 slots that the \ndominant carrier at Chicago previously sought to obtain from the \nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) but was twice denied.\n  This provision would advantage a single carrier, which knew of the \npriority of slot withdrawal and should have planned its hub operations \nto take into account the effects. It strengthens a single carrier's \nposition at O'Hare, a situation which the Congress should not \nlegislate.\n  As this legislation goes to conference, the Senate is relying on the \nconferees to ensure Congress is even-handed in these matters.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand the Senator's concerns, which others have \nraised as well. I appreciate the Senator from Oklahoma expressing these \nviews.\n\n\n                       death on the high seas act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would like to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman \nfrom Arizona, the distinguished Chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nconcerning provisions included in the FAA reauthorization bill to \nreform the Death on the High Seas Act.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be happy to engage the gentleman from Oregon in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chairman. As the Chairman knows, one of my \nconstituents, John Sleavin, lost his brother and nephew and niece under \ntragic circumstances when their pleasure boat was run down on the high \nseas by a Korean freighter. The accident was especially tragic because \nafter the collision there was no attempt by the Korean freighter to \nrescue the family or even to notify the authorities about the \ncollision. Mr. Chairman, you were very gracious to me in allowing my \nconstituent to testify before the Commerce Committee on the need to \nreform the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) to provide just \ncompensation for victims like my constituent. I believe he provided \ncompelling testimony on the need for reforming DOHSA for\n\n[[Page S10946]]\n\nmaritime accidents. The FAA reauthorization bill reforms DOHSA but only \nfor aviation accidents. I would like to ask the Chairman whether he \nwill commit to work with me to reform DOHSA comprehensively so the \nreforms cover both aviation and maritime accidents.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I am committed to work with the Senator from Oregon \nand other Members who have an interest in this issue to explore this \nissue further and to work to reform DOHSA to appropriately provide \nvictims of maritime accidents the same rights to recover for loss of \ntheir loved ones as are provided to victims of aviation accidents.\n  (At the request of Mr. McCAIN, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                       permimeter rule exemptions\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, and I would like to ask the \nChairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation a \nquestion concerning the perimeter rule exemptions that are contained in \nS. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System \nImprovement Act.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be delighted to respond to questions from the \nSenators from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We thank you. We first want to thank the members of the \nCommerce Committee for working so diligently to produce a comprehensive \nFAA reauthorization bill, and for giving us the opportunity to address \na provision in this bill which affects the people of our state and many \nof the other western states.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The FAA reauthorization bill will provide important \nand necessary funding to our nation's aviation system. It is crucial \nthat we work to pass this legislation before the end of this session. \nBut, there is one provision in this bill that we must resolve before we \ncan go forward. The exemptions to the Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport Perimeter Rule has come to our attention as a section of this \nbill which opens the door to an array of concerns. The change in the \nPerimeter Rule will allow for six new daily round trip flights between \nReagan National Airport and airports beyond the 1,250-mile perimeter.\n  We have some questions as to who will be served if these exemptions \nare enacted by Congress. We would like to see the highest level of \nservice provided to the most number of passengers. Do you believe that \nthis Perimeter Rule exemption would prevent airlines from competing to \nprovide the greatest amount of service to the most number of \npassengers?\n  Mr. McCAIN. This provision included by the committee is intended to \nimplement a process that will provide numerous domestic cities, \nincluding small and medium-sized committees, with improved service. \nHowever, the provision allows for competition for routes to larger \ncommunities.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask the distinguished chairman to yield to a further \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Specifically, would carriers be prevented from competing \nfor routes from National Airport to Los Angeles or San Jose or other \nCalifornia airports under this bill?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. As long as carriers can demonstrate that their routes \nprovide domestic network benefits and increase competition in multiple \nmarkets, they may compete for these non-stop routes, including select \nroutes to California airports.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nWendell H. Ford National Air Transportation Improvement Act of 1998. As \na member of the Commerce Aviation Subcommittee, it has been my \nprivilege to work with Senator Ford on this and other bills to improve \nthe quality and safety of air transportation in this country, and I \nbelieve it is a fitting tribute that we name this bill in his honor.\n  I appreciate the assistance I received from the Senator from Kentucky \nand from my good friend, the Chairman, Senator McCain, in adding three \namendments to this bill which I believe will help improve safety, \nquality and access.\n  I will vote for this bill because on the whole, it will benefit our \nairports and air travelers. But I do want to make it clear that I do \nnot support sections 606 and 607. These sections will be detrimental to \ncommercial air service to Maine and the other markets within the \nperimeter rule. While I will not be offering an amendment to strike \nthese two sections, I would encourage the conferees to seriously \nconsider the detrimental effects these sections will have on air \nservice.\n  Section 606 will negatively alter the perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Airport in a way that jeopardizes air service to \nMaine. It is my opinion that expanding the number of slots would \nclearly result in more negatives than positives.\n  Due to the current Federal Aviation Administration guidelines on the \ndistance required between aircraft, adding flights at National airport \nwill require air traffic controllers to chose between staying on \nschedule or sacrificing safety.\n  If more flights are added through the creation of these new slots in \nSection 606, the controller will have to place these flights more \nclosely together in order to prevent delays in arrivals and departures. \nBy decreasing the spacing of the flights in and out of Reagan National, \nit will create an unsafe situation by subjecting the flights to the jet \nwash, or turbulence, of flights in front of them. Such exposure to the \njet wash, especially at take-off creates a terrible safety situation. \nOne which will jeopardize lives of the traveling public.\n  I am also concerned about the way that section 606 distributes the \nnew slots are distributed. Specifically, the section gives priority \nconsideration to air carriers who have already had slots withdrawn from \nthem. This will result in the majority of new slots to go to one \ndominate carrier and further increase already overpriced business \nairfares. Further, this language will overturn a March 1998, Department \nof Transportation decision concerning the distribution of slots.\n  I would also like to note my opposition to section 607, which \nmodifies the perimeter rule. It is well established that the perimeter \nrule maintains a delicate balance between National Airport and Dulles \nInternational Airport. Under the perimeter rule, Dulles has flourished \nas an international gateway, and National has provided regional service \nto states such as Maine.\n  I believe that in the long run, violating the perimeter rule will \nhurt travelers from Maine. Eroding the perimeter rule will bring long-\nhaul flights to National--short haul flights, in turn, will be rerouted \nto Dulles or eliminated altogether. Ironically, violating the perimeter \nrule would also hurt those underserved communities the legislation is \ndesigned to assist. Modifying the perimeter rule could encourage \nairlines at National to substitute long-haul flights for existing \nservice to smaller communities within the perimeter.\n  I believe that the amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia, \nMr. Robb, which I have cosponsored, will mitigate some of the potential \nimpact of modifying the perimeter rule by making it incumbent on the \nSecretary of Transportation to ensure that these changes will not \nreduce travel options for communities served by small and medium sized \nairports within the perimeter and not result in meaningful increases in \ntravel delays.\n  I also would want to note the Dorgan-Snowe amendment that was adopted \nand to thank the Chairman and Ranking member for their helping in \nworking through the language. The Dorgan-Snowe amendment would \nfacilitate air service to under-served communities and encourage \nairline competition through non-discriminatory interconnection \nrequirements by permitting the Secretary of Transportation to require \nmajor carriers to enter into agreements with new entrant air carriers \nwhich serve rural or underserved markets.\n  This amendment will give the Secretary of Transportation the \nauthority to require an air carrier that serves an essential airport \nfacility, such as a major hub, and has an exclusive--almost \nmonopolistic--agreement with another airline which serves an under-\nserved market to enter into a joint fare or interline agreement with a \nnew air carrier, trying to enter the underserved market so that the \npeople living in the rural or underserved area will have a competitive \nalternative and not be beholden to one airline.\n  This would allow a new airline to fly from a rural or underserved \nmarket to a hub airport which is dominated by a\n\n[[Page S10947]]\n\nmajor carrier and permit the traveler to continue to another market on \nthe megacarrier without having to purchase a second ticket or worrying \nif their bags will be transferred to the megacarrier.\n  I want to make it perfectly clear. States which are primarily rural \nor have a large number of underserved markets will benefit from this \namendment. Opponents of this amendment argue that this is re-\nregulation. Nothing is further from the truth. Senator Dorgan and I are \nestablishing a mechanism which will allow new entrant carriers to be \nable to compete with the mega air carriers. Only if the Secretary \nbelieves that underserved markets will benefit and that competition \nwill result, will an interline agreement be sanctioned.\n  It is interesting to note that when the commercial air carrier \nindustry was deregulated, there were 19 domestic trunk-line and local \nservice carriers. Of those 19, only 5 (American, Continental, Delta, \nNorthwest, and United) airlines are still in existence. At the time of \nderegulation, eight of the 15 airlines controlled 80% of the market \nshare. Today, the seven largest carriers control more than 90% of the \nmarket.\n  Some say that this is positive result of deregulation, claiming that \nderegulation was designed to promote a ``survival of the fittest'' type \nindustry and promote profitability. Unfortunately, deregulation has \nactually hurt the vast majority of communities in the United States and \nthe passengers who travel from small and medium sized markets. \nAccording to a Government Accounting Office report, the full benefits \nof deregulation have yet to be realized because of problems with \nentering the markets dominated by a major airline.\n  As a result of deregulation, consumers are actually paying far more \nfor air travel. In fact, a doubling of an airline's market share on a \nparticular route translates into a price increase of almost nine \npercent. Today, as a result of the lack of competition at small and \nmedium sized markets, it is cheaper to fly from Washington, D.C. to \nMexico City on an unrestricted ticket than it is to fly from Washington \nto Portland, Maine.\n  Our amendment would require carriers who enter into interline and \njoint fare agreements with other carriers, like those which have \nalready been proposed and implemented on a limited basis by the \nmegacarriers, to provide these agreements on a non-discriminatory basis \nto carriers seeking to provide service between an underserved market \nand a large hub airport in which one carrier has market dominance.\n  Open access like that proposed in this amendment is nothing new. In \nfact Congress, just two and one-half years ago, approved legislation \nwith similar requirements. When Congress de-regulated the \ntelecommunications industry, the fundamental element to promote \ncompetition in that legislation was the requirement that the incumbent \ncarriers would be required, by law, to allow their competitors to \ninterconnect into their network.\n  In a situation analogous to the telecommunications market, in order \nto develop competition in the local market, we must impose, by law, the \nrequirement that the dominant megacarriers, allow its competitors to \ninterconnect into their networks. By adopting this amendment, new \nentrant carriers will be allowed to interconnect into the flight \nnetwork of a major carrier which dominates a hub airport. In light of \nwhat has been required of other industries under the goal of promoting \ncompetition, this amendment makes sense if one wants to see a \ncompetitive airline industry.\n  The only way to allow for competition in this environment is to \nimpose conditions on the major carriers to cooperate with their \ncompetitors. Interline and joint fares are necessary to ensure that the \ndominant carriers will not kill potential competitors.\n  Through the adoption of this amendment, much like the principle \nunderlying the local competition in the telecommunications industry, we \nwill be able to provide more choices, lower costs, and better service \nto the majority of markets across the country.\n\n\n     permanent ban on rocky mountain national park commercial tour \n                              overflights\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as I cast my vote in favor of final \npassage of the Federal Aviation Administration's Reauthorization bill, \nS.2279, I am pleased to bring attention to one special amendment to \nthis bill.\n  The amendment which my colleague Senator Allard and I offered will \nmake the FAA's temporary ban on commercial tour overflights permanent. \nI have been working toward permanently banning commercial tour \noverflights over Rocky Mountain National Park for many years now, and \nam pleased to see this provision pass the Senate.\n  As I cast my vote today, Coloradans will be one big step closer to \nbeing assured that they will be able to enjoy the scenic beauty of \nRocky Mountain National Park without the noisy disturbances of \ncommercial tour overflights.\n  At this time I want to thank Senator McCain, who as the Chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, played a critical role in getting this \namendment successfully included in the FAA bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, section 606 subparagraph (6) of S. 2279 \nwill have the unintended consequences of limiting competition at \nChicago's O'Hare airport. I have spoke at length with Senators Lott, \nMcCain, and Ford regarding my concerns with this provision and \nunderstand that it may be possible to correct this problem in \nconference. I hope that is the case.\n  This provision will allow those carriers who have lost landing/\ntakeoff slots to foreign air carriers at Chicago's O'Hare to get them \nback. On the surface this seems very fair; however, it will in fact \nunfairly favor the largest slot holder at O'Hare at the expense of \nother competitors and new entrants. Because the dominant carrier at \nO'Hare has lost the most slots, it stands to gain the most. The result \nwill be less competition rather than more at O'Hare.\n  Mr. President, by way of further explanation on this issue, I would \nlike to submit for the Record a letter Senator Nickles and I sent to \nSenators Lott, Daschle, McCain, Hollings, Shelby, and Lautenberg \ndescribing our concerns and asking for their assistance in correcting \nthe problem.\n  Knowing that the managers of the bill have worked very hard to \nincrease competition, I am certain they share my concerns regarding \nmarket domination at O'Hare. In my discussions with Senator Lott, he \nhas assured me that he has no position on section 606 and would not \nobject to this section being removed in conference.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1998.\n     Hon.

Shelby,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation, Senate \n         Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     Minority Member, Subcommittee on Transportation, Senate \n         Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We are writing to express our strong \n     opposition to a proposal that would increase major airline \n     dominance at a key hub airport while at the same time \n     reversing a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) decision \n     and undercutting our international obligations. Specifically, \n     a provision in Section 606 of FAA Reauthorization (S. 2279) \n     would hand over roughly 35 slots at Chicago's O'Hare \n     International Airport to its largest slot holder, United \n     Airlines, while restricting access at that hub to its \n     competitors and new entrants. It is our understanding that \n     this special interest provision is being adviced for \n     inclusion in other pieces of ``must-pass'' legislation. Such \n     special interest legislation benefiting one airline will no \n     doubt lead to less competition and higher airfares. We urge \n     you to foster greater airline competition by deleting this \n     special interest provision from S. 2279 and preventing it \n     from being attached to other legislation.\n       Late last year, United petitioned FAA on just this issue \n     and was rejected soundly. United sought priority for any \n     future slot exemptions claiming they would replace the 35 \n     slots withdrawn under FAA regulations and used by foreign \n     carriers in order to meet our bilateral commitments. In a \n     March 1998 order, FAA found that the public interest\n\n[[Page S10948]]\n\n     would be best served by continuing to meet our aviation \n     bilateral agreement commitments to international air \n     transportation using the slots withdrawn from United and \n     American Airlines at O'Hare, while using the slot exemptions \n     to increase competition at that key airport. The priority by \n     which slots were to be withdrawn was well known. United chose \n     not to invest in better priority slots to protect its \n     schedule and slot holdings. In rejecting United's request, \n     FAA found:\n       ``Since 1993 the FAA withdraws, on average, 31 air carrier \n     slots from United, which is approximately four percent of \n     United's domestic slot base. These slots are withdrawn based \n     on a priority numbering system that was established by random \n     lottery in 1986. Slots having the lowest numbers are most \n     vulnerable to withdrawal, regardless of the slot holder. As \n     articulated in our previous denial to United concerning this \n     issue, United made its selection or acquisition of slots with \n     vulnerable withdrawal priority and planned its hub operations \n     fully knowing the effects of the rule's operations might have \n     upon them . . . United knew, or should have known, that these \n     slots were vulnerable in case of withdrawal.''\n       We applaud the Commerce Committee's efforts to fashion a \n     bill that promotes greater airline competition aimed at \n     producing lower airfares and improved service in all \n     communities. Accordingly, we respectfully urge your support \n     for striking this provision of section 606, the effect of \n     which is directly opposite the intent of S. 2279 and other \n     procompetitive aviation legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jim Inhofe,\n     Don Nickles.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support H.R. 4057, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA) Reauthorization Act and I commend my colleagues on \nthe bipartisan and expeditious manner in which this important \nlegislation was adopted by the Senate. This bill will reauthorize the \nprograms of the FAA for two years, including the Airport Improvement \nProgram (AIP), which is due to expire on September 30. The purpose of \nthe AIP is to provide grants to fund the capital needs of the nation's \ncommercial airports and general aviation facilities. Without this \nimportant FAA reauthorization legislation to continue the contract \nauthority for the AIP, the FAA would not be able to distribute airport \ngrants that are vitally important to not only the State which I am \nhonored to represent, West Virginia, but also the entire nation.\n  A major focus of H.R. 4057 is promoting competition and quality air \nservice which, Mr. President, the State of West Virginia needs \ndesperately. Since the deregulation of the airlines, West Virginia \ntravelers have suffered from increased airfares and greatly reduced \nservice. Consequently, the inefficiencies in the present air \ntransportation system and the high costs have denied air passengers and \nair freight shippers in West Virginia reasonable access to the national \nand international air transportation system.\n  Mother Nature has blessed the State of West Virginia with a beautiful \nbut most unforgiving terrain. Steeply undulating mountains and deep \ngorges are punctuated by sweetly serene valleys and hollows, and West \nVirginia is kind to those who need to travel through the State by \nautomobile. Yet, despite the rigorous terrain of the State, most people \nhave to drive great distances even to catch an airplane for what is \nusually the first of several stops en route to their final destination. \nIn eastern West Virginia, residents travel to either Dulles or Reagan \nNational Airports in Virginia; in the northern reaches, residents drive \nto Pennsylvania or Ohio; and in the southern portion of the State, they \nmay have to drive to North Carolina to get to a major hub. Not only is \nthe limited availability of flights and destinations a problem for air \ntravel originating within West Virginia, but so is the exorbitant cost \nof air transportation to and from the State. For example, a round trip \nair ticket from Reagan National Airport to Yeager Airport in Charleston \ncan cost almost $700. That is almost $700 to travel under 400 miles--\nand when you are done, you are only as far away as Washington, D.C. \nLeaving from Washington, $700 can take you to Europe and back! This \ndoes not make sense to most hardworking West Virginians, and it \ndiscourages other travelers from visiting to experience West Virginia's \nmany wonders for themselves.\n  With the advent of the 21st Century just around the corner, the West \nVirginia air travelers and businesses that rely on air freight will \nwelcome this legislation. West Virginia's expected economic expansion \nin the 21st century will depend on its ability to compete not only in \nthe national economy, but also in the ever-growing global economy. To \nsuccessfully compete, quality, affordable, and efficient air \ntransportation is needed to successfully round out West Virginia's \nincreasingly modern infrastructure of highways, railways, and \nwaterways.\n  Mr. President, this bill, H.R. 4057, contains other necessary \nlanguage to help West Virginia progress into the new millennium. Major \nprovisions of this bill are not only the AIP program, but also the \nSmall Communities Air Service Development Program, and slot exemptions \nfor nonstop regional jet service.\n  The Small Communities Air Service Development Program will be a four-\nyear, $30 million, small communities grant program. Executed through \nthe Department of Transportation, this program will encourage \ncommercial air service to small communities all over the United States, \nincluding those in West Virginia. By providing matching funds of up to \n25 percent, a consortia of local communities in West Virginia is \nexpected to compete for the grants of $500,000 per year available per \ncommunity.\n  It was Thomas Edison who said, ``Restlessness and discontent are the \nnecessities of progress.'' Mr. President, this captures the way that I \nfeel about additional slot exemptions for nonstop regional jet service \nat Ronald Reagan National Airport. I share the concern expressed by the \ndistinguished Senators from the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth \nof Virginia regarding increased noise pollution in the localities \nsurrounding Reagan National Airport. On the other hand, twelve \nadditional slots to increase traffic between Washington and smaller, \nnon-hub airports increases the likelihood of additional airline traffic \nto underserved areas like West Virginia. Improved air travel to and \nfrom States like West Virginia will be critical to my State's remaining \ncompetitive in the future and accessible in the present.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

and\n       (C) creating a toll-free, private-sector operated, \n     telephone number, staffed by multilingual operators, to \n     provide assistance to international tourists coping with an \n     emergency;\n       (9) by establishing a satellite system of accounting for \n     travel and tourism, the Secretary of Commerce could provide \n     Congress and the President with objective, thorough data that \n     would help policymakers more accurately gauge the size and \n     scope of the domestic travel and tourism industry and its \n     significant impact on the health of the Nation's economy; and\n       (10) having established the United States National Tourism \n     Organization under the United States National Tourism \n     Organization Act of 1996 (22 U.S.C. 2141 et seq.) to increase \n     the United States share of the international tourism market \n     by developing a national travel and tourism strategy, \n     Congress should support a long-term marketing effort and \n     other important regulatory reform initiatives to promote \n     increased travel to the United States for the benefit of \n     every sector of the economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to provide \n     international visitor initiatives and an international \n     marketing program to enable the United States travel and \n     tourism industry and every level of government to benefit \n     from a successful effort to make the United States the \n     premiere travel destination in the world.\n       (c) International Visitor Assistance Task Force.--\n\n[[Page S10957]]\n\n       (1) Establishment.--Not later than 9 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall \n     establish an Intergovernmental Task Force for International \n     Visitor Assistance (hereafter in this subsection referred to \n     as the ``Task Force'').\n       (2) Duties.--The Task Force shall examine--\n       (A) signage at facilities in the United States, including \n     airports, seaports, land border crossings, highways, and bus, \n     train, and other public transit stations, and shall identify \n     existing inadequacies and suggest solutions for such \n     inadequacies, such as the adoption of uniform standards on \n     international signage for use throughout the United States in \n     order to facilitate international visitors' travel in the \n     United States;\n       (B) the availability of multilingual travel and tourism \n     information and means of disseminating, at no or minimal cost \n     to the Government, of such information; and\n       (C) facilitating the establishment of a toll-free, private-\n     sector operated, telephone number, staffed by multilingual \n     operators, to provide assistance to international tourists \n     coping with an emergency.\n       (3) Membership.--The Task Force shall be composed of the \n     following members:\n       (A) The Secretary of Commerce.\n       (B) The Secretary of State.\n       (C) The Secretary of Transportation.\n       (D) The Chair of the Board of Directors of the United \n     States National Tourism Organization.\n       (E) Such other representatives of other Federal agencies \n     and private-sector entities as may be determined to be \n     appropriate to the mission of the Task Force by the Chairman.\n       (4) Chairman.--The Secretary of Commerce shall be Chairman \n     of the Task Force.

EXTENSION OF EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 9502(d) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to expenditures from \n     Airport and Airway Trust Fund) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``October 1, 1998'' and inserting ``October \n     1, 2000''; and\n       (2) by inserting before the semicolon at the end of \n     subparagraph (A) the following ``or the Wendell H.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendment, requests a conference with the House, and the Chair \nappoints the following conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel) appointed Mr. McCain, Mr. Stevens, \nMr. Gorton, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Ford conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Ashcroft is necessarily absent. \nFor the record, if he had been here today, he would have voted in favor \nof the Wendell Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is the Wendell Ford National Air \nTransportation System Improvement Act, as Chairman McCain just pointed \nout.\n  I see my good friend from Kentucky is here. I think that this is an \nact that should be named after the Senator from Kentucky because of his \nlong service on the Commerce Committee and particularly on the Aviation \nSubcommittee.\n  Our Nation has come through a very interesting period during the time \nthat Wendell Ford has been Senator from Kentucky--a total revolution in \naviation and a concentration on safety and improvement of our airway \nsystem.\n  Wendell Ford has been a leader in that effort. This bill signifies \nthe totality of what he has done for the aviation community.\n  I come to the floor today, because, as I believe most Members of the \nSenate know, Alaska is completely dependent upon air transportation.\n  Over 70 percent of our communities can only be reached by air year-\nround. We believe in the safety of that system.\n  I have been pleased to have the honor to be able to work with the \nSenator from Kentucky on a whole series of matters dealing with \noperations, with safety, and with the maintenance of the airways \nsystem, and in particularly with the development of air transportation \nfacilities on the ground.\n  As you go throughout this country and go to these major new \nterminals, you should think of Wendell Ford, because he has led us, \nthrough the period when he was chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, \nand during the period when he has been ranking member of that \nsubcommittee, to an understanding of what is necessary to keep the lead \nthat we have as a nation in aviation.\n\n  I come to the floor to thank my good friend for all he as done for us \nand for the Nation, but particularly to thank him on behalf of all of \nus in Alaska who rely so much on this system that he has improved and \nmade more safe.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is difficult for me to respond because it \nis somewhat melancholy, as this is my last effort at developing an \naviation package, to have such kind remarks come from my learned friend \nwho also has worked tirelessly in an attempt to make the aviation \nindustry safer, more accessible, helping it expand, and giving it the \nopportunity to grow.\n  He comes from a unique State. He sits down with you and explains the \nproblem. It isn't ``I am Ted Stevens, vote with me.'' He sits down and \nexplains the problem and what is needed to improve the problems of his \nfine State. It is very difficult for anyone to not help once they \nunderstand what Alaska has.\n  We have a great mix in this country. You go all the way from the cold \nin the north in the 49th State to the south where it is hot, and to \nHawaii, the 50th State. We have a great mix. The people who represent \nthose States are great.\n  My friend from Alaska is really and truly my friend. One of the \nthings I will miss around here is my association with him. He has \nhelped me on more than one occasion to do some things maybe that he \nwould rather not do. But I found, as my dad taught me, that you pay \nyour debts whether you sign the paper or shake a man's hand. Ted \nStevens' word is his bond. And I respect him for that. I respect what \nhe does as a Member of this institution.\n  I will feel comfortable when I leave here that Senator Stevens is \nhead of appropriations. He is still on the Commerce Committee. And when \nthe new aviation bill comes forth, he will be sure that those things \nthat we fought for so long will be improved.\n  I thank my friend very, very much.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for all their hard \nwork in putting this bill together. It was a tough task. But we have \nbeen able to work out just about every issue that was of concern to \nMembers on both sides of the aisle.\n  The FAA in the future years must be able to have the funding that it \nneeds to modernize. The new Administrator has a very difficult job. She \nhas been working with the industry and with Congress to move forward on \nmany tough issues.\n  Some have described the modernization of the air traffic control \nsystem like this: It is sort of like needing to rebuild your entire \nhouse, but you have to live there at the same time.\n  Modernization is a critical issue. We included in this bill a section \non tourism, and because of its importance to each of us and without an \naviation system that can grow, tourism will also be affected. In \nleaving, let me mention a few areas of concern.\n  In the next year the FAA and the aviation community, airports, \nairlines, manufacturers, and our international partners, all must \naddress the year 2000 computer problem. The FAA must also move forward \non the STARS and WASS programs. Think about that. We need to yank out \nall of the controller workstations across the country and put in new \ncomputers. All of us have had new systems put in our offices, and we \nknow it is a mess. The FAA has to do it while planes are still flying \nand people's lives are at stake. We may fault the FAA at times for not \nmoving as quickly as we want, but keep in mind how tough the task is.\n  With respect to the Wide Area Augmentation System, the industry is \nbeginning to equip its fleet to be able to take advantage of a \nsatellite-based tracking system. The FAA, Congress and the industry \nhave got to move forward with this new program. We have committed \nhundreds of millions of dollars to this effort, and we cannot turn back \nnow.\n  The Administrator knows all this, but this body has to give her the \nresources to do the job. Next year, you will debate and argue over how \nto fund the FAA. It is a critical matter. We know that traffic will \nincrease by 35 percent over the next several years. We know that our \nairports need to be expanded. Gridlock cannot occur because the FAA \ndoes not have the ability to meet the industry's needs.\n  I also want to mention the small communities program in this bill. \nThere are many segments of the country that have not received all the \nbenefits of deregulation. We are going to try to help those areas, but \nnot by merely giving them money. The communities will need to work hard \nto develop their markets and work with carriers to provide the needed \nservice.\n  I thank the chairman, Senator McCain. I know that he will continue to \nfight for FAA's needs next year. I also hope that we can quickly \nconclude the conference on this bill. There are a few tough issues that \nwill need to be decided by the Members, and I hope that we can come to \nclosure soon.\n  Mr. President, in this life in the Senate, you come across some very, \nvery fine people, and those are the ones who make this place run and \nare not recognized. We get all the publicity, good or bad. We have to \nface the voters, good\n\n[[Page S10968]]\n\nor bad. But the staff who support us, the staff who support the \ncommittee, the staff who support us on the floor, they are the ones who \nneed to have the accolades. They work hard--all night, they work 24 \nhours, around the clock--and we never seem to thank them as we should. \nI know my life in the Senate would have been made a lot tougher, and I \nprobably would not have succeeded had it not been for staff.\n  You find a lot of excellent staff, on both sides now. Don't think I \nam just talking about one side of the aisle. Ann--I hope I pronounce \nher last name right--Choiniere. Getting close? This is the first time I \nhave worked with her, and I found out how tough she can be but how \nthorough and fair she is representing the chairman; she has done an \nexcellent job. Mike Reynolds and others on Senator McCain's side have \nall done well. Senator Gorton's staff. He was fairly bright and smart \nwhen he brought Brett Hale from Kentucky on his staff. He is one of the \npeople around here who definitely understands Kentucky Wildcat \nbasketball, and we can talk together about that on occasion. And Jeanne \nBumpus on Senator Gorton's staff; Jim Drewry and Carl Bentzel, Dave \nRegan and others on my side.\n\n  But there is one you have to depend on, one who is the leader, one \nwho comes and sits down and we work through the problems and then get \nthe challenge to go and get it settled and come back and see where we \nare and keep you informed and keep you moving. Sam Whitehorn is that \nkind of fellow, and I am going to miss him. He and I have become good \nfriends. I don't look at him as a staff person. I look at him as a \nmember of the family, because he is. He is dedicated, and wants to get \nthe job done. And sometimes he has to do maybe what he didn't exactly \nlike to do, but I made the decision. Sam has been a good soldier \nthrough the whole thing, and I am grateful to him.\n  Mr. President, as we end this part of the aviation bill, I again \nthank my colleagues, and I look forward to being down in Kentucky to \nsee some of this work I have done, to watch it grow there, because we \nneed as much help as any other State. I am grateful for the opportunity \nI have had, and I thank the chairman again. Some people think he is \ntough and rough and that sort of thing, but he really has a soft spot. \nNow, if you can find that soft spot, you can get along with him. \nSometimes it is difficult to find it. But you see him laughing. That is \nthe kind of association we have had. I look forward to working with him \nto complete this bill, working in conference, so that when we leave \nhere sometime mid-October we can leave knowing we have done the best we \ncould, that we have tried to be responsible to the people we represent \nin this great country of ours.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Ford in thanking the staff \nfor their contributions: John Raidt, Ann Choiniere, Michael Reynolds, \nLloyd Ator, Scott Verstandig, Brad Sabala, and Bill Winter on the \nCommerce Committee staff; Ivan Schlager, Sam Whitehorn, Jim Drewry, and \nBecky Kojm with Senator Hollings' staff; Brett Hale and Jeanne Bumpus \nwith Senator Gorton; and David Regan with Senator Ford. Charles \nChambers and Tom Zoeller, who are no longer Senate staffers, made \nefforts in making this legislation happen. Also, Mr. President, because \nof the scope associated with this bill, we have negotiated with \nliterally every Senator and their staff members on various provisions \nof this bill, and I thank all of them, also.\n  But obviously, Mr. President, I wish to express again my deep and \nprofound appreciation to the Senator from Kentucky for his efforts on \nthis legislation and many, many other aviation bills that have moved \nthrough the Senate during my time here. I think it is a very small \ntoken that the bill before us is named for him. He deserves that \nrecognition and much, much more.\n  Mr. President, Senator Ford has been a Member of the U.S. Senate for \n24 years. That is a long time, even in the history of the U.S. Senate. \nI have had the privilege of working with him for 12. When I first came \nto the Commerce Committee 12 years ago, I spent a lot of time with \nSenator Ford then and in the intervening years, especially on aviation \nissues, because he is regarded, perhaps, as the most knowledgeable \nMember of the U.S. Senate on those issues.\n  Senator Ford is also known--as I think, perhaps, I may be to some \nextent--as a person who fights fiercely for the principles that he \nbelieves in, for what he believes is right as God gave him the right to \nsee it. And he also is a strong advocate for his party. I noted, while \nlooking at his biography this morning--I was scanning it--not only is \nhe a former Governor, but for 6 years he was the chairman of the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. I know that there are many \ntimes when he and his colleagues yearn for those golden days of \nyesteryear.\n  Mr. FORD. No, we lost then.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Did you? But Senator Ford has obviously served his party \nwith distinction as well. Around this place you have the opportunity of \nworking with your colleagues on a variety of issues, but I do not \nbelieve that I have observed anyone as effective, as single-minded, and \nas dedicated as the Senator from Kentucky. Yes, we have had fierce \ndifferences of opinion which have always been resolved at the end of \nthe day with a smile and a handshake. I have learned from those \nencounters. I believe one of the great learning experiences of my life \nwas in 1990 when Senator Ford was responsible for a massive \nrestructuring of the aviation system in America. The impact of that \nwill be felt well into the next century. I watched him guide that \nlegislation through all the rocks and shoals of the process around \nhere, and it emerged as a landmark piece of legislation.\n  I am proud to have learned from him. I am proud to have worked with \nhim and to be associated with him on a broad variety of various areas. \nMost of all, I will be pleased many years from now to be able to call \nhim my friend. So I thank him. I look forward to observing that same \nfierce determination as we do battle with the folks on the other side, \nto try to maintain this legislation intact as it has been reported out \nthrough the Senate.\n  As has often been observed, the Senator from Kentucky is not dying, \nhe is just leaving the Senate.\n  Mr. FORD. Thanks.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We will, for many, many years in the future, work with \nthe Senator from Kentucky and maintain our close relationships with \nhim. I know I speak for every Member on my side of the aisle when I say \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Thank you, John. I appreciate it very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me add my words of admiration for the \nwork done by Senator Ford. He has been an important part of the Senate \nfor many years and has done some very important things for his country \nand the Senate will miss very much the service that he has offered. He \nis in the leadership, has been for many years on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle. But he is fiercely independent. He is smart. He is tough, \nand he has all the qualities that you look for in a good legislator. He \nwill, in my judgment, for many, many years be remembered as one of the \nreally outstanding legislators in this body, and I feel very fortunate \nto have been able to serve with him. I just wanted to add those words \nto the words offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the importance of \ntoday's passage of the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization \nbill. Today is a great day for rural America's air passengers. This \nlegislation, now known as the Wendell H. Ford National Air \nTransportation System Improvement Act of 1998, will bring much needed \nair service to underserved communities throughout the Nation. It will \ngrant billions of dollars in Federal funds to our Nation's small \nairports for upgrades, through the Airport Improvements Program (AIP).\n  Additionally, Senator McCain, chairman of the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, is to be commended for his superb \nleadership on this complex and contentious measure. Together with \nSenator Ford, their joint efforts moved this bill through the committee \nand to the Senate floor in such a manner that the amendment process \nwent smoothly.\n  It is only fitting that this must-pass legislation be named after \nsuch a worthy Senator. Wendell Ford has spent\n\n[[Page S10969]]\n\nnearly 24 years as a Member of this body. For the last 10 years, I have \nenjoyed working with Senator Ford on a variety of issues within the \njurisdiction of the Senate Commerce Committee. Through his leadership \non this legislation, Senator Ford has proven himself as a champion of \nrural aviation issues. The Senate will certainly miss his guidance and \ninsight. Likewise, the Senate will miss his wry, biting humor.\n  Rural Americans are the biggest winners with the passage of the Ford \nAct. Citizens of underserved communities will no longer have to travel \nhundreds of miles and several hours to board a plane. This legislation \ngives incentives to domestic air carriers and its affiliates to reach \nout to these people and serve them conveniently near their homes. Many \nAmericans will be able to travel a reasonable distance to gain access \nto our Nation's skies and, from there, anywhere they wish to go.\n  Mr. President, I also applaud the hard work of Senator Bill Frist of \nTennessee. He added provisions to the Ford Act to expand small \ncommunity air service. His dedicated efforts ensured that underserved \ncities like Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Bristol/Johnson City are now in \na position to receive additional or expanded air service.\n  The major policy changes in the Ford Act led to hard fought but \nhonest disagreements. I have enormous respect for the efforts of \nSenators John Warner, Jim Inhofe, and Kay Bailey Hutchison as they \ndiligently advocated for their constituents and their respective \nStates. This honest debate is what makes it exciting to serve in the \nUnited States Senate. I was very pleased by the efforts of Senators \nSlade Gorton and Arlen Specter to address a very sensitive issue, while \nresolving it in a true Senate fashion--a consensus which will prove to \nbe beneficial to both sides of the debate.\n  Throughout the last 12 months, my home State of Mississippi has \nreceived Federal support from the AIP to make needed physical \nimprovements. A portion of these funds went to the Bobby L. Chain \nMunicipal Airport in Hattiesburg to rehabilitate their existing runway \npavement and lights. Other funds were allocated to the Jackson \nInternational Airport to construct a new taxiway and apron. These \nenhancements are needed. And this bill will ensure that the AIP will \ncontinue uninterrupted. AIP's reauthorization within the Ford Act will \nallow Mississippi to continue to receive funds for essential \nenhancements for the upcoming year. I look forward to working with the \nairport authorities in my home State to make sure that the right \nimprovements are made at the right airports. This is about safety and \nabout economic growth.\n  No legislative initiation is ever possible without the dedicated \nefforts of staff, and I want to take a moment to identify those who \nworked hard to prepare the Ford Act for consideration by the full \nSenate.\n  From the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation: \nMark Buse; Ann Choiniere; Jim Drewry; Becky Kojm; John Raidt; Mike \nReynolds; Ivan Schlager; Scott Verstandig; and Sam Whitehorn.\n  The following staff also participated on behalf of their Senators: \nDavid Broome; Steve Browning; Jeanne Bumpus; Nat Grubbs; Brett Hale; \nKatrina Hardin; Dan Renberg; Pam Sellars; Ellen Stein; Ben Thompson; \nand Clay Williams.\n  Mr. President, these individuals worked very hard on the Wendell H. \nFord National Air Transportation System Improvement Act of 1998 and the \nSenate owes them a debt of gratitude for their dedicated service to \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's small communities are a step closer to \nreceiving long-sought air service. Also, America's smaller, yet \nimportant air strips and airports will be enhanced. This is good for \nall Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S10945-5", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

I \ndeeply regret that.\n  The Senator from Florida, as I understand it, is insisting on a \nspecific result in this legislation. We never do that. The Senator from \nFlorida knows that. We don't insist on a specific result.\n  We would be more than happy to listen to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Florida. We would be glad to debate it. Perhaps I could even \nsupport it. But, frankly, what the Senator from Florida is doing right \nhere--the other 99 Senators are in agreement--by objecting to us moving \nforward to the bill that is vital to the future of the economy of this \nNation, I think the Senator from Florida takes on a very large \nresponsibility.\n  I want to tell the Senator from Florida I am going to file cloture \nright now and we are going to have a vote. And I also want to tell the \nSenator from Florida that because of that, we will delay, again, \nconsideration of this very important bill. We will move forward. I do \nnot understand why the Senator from Florida, after having a commitment \nof mine, that of the Senator from Oregon and everybody else, to give \nthe kind of consideration that he deserves, and ample debate, unlimited \ndebate on his amendment and a willingness to work with him--because the \nSenator from Florida knows that there is a Senator on this side who \ncannot agree to the language of the amendment that he is insisting on. \nThat is what debate is all about.\n  We just finished a bill, an omnibus aviation bill, where everybody \nsat down together.

Mr. President, let me just point out the President of the \nUnited States is in Silicon Valley today and the people in Silicon \nValley were under the impression that we were going to move forward \nwith this bill and resolve it next week. I hope that is duly noted.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am very hopeful that the Senate will not \nhave to get into this cloture matter with respect to the Internet tax \nbill. The Senator from Florida is one of the Senators that I most \nrespect in this body. I find myself agreeing with him on just about \neverything that comes before the Senate. As he knows, we have, over \nmany, many months, tried to address the host of legitimate concerns \nthat the States have. We have a number of Governors--the Senator from \nFlorida having served as Governor, as have others here--who know a \ntremendous amount about this. I have tried to make clear, as the \nprincipal sponsor of this legislation, all we are seeking is \ntechnological neutrality with respect to the Internet. The Internet \nwould be treated like everything else--nothing favorable, nothing \ndiscriminatory.\n  Because many of the Nation's Governors are concerned about other \nissues, particularly the question of out-of-State sales, this \nlegislation, S. 442, has become a magnet for a variety of other issues.\n  The sponsors, Senator McCain and I, especially have, in my view, done \nsomersaults now to make sure there was a fair evaluation of all the \nimportant issues with respect to out-of-State sales. Let me say, in \ndoing that, there have been a number of other Senators--Senator Gregg \nand Senator Lieberman--who I think have been very fair in an effort to \ntry to get to a compromise on this matter. As the Senator from Florida \nknows, just a few minutes ago Senator McCain and I were willing to make \nadditional changes in the managers' amendment to ensure that there \nwould be a fair study of both the Internet and commercial activities, \nwhich is the precise language that the Governors have sought.\n  I don't think there is anything else that Senator McCain, I, or \nothers can offer at this point to ensure that a fair and objective set \nof studies and analyses go on by the commission.\n  I hope that if there continues to be opposition to this legislation, \nthat those who oppose the legislation simply say that they are opposed \nand not, in effect, produce a situation which I think is going to turn \nwhat ought to be a bipartisan and thoughtful fight into what will be a \nvery bloody battle.\n  I see my friend from North Dakota here. The Senator from North Dakota \nhas had strong views on this, and over many, many months we have been \nnegotiating on it. He did not come to the floor today to object as a \nresult of that work, nor did Senator Bumpers.\n  I am hopeful that particularly Senators on the Democratic side are \nnot going to force what I think will be a very unfortunate and bloody \nfight with respect to a bill that has undergone more than 30 separate \nand important changes since it was originally introduced to accommodate \nthe concerns of the States and localities. Those folks were very, very \nopposed when this discussion started. They raised legitimate issues. We \nhave sought to deal with them. I am hopeful we will be able to go to a \nmotion to proceed early next week and not have a bitter fight as I \nthink we have over cloture.\n  Let me conclude by way of saying that I and my staff are prepared to \ncontinue to work around the clock with the Senator from Florida and \nothers who may have questions about how this legislation will affect \nthe States, but let us go forward in an effort to try to resolve this \nand not just get to a solution with respect to one section and then \nsay, ``Well, I have another one that we have to deal with,'' which, \nregrettably, has been the case. I have enormous respect for the Senator \nfrom Florida and I think one of the more unpleasant tasks is to have an \nargument with him. I hope this can be resolved.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate those kinds words from my \ngood friend from Oregon. I share the hope that we can arrive at a \nreasoned resolution of this matter.\n  I will briefly state why I think this is such an important piece of \nlegislation. First is fundamental fairness. We have a situation now in \nwhich remote commerce--that is, commerce that is not conducted through \nthe traditional retail sales outlet--is effectively exempted from State \nsales taxes. The same sweater that one would buy at the local \ndepartment store, subject to local and State sales taxes, is exempt \nfrom those taxes, for practical purposes, if it is purchased by a \nremote sale, either the traditional postal sales or by the \nnewer electronic commerce.\n\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that that degree of unfairness as to \ntaxability of the form of sales is a decision which has been made by \nthe Congress. It is, as Harvey Cox once observed, not to decide is to \ndecide. Our decision not to authorize the States to impose a tax on the \nseller using a remote sales method has resulted in the inability of the \nStates to impose that tax.\n  Therefore, as we are looking at the issue of Internet sales, those of \nus who are concerned about this unfairness in the marketplace where our \nlocal merchants are required to collect the sales tax and, therefore, \nare subject to the competitive disadvantage of their remote sales \nbrethren who are not--that this commission should study that issue. \nThat is one of the concerns that those of us who have been negotiating \non this matter want to see achieved.\n  But there is really a larger issue at stake here, Mr. President. Many \nof our States, including my own, are very heavily dependent upon the \nsales tax as the means for financing their basic responsibilities, and \nthe most basic responsibility of State government is education. In my \nState, some 35 to 40 percent of its tax collections, which are \npredominantly sales tax, are used to finance education.\n  What is happening is that as the new forms of commerce, particularly \nelectronic commerce, become more attractive and more available and more \nfamiliar, they are gathering a larger and larger share of all retail \nsales in the United States. If we adopt the policy that they should not \nbe subject to tax, as we have adopted the policy by inaction that \npostal long distance sales should not be subject to tax, we are going \nto substantially erode the ability of State government to carry out its \nmost fundamental responsibility, which is to educate the next \ngeneration of Americans.\n  That is the fundamental issue which I think is at stake here. The \nidea of having a short pause so that we can arrive at a rational way to \ndeal with all of these issues is appealing. I think the idea of this \nbill, as reported by the Finance Committee, to have a 2-year pause in \nany discriminatory taxation relative to Internet sales or charges to \nhave access to the Internet, and during that period to have a \ncommission that would look at all of this interrelated set of issues, \nis a proposition that I can support.\n  I just want to be personally satisfied that, in fact, that is going \nto be the result and that the result will not be a skewed study that \nwill exclude some of the most important aspects of this and which, by \nsaying that we are going to treat Internet commerce the same way as we \ndo other remote commerce, answers the question before it is asked, \nbecause we know how other forms of remote commerce are dealt with; \ni.e., they are exempt from State sales taxes. If we say the Internet \nshall be treated in an equivalent manner, we have preordained how it is \ngoing to be treated; i.e., exempt from State sales taxes, and we have \nfurther preordained that the States' fiscal capacity to carry out their \nimportant functions, particularly education, will be eroded.\n  Mr. President, that is why I have had this degree of disagreement \nwith some\n\n[[Page S10971]]\n\nof my best friends and colleagues in this Chamber, the Senator from \nOregon and the Senator from Arizona. I don't believe that we are that \nfar apart in terms of finding the set of words and phrases that will \ncarry out our joint intention, and I hope that between now and Tuesday \nwe can achieve that goal and be able to have a consideration. I \nrecognize that once this bill is up, there will be policy differences \namong the different parties. The National Governors' Association feels \nvery strongly about this legislation as it impacts the ability of the \nStates to meet their responsibilities, and those views deserve to get a \nproper airing.\n  I also recognize that the House has already passed a companion bill \nto this but which is somewhat different from the bill that is before \nthe Senate. So there will be a conference committee. There will be \nfurther reforms on this matter.\n  My concerns are fairness in the marketplace and the ability of the \nStates to be able to carry out their responsibilities, especially the \nresponsibility which I think the American people feel is the principal \nnational challenge today, which is to properly educate the next \ngeneration of Americans so that they will be able to compete in a world \nof electronic commerce.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to have made those \nclarifying remarks and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to make some comments on three \nitems that are left on the Senate's agenda that I am very concerned \nabout. The Senate is going to continue, for apparently 2 additional \nweeks, and try to adjourn for the year and finish the 105th Congress on \nOctober 9th or October 10th. In the 2 short weeks that remain, I am \ntold that we will consider H.R. 10, the financial modernization bill, \nfast-track trade authority for new trade treaties, and a substantial \ntax cut.\n  I want to describe how easy it is, with a small amount of time left, \nto make big mistakes. I am mindful there will be much disagreement \nabout these three items. And I am also mindful back in my hometown one \nof the older fellas who was the wise sage said, ``It's hard to tell the \ndifference between the open minded and the empty headed. They dress \nalike.''\n  Let me describe these three issues and tell you what I think is empty \nheaded about the attempt to try to pass these three pieces of \nlegislation in the final 2 weeks of a legislative session.\n\n\n                        Financial Modernization\n\n  First, H.R. 10, the Financial Services Act of 1998. H.R. 10 is a huge \npiece of legislation that deals with the financial institutions of this \ncountry and the methods by which they are involved in various kinds of \nactivities.\n  We have had some experience in this country with the mixing of \ndifferent kinds of enterprises--banks whose deposits are insured to \n$100,000, by the American taxpayer I might say; banks, those who are \nspeculating in real estate, those who are involved in securities \nactivities, those who are selling insurance; those kinds of financial \nactivities.\n  We have had some experience in this country putting a number of those \ntogether in one institution and then seeing, through speculation, one \npart of the institution weakening and eroding the other part of the \ninstitution that caused massive bank failures in our country. The \nresult was in the 1930s and this country said let's not forget what \nhappened here. Let's not allow this to happen again, and let's create \ncertain circumstances that would prevent us from merging banking \nenterprises whose very existence depends on the perception of safety \nand soundness--not unsafety and soundness, but on whether people \nperceive the institution to be safe and sound. Their very existence \ndepends on that.\n  Let's not threaten again the banking institutions by fusing together \nfinancial conglomerates that merge banks with the more speculative \nenterprises of securities and insurance, or even commerce.\n  The American public has in this century paid a heavy price for the \nmistakes in those areas and put together walls in the form of \nlegislation to prevent it from happening again. H.R. 10 is an attempt \nto bring the walls down. It says, ``Let's create a kind of financial \nfruit salad here. Let's decide we can merge all of these again. We can \nput all of these together and we can build firewalls, and you'll never \nfeel the heat in between and it will never threaten bank institutions \nand the American taxpayer will not be put at risk.''\n  I guarantee you this, that if this Congress passes in the final \nhours, H.R.10, financial modernization legislation, it will result \nalmost immediately in exacerbating the orgy of mergers that now exists \nin this country with big banks, and an orgy of mergers that will not \nonly include banks, but will continue to include, at a greater pace, \nbanks with the other kinds of financial enterprises I just described.\n  And 20 years or 30 years from now they will look back at this \nCongress and this period and say, ``How on Earth could they have \nthought that that made sense? How could they have possibly thought that \nwas in the public interest? How could they have forgotten the lessons \nthat they learned in the 1920s and 1930s that resulted in the \nlegislation that had protected us?''\n  I know that there are some big interests around this town who want \nthis bill to pass. There is a great deal of lobbying on its behalf. But \nI feel so strongly that to do this in the final 2 weeks of a \nlegislative session would have such enormous consequences and pose such \nsubstantial risks for our country that I am going to resist with all of \nmy effort the motion to proceed and in every other way to see if we \ncannot slow this train down on behalf of the American citizens.\n  I know it sounds attractive. I know some say, ``This is creating a \nnew financial blueprint for our institutions for the future, allowing \nthem to compete at home and abroad. It's now a global economy.'' What \nit is is forgetting the lessons of the past. It will be a replay, in \nsome ways, of the Garn-St Germain bill of the early 1980s in which they \nunhitched the S and said, It is OK. You go broker deposits. You load \nup with risky junk bonds. You can become Roman candles. Take a small \nS and turn it into a giant S with broker deposits, and you can do a \nwhole range of other things, and it is fine--and the American taxpayer \ngot stuck with a nearly $500 billion bailout for that fiasco.\n  If this bill passes, there will be massive, massive mergers once \nagain. And they have already been going on at an unprecedented and \nunhealthy pace in the banking industry and other related financial \nindustries. So that is one big mistake I hope this Congress will avoid \nin the remaining days of this session. And to the extent I have the \nenergy to be able to help them avoid it, I intend to try to do that.\n\n\n                               Fast Track\n\n  Second is fast track. I know that also has a lot of support, fast-\ntrack trade authority. Just the very words ``fast track'' connote lack \nof preparation. Fast track, fast food--you just go down the line on \nwhat ``fast'' precedes, and it describes well ``fast track.''\n  Fast track means you create a trade agreement negotiated in secret, \nbehind locked doors someplace, probably in most cases overseas, and \nbring it to Congress and say to Congress, ``You weren't there when we \nnegotiated this trade agreement, but you have no right to offer \namendments to it.''\n  The last three trade agreements under fast track have been \nincompetent. I voted against all three. In each case we have, as a \nresult of it, had higher and higher trade deficits--Canada, Mexico, \nGATT--record trade deficits. This country is choking on trade deficits. \nI think to bring fast track to the floor of the House and the Senate in \nthe final 2 weeks is regrettable.\n  I will, again, to the extent I have any capability of slowing this \ndown, there will be nothing fast about it. If I can create a \nlegislative bog through which they cannot pull this fast track, I \nguarantee you I will object to every circumstance that allows anybody \nto short-circuit any amount of time to try to get fast track through \nthis Congress. It is not in this country's interest to continue that \nkind of trade policy.\n\n[[Page S10972]]\n\n             A Tax Cut And the Social Security Trust Funds\n\n  The third item is an $80 billion tax cut paid for with Social \nSecurity trust funds. Some say, ``Well, that's not the way it's paid \nfor.'' Show me the money. Where do you get the money? You get the money \nfor a big tax cut by taking Social Security trust funds that are in a \nfund that is preceded by the word ``trust.'' Taking those trust funds \nand saying these now represent the resources by which we can offer a \ntax cut is not the way to do this country's business.\n  When we have that debate--and I expect we will next week or the week \nafter--it will be an aggressive debate because some of us are fiercely \ndetermined never to let that happen. I recall when we had the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget on the floor of the \nSenate, I voted against it. In fact, it lost by one vote. Had some \nfolks pretty upset with that vote. I said, ``It's not that I don't want \nto balance the budget, I do.'' I helped play a role in balancing or \nnearly balancing this country's budget, not by writing something in the \nConstitution, but by doing the kinds of things you need to do on a day-\nto-day basis, to do things on taxing and spending that really does \nbalance the budget. But to write into the Constitution a proviso that \nsays, ``Let's balance the budget by describing all revenue coming in as \noperating revenue'' is to mistreat the Social Security trust funds once \nagain. And to actually write it in the Constitution of the United \nStates, that does not make any sense to me.\n  It does not make any sense to me in the final 2 weeks of a \nlegislative session coming up to an election for anybody to say we are \ngoing to package up $80 billion in tax cuts so we can say to the \nAmerican people we are offering tax cuts, when in fact the money by \nwhich they offer these tax cuts is to take the money out of the Social \nSecurity trust funds and make them available for tax cuts.\n  Those moneys are not available. Those moneys were collected from \npaychecks in this country. The paychecks are a result of the work of \nthe American people, and they are told ``We're going to take some money \nfrom that paycheck to put into a trust fund because it is needed when \nyou retire to make Social Security viable.''\n  Then somebody comes along and says we are changing the words ``trust \nfund''; we will just drop ``trust.'' Maybe we should amend that to the \nextent they want to bring $80 billion in tax cuts to the floor, paid \nfor by Social Security trust funds. Perhaps we ought to require them to \ntake the ``trust'' out of the trust fund name. That will, in my \njudgment, certainly abridge the trust that is supposed to exist with \nthose trust funds.\n  Those are three big mistakes in a very short time. The potential, in \na small amount of time, to make big mistakes is very substantial: H.R. \n10, fast track, and tax cuts.\n  I have a lot of things I want to get done, others have a lot of \nthings they want to do, and in most cases we work closely together and \nhave good relationships, but on large public policy issues like this it \nseems to me we ought to be very careful. I feel very strongly about all \nthree of these areas. All three, in my judgment, would be a mistake.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S10971-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10972-S10975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, here we are, Friday at 11 o'clock. Most \nAmericans are out working the fifth day of the week, and the Senate is \nin a quorum call while we have important business to attend to. None is \nmore important, I think, than the consideration of the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. I took time yesterday on the floor of the Senate when we had \na long quorum call, asking why we weren't debating the Patients' Bill \nof Rights, as I did the day before. And here we are midmorning on a \nFriday--a workday for most Americans--just going through the motions \nbefore recessing, with a cloture vote scheduled late Monday afternoon.\n  We could debate this issue all day today, could debate the issue all \nday on Monday, and we could have some resolution to the kinds of \nprotections that we are talking about in the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nWe have written these protections into legislation and we have \ndescribed these protections on the floor. We have challenged our \nfriends on the other side, the Republican leadership, to permit us an \nopportunity to debate and vote on the kind of protections that are \noutlined in the legislation introduced by Senator Daschle.\n  However, we have been denied the opportunity to bring up this \nlegislation, and to debate these various protections. Instead, we have \ncontinued in the Senate to move forward on other pieces of legislation \nwhich, as important as they are, don't measure up to what I think most \nfamilies are concerned with--and that is ensuring the protection of the \nhealth of themselves, their children, and their parents.\n  Endorsements of various groups and individuals are important in some \ninstances, less so in other instances. But I daresay that in this \nparticular instance virtually all of the leaders in the health debate--\ncertainly the doctors, nurses, and patient coalitions--have endorsed \nour proposal. We have been asking the Republican leadership for the \nnames of the organizations that endorse their program. And we are still \nwaiting to hear from the other side which medical professional groups \nhave endorsed or supported the Republicans in this debate. I do not \nthink there are any leading groups that support their plan, while \nvirtually all support our legislation. Still, we are denied the \nopportunity to debate these issues.\n  Now, yesterday Senator Gramm took the floor for an extended period of \ntime to attack our plan. He said that the Republican solution was a new \nkind of insurance policy called medical savings accounts. The fact is \nthat our bill takes medical decisionmaking out of the hands of the \ninsurance company accountants and puts it back where it belongs, with \nthe patients and the doctors. The Republican program is a sham and it \ngives the appearance of reform without the reality.\n  I was struck by the fact that my friend, Senator Gramm, accuses the \nAmerican people of wanting something for nothing, of wanting a ``free \nlunch.'' I object to this characterization of the patients who want \nprotections from the health insurance company abuses. That is what we \nare basically talking about. What is at the heart of the legislation \nthat we support is ensuring that medical professionals--doctors, \nnurses, and the trained medical professionals--make medical decisions. \nThose who are opposed want to maintain the status quo. They want to \npermit, in too many instances, insurance company accountants to make \nmedical decisions.\n  Now, a number of HMOs work well. Managed care in its best form can be \ngood for patients. There are even a number of HMOs that support our \nparticular proposal. And portions of our legislation are drawn from \nstandards adopted voluntarily by some plans. But the problem is the bad \napples that reach their medical decisions not on the basis of what is \nnecessary from a medical point of view, but what is necessary from a \nbottom line point of view or the profit point of view of the HMO. That \nis the fundamental, basic issue. That is it.\n  The good HMOs are complying with the kinds of protections that we \nhave here. But a great many of other HMOs are not. We want to make sure \nthat the patients are going to get what they pay for and what they are \nentitled to, and that their medical decisions are made by medical \npersonnel and not accountants for insurance companies.\n  Now, that fact is not understood by the Senator from Texas. What he \nhas basically done in his presentation yesterday is accuse the American \npeople of wanting something for nothing--I use his words: ``a free \nlunch.'' Those are the words the Senator used. Mr. President, I object \nto the characterization of patients who want protection from health \ninsurance company abuse as patients who want a free lunch.\n  I don't think a cancer patient who needs access to a specialist or a \ncancer treatment center wants a free lunch. I don't think that a family \nwith a child experiencing seizures is asking for a\n\n[[Page S10973]]\n\nfree lunch when they want to rush their child to the nearest emergency \nroom, and their HMO, in an emergency, requires instead that they go all \nthe way across town to another emergency room. That type of response \ncan risk the life and the health of that particular child. I don't \nthink those parents who are saying, ``Why can't I take my child to the \nnearest emergency room?'' are asking for a free lunch. I don't think a \nwoman whose doctors say she needs to stay in the hospital after a \nmastectomy, even though her insurance company wants to send her home in \npain, with tubes still dangling from her body, is asking for a free \nlunch.\n  All of these examples I am using are examples we have presented to \nthe U.S. Senate day in and day out over the period of the past many \nmonths. All of those particular situations are addressed in our \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  I would have hoped that the Senator from Texas at least would have \nurged the Republican leadership to permit us to debate this and let the \nSenate resolve these particular issues. That is where we would have the \nopportunity to make our respective presentations and call the roll on \nthese matters, as to whether these requests amount to ``free lunches.'' \nLet him make his presentation, and those of us who are strong \nsupporters of the Patients' Bill of Rights can respond and make a \npresentation to the Senate. Then let the Senate make a decision as to \nwhether those individuals are trying to have a free lunch.\n  I don't think a doctor who is penalized for telling patients about \nthe best available treatment is asking for a free lunch. In too many \nHMOs, when doctors make that kind of judgment and tell that patient \nthey ought to have a treatment that is not on the plan's list, is that \nthey are effectively fired, or they are not rehired at the end of the \nyear. The insurance companies and Republicans can say this isn't a gag \nrule. But the fact that they are not hired back when they are dismissed \nis effectively a gag rule. That is what is happening in too many \ncircumstances. I don't think that the patient who is getting the best \nadvice from that doctor, at the risk of that doctor's employment, is \nasking for a free lunch.\n  I don't think an individual suffering from terrible mental illness, \nlike schizophrenia or clinical depression, who wants effective \npharmaceutical products to treat the illness rather than the older, \nineffective, but cheaper medication that happened to be on the plan \nlisting, is asking for a free lunch. That is happening in America today \nand will continue today and tomorrow, and it will continue day after \nday in the future unless we address that issue here.\n  This isn't just my opinion or the opinion of our cosponsors. We have \nthe strong support of the leaders of the medical organizations, \ndoctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and \nothers who know firsthand that the various HMOs are doing these things. \nWe have heard from countless patients who have been told, ``You can't \nget the good kind of medications that are necessary to meet your \nparticular health care needs until you use these other ones and \ndemonstrate to us, not just once, but twice, that they just don't \nwork.'' This puts a patient's health at risk. That is happening today. \nLook right here on the chart, Mr. President--``access to the doctor \nprescribed drugs.'' But the Senator from Texas says, well, that \nparticular patient is just looking for a free lunch. These Americans \ndon't want something for nothing, and it is insulting of the Senator \nfrom Texas to suggest that they do. They have faithfully paid their \npremiums and they deserve quality care.\n  These companies don't mind going out and representing that they have \na whole range of different quality programs to get individuals into \ntheir HMO. But, too often, insurance companies then deny the \nindividuals the kind of health quality protections they need when they \nget ill. That is what is happening.\n  That is where there is bureaucracy; the bureaucracy is in that HMO \nthat refuses to give the best in terms of health care to the patient. \nAll we are requiring is that they just give the patient what they paid \nfor, what HMO represented in terms of quality health care. They are not \ndoing it. They are not doing it in the ways listed on this chart, Mr. \nPresident.\n  These are not just made up categories of care; these have been \nrecommended by the President's nonpartisan commission, and by Congress \nfor the Medicare program. These are recommendations that have come from \nState insurance commissioners. These are recommendations that have been \nmade by the health plans themselves. They are the ones who made these \nrecommendations. We didn't just pull this out of the blue.\n  These are protections that those who know the condition of what is \nhappening in America have recommended to us. That is what this debate \nought to be about.\n  Mr. President, the American consumer has faithfully paid for their \npremiums. They deserve quality care. The characterization of it by the \nSenator from Texas is typical of the attitude that the Republican \nleadership has taken toward this issue. They want to allow insurance \ncompanies to continue to put the profits first and patients last--all \ndriven by the bottom line.\n  You can solve these issues and problems by having the decisions \naffecting the quality made by the doctors. There is not a great mystery \nabout what the solution is.\n  But no. We do not hear that from the opponents. They want to allow \nthe insurance companies to continue to put the profits first. That is \nwhy they have offered a sham bill. That is why they won't allow the \nSenate to have a chance to debate and vote on this issue. That is why \nthey are trying to change the subject to medical savings accounts. They \ndon't want to debate this issue. They refuse to debate this issue. They \nwant to debate another issue and divert attention away from the real \nissues in this discussion.\n  They do not want to talk about clinical trials and their importance \nfor women with breast cancer. They do not want to talk about the \nability to have the pediatric specialist for children with dread \ndiseases. They don't want to debate those issues. They don't want to \ndebate the question about giving the family the right to be able to go \nto the nearest emergency room rather than across town. They don't want \nto debate that issue. Which of these do they not want to debate? We \nchallenge the Republican leadership to tell us.\n  But day after day we go on with the charade of trying to get cloture \nto prohibit any kind of amendments and any kind of debate on these \nissues--day after day, issue after issue. That is wrong. It is \nabsolutely categorically wrong.\n  We are committed to trying to have this kind of debate and discussion \non, as Senator Daschle has said on many occasions, a reasonable way to \nproceed. But, quite frankly, we see day in and day out the Republican \nleadership attempting to do to the U.S. Senate what many of these HMOs \nare doing to their patients--gagging their doctors so they can't give \nthem the right kind of health advice. The Republican leadership is \ngagging the Senate by saying: We will only permit you to bring this up \nif we have one vote--one vote--and do it now with no debate.\n  Why aren t we debating this on Friday at 11 o'clock this morning, or \nthis afternoon, or on Monday when millions of Americans are going back \nto work? Why aren't we debating these issues? Why aren't we, Mr. \nPresident? It is silence on the other side. It is silence on the other \nside. They are trying to gag us from debating these issues. They are \ntrying to protect the profits of those HMOs that refuse to provide the \nright kind of treatment by refusing us the opportunity to address these \nissues. They are basically protecting those various special interests \nand denying to virtually every major consumer group, and every major \nmedical professional group their voice here in the Senate on these \npoints. They refuse to let us even debate these issues. And the \nAmerican people understand it.\n  The American people want Congress to pass strong and effective \nlegislation to end the abuses of HMOs, managed care plans, and health \ninsurance companies. They want us to pass the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nwhich was introduced by Senator Daschle and Senate Democrats, to \nprovide the needed and long overdue antidote to these festering and \ngrowing abuses.\n  Our goal is to protect the patients and to see that insurance plans \nprovide the quality plan they promise but, too\n\n[[Page S10974]]\n\noften, fail to deliver. Our bill has been on the Senate calendar since \nMarch. An earlier version of the legislation was introduced more than a \nyear and a half ago, but the Senate has taken no action because the \nRepublican leadership has been compounding the HMO abuses by abusing \nthe rules of the Senate to block meaningful reform. This record of \nabuse should be unacceptable to the Senate. It is certainly \nunacceptable to the American people.\n  We held a forum Wednesday in which a letter was released from 36 \ngroups representing patients, families, psychiatrists, psychologists, \nsocial workers, and others concerned about quality health care for \npeople with mental illness. As I discussed in a floor statement \nyesterday, these groups begged the Senate to act to pass a patients' \nbill of rights, because with every day that passes, patients and their \nfamilies suffer needlessly because of abuses by managed care plans.\n  The stories they told were tragic--they involved suicide, spousal \nabuse, anxiety attacks inflicted on a Vietnam veteran, successful \ncourses of treatment cruelly interrupted--all because insurance \ncompanies are putting the bottom line first and their obligations to \npatients last.\n  This forum was just the most recent one in which we have heard \npatients and doctors and nurses pleading with the Republican leadership \nto act on real managed care reform. In my statement yesterday, I \nreported on an earlier forum in which we heard from Dr. Charlotte Yeh, \nan emergency room doctor representing the American College of Emergency \nPhysicians. Dr. Yeh described tragic cases in which patients had been \ndenied the care they needed because of managed care penny-pinching.\n  On behalf of the college, she endorsed our legislation, and she \ndenounced the Republican leadership alternative as worse than \ninadequate. Only with a full and fair floor debate can we pass real \nprotection for patients who need emergency care or who should be \nallowed to go to the nearest emergency room when the symptoms of \nserious illness strike.\n  On July 24, we heard from cancer patients and their doctors who \nexplained how critical the provision of the Patients' Bill of Rights \nwas in assuring patients access to quality clinical trials. These trial \nare often the only hope for patients with incurable cancer or other \ndiseases where conventional treatments are ineffective. They are the \nbest hope for learning to cure these dread diseases. Insurance used to \nroutinely pay the doctor and hospital costs associated with clinical \ntrials--but managed care plans are refusing to allow their patients to \nparticipate or to pay these costs.\n  We understand. When patients are in a clinical trial there isn't a \nsignificant increase in terms of the costs to the HMO. It is just the \nroutine doctor costs and hospital costs that they would pay anyway. The \ntrial itself pays for the kinds of additional attention and \nprescription drugs that are given to these patients. But the insurance \ncompanies won't even cover the minimal payments.\n  Our bill requires them to respond to this need--but the Republican \nbill does not, and the Senate leadership does not want a debate on this \nissue.\n  Fourteen leading organizations of cancer patients, representing the \neight million Americans surviving with cancer and the 1.5 million \nAmericans who will be newly diagnosed with cancer this year, have \nspoken out strongly on the need for this amendment. These are \norganizations that patients and physicians alike look to for guidance \non cancer issues. They include the National Coalition for Cancer \nSurvivorship, Cancer Care, Incorporated, the Candle- \nlighters Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer \nFoundation, the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, the \nNorth American Brain Tumor Coalition, US TOO International, the Y-ME \nNational Breast Cancer Society, the American Society of Clinical \nOncology, the Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, Support and Education, \nthe Friends of Cancer Research, the Leukemia Society of America, and \nthe Oncology Nursing Society--all groups that speak out for patients \nwho have cancer. They have made their recommendations. They support our \nlegislation. But we are being refused and denied the opportunity to \neven debate it.\n  Here is what the combined cancer groups say about this:\n\n       Clinical trials represent the standard of care for cancer \n     patients. Patient care in clinical trials is no more \n     important than standard therapy. Cancer will strike roughly \n     one in three Americans during their lifetimes. Even those who \n     escape the diagnosis will have friends and family touched by \n     the disease. Any patient rights or quality care legislation \n     will be a shallow promise for people with cancer if it does \n     not include provisions ensuring access to clinical trials.\n\n  That is what we are talking about--clinical trials for individuals \nwho have cancer. Why can't we debate that on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate on a Friday at noontime? Why can't we call the roll for those \nwho believe, as the cancer organizations do, that clinical trials are a \ncritical aspect of treatment, and that most Americans believe when they \nsign those HMO contracts that they are going to get the best in terms \nof American health care? And they do with a better HMO. But there are \ntoo many that are denying that care. Too many that are risking their \nlives because they are being denied the opportunity for clinical trials \nthat may offer new hope and opportunity of survival for an individual \nmember of a family. That is unbelievable. But that is happening--\ndenial. Too often the insurance companies offer a shallow promise. But \nour program ensures these protections. The Republican plan does not.\n  Mr. President, we see that not one, not a single group that is \nconcerned about the survival of cancer has supported the Republican \nprogram. But virtually every major cancer group supports our \nlegislation and believes it is essential to protect American families.\n  Why can't we debate that on the floor of the U.S. Senate? What is it \nabout? Hard-working Americans--more than 160 million working Americans \nwho are going to work today on Friday at noontime.\n  Why aren't we debating that in the Senate? Why aren't we debating it \nat 2 o'clock or 5 o'clock or on this coming Monday morning or \nafternoon? We are prepared to debate these issues. But, no, the \nRepublican leadership refuses to debate them. We are effectively seeing \nthe manipulation of the Senate rules in such a way as to deny the \nopportunity for full consideration of something that is of core concern \nand importance to every American family, and that is the quality of \ntheir health care.\n  So, Mr. President, I just want to again reiterate my strong support \nfor our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, who has indicated that we \nare going to still, even in the final days of this session, continue to \npursue this. There are those who say, well, we haven't got enough time. \nBut our Republican friends must think we do have enough time because \nthey are continuing to resist our efforts. They must assume we do have \nenough time. It is amazing how quickly this body can act when we want \nto act on important pieces of legislation, and we do have time. So, Mr. \nPresident, we will continue to press these issues forward.\n  I see other of my friends and colleagues in this Chamber. I will \ncontinue to address this issue at another time, but it is important to \nnote that we have seen one more week go by and a denial of the request \nof our Democratic leader to at least have a reasonable period of time \nto debate these issues and resolve them in a way that would respond to \nthe central concerns of every major medical professional group and \nsociety in our country. I am not aware of a single medical society or \npatient group that supports the Republican plan--not one. We have been \nwaiting to hear one. They can't come up with one. In contrast, more \nthan 180 groups support our particular proposal.\n  Now, we may not have it all right, and we are interested in \ndiscussing adjustments that we may have to make. But 187 groups in our \ncountry, representing the cancer societies, the medical professionals, \nthe nurses, the patient groups, working families, and others \neffectively support our proposal.\n  Every major children's health organization in our society has \nendorsed this proposal because they know how important this is for \nchildren. Every major breast cancer group in our society that cares \nabout women and understands the enormous possibilities of breakthroughs \nin terms of the new\n\n[[Page S10975]]\n\nmodern miracle drugs supports our proposal. Every major group that \nrepresents persons with disabilities in our country--individuals who \nare challenged mentally and physically every single day--supports our \nproposal. And still, because of the manipulation of the Senate rules, \nwe are denied a full debate and discussion and ultimate resolution as \nto what this body would say to families of this country on such a \nmatter. It is wrong, and we are going to continue to press our case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \ncan always be counted upon to stand up for the things in which he \nbelieves. He is constantly supporting legislation that is calculated \nand dedicated to bring better health care to the American people. I \nsupport his Patients' Bill of Rights. ``Constancy, thou art the \njewel.'' He is always constant in this efforts.\n  I have been hearing some ads on the radio, and these ads are talking \nabout the ``Kennedy Bill of Rights.'' I don't recall their ever telling \nus what is wrong with it. They may have been doing it; I have missed \nthat. But I continually see these ads on the television: ``Write your \nCongressman, write your Senator, write your representative, and urge \nthem to defeat the Kennedy Bill of Rights, the health care bill of \nrights.''\n  Tell me, has the Senator seen those ads, and what are we talking \nabout?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is very interesting. I have seen those \nads, but I believe they are going to be pulled very soon because what \nhas happened, according to the most recent study by Bob Blendon at \nHarvard and the Kaiser Family Foundation, is that support for our bill \nhas gone up, quite in conflict with the intentions of those who \nsponsored the ads that have been critical of the Patients' Bill of \nRights. And so now the insurance companies and corporations that oppose \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights are reviewing their television strategy \nbecause their campaign has had the reverse effect. They are sort of \ngoing back to the drawing board.\n  But quite clearly, as the Senator implies, their ads certainly were \nnot a fair representation of the legislation that we have introduced. \nAs I mentioned, virtually every one of these proposals in our bill has \neither been suggested by the President's commission--which was \nbipartisan and reported its recommendations unanimously--as important \nfor all patients, or included in Medicare at the present time and used \nin protecting our seniors, or have been embraced by the state insurance \ncommissioners--which are the 50 commissioners around this country, \nRepublicans and Democrats--or adopted voluntarily by the HMOs \nthemselves through their trade association.\n  This legislation reflects the best judgment of those groups that know \nthis issue best. That is why we have a sense of confidence in this \nlegislation. It has the strong support of those professionals who treat \nfamilies and understand the kinds of protections that are necessary to \ngive the best of health care to American families.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for enlightening this \nSenator in response to the question I asked. I again commend him for \nhis unceasing effort in behalf of this legislation, the Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S10972-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I rise to address two matters that are \nof importance to me. The first is the issue of national cancer \nawareness.\n  Mr. President, for the next 3 days, hundreds of thousands of cancer \nsurvivors, families, care givers, and friends, whose lives have been \naffected by cancer will join together in this city for an event called \n``The March: Coming Together to Conquer Cancer.''\n  Yesterday, other Members of this body and I had an opportunity to \nplace a large star on our respective States to represent special \npersons in our lives who have been touched by cancer.\n  I had the pleasure and honor on behalf of my wife, Nancy, to place a \nstar on my State of Alaska for the late Judge Lester Gore, my wife's \nfather. He was a remarkable pioneer in our State. In 1912, Judge Gore \nmoved to Juneau after graduating from law school and established an \nimpressive record as a young deputy district attorney. He was \nrecognized in that effort in 1932 by President Hoover's appointment to \nserve as a Federal judge for the Territory of Alaska, serving the first \njudicial district in Nome.\n  In serving as a Federal judge in the far reaches of western Alaska in \nthe aftermath of the gold rush, Judge Gore traveled from village to \nvillage hearing various cases and judging on the merits. He used every \nmode of transportation from dog team to the former cutter Bear, \nbringing justice to rural Alaska. He was instrumental in both creating \nlegal precedent and shaping the legal history of our State. Later in \nhis career he worked as an attorney in Ketchikan, and died in 1965 of \ncancer. He had many accomplishments but none more important to me than \nfathering a daughter, Nancy, who later was good enough to accept my \nproposal of marriage.\n\n  In addition, I was pleased in my own personal case to recognize my \nmother, who died of cancer, leukemia, in Alaska in 1956, having spent \nher entire career in the area of education. She was the longest \nstanding sixth grade teacher in Ketchikan, Alaska.\n  To move on, for more than 20 years now, my wife, Nancy, has worked \nwith Alaskan women to encourage the establishment of a breast cancer \ncenter starting in Fairbanks, Alaska. She and a group of women \ninitiated the Breast Cancer Detection Center for the purpose of \noffering free mammograms to women in the remote areas of Alaska, \nregardless of their ability to pay. I am proud to say that the center \nnow serves about 2,500 women a year and provided screenings to more \nthan 25,000 Alaska women in 81 villages throughout the State.\n  To help fund these efforts of the Fairbanks center, each year my wife \nhas sponsored a fishing tournament to raise money for the operation of \nthe facility and to purchase units. Interestingly enough, over the last \n5 years they have raised over $1 million in this effort. They now \noperate a permanent facility in Fairbanks, as well as a mobile \nmammogram unit that travels the highways of Alaska providing free \nbreast cancer examinations for the women along the highway system. It \nlooks like a big armored car. More recently, they have purchased a \nsmaller unit called Molly. Molly is designed to go in aircraft to fly \nout to the villages that are not connected by any road, and by river \nbarge down the rivers of the interior.\n  So I commend those who are responsible for this effort in my State, a \ngroup of women who have taken it upon themselves to do something about \nthis disease, this killer disease which affects all of us. It is \nanticipated that 40 percent of us will get some form of cancer during \nour lifetimes. We have had a figure of about 1.5 million Americans \nbeing diagnosed this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in taking part in \nthe activities here in Washington, D.C., with The march, thereby \ndemonstrating our commitment to end cancer forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S10975-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10975-S10977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NORTH KOREA MISSILE TEST\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to address one more issue, \nwith the agreement of my colleagues. I see a number of them on the \nfloor--\n\n[[Page S10976]]\n\nSenator Byrd--so I will try to be very brief. But I want to talk a \nlittle bit about our national security interests and what is occurring \nin North Korea. It does not just affect my State of Alaska, although \nthis recent three-stage rocket did generate a little interest in my \nState because on August 31, 1998, the North Koreans fired a rocket \nwhich we now believe is a three-stage rocket carrying a satellite over \nthe sovereign territory of Japan and it evidently came down very close \nto my home State of Alaska.\n  Although initial reports indicated that this was a two-stage rocket \nwith a range of approximately 1,200 miles, now there is acknowledgment \nin the U.S. intelligence community that it was likely a three-stage \nrocket carrying a satellite. The third stage malfunctioned, \nconsequently the satellite was not launched. But the point is that it \nhas been identified that, indeed, the North Koreans have the rocket \ncapability to carry some type of armament to the shores of the United \nStates.\n  The Asian press reported that the rocket traveled 3,700 miles, or \n6,000 kilometers, and landed in the ocean near Alaska. On September 17, \nthe U.S. Department of Defense spokesman Kenneth Bacon responded to \nthis report by saying:\n\n       The only way to track this is by radar tapes and there's \n     considerable disagreement among experts on how to interpret \n     this.\n\n  Let's think about what this really means. The only way we have to \ntrack this is by radar tapes; in other words, after the fact. But \nintelligence sources have been quoted as acknowledging that a three-\nstage rocket could have a range three times that of the two-stage Taepo \nDong I rocket. Particularly concerned about this latest missile test, a \nnumber of us have recognized that there seems to be a breakdown on \nwhether the administration was either caught off guard by the \nsophistication of the North Korean technology, or was reluctant to \nshare this information with lawmakers.\n  I am reminded of President Clinton's comments last year, when he said \n``[t]he possibility of a long-range missile attack on U.S. soil by a \nrogue state is more than a decade away.''\n  That does not appear to be the case--as a consequence of the \noccurrence in August, the last day of August, relative to the North \nKorean missile which did land within shouting distance of my State of \nAlaska.\n  This would ignore the testimony in 1994 by John Deutch, then-Deputy \nSecretary of Defense:\n\n       If North Koreans field the Taepo Dong 2 missile, Guam, \n     Alaska and parts of Hawaii would potentially be at risk.\n\n  It appears the North Koreans have gone beyond even what Mr. Deutch \nenvisioned by launching a three-stage rocket carrying a satellite.\n  There is truly an immediate need for missile defense, Mr. President. \nMIT professor Daniel Fine has an interesting take on why we need \nimmediate action on a National Missile Defense System which protects \nall of the United States, including Hawaii, Alaska and our territories. \nHe conclusion is that:\n\n       If the $32 billion infrastructure [associated with oil \n     production in my State] in Prudhoe Bay--which produces 1.6 \n     million barrels of oil . . . is subjected to a credible \n     missile threat . . . then the cost to the American economy of \n     a missile threat as economic blackmail would reach $4 \n     billion--$6 billion in the first ten days.\n\n  Well Mr. President, I for one do not think it is far fetched to think \nof Prudhoe Bay as a potential target. After all, it accounts for \napproximately 20 percent of the total domestic production of crude oil \nin the United States. While I have not reviewed how the professor \nreaches the $4 to 6 billion figure, I think it should serve as a wake-\nup call to those who continue to oppose a National Missile Defense \nSystem. It is not just Alaskans, Hawaiians and those in Guam who should \nbe concerned about the launch. Monday's test was the first of a \nmultistage missile. According to experts, the ability to build rockets \nin stages opens the doors to intercontinental missiles that would have \nvirtually unlimited range and which would carry payloads capable of \nnuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Such missiles, and the threat \nof them, certainly puts U.S. citizens at risk as a consequence of any \nattack coming from North Korea or any other area with a missile that \ncarries weapons of mass destruction.\n  I think we have to reflect a little bit on the North Koreans. Some \nwould dismiss the threat from North Korea because that country is on \nthe verge of an economic collapse. But I remind my colleagues that \nNorth Korea has a history.\n  Mr. President, we have seen in the past, irrational actions by the \nNorth Koreans. You recall this is a country that in 1950 launched an \ninvasion on South Korea, resulting in the deaths of 3 million of her \ncountrymen and 54,000 American troops.\n  Recall the detonation of a bomb in Rangoon killing 16 South Korean \nofficials; a country whose agents blew up a Korean Airlines flight \nkilling 115 passengers and crew; and a country whose military hacked \nU.S. personnel to death in the DMZ.\n  I think we have to recognize there is still a great deal of \nuncertainty relative to the objectives of North Korea.\n  Furthermore, as we look at the crisis on the Korean peninsula, the \nUnited States has given over $250 million in combined food aid and \nsupport for KEDO. The North Koreans have received 1.3 million metric \ntons of heavy fuel oil.\n  While the United States has provided humanitarian assistance from \ntime to time, as well as technical assistance, we have also promised \nlarge contributions to the $5 billion light water reactor program and \nalso have given food and aid and contributed over $50 million to KEDO.\n  What have the North Koreans done in return for this assistance? They \nlaunched a missile in August. Intelligence photos show work on vast \nunderground construction complexes.\n  In July of 1998, GAO reported that North Korea has taken actions to \nhinder work of international inspectors sent to monitor North Korea's \nnuclear program.\n  It goes on and on.\n  As a consequence, I think it is fair to say the administration has \ntreated each of these incidents as if North Korea is merely an innocent \nchild throwing a harmless tantrum, not a terrorist nation home to the \nworld's fourth largest army, just miles away from the 37,000 American \ntroops.\n  Incident after incident is dismissed by this administration as ``not \nintentional'' or not ``serious'' enough to derail U.S. assistance under \nthe Agreed Framework.\n  The administration called latest missile launch `` a matter of deep \nconcern to the U.S. because of its destabilizing impact in Northeast \nAsia and beyond,'' but reiterated its commitment to provide funds under \nthe Agreed Framework.\n  The administration refuses to say that newly disclosed evidence of \nunderground facility would violate the 1994 accord because ``concrete \nhas not been poured.''\n  When a sub full of North Korean commandos landed in South Korea, the \nadministration asked both sides to ``show restraint''--as if South \nKorea was in the wrong.\n  The administration responded to violations of the Military Armistice \nAgreement by asking that the issue not be ``blown out of proportion.''\n  Issuing polite reprimands from the State Department, while the \nAdministration continues to seek increased funds for activities that \nbenefit North Korea, only encourages bad behavior.\n  Mr. President, enough is enough. Congress should block further \nfunding for KEDO until the President can certify that North Korea's \nnuclear program is, indeed, frozen and not simply an ongoing \nclandestine operation. The United States is a global power with vested \ninterests both politically and commercially all over the world. We \nsimply cannot allow policy to be determined by those who practice \nmissile blackmail.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and wish the President a good day \nand a good weekend.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A reservation of the right to object is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will not object. I have been waiting here \nand\n\n[[Page S10977]]\n\nam very happy to wait longer. I understood the Chair wanted to be \nrecognized for 2 or 3 minutes, also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair did, but it has gotten too late and \nhe has abandoned that desire.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is the Senator from West Virginia waiting to speak? I will \nbe glad to withhold and let him speak and then I will speak.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator is very kind and considerate. I \nwas waiting to speak, but the Senator from Texas may have to go \nfarther, a greater distance than I would have to go if I were going to \nWest Virginia today. I ask unanimous consent that I may be recognized \nat the completion of the remarks by the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am delighted to listen to what the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas has to say.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me reiterate, in fact, when the Senator \nfrom Alaska finished his speech, Senator Byrd and I were having a \nconversation. I had thought as I left my office that he had spoken. I \nassumed that he was simply here listening to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Again, I reiterate, if the Senator from West Virginia had come over \nto speak, he was on the floor before I was, and I believe he should be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no, Mr. President, I hope he will not be under the \nburden of thinking that I have a feeling about this. I am perfectly \nagreeable to wait a little longer, just so I can get in line \nimmediately after the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this reminds me of the time when I was on \nthe elevator for the first time with Senator Thurmond, and Senator \nThurmond insisted that I get off the elevator before he did. I \ndetermined when I was on the elevator with Senator Thurmond again that \nI would not get off the elevator before Senator Thurmond did. But I was \nwrong. I stood there for almost 2 minutes insisting that Senator \nThurmond get off the elevator before I did. In the end, Senator \nThurmond had more patience. I got off the elevator first.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I like to try to live according to the Scriptures, which \nsay that the first should be last and the last should be first. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S10975-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10977-S10979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, our dear colleague from Massachusetts came \nover today and responded to a speech I gave yesterday. As he always \ndoes--and I think it is one of the things we admire about him--he spoke \nwith great passion because I think he clearly is one of our Members who \ncares deeply about these issues. Whether he is right or whether he is \nwrong, I think we all respect that in one of our fellow Members.\n  What I would like to try to do is to briefly respond and make the key \npoints that I made yesterday, given that so much reference has been \nmade to the speech of yesterday, and try to make all these points in \nsuch a way as to deviate from my background as a former schoolteacher \nand be brief so that Senator Byrd can give his speech and we can both \ngo home for the weekend.\n  Yesterday, I made the point, which I am continually struck by, that 5 \nyears ago in the Senate, we were debating a proposal to have the \nGovernment take over and run the health care system. A substantial \nmajority of the Members of the Senate at the beginning of that debate, \nfollowing the lead of Senator Kennedy and President Clinton, had \ndecided that the problem we had in American health care was access; \nthat 40 million Americans didn't have health insurance and that a price \nwe should be willing to pay to solve that access problem was to deny \npeople the freedom to choose their health care provider and force every \nAmerican into a health care purchasing cooperative or health care \npurchasing collective which would be one giant HMO run by the \nGovernment.\n  I have on this desk--and I want to be careful because one of these \nbills fell on my foot over there and I want to be sure all of them \ndon't fall--but I have here those bills from 5 years ago. Each one of \nthese bills denied the American people freedom to choose their health \ncare provider, forced them into a Government-run collective in order to \ndeal with the problem of access.\n  Each one of these bills, this massive pile of bills--Kennedy I, \nKennedy II; Moynihan I, Moynihan II; Mitchell I, Mitchell II, Mitchell \nIII and Mitchell IV--each of these bills was about denying Americans \nthe freedom to choose their doctor, choose their health care, choose \ntheir hospital, and we had a big debate about it 5 years ago. The \nargument from the sponsors of these bills was that the denial of this \nfreedom was a small price to pay in order to guarantee access to health \ncare.\n  I had an alternative then. It was a very modest bill. Here is a copy. \nI want people to see what freedom looks like. It is simple.\n  It was a small bill, as these kind of bills go. Basically, what it \ndid was deal with the access problem by helping people who didn't have \nhealth insurance to get it without denying freedom to everybody else. \nIt established risk pools at the State level where we would help people \nwith preexisting conditions get health insurance.\n  But the point is, the same people who are saying today that we should \nbe willing to drive up costs and deny access to people in the name of \nguaranteeing freedom are the same people who 5 years ago said, ``Let's \ndeny freedom in the name of access.'' Now, 5 years later, after we \ndebated the original Kennedy-Clinton bill--and I am very proud to have \nplayed a small role in seeing that effort defeated--5 years later, now \nwe have the same people saying, ``The problem is not access--don't \nworry that by driving up costs millions of Americans might lose their \nhealth coverage--the problem now is HMOs.''\n  Five years ago, the same people were saying, ``HMOs are so wonderful \nthat we ought to have one HMO run by the Government, and it will be \ngreat for everybody.'' Now they say HMOs are evil and what we have to \ndo is, we have to regulate HMOs.\n  What I would like to do is simply explain why the new approach is not \nthe approach that I believe we should follow. Let me first define the \nreal problem with HMOs, then what I believe the solution is. And then I \nwant to say a little bit about the bill, and I will be finished.\n  Fifteen years ago, almost every American had a low deductible health \npolicy funded by either Medicaid, Medicare, or by themselves and their \nemployer through private health insurance. These were health insurance \npolicies where the person who bought health care, using this coverage, \npaid relatively little of the cost.\n  Fifteen years ago, the average American who went to the hospital was \nresponsible personally for paying only about 5 percent of the bill. And \nthis was a wonderful system. It produced the greatest quality health \ncare the world has ever known. It created wonderful new technology, but \nit had one terrible problem, and that is, we could not afford it. And \nit is easy to see why we could not afford it.\n  If you can imagine--imagine you had grocery insurance that, when you \nwent to the grocery store, paid 95 percent of the cost of the food you \nput in your basket. If we had grocery insurance like we have health \ninsurance, when we went to the grocery store, we would end up eating \ndifferently, and so would our dog. The grocery stores we know today \nwould be totally different. You would have 20 or 30 times as many \npeople working at the grocery store. You would have all kinds of \nprecooked foods. You would have all kinds of specialty items. And \ngrocery costs would be exploding. We would all be cussing the cost of \ngrocery insurance.\n  So it is not surprising that our old fee-for-service medical system, \nwith low deductible insurance where the patient did not care about \ncontrolling costs, the physician did not care about controlling costs, \nand so nobody controlled costs--it is not surprising that that system \ndid not work.\n  The Government talked about it for 15 years, but we never did \nanything about it. There are a lot of things we\n\n[[Page S10978]]\n\ncould have done. We could have let people have tax deductibility to buy \ntheir own health insurance, so that if I did not like the health \ninsurance provided by my employer, I could take the employers \ncontribution and with some of my own money, on a tax-deductible basis, \nchoose and buy my own health insurance. We did not do that, have not \ndone it to this day. There are other things we could have done, but we \ndid not do them either.\n  The private sector started to respond to the problem, and the net \nresult is that we now have over 100 million people who are in HMOs.\n  HMOs have advantages and disadvantages like anything else in life, \nwith any choice you make. If you buy a Cadillac, the advantage is, you \nhave a good car; the disadvantage is, it costs a lot of money. If you \nbuy a Chevrolet, the advantage is that it does not cost as much as a \nCadillac, but generally it is not as good or as fancy. And we should \nnot be surprised that in life, even with the Government, we face these \nkinds of tradeoffs.\n  We have over 100 million people in HMOs. The advantage of HMOs is \nthat they are more efficient, they do control costs, they have brought \nthe medical price index down from twice the Consumer Price Index--twice \nthe growth as goods in general--down to the same growth as goods in \ngeneral.\n  Fifteen years ago, we would not have believed that it was possible, \nbut it has happened. But there is a disadvantage. And the disadvantage \nis, when you enter into a contract with an HMO, you are bound by the \nterms of the contract. It describes what they will cover and what they \nwill not do, and the HMO exercises some control over the amount of \nhealth care you consume and from whom you consume it. And everyone \nknows that when they enter into these contracts.\n  This creates a problem, which Senator Kennedy and others have put \ntheir finger on, and which is a real problem. The problem is that you \nhave, in these HMOs, gatekeepers whose job it is to try to see that you \nget good enough health care to meet your needs, so that next year you \nrenew with the HMO, but they also attempt to prevent the consumption of \nhealth care that you do not need because such usage drives up costs. \nThe problem is, they are deciding--not you.\n  So I have likened the problem to, you go to the doctor, you go into \nthe examining room, and instead of being alone with your doctor, you \nhave--not literally--but figuratively, you have a gatekeeper in the \nexamining room with you. And you want him out. You want to be in the \nexamining room with your doctor. You do not want somebody there, who is \nnot a doctor, second-guessing your doctor. That is the problem. On that \npoint, Senator Kennedy and I are in agreement.\n  The question is, How do you fix it? How do you get a Cadillac at \nChevrolet prices? Well, nobody has, throughout 5,000 years of recorded \nhistory, figured out how to do that. Maybe we will. But if we do, we \nwill be the first. But the point I made yesterday was that in reality \nthe solution that is being proposed in the Kennedy bill can be depicted \nas I've done here, using a Greek invention, the stethoscope.\n  The problem basically is that here you are with your heart right on \nthe other side of this stethoscope, and what you want is, you want your \ndoctor's ears at the other end trying to be sure that your heart is \nworking right and fixing it if it is not. Senator Kennedy's complaint \nis that in a very real sense the HMO has this gatekeeper who is \nlistening in on the stethoscope. You would like to get him out of the \nexamining room.\n  But in an incredible paradox, the bill that Senator Kennedy presents \nnot only does not get the HMO gatekeeper out of the examining room but \nit brings two other people in. It lets the Government hire a \nbureaucrat, who comes in and he gets his ears to the stethoscope so \nthat he can regulate your HMO and your doctor, and then, under the \nKennedy bill, you can also hire a lawyer who can come and listen so \nthat he can join the bureaucrat in listening to your heart with your \ndoctor and with the HMO so that he can sue the HMO and sue the doctor.\n  The point I made yesterday was that, people are already unhappy about \nhaving the HMO gatekeeper in the examining room with them. And we are \ncertainly not going to make them happier by bringing in a Government \nbureaucrat, who we choose, and by letting them hire a lawyer.\n  What they want, literally and figuratively, is to be alone with their \ndoctor in their examining room. What they want is a system where their \ndoctor is using this stethoscope; their heart is at this end and their \ndoctor's ears are at this end, and nobody else is involved. That is the \nideal that people want.\n  Now, how can we get it? I believe the best way to get it is to make a \ndramatic change in the system. Therefore, I and others have proposed \nwhat we call medical savings accounts. Here in essence is how it works: \nSay I currently have a Blue Cross/Blue Shield policy, standard \ndeduction, and it costs about $4,000 a year. It has very low \ndeductibles. If that policy had a $3,000 high deductible, I could buy \nit for about $2,000. What the bill that I have introduced with Senator \nNickles and others would do is give people the choice. It doesn't make \nanybody do it. Nobody is forced under our bill to do anything. They can \nstay in the HMO they are in if they are happy. We set out reasonable \nthings to do to try to deal with the problems that Senator Kennedy and \nothers have raised, without driving up costs and forcing young working \ncouples out of the health care market and out of their HMO because they \ncan't afford it.\n  In addition to that, we do something more important; that is, we give \npeople the right to choose a medical savings account. Here is how it \nwould work: I am a young man and I am married to a young woman. We have \ntwo little children and we are both working hard and we both have \nmodest incomes. It lets my employer join with me in buying the high \ndeductible policy I've described, with a $3,000 deductible. Then we \nwould take the $2,000 we saved--we bought the high deductible policy \nfor roughly $2,000; we were paying $4,000 for Blue Cross/Blue Shield--\nand we put the $2,000 into a medical savings account out of which I can \npay deductibles. At the end of the year, if I don't spend the money on \nmedicine, I get to keep it. I can use it to get braces for my children \nor I can get tutors for them or save it and send them to Texas A, the \nUniversity of West Virginia, or the University of Alabama, or wherever \nthey want to go.\n  Now, that is how this system is different because 90 percent of \nAmerican families don't spend $3,000 on medicine. If I go to the doctor \nand he says, ``Phil, you have a headache. I think it is just a \nheadache. Take two aspirin. If it doesn't go away, come back in 2 days \nand we will give you a brain scan which costs $1,000, or we can give \nyou the brain scan right now.'' Currently, I might ask, well, does my \ninsurance cover the brain scan? If it does, it is interesting, you get \nto look at it, I may say let's do the brain scan right now. But if I \nwould get to keep that money for my children, and I am a truck driver, \nmy wife is a waitress, I will say, you know, Doc, I will take those two \naspirin. If it doesn't go away I will come back.\n  One of the benefits of the medical savings account is that it \nprovides incentives to be cost conscious. But that is not the most \nimportant thing. The most important element is it allows me freedom to \nchoose.\n  I showed this chart yesterday and I will show it several times in \nthis debate because it is so important to me and I think to the people \nI represent. I and my staff did a little experiment. We took one column \nof doctors on one page selected at random from the Yellow Pages. We \ncalled up every one of these doctors and we took the most popular, \nmost-participated-in HMO in our region, which is Kaiser HMO. We took \nthe largest participating PPO, preferred provider option, which is Blue \nCross/Blue Shield preferred provider. Then we called everybody on this \nlist and said, ``Do you take Kaiser HMO?'' In other words, we called \nWilliam D. Goldman, pediatric and adolescent medicine, and we said, \n``Do you take Kaiser HMO? Do you take Blue Cross, PPO?''\n  When we did this, 10 of the physicians listed on page 1017, in the \nleft-hand column, took Kaiser payments. If I were a member of Kaiser, I \ncould have gone to 10 of these physicians. If I were a member of Blue \nCross/Blue Shield preferred provider, 17 of them would have taken me.\n\n[[Page S10979]]\n\n  But if I had a medical savings account, and even though the current \nlaw doesn't really permit a full-blown system to work, there are \nseveral options. One is Golden Rule Insurance in Indiana. They give you \nthe option of a medical savings account checking account. Out of that \nchecking account you pay your deductibles, and above that level they \npay for the costs. We have other MSAs that use Mellon Bank with \nMasterCard. This is your medical savings account. It keeps the record \nfor you as to what you are spending the money on. And then American \nHealth Value Medical Savings Account uses Visa.\n  Let's just assume that you have a baby and your baby has a fever of \n104 and you want to go see William D. Goldman who is in pediatrics and \nadolescent medicine. You call him. If you are with Kaiser--he may be \none of the 10 people on this list that takes it, but he may not be; if \nyou are with Blue Cross PPO you call up, he may be one of the 17, he \nmay not be; but if you have a medical savings account, which I want \npeople to be allowed to choose, you call up and you don't say do you \nparticipate in Kaiser HMO? You don't say do you participate in Blue \nCross PPO? You simply say, Do you take a check? Or, Do you take \nMasterCard? Or, Do you take Visa?\n  The point being, every single person who is a physician on page 1017 \nin column 1 of the Yellow Pages takes a check, MasterCard and Visa. If \nmy baby is sick I don't have to go to some gatekeeper to get to see a \nspecialist. All I do is take my Visa and go. I make the decision. The \nmedical savings account sets me free. It makes me the decision maker. \nIt gives me the freedom to choose. I believe that is a better way.\n  Finally, we have had a lot of discussion about trying to get started \non this debate. We have 10 days left in the session. We have a lot of \nthings left to do in this session. We have passed to completion, I \nthink, only one appropriations bill which has been signed into law. We \nknow at some point we have to deal with all of those legislative \nproblems. We don't know how they will all work out. It will take lots \nof time and lots of long nights.\n  Senator Kennedy and others have a proposal that they believe is the \nanswer to our health care system. Senator Nickles, I and others have a \nproposal that we think should be part of the health care system. \nGranted, the normal procedure of the Senate would be to bring a bill to \nthe floor, have unlimited debate, and unlimited amendments. We could do \nthat, but I think everybody here knows with 10 days left we will not \npass a bill if we do that.\n  So a proposal has been made to let Senator Kennedy and others write \ntheir bill however they want to write it, make whatever changes they \nwant to make in it, and we will agree to set a time to vote on it--as \nthe Presiding Officer knows, and as many people who follow our debate \nknow, we often operate under what is known as unanimous consent where \nwe agree to a more truncated procedure.\n  What I have proposed is the following: Let those who have an idea \nwrite their bill exactly as they want it written. In the case of \nSenator Kennedy, I don't want to change his bill before we vote on it. \nWhat often happens in that process is we get something that nobody \nwants and that doesn't work. The proposal I have made is that we enter \ninto unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy and others can present \ntheir proposal and we will vote on it, up or down, without amendment, \nhowever they write it. Then Senator Nickles, I, and others will present \nour proposal. If their proposal gets 51 votes, then it will be adopted \nby the Senate. If our proposal gets 51 votes, it will be adopted by the \nSenate.\n\n  Now, it is true that that is not the normal way we do business. But \nwith 10 days left, if we really want to pass a health care bill, that \nis the option we are down to. I believe we have written a good bill. I \nam proud of our bill. I know Senator Kennedy is proud of his bill, and \nI am sure he feels at least as passionately about his as I do about \nmine. But the point is, we are never going to get to choose his bill or \nchoose the bill I and others have worked on, unless we work out some \nkind of accommodation, because we only have 10 days left in the \nsession.\n  So we are down to having to make a decision. Do we want to take this \ninto the election and campaign on it and then come back, which is \nperfectly legitimate? I am not criticizing anybody for wanting to do \nthat. But if we do, then I think we would continue the standoff and \nthen this would be an election year issue and we would decide next \nyear. On the other hand, if we actually want to pass a bill this year--\nand the House has passed a bill--the only way I can see that we can do \nit is with an agreement where we simply present the bills and let the \nSenate vote up or down on the bills. I don't have any desire to amend \nSenator Kennedy's bill. I want him to have his best shot, and then we \nwould have ours.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for withholding and allowing \nme to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for a very \ninteresting statement concerning the health bills. I admire the Senator \nfrom Texas. I admire his ability. He is one of the most articulate \nMembers that I have ever seen in my 40 years in the Senate. He has one \nof the best brains, I would say, of any of those that I have seen on \nboth sides of the aisle in those 40 years. I think Darwin's theory of \nnatural selection would not explain how this kind of a brain developed. \nI take my hat off to people like Senator Gramm for the extremely high \nintelligence that is obviously there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S10977-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10979-S10982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE UNITED STATES IS A REPUBLIC\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

I tell them the story, ``Acres of Diamonds,'' \nTolstoy wrote, ``How Much Land Does a Man Need,'' and I tell them the \nstory, that Russell Conwell, one of the early chautauqua speakers, said \nhe had given 5,000 times. I tell them various other stories, and I \nalways try to help them to learn some things about the Senate, about \nour Constitution, and about our form of government. Recently, I said to \nthe little pages, ``Now, is this a democracy? What form of government \nis ours?'' And I said to them about the same things that I am going to \nsay here with reference to a democracy versus a republic.\n  Again, Americans, commonly speaking, refer to our form of government \nas a ``democracy.'' One reason for this is because politicians of all \npolitical parties generally refer to our government as a democracy. \nPoliticians generally do that. Glib references are constantly being \nmade anent our democracy. But our form of government, strictly \nspeaking, is not a democracy. It may more properly be called a \nrepresentative democracy, but, strictly speaking, ours is a republic. \n``We pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and \nto the Republic for which it stands''--not to the democracy for which \nit stands.\n  Incidentally, I was a Member of the other body when the House passed \nthe law on June 5, 1954, inserting the words ``under God'' into the \nPledge of Allegiance. Exactly 1 year from that day, on June 5, 1955, we \npassed a law requiring the words ``In God We Trust'' to appear on our \ncurrency and coins. There are the words on the wall in this Senate \nChamber just below the clock, ``In God We Trust.'' We passed that law \nin the House on June 5, 1955. I will always be proud that I was a \nMember of the House of Representatives when we passed those two pieces \nof legislation.\n\n  So we pledge allegiance ``to the flag of the United States of America \nand to the Republic''--not to the democracy, but to the Republic--``for \nwhich it stands.'' We operate by democratic processes. Ours is a \ndemocratic society--I have no quarrel with that--but we do not live in \na pure democracy. This is a Republic. We ought to get it straight. High \nrhetorical phrases referring to our form of government as a democracy \nconstitute somewhat idle talk, and we politicians especially ought to \nknow better.\n  I sent over to the Library and got a civics textbook by R.O. Hughes, \nvintage 1927. I studied civics in 1927. That was the year Lindbergh \nflew across the Atlantic and Jack Dempsey fought Gene Tunney to regain \nthe heavyweight title, but he didn't regain it.\n\n[[Page S10980]]\n\n That was the year when Babe Ruth, the Sultan of Swat, hit his 60th \nhome run. So this civics textbook was vintage 1927, and it was right on \nthe mark. Here is what it said: ``We call the United States a federal \nrepublic.'' The textbook also defined a republic as ``a government in \nwhich the sovereign power is in the hands of the people, but is \nexercised through officials whom they elect.'' Now, there it is. The \ntextbook also defined a democracy: ``A democracy is a government in \nwhich all power is exercised directly by the people. It is next to \nimpossible for this to be done except in small communities, but the \nspirit of democracy prevails in many republics and some monarchies.''\n  That 1927 civics textbook had it right. In my hometown of Sophia, WV, \n1,186 souls--as of the last census--could very well operate as a pure \ndemocracy.\n  All of the people could gather together, and they could pass laws; \nthat would not be difficult at all--like the early city-states of \nGreece.\n  The 1927 civics textbook also defined a ``monarchy'' as well as an \n``oligarchy'' and an ``aristocracy.''\n  Curious as to what a modern textbook on civics would have to say on \nthis subject, I picked up a book, copyright 1990 by Prentice-Hall, \nInc., and found no reference--none--to republics and monarchies. \nInstead, the book referred only to dictatorships and democracies. The \n1990 civics textbook states that one way to describe government ``is by \nsaying whether it is a dictatorship or a democracy.'' The book defined \na democracy as follows: ``Democracies are quite different from \ndictatorships. In a democracy the final authority rests with the \npeople. Those who govern do so by permission of the people. Government \nis run, in other words, with the people's consent. The United States of \nAmerica is an example of a democracy.''\n  That is really inaccurate, ``The United States of America is an \nexample of a democracy.'' It is not.\n  Let me quote what I would consider to be the ultimate authority. This \ndefinition does not square with Madison's definition. If Senators want \nan argument about this, don't argue with me, argue with Madison. This \ndefinition does not square with Madison's definition, yet this is what \nstudents who study from this 1990 civics textbook are being taught.\n  The same textbook goes on to state: ``Democracies may be either \ndirect or indirect. A direct democracy is one in which the people \nthemselves, usually in a group meeting, make decisions about what the \ngovernment will do. Direct democracies do not work very well in large \ncommunities. It is almost impossible to get all the people together in \none place.''\n  That is what the book says.\n  Then the book proceeds. It says: ``An indirect democracy is one in \nwhich a few people are elected to represent everyone else in the \ncommunity. For this reason, indirect democracies are also called \nrepresentative democracies.''\n  It is kind of a convoluted way of getting around to saying the right \nthing, referring to a representative democracy.\n  Continuing to quote from the book: ``These representatives are held \nresponsible by the people for the day-to-day operation of the \ngovernment. If the people are unhappy with the performance of their \nrepresentatives, they may vote them out of office during the next \nelection.''\n  What a profound statement. That is the civics textbook of 1990. Until \nI opened up that textbook, I had never heard, I have to say, of \n``direct'' democracies and ``indirect'' democracies. So now, my Pledge \nof Allegiance would have to be stated as follows: ``I pledge allegiance \nto the flag of the United States of America and to the indirect \ndemocracy for which it stands,'' and so forth.\n  Are you confused?\n  James Madison, one of the principal framers of the Constitution, \nalluded to ``the confounding of a republic with a democracy'' in the \nFederalist #14, written on November 30, 1787. He proceeds to delineate \na true distinction between these forms: ``. . . in a democracy, the \npeople meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic they \nassemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A \ndemocracy consequently will be confined to a small spot. A republic may \nbe extended over a large region.''\n  Madison was confronting the critics of the Constitution, some of whom \nsought, by the artifice of confusing the terms democracy and republic, \nto maintain that a republic could never be established except among a \nsmall number of people, living within a small territory. As Madison so \nably pointed out, this observation was applicable to a democracy only.\n  Madison describes the territorial limitations of democracies such as \nthe ``turbulent democracies of ancient Greece,'' saying: ``. . . the \nnatural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point, \nwhich would just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often \nas their public functions demand; and will include no greater number \nthan can join in those functions; . . .'' He proceeds to say that the \nnatural limit of a republic ``is that distance from the center, which \nwill barely allow the representatives of the people to meet as often as \nmay be necessary for the administration of public affairs.''\n  Madison argues that the territorial limits of the United States do \nnot exceed the limit within which a republic can operate and \neffectively administer the affairs of the people. Again, in the \nFederalist #10, where Madison discusses the sources and causes and \ndangers of faction, he defines a ``pure'' democracy as being ``a \nsociety, consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and \nadminister the government in person.''\n  Let me say that again.\n  Madison defines a ``pure'' democracy as being ``a society, consisting \nof a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the \ngovernment in person.'' And Madison indicates that such a form of \ngovernment ``can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction.''\n  Listen to this--Madison again--stating that, ``democracies have ever \nbeen spectacles of turbulence and contention,'' Madison proceeds to add \nthat they ``have ever been found incompatible with personal security, \nor the rights of property.'' He adds: ``Theoretic politicians, who have \npatronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed, that \nby reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, \nthey would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in \ntheir possessions, their opinions, and their passions.''\n\n  It is quite different with a republic, however. Listen to Madison as \nhe extols this form as a better approach to dealing with faction: ``A \nrepublic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of \nrepresentation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises \nthe cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which \nit varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature \nof the cure, and the efficacy which it must derive from the union.''\n  Again, Madison clearly distinguishes between a democracy and a \nrepublic: ``The two great points of difference between a democracy and \na republic are, first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, \n``--meaning in the republic--'' to a small number of citizens elected \nby the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater \nsphere of country, over which the latter ``--meaning the republic--'' \nmay be extended.''\n  Madison in the Federalist #10 then examines whether the public voice \npronounced by the representatives of the people will be more consonant \nto the public good in a small rather than in a large republic, and he \ncomes down in favor of a more extensive republic as being ``most \nfavorable to the election of proper guardians of the public weal.'' \nMadison clearly decides in favor of the larger territory. But let's let \nhim speak for himself: ``The greater number of citizens and extent of \nterritory which may be brought within the compass of republican, than \nof democratic government'' is a ``circumstance principally which \nrenders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former ``--the \nrepublic--'' than in the latter.''\n  In summation, Madison said, ``Hence it clearly appears, that the same \nadvantage, which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the \neffects of faction''--George Washington, we will remember, warned us \nabout faction in his farewell address. Madison said, ``Hence it clearly \nappears, that the same advantage, which a republic has over a \ndemocracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large\n\n[[Page S10981]]\n\nover a small republic--is enjoyed by the Union over the States \ncomposing it.''\n  Hamilton, in Madison's notes on the Constitutional Convention, \nreferred to the ``amazing violence and turbulence of the democratic \nspirit.'' Madison himself, in his notes, referred to the dangers of a \n``leveling spirit,'' when he said: ``No agrarian attempts have yet been \nmade in this country, but symptoms, of a leveling spirit, as we have \nunderstood, have sufficiently appeared in a certain quarter to give \nnotice of the future danger. How is this danger to be guarded against \non republican principles?''\n  Madison was probably referring to the Shays' Rebellion which had \noccurred just the year before the convention, in 1786, when he spoke of \nthe symptoms of a ``leveling spirit.''\n  Madison was espousing the establishment of a Senate as ``a body in \nthe government sufficiently respectable for its wisdom and virtue, to \naid on such emergencies, the preponderance of justice by throwing its \nweight into that scale.''\n  Madison went on to observe ``That as it was more than probable we \nwere now digesting a plan which in its operations would decide forever \nthe fate of republican government--talking about the constitution--we \nought not only to provide every guard to liberty that its preservation \ncould require, but be equally careful to supply the defects which our \nown experience had particularly pointed out.''\n  What a wise, wise man, Madison. What wise men who gathered there in \nPhiladelphia during those hot summer days between May 25, 1787 and \nSeptember 17 of that year and hammered out the Constitution of the \nUnited States. What a document!\n  In the discussions concerning the mode of selection of members of the \nfirst branch of the national legislature, Mr. Sherman opposed election \nby the people.\n  We hear a lot about this ``democracy'' of ours. Many of the framers \nwere concerned about democracy. Some of them didn't want any part of \nit. They didn't want a democracy.\n  Mr. Sherman opposed election by the people, insisting that it ought \nto be by the State legislatures. According to Madison's notes, Mr. \nSherman expressed himself accordingly: ``The people, he said, \nimmediately should have as little to do as may be about the Government. \nThey want information and are constantly liable to be misled.''\n  Roger Sherman, a delegate from Connecticut, was joined in this \nfeeling by Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts who, as Madison explained, \naverred: ``The evils we experience flow from the excess of democracy. . \n. . He . . . had been taught by experience the danger of the leveling \n[sic] spirit.''\n  George Mason of Virginia favored the election of the larger branch by \nthe people. According to Madison, Mason ``admitted that we had been too \nDemocratic but was afraid we should incautiously run into the opposite \nextreme.'' They didn't want to go to the extreme on either edge.\n  Governor Edmund Randolph of Virginia, who had offered the resolves, \naround which the debates would swirl throughout the Convention. These \nare Madison notes from which I am quoting Governor Edmund Randolph of \nVirginia who had presented the resolves on the 29th day of May, 1787. \nIt is so easy for me to remember that day because the 29th day of May \nis my wedding anniversary. It happens to be my wife's wedding \nanniversary also, naturally, May 29. We have seen 61 anniversaries \nalready in our lifetime. And so here is the quote of Governor Randolph.\n\n  He ``observed that the general object was to provide a cure for the \nevils under which the United States labored; that in tracing these \nevils to their origin, every man had found it in the turbulence and \nfollies of democracy.'' He was of the opinion, therefore, that a check \n``was to be sought for against this tendency of our government,'' and \nhe believed that a Senate--a Senate would achieve this end.\n  In speaking of the Senate of Maryland, and the length of Senatorial \nterms in that State, Hamilton said: ``They suppose seven years a \nsufficient period to give the Senate an adequate firmness, from not \nduly considering the amazing violence and turbulence of the democratic \nspirit. When a great object of government is pursued, which seizes the \npopular passions, they spread like wildfire, and become irresistible.'' \nThis was Hamilton speaking, referring to the Senate of Maryland.\n  It is evident from Madison's notes on the Convention that a pure \ndemocracy, as a form of government, did not appeal to the delegates at \nthe Convention, and that a fear of the ``leveling spirit'' of democracy \nwas prevalent at the time and leading members of the Convention were \naware of this concern.\n  Therefore, as Alexis de Tocqueville stated in ``Democracy in \nAmerica,'' ``the Americans have a democratic state of society'', we \nshould be more careful than to allude to our form of government as a \n``democracy.'' If we want to say it's a representative democracy, that \nis one thing. But it is not a ``democracy''. To do so is to use our \nlanguage loosely. And we all use our language loosely from time to \ntime. I do. But I never refer to this government as a ``democracy.'' I \nprefer to stick to the strict definition as explained by Madison and \nrefer to ours as a republic--which I proudly do.\n  The framers were wise men. As Butler of South Carolina said ``We must \nfollow the example of Solon, who gave the Athenians not the best \ngovernment he could devise, but the best [government that] they would \nreceive.''\n  Our founding fathers gave us a republic. As Dale Bumpers reminded me \na moment ago--a few minutes ago, when a lady approached Benjamin \nFranklin at the conclusion of the convention's proceedings on September \n17, 1987, she said, ``Dr. Franklin, what form of government have you \ngiven us?''\n\n  Franklin didn't answer saying, ``A democracy, Madam.'' His answer \nwas, ``A republic, Madam, if you can keep it.''\n  Our Founding Fathers gave us a republic, and we public officials, \npoliticians and other molders of opinion should formulate our spoken \nand written language accordingly.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank Senators for their \ncourtesy in listening. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have enjoyed being here and listening \nto the senior Senator of West Virginia on a subject about which I have \nhad some opinions and to which I have given some thought, and I would \nlike to engage with him at another time about these issues. But I would \njust share with him and with the Senate this personal experience.\n  When I lived in California, I discovered that many governmental \nreformers had put into place in California, initiative, referendum, and \nrecall. This was the cry of political reformers, I think, in the 1920s, \nand it was supposed to be a demonstration of how forward-looking you \nwere if you were in favor of initiative, referendum and recall. I voted \nagainst every single initiative that came in California, whether I \nagreed with it or not, for precisely the reasons that the Senator from \nWest Virginia has given us. Because, I said, the people should not be \nlegislating directly in the ballot box. We have a republic to do that. \nThe Constitution guarantees every State a republican form of \ngovernment. And I felt that California was going down the road, away \nfrom that constitutional requirement.\n  I have discovered, since I left California, that whenever the \npoliticians there have a problem now that they find too difficult for \nthem to deal with in the State assembly, they simply say: Well, let's \nput it on the ballot. And you have legislation going on the ballot that \nshould be fought out in the legislative process of a republic.\n  Another problem that you have in California, I would say to the \nSenator from West Virginia, if it passes in an initiative, it becomes \npart of the State constitution and therefore cannot be amended. And we \nhave seen examples of legislation that could not get through the State \nassembly being put on the ballot by factions--to use Madison's term; \ntoday we would call them special interests--and therefore being \nembedded in the California State Constitution so that a future \nlegislature cannot repair the mischief that is created by this attempt \nat pure democracy.\n  So we have a laboratory here in our own Union of States that \ndemonstrates the wisdom of Madison and his counterparts in creating the \nConstitution.\n\n[[Page S10982]]\n\n As I say, I am proud to say that when I lived in California, as a \ncitizen, as a matter of constitutional conscience, I voted against \nevery single initiative, even those with which I agreed, because I \nwanted to preserve the concept of a representative republic that is the \nfoundation of our liberties.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for this most scholarly \npresentation. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to be here to \nhear it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nobservations. I am grateful for his presence at this time and grateful \nfor the perceptions that he has expressed to us based on his \nexperiences in living in the great State of California.\n  I thank him. I think he is a scholar, a real scholar of our form of \ngovernment and interested in keeping this republic as Benjamin Franklin \nso wisely admonished the lady. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for his kind words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S10979-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FEDERAL VACANCIES REFORM ACT OF 1998--PERMISSION TO FILE AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, yesterday marked the 35th Anniversary of \nthe Senate's ratification of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963. \nUnfortunately, we still have not achieved the larger goal of ratifying \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In fact, the Treaty has languished \nin the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a year with no debate, no \naction, and no results.\n  As President Kennedy said about the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, \n``The conclusion of such a treaty * * * would check the spiraling arms \nrace in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear \npowers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest \nhazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms.'' \nThirty-five years later, those words are truer than ever.\n  Nuclear proliferation is one of the most serious national security \nthreats we face. Earlier this year, the nuclear tests in India and \nPakistan reminded us that we must do all we can to ratify the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty as soon as possible.\n  On Wednesday, at the United Nations, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of \nPakistan announced his intent to sign the test ban treaty within the \nnext year. The Prime Minister linked this decision to the lifting of \nsanctions imposed in the wake of last May's nuclear tests. Yesterday, \nIndia's Prime Minister Vajpayee followed suit and announced to the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly that his nation would also sign the Treaty within the \nyear.\n  If both Pakistan and India sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, \nonly North Korea will remain outside the worldwide group of nations in \ncontinuing to develop their nuclear program. Prompt U.S. ratification \nof the Treaty would not only demonstrate our support for Pakistan and \nIndia, but also encourage North Korea to join the world and reject \nnuclear testing.\n  The recent tests by India and Pakistan are ominous proof that the \ngreatest threat to humanity is still the danger of nuclear war. The \nCTBT would give the United States access to a vast worldwide network of \nnuclear monitoring stations. These additional stations would blanket \nthe globe with sensors that can detect radiation, feel the ground shake \nfrom a nuclear test, or hear the sounds emanating underwater from a \nnuclear explosion. This network is possible only through the \ncooperative efforts of the CTBT, and it will clearly strengthen our \nnational security.\n  We face a unique opportunity in the Senate, an opportunity to help \nthe world pull back from the nuclear brink and end nuclear testing once \nand for all. Other nations look to the United States for international \nleadership. President Clinton has done his part, in signing the Treaty \nand submitting it to the Senate for ratification, as the Constitution \nrequires.

A bill to exclude from Federal taxation any portion of any \nreward paid to David R. Kaczynski and Linda E. Patrik which is donated \nto the victims in the Unabomber case or their families or which is used \nto pay Mr. Kaczynski's and Ms. Patrik's attorneys' fees; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                        tax exemption of rewards\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, three years ago, a quiet, law-\nabiding American family found itself suddenly and unavoidably caught up \nin the story of one of the most notorious criminal manhunts of the last \nquarter century in the United States. At this time, my constituents \nDavid R. Kaczynski and his wife Linda E. Patrik were confronted with a \nterrible dilemma. Published news reports led them to suspect they knew \nthe identity of the ``Unabomber,'' the elusive criminal whose letter \nbombs had killed three people and injured several others over a 17-year \nperiod.\n  Upon reading the Unabomber's ``manifesto'' published in the New York \nTimes and Washington Post in September of 1995, Mr. Kaczynski and Ms. \nPatrik, residents of Schenectady, New York, came to the awful \nrealization that the Unabomber might be David's brother, Theodore J. \nKaczynski, whose letters they believed closely resembled the \nUnabomber's ``manifesto.'' David Kaczynski, a social worker, and Ms. \nPatrik, a professor of philosophy at Union College, understandably \nfeared that disclosure of their suspicions might ultimately lead to the \nexecution of David's brother for the crime of murder. Even so--and as \npainful as it was for them--they considered it their duty to notify the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, which they did.\n  Soon thereafter, Theodore Kaczynski was arrested in a small cabin in \nMontana, bringing to an end the Unabomber's long reign of violence. In \nJanuary 1998, Theodore Kaczynski entered a plea agreement with federal \nprosecutors resulting in his sentence of life in prison without parole.\n  Earlier this year, David Kaczynski and Linda Patrik received a $1 \nmillion reward from the FBI for the information they supplied. And it \nwas characteristic of these fine citizens that they immediately \npledged, after taxes and attorneys' fees, to pay every cent of the \nreward to the Unabomber's victims and their families.\n  For over two years, David Kaczynski, his family, and his attorney \nspent countless hours involved in efforts associated with the \ninvestigation, capture, and trial of Theodore Kaczynski. Now they are \nattempting to do the right and noble thing by pledging the reward money \nto help those injured by a deeply troubled member of their family. It \nwould be ironic and I believe unjust if the federal government were to \ndiminish this selfless act by taxing the Kaczynskis or those to whom \nthey have agreed to pay the reward monies. Therefore we are introducing \na bill today to increase the amount available to the Unabomber's \nvictims and their families by exempting from federal taxation all \namounts donated to the victims, as well as attorney's fees incurred in \nthe matter.\n  Mr. President, surely this is the least we can do to express our \ngratitude to David Kaczynski and Linda Patrik, and our sorrow and \ncondolences to the victims and their families. I hope all Senators will \nsupport this simple but much-needed measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S10986-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1868\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Hagel) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1868, a bill to express \nUnited States foreign policy with respect to, and to strengthen United \nStates advocacy on behalf of, individuals persecuted for their faith \nworldwide;

I am always proud when \nWest Virginians are recognized for their outstanding contributions to \nsociety. However, this is an especially nice case since Dr. Bhasin's \nwork also demonstrates how great ideas can improve a company's profit \nmargin and save resources at the same time.\n  Dr. Bhasin received his B.Sc. from the University of Delhi and his \nPh.D. from the University of Notre Dame in 1958 and has been with Union \nCarbide since 1963. During his 35 year career at the Union Carbide \nTechnical Center in\n\n[[Page S11000]]\n\nSouth Charleston, West Virginia, he has devoted his efforts to \nresearching and applying catalysts to create new production methods and \nhelp improve existing industrial processes. His invention and \nimplementation of nine generations of ethylene epoxidation catalysts \nled to his recognition by the American Chemical Society. The catalysts \nthat Dr. Bhasin invented allow for the more efficient conversion of \nethylene epoxidation to ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol, which are \ncomponents in products such as polyester and anti-freeze. Billions of \npounds of ethylene epoxidation are used each year so increasing the \nconversion efficiency has allowed Union Carbide to remain one of the \nworld leaders in this market as well as save energy and reduce by-\nproducts. This is obviously a win for Union Carbide, the environment \nand the state of West Virginia.\n  Again I would like to take this opportunity to publically recognize \nand congratulate Dr. Bhasin for this great accolade and wish him \ncontinued success in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S10999-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC SAFETY ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about some \ngood news for a change. I want to talk about the Wireless \nCommunications and Public Safety Act of 1998 that Senator McCain is \nintroducing, and I am cosponsoring. The purpose of this legislation is \nto link some of the amazing innovations in wireless technology to 9-1-1 \nand emergency response professionals.\n  All kinds of technologies exist today that can greatly reduce \nresponse time to emergencies and help victims get the right kind of \nmedical attention quickly. But right now these technologies are not \nconnected in ways that we can use them for emergencies. That's why this \neffort to upgrade our 9-1-1 systems across the nation is to so \nimportant and necessary.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conducted \nstudies showing that crash-to-care time for fatal accidents is about a \nhalf hour in urban areas. In rural areas, which covers most of my home \nstate of Montana, that crash-to-care time almost doubles. On average, \nit takes just shy of an hour to get emergency attention to crash \nvictims in rural areas. Almost half of the serious crash victims who do \nnot receive care in that first hour die at the scene of the accident. \nThat's a scary statistic. But it doesn't have to continue that way.\n  Drew Dawson, who is the Director of the Montana Emergency Medical \nServices Bureau and president of the National Association of State \nEmergency Medical Services Directors, strongly supports this \nlegislation. He tells me that the bill will help bring better wireless \n9-1-1 coverage to Montana and will enhance our statewide Trauma Care \nSystem. Mr. Dawson believes this legislation will help him and his \nemergency folks do their job better, which means it will help them save \nmore lives than they already do.\n  Montana unfortunately has a high motor vehicle crash death rate. Part \nof this bill promotes research on something called Automatic Crash \nNotification technology or ACN as Mr. Dawson and the trauma and \nemergency professionals call it. ACN technology takes the sensors in \ncars, such as airbag sensors and speed sensors, and links them to a \nwireless phone and a location device. When an ACN-equipped car in a \nremote area of Montana crashes, the car automatically dials 9-1-1. Not \nonly does the car dial 9-1-1 but it transmits data telling the \nemergency operator where exactly the crash victim is and the likelihood \nof the victim's injuries. This ACN system also opens up a voice channel \nenabling the emergency operator to speak to the crash victim.\n  ACN technology comes into effect only seconds after the crash. It can \nbe rigged so that the emergency operator gets the crash information as \nwell as the nearest trauma center. ACN would eliminate many drawn out \nsearch and rescues that usually have to take place.\n  In these crash situations, time is of the essence. The emergency \nmedical professionals refer to the first hour after a crash as the \n``Golden Hour.'' They say if they can get to victims in that first \nhour, then they have a good chance of limiting the severity of the \ninjuries. Once the clock ticks over an hour, the chances of medical \nmiracles lessen more and more. Reducing response time means the \ndifference between life and death.\n  I have to say a word about all of the good work that folks like Drew \nDawson in Montana and other emergency professionals do all over the \ncountry. The United States has the most skilled and dedicated group of \nmedical and emergency professionals in the world. We just need to give \nthem better tools. There is technology out there that can help these \nprofessionals and that can help all of us citizens, if, God forbid, we \never find ourselves in an emergency situation needing this kind of \nhelp. The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1998 will \nhelp all of us and will make our emergency services even better than \nthey are today.\n  Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues will join me and help pass \nthis important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S11000-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE CITIZENS AGAINST LAWSUIT ABUSE (CALA)\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize today the \nefforts of a group of West Virginia citizens who have joined together \nto address an important issue affecting our state and the nation. These \nindividuals, who have formed Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse (CALA), are \nworking to educate the public about how excesses in our civil justice \nsystem can be harmful.\n  CALA volunteer spokespersons are speaking out about how lawsuit abuse \nmeans people pay through higher prices for consumer products, higher \nmedical expenses, higher taxes and lost business expansion and product \ndevelopment. I should note that my own concerns relate to abuse of the \nsystem which comes in the form of frivolous suits and inappropriate \ndelays--not legitimate use of our tort system.\n  CALA reports that recent studies of liability costs have found that \nour State has a high lawsuit and liability cost relative to our \neconomic output measured as gross state product. As another example of \nthe effect of lawsuit abuse, CALA's own survey of all West Virginia \nmunicipalities last year found an estimated annual lawsuit-related cost \nfor our municipal taxpayers to be more than $9 million. Nationally, it \nhas been estimated that the costs of our civil justice system averages \n$1200 per person per year.\n  Legal reform of any kind is not a simple issue. The legal system is \nessential to provide justice to every American. But that does not mean \nthat the status quo is perfect. When lawsuits and the courts can be \nused in excess or result in imposing costs without reason on the other \nparties, from individuals to not-for-profit agencies to businesses, the \nsystem should be reviewed and reformed if possible.\n  I often have spoken about the problems of our product liability \nsystem. We see the terrible consequences of our country's confusing \npatchwork, slow, and often unfair system of product liability rules \nthat need to be properly and fairly reformed.\n  The leaders of West Virginia's CALA movement should be commended here \ntoday. Volunteers such as Robert Mauk of Huntington; Jim Thomas, Sid \nDavis and Mac McJunkin of Charleston; Cuz Blake of Bridgeport; Phyllis \nGarner of Clarksburg; Rick Pruitte of Fairmont; and Sam Chico of \nMorgantown are all working hard to ensure that our State has a strong, \nfair and effective civil justice system that will serve all West \nVirginians and grow our economy and job base. These people give their \ntime to speak to community groups, organize educational activities and \ndistribute materials to help us all be conscious of lawsuit costs and \nexcesses of the system.\n  Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse groups have declared September 21 \nthrough 26 to be ``Lawsuit Abuse Awareness Week'' in West Virginia. I \nwant to commend these citizens for their dedication and commitment and \nto acknowledge this week as time of public awareness on the serious \nissues associated with lawsuit abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S11000-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11000-S11002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, first, I alert my colleagues that I will \nspeak a very short time. I am going to talk about a UC that I would \nhave proposed but will not propose today but will explain why.\n  Earlier this month, the Republican majority came to the floor, \nunfortunately without prior warning, to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest for consideration of the Hatch-Sessions juvenile justice bill, \nS. 10. I see the distinguished Senator from Alabama here on the floor \nnow. The UC was proposed late on Thursday afternoon. Unfortunately, it \nwas after Senators had been informed there would be no more votes. In \nfact, I had already left for home in Vermont. We were unaware that they \nmight want to proceed to S. 10 on Thursday.\n  My concern is that there had been a year of inaction on the bill. I \nhad tried to propose some additional changes to the bill, which was \nvoted on by the Judiciary Committee in July 1997, but I was unable to \nget any response from the other side of the aisle in the Judiciary \nCommittee on that. There was also no attempt to get a response from \nthis side of the aisle on the proposed UC.\n  I mention this because the failure of this Congress to take up and \npass responsible juvenile crime legislation does not rest with the \nDemocrats. And it is not going to be cured by any kind of a procedural \nfloor gimmick.\n  Over the past year, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate and at \nhearings on several occasions about my concerns with the legislation. \nAt the same time, I have expressed my willingness to work with the \nchairman of the full committee in a bipartisan manner to improve the \njuvenile crime bill.\n  I am not alone in my criticisms and in wanting to see changes in the \nbill. It has been criticized by virtually every major newspaper in the \nUnited States. It has been criticized by national leaders ranging from \nChief Justice Rehnquist to Marian Wright Edelman, President of the \nChildren's Defense Fund. The National District Attorneys Association, \nand other law enforcement agencies have also written me with their \nconcerns about this bill.\n  I have also heard from numerous State and local officials across the \nUnited States, including the National Governors' Association, the \nCouncil of State Governments, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the National Conference of State \nLegislatures. All of them have expressed concerns about the \nrestrictions this bill would place on their ability to combat and \nprevent juvenile crime effectively.\n  In short, S. 10, as reported by the Judiciary Committee, is a bill \nladen with problems--in fact, so many that at last count the bill had \nlost nearly a quarter of the Republicans who signed on as cosponsors \nsince its introduction.\n  The unanimous consent request that was proposed by the other side of \nthe aisle, I believe, was patently unfair. It would have limited debate \nof juvenile justice and other crime matters. It would have permitted \nthe Republicans to offer a substitute to their own bill but not allowed \nDemocrats the same opportunity. The only additional amendments in order \nunder their plan would be five on each side.\n  We just received from the chairman of the Judiciary Committee the day \nbefore yesterday, September 23, the latest version of S. 10 which \ncontains over 100 different changes, but the Republicans want to limit \nus to 5 amendments. That is not a bipartisan effort to improve this \nbill.\n  While I appreciate that we are short of time in this Congress, and I \nunderstand why the Republican leadership would like to limit the number \nof amendments the Democrats may offer, of course, the decision to bring \nthe bill up at the end of the Congress is that of the majority. I have \nno problem with that.\n  But we have worked diligently to pare down the amendments that the \nDemocrats plan to offer to S. 10 from 64 to the 25 substantive \namendments which I would have put in a proposed UC. Keep in mind what I \nsaid, also, that just a couple days ago we were handed the latest \nversion from the other side with over 100 changes. We are talking about \ncutting Democratic amendments from 64 to 25 substantive ones that \naddress the substantial criticisms leveled at this bill. I want to \nassure that Senate consideration of this legislation is fair, full, and \nproductive. I do not appreciate, frankly, what appears to be almost a \nprocedural ambush to move this bill forward in a way that allows \nconsideration of all changes from the other side but very few from this \nside.\n  So, Mr. President, I am not going to make a unanimous consent \nrequest, but I ask to put this into the Record--not as a unanimous \nconsent request. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nwhat I would recommend should be a unanimous consent request to be \nasked by the leadership entitled ``Juvenile Justice.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Juvenile Justice\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the \n     majority leader, after consultation with the democratic \n     leader to proceed to Calendar No. 210, S. 10, The Violent and \n     Repeat Juvenile Offender Act and it be considered under the \n     following limitations:\n       That the only amendments in order be a substitute amendment \n     offered by Senators Hatch and Sessions, a substitute \n     amendment offered by the minority leader or his designee and \n     the following listed amendments, and that if either \n     substitute is agreed to that the substitute continue to be \n     amendable in two degrees:\n       Leahy--judicial review procedures in certain juveniles \n     cases; preservation of state presumption for prosecution of \n     most juveniles; access to juvenile records; separation \n     standard for juveniles in custody; crime victims assistance.\n       Kennedy--gun control measure; Hate Crimes Prevention Act; \n     reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \n     Prevention Act.\n       Biden--prevention program for after-school activities; \n     increase funding for prosecutor/courts grant program; modify \n     requirements to qualify for funding from $150 million grant \n     program; gun ban for dangerous teens; preserve the sovereign \n     rights of native Americans by continuing the tribal ``OPT-\n     IN''; extension crime law trust fund.\n       Kohl--reauthorize title V programs; restoration of the jail \n     removal mandate.\n       Feingold--improve school safety; allow funds to be used to \n     identify early warning signs of potential juvenile offenders.\n       Durbin--relevant.\n       Bingaman--Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction \n     Act; to strike provisions relating to tobacco and alcohol.\n       Lautenberg--jump mentoring bill, S. 1461.\n       Wellstone--juvenile mental health protections.\n       Murray--restorative/community justice.\n       That there may be a managers package of amendments to be \n     cleared by both the majority and minority manager; and\n       I finally ask consent that following the disposition of any \n     or all amendments the bill read a third time, the Judiciary \n     Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n     1818 and the Senate proceed to its consideration; all after \n     the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 10, as \n     amended be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill be read a third \n     time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill. \n     I further ask that following the vote the Senate insist on \n     its amendment, request a conference with the House and the \n     Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There was a unanimous consent----\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, no. I tell my friend from Alabama, this is what I \nwould propose. I already stated that. And I have informed the floor \nstaff on the Republican side that I would not make the unanimous \nconsent request to this proposal at this time. Anyone who has known me \nfor 24 years here knows I would never do this. I would not propose a \nunanimous consent request on a\n\n[[Page S11004]]\n\nday when everybody has taken off already to the various airports or \nhome. But I am putting into the Record, so that Senators can read it on \nMonday, what would have been my proposal if we were able to make it. I \nwould not seek to ambush the other side. I have not done that in 24 \nyears, and I am not about to start now.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  The Chair advises the Senator, because of the previous order, he will \nhave to seek unanimous consent to speak at this point.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, notwithstanding \nthe previous order for adjournment, I be permitted to speak, and the \nSenate then adjourn under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I really appreciate Senator Leahy and his leadership as \nranking member on the Judiciary Committee. I would suggest, with regard \nto juvenile justice, that we have not had a year of inaction, as the \nSenator said. There were 100 changes proposed, and most of those in an \napparently futile attempt to gain the support of Democratic Members who \nhave been using procedural tactics to block the consideration of that \nbill.\n  The bill came out of the Judiciary Committee on a 12-6 vote, and with \nbipartisan support. Since that time, we have sought to gain additional \nsupport from the Democratic side. I have been a prosecutor for almost \n20 years. I believe in this bill. It is not a political bill. It is a \nbill that provides resources and support and strength right to the \nlocal juvenile courts throughout America. It is in those courts where \nthe real progress is being made in fighting juvenile crime.\n  I see the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Ohio. A few months ago \nwe had the opportunity to meet in Ohio with a juvenile judge, Judge \nGrossman, who allowed us to witness a model program in action. In this \nprogram the judges have the resources and the capacity to confront \nyoungsters when they are first arrested for juvenile crimes, and the \njudges also have the option to do something effective to confront those \nchildren and to change them from the road of destruction on which they \nare too often headed. A community may have alternative schools. It may \nhave boot camps. It may have intensive probation supervision. In Ohio, \nJudge Grossman has a truancy program with trials conducted in the \nschoolroom with the Judge present. These are the kind of programs that \ncan actually deter juvenile crime in America.\n\n  That is the heart and soul of this juvenile justice bill. I hope \nsomehow, some way we can get a vote on it this time. It has been \nfrustrating that we have not been able to do that yet. The National \nJuvenile Judges Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the Boy's \nand Girl's Club, and organization after organization have supported \nthis piece of legislation. I don't think there is any group more \ninterested and more professionally concerned than the National Juvenile \nJudges Association. They have spent a good bit of time analyzing it, \nand they support it. This bill certainly represents a very important \nstep forward.\n  I thank this body and I thank the Presiding Officer for his \nleadership on juvenile crime and juvenile justice. It is a matter close \nto my heart. The Presiding Officer is a former prosecutor who has given \nintensive leadership to that issue.\n  The legislation we have today is a product of bipartisan compromise \nand a lot of hard work. I think it is an excellent bill and it will be \na tragedy, indeed, if for partisan reasons we are not able to bring it \nforward.\n  The House has acted on good legislation. If we can get our \nlegislation passed, even in these last few days--I know the time is \nshort--if we can get ours passed and go to conference and work together \none more time, we could pass a bill that the people of this country \nwould be proud of and would, in fact, allow us to intervene in the \nlives of kids who are going wrong and get them on the right track. \nSometimes that takes tough intervention. Sometimes they need to go to a \nboot camp or detention facility or alternative school. We need to help \nencourage States to do that. Mr. President, I thank the occupant of the \nChair for his time and his leadership on this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S11003-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11004-S11005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was taken aback this morning after \nreading statements made by Vice President Gore that appeared in an \narticle detailing the decision made by the Energy and Water \nAppropriations conference committee to eliminate Federal funding for \nthe Tennessee Valley Administration's non-power programs. Funding for \nthese TVA programs has been going on since TVA's inception. It has been \npared down very much, year after year after year, until it has reached \nan amount that really can fund only the maintenance of the waterway, \nthe dams, the flow of water, and reservoirs contained therein.\n  The conference committee has determined and has decided that funding \nfor these programs will be eliminated. I am extremely disappointed in \nthat. I want to say a few things about this decision and how it came \nabout, but first I want to comment on what the Vice President said in \ntoday's AP story. According to published accounts, Vice President Gore \nsaid he was deeply disappointed in these program reductions. Then he \nsaid, ``The conference committee's action in zeroing out TVA is \ncompletely misguided, unjustified, unfair, and it seriously undermines \nTVA's important role in enhancing the Tennessee Valley.''\n  That is what the Vice President said, ``* * * completely misguided, \nunjustified, unfair, and it seriously undermines TVA's important role \nin * * * the Tennessee Valley.''\n  I agree that the decision to eliminate this funding is unfair because \nfor the first time the ratepayer, the Tennessee Valley power payers, \nwill be asked to keep up a waterway, even though every other waterway \nin America is kept up by taxpayers, through either the Corps of \nEngineers or other agencies. This is a major change and I think it was \nan unwise decision.\n  Mr. President, just 2 years ago this administration took action that \ndirectly led to this result. There has been debate for some time as to \nwhether or not we ought to fund the Tennessee Valley Authority in this \nway. Two years ago this President and this Vice President, working \nthrough the Office of Management and Budget, which is a part of this \nadministration, submitted a budget to this Congress that zeroed out \nnonpower funding for the Tennessee Valley Authority. The last time I \nchecked, the Vice President was a part of this administration.\n  Now, those of us who opposed the Administration's decision are in \ntrouble. There was a debate about reducing TVA's funding. People took \ndifferent sides on it. The chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority \nis a personal friend of the Vice President. The Vice President helped \nthe current TVA chairman get his appointment and the Vice President \nconsults with him regularly. Initially, the TVA chairman said he \nthought the Administration's funding reductions were a good idea and he \nsupported the Clinton Administration's position. We asked him to \nreconsider. Chairman Crowell held hearings and studied the issue and \ncame back and said he didn't think the Administration's position was a \ngood idea after all; he changed his mind.\n  What I am saying, Mr. President, is that we are ``living in spin'' in \nthis city. It offends me. It is a matter of basic integrity. I am just \na former prosecutor from Alabama. I haven't been in this body 2 years. \nMaybe you are supposed to become immune to these things. I am not \nimmune to it yet. When the Vice President says, ``It is completely \nmisguided, unjustified, unfair,'' and yet 2 years ago he submitted a \nbudget to do the very thing he is now criticizing, it strikes me as \nsomewhat unusual and unfair and unjustified for him to say that.\n  The reason this funding failed and the reason the conference \ncommittee succeeded over my objection and over the objection of \nSenators Thompson, Frist, Shelby and others involved in the Tennessee \nValley, was because of the impetus given to this effort by this \nadministration when, along with their chairman of TVA, they supported \nproposed funding reductions 2 years ago.\n\n[[Page S11005]]\n\n Once the Administration supported it and said it was a good idea--and \nwere joined in this belief by the TVA leadership itself--it was almost \nimpossible to change the decisionmaking momentum. I am disappointed. I \nremember that a little over a year ago we held a TVA caucus meeting \nwith the chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Mr. Craven \nCrowell. During this meeting Mr. Crowell met with Members of the House \nof Representatives and with Senators who live in the area and who care \nabout the Tennessee Valley. This meeting gave us the opportunity to \ncome together and share information and discuss issues of importance \nregarding how to make TVA work better. I asked if he had discussed with \nthe President of the United States, President Clinton, the zeroing out \nof funding for TVA's nonpower resources, and Mr. Crowell said yes. I \nsaid, ``Have you talked with the Office of Management and Budget?'' and \nMr. Crowell replied, ``Yes, I spend a lot of time with them.'' Then I \nasked, knowing that the Vice President is from Tennessee and had \npreviously been involved in TVA, ``Did you talk with the Vice President \nabout it,'' and Mr. Crowell said the Vice President ``knew about it.''\n  So, now we have it. More spin in the Capitol. The President and Vice \nPresident personally engaged in recommending the zeroing out of this \nbudget item 2 years ago and now they are coming forward to attack those \nwho carried out what they recommended. In fact, the budget the \nPresident submitted has zero dollars for nonpower in the Tennessee \nValley.\n  Whatever happens with this issue and what we will do about it, I \ndon't know. I continue to adhere to the belief that it is unfair to ask \nthe people who live there to fund the waterway maintenance and upkeep--\nthat is what we are talking about--when no other place in the country \ndoes it that way. The taxpayers, through the Corps of Engineers or \nother agencies, do that throughout the country.\n  It shocks my conscience and doesn't enhance my respect for the \ncredibility, integrity, and the honesty of the Vice President to have \nhim make the kind of comments I quoted earlier. In truth, had the \nPresident and Vice President not supported reducing this funding 2 \nyears ago, it would not be passing now. I think most people who keep up \nwith the details of this situation know what I am saying is true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/25/senate-section/article/S11004-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
