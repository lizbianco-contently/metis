Without objection, John Rood is \ngranted floor privileges during consideration of the pending debate of \nthe defense authorization bill, S. 2057.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will make some comments on the defense \nbill that we are considering.\n  This defense authorization bill, as reported by the Armed Services \nCommittee, contains essential elements to ensure that our military men \nand women and the equipment that we have are prepared to respond when \nand if needed for our national security. Funds are included in the bill \nthat continue to modernize the force and continue to improve the \nquality of life for our military personnel and families.\n  The bill remains within the limits of last year's budget agreement. \nIt cuts spending by about 1 percent in real terms from last year. The \ncommittee approved a budget of $270.6 billion in budget authority.\n  The bill represents a number of very difficult choices--choices that \nwe had to make when we proposed increases in funding for the programs \nthat the committee wanted to increase. For every dollar of increase, of \ncourse, we had to find funds elsewhere and, accordingly, there are some \ncuts in the budget that came from the administration. There are a few \nsignificant departures from funding levels in programs that were in the \nbudget last year. In my view, it is a more ``responsible'' budget than \nwe have had here on the Senate floor in several years with regard to \nour defense spending.\n  That said, the relative stability in the bill can be a good thing. It \ncan also prevent us from moving swiftly in important directions that \nrequire a timely response. I want to speak to some of those in a \nmoment.\n  At its best, the bill takes good care of the military personnel and \ntheir families. It contains a 3.1 percent pay raise, effective January \n1, and three health care demonstration projects for retired military \npersonnel, who are over 65, and for their families. These projects are \ndesigned to meet the concerns voiced by retirees who have served their \ncountry and seek equitable and quality health care services. There is a \nprovision to enhance cooperation between the Veterans' Administration \nand the Department of Defense in providing health care to dual-eligible \nbeneficiaries. There is a continuation of pilot and nuclear personnel \nbonuses and increased limits on certain bonuses to enhance recruitment \nand retention. There is increased funding for construction and upgrades \nof family housing. There are provisions to make it easier for military \nfamilies to move when they are required to move.\n  For my home State of New Mexico, the bill includes significant \nfunding for our military bases and our National Laboratories that will \nbenefit not only my State but the Nation. It includes funds for the \nHigh Energy Laser Test Facility and the Tactical High Energy Laser \nProgram at White Sands Missile Range. It includes funding for the high-\ntech research being conducted at Phillips Laboratory in Albuquerque. It \nincludes substantial funding for the defense programs at Los Alamos and \nSandia to support their work in the stockpile stewardship program, \nnonproliferation research and development, and nuclear security \nassistance programs. It includes funds for military construction \nprojects that we have been seeking--a new support facility for National \nGuard in Taos, NM, refurbishment of facilities and new family housing \nat Kirtland Air Force Base, a new war readiness facility at Holloman \nAir Force Base, and a badly needed runway repair project at Cannon Air \nForce Base.\n  Mr. President, for all the good things that this bill provides for \nour military personnel and to the facilities in my State and to the \nNation, there are still some aspects of the bill that I find troubling.\n  The bill continues to place relatively greater emphasis on programs \nthat address potential, rather than actual, long-term threats for which \nthere is no current deployment requirement. Increased spending in those \nareas has come at the expense of programs designed to meet near-term \nthreats which are actual and for which validated requirements exist.\n  For example, the bill contains $1.1 billion for strategic missile \ndefense programs, including national missile defense and space-based \nlaser programs; that is an increase of $100 million over the \nPresident's request. That $1.1 billion is compared to $675 million for \nprograms designed to reduce the threat of proliferation of nuclear, \nchemical, and biological weapons. The committee approved cuts in \nfunding to proliferation prevention programs at a time when India's \nactions, and now Pakistan's actions, remind us of the immediacy of such \nthreats.\n\n  Information provided to the committee indicates that the \nintercontinental ballistic missile threat for which the national \nmissile defense is intended is limited. The Intelligence people told \nour committee that such threats from rogue nations are not likely to \noccur for many years in the future.\n  The tradeoff seems clear to me. The committee prefers to allocate the \nlion's share of resources to meet a poorly defined threat that lies \nsomewhere in the distant future, rather than allocating resources to \nmeet the near-term, real world threat of proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Particularly, the bill does not fully fund programs intended to meet \nthe threat of proliferation of weapons grade fissile materials, highly \nenriched uranium, and plutonium. A small amount of any of these \nmaterials in knowledgeable hands could wreak havoc upon our cities.\n  It is extremely important that we continue to work cooperatively with \nRussia and with other former Soviet States to account for and secure \nformer Soviet nuclear weapons and related nuclear materials.\n  Despite the clear and present danger of that threat, the committee \nchose to reduce funding for the DOD's cooperative threat reduction \nprogram, also known as the Nunn-Lugar program, by $2 million after \nconsidering much deeper cuts.\n  The committee cut similar programs managed by the Department of \nEnergy by $20 million. Those programs are designed to improve the \nsecurity of Russian nuclear weapons and materials and to provide \nprotection against their theft, unauthorized use, or accidental misuse.\n  The Department of Energy's materials protection control and \naccounting program provides those security measures to a small portion \nof Russia's nuclear arsenal. With more funding, that program could \nprovide greater security against the threat of smuggling dangerous \nmaterials to terrorists or rogue nations.\n  Instead, if the bill is passed as it stands, funding for this \nprogram--an essential program for our Nation's security now and in the \nfuture--is going to be cut. Efforts to secure hundreds of tons of \nnuclear materials at 53 sites will be delayed.\n  Mr. President, I spoke of India and Pakistan a moment ago. I would \nlike to take a few more minutes to relate that problem to this defense \nbill. Shocking as India and Pakistan's nuclear tests have been, they \nshould serve as a wakeup call to this country and to the Senate. The \nproliferation clock ticks on, while the Senate defers debate and \nconsideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Other nonnuclear \nStates could be reconsidering their positions on nuclear weapons in \nlight of events in south Asia.\n  China, who is a signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, may \nnow choose not to ratify. The U.S.--the first to sign the treaty--\nshould have led the effort to implement a comprehensive testing ban \nbefore now. Perhaps our leadership in that area could\n\n[[Page S6737]]\n\nhave forestalled the tests in south Asia. Instead, the Senate has \nchosen not to step forward. Now we see ourselves more as a follower \nthan as a leader in this area.\n  One element that could support a leadership role in ratifying a \ncomprehensive test ban is an effective nuclear stockpile stewardship \nprogram. That program is an essential element for ensuring the safety \nand reliability of our nuclear weapons in the absence of testing. The \ndirectors of our National Laboratories at Livermore, Los Alamos, and \nSandia have testified about the effectiveness of that program in the \nabsence of nuclear testing. In spite of that testimony, this bill \nreduces funding by $145 million in prior year balances that, according \nto the DOE, no longer exist.\n  Without sufficient funding for the stockpile stewardship program, \nthis bill threatens the likelihood of ratifying the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty. Failure to ratify that treaty plays into the hands of the \nIndian and Pakistani Governments and could encourage other nonnuclear \nnations to follow their lead. The result will be a far more dangerous \nworld than the one we live in today.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that while many of my colleagues are \nfocused on the long-term future security issues, they may have their \nfocus in the wrong place. Funding for basic research and development \nand building, the building blocks for future technological advances, \ncontinues to receive low priority in this defense budget. It is not \nanticipated to increase for the foreseeable future under current \nDepartment of Defense plans.\n\n  My colleagues acknowledged when considering this bill that funding \nfor basic research and development has often been and remains a bill \npayer for other programs.\n  Efforts to identify this problem and establish long-term spending \ngoals for basic research were rejected during the deliberations in the \ncommittee on this bill.\n  I believe that the high-tech future so many of us in the Senate \nconsider an axiom of America's future security is unlikely to become a \nreality in the defense area unless we make the investment that is \nneeded in the future today.\n  In addition, funding for the Nation's test and evaluation facilities \nand their operations lags behind efforts to modernize our weapons.\n  I have seen this with personnel cuts, neglect of infrastructure, and \naging instrumentation at White Sands Missile Range in my State. These \ncuts reflect a low priority that has been given to the testing \nactivities across the Department of Defense in this budget.\n  These cuts suggest that even if our technical genius continues to \nprovide new technological opportunities, we may not be able to \nadequately evaluate whether they will actually work as intended.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about the inertia contained in this \nbill. I believe that in many ways it fails to meet our most immediate \nhigh priority security concerns. It may also fail to lay a sound \nscientific foundation for the long-term security needs of our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider these large issues as we consider \nthe bill this week. We have an opportunity to fix some of these \nproblems. I hope we are able to do so. I intend to have one or more \namendments to offer later in the week which will help us to accomplish \nthat.\n  Mr. President, let me yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum at this point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6735-7", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CORRECTION OF THE RECORD\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of corrections in \nthe Record of Friday, June 19.\n  In the middle column on page S. 6661, where I quote Tennyson, the \nRecord indicates that I quoted Tennyson as saying, ``I am a part of all \nthat I have met, and we are all a part of each other.''\n  Mr. President, only the first clause is an accurate quote by \nTennyson. The second clause was an editorial comment of my own. It \nshould not be included in Tennyson's quote. So I ask unanimous consent \nthat in the permanent Record Tennyson's quote as quoted by me read, ``I \nam a part of all that I have met,'' and take out the quotation mark at \nthe end of the sentence which appears in the Record in the middle \ncolumn.\n  The next correction I should like to make is in the same speech, the \nsame page, S. 6661, middle column. I am quoted as saying, ``The Bible \nsays, `see us now a man diligent in his business; he shall stand before \nkings.' ''\n  That is a misquote. I did not say, ``See us now.'' I said, ``Seest \nthou.'' ``Seest thou a man diligent in his business; he shall stand \nbefore kings.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that that correction be made in the permanent \nRecord. Sometimes in talking I sound like I have my mouth full of \nturnips, and I am sure it is hard for the Official Reporters to catch \nthe diction correctly. So I ask that those corrections be made.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, those of us who had the real privilege to \nbe in the Chamber during Friday had the benefit of an absolutely \nmagnificent set of remarks by our distinguished colleague, the senior \nSenator from West Virginia, the former majority leader of the Senate. I \nreflected over the course of the weekend on those remarks. I urge \nothers to take a look at the Record today which, with these minor \ncorrections, clearly sets forth those remarks. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6737-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6737-S6739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are in the process of resuming \nconsideration of S. 2057, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1999. On behalf of Chairman Thurmond and the distinguished \nranking member, I urge Senators who have amendments to the bill to \nbring their amendments to the floor. Last Friday, Chairman Thurmond, \ntogether with the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, \ncleared some 45 amendments to this important bill. The majority and \nminority staffs of the Committee on the Armed Forces will continue to \nwork today with others and Members to get further amendments cleared.\n  I remind Senators that a cloture vote on S. 2057 will occur tomorrow, \nat a time to be determined by the majority leader after consultation \nwith the Democrat leader. And if cloture is imposed, all nongermane \namendments which have not already been adopted will be terminated. \nTherefore, I urge Senators to come to the floor. The bill will be up \nuntil 3 o'clock today, according to the previous order. Hopefully, we \ncan conclude a profitable day towards further concluding this bill \nwhich must be concluded this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just clarify what my colleague \nfrom Virginia said. My understanding is that the present parliamentary \nsituation is that no amendments can be offered unless that is done with \nunanimous consent; is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We are urging people to come to the floor and try to \nobtain that unanimous consent. But those Senators who do have \namendments that have not been agreed to are not able to offer those \namendments at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in response to the observation of my \ndistinguished colleague, the situation is that there are pending \namendments, of course. I hope my colleague and I, and such others who \nare managing this bill throughout the day, can work out accommodations \nand perhaps get unanimous consent for other amendments so we can \nproceed. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S6738]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, since we do have a lull in the \nproceedings, I have filed two amendments that together would \nincorporate in this year's defense bill the key provisions of S. 2081, \nwhich is the National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act of \n1998. Consistent with the strong bipartisan support for defense \nresearch, I am very pleased to say that we have Senator Santorum, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Lott, Senator Frist, all as original \ncosponsors of this bill and also as sponsors of these complementary \namendments.\n  I will not, of course, try to get a vote on these at this point \nbecause it would require unanimous consent to do so, but I would like \nto just briefly describe what the amendments do so when the opportunity \ncomes to have a vote, people will be informed.\n  These amendments lay the fiscal framework for the defense research \nthat is needed to achieve, early in the next century, what the \nDepartment of Defense calls full spectrum dominance, that is the \nability of our Armed Forces to dominate potential adversaries across \nthe entire spectrum of military operations, from humanitarian \noperations through the highest intensity conflicted.\n  One of the two amendments sets goals that would result in the Defense \nScience and Technology Program budget reaching the equivalent of at \nleast $9 billion in today's dollars by the year 2008; that would be an \nincrease of 16 percent above today's level. The other amendment sets \nsimilar increased goals for the nonproliferation research at the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  It is worth focusing on why defense research is so important. Much of \nthe technology that gave the United States a quick victory with so very \nfew casualties in Desert Storm came out of defense-related research in \nthe 1960s and 1970s. Those kinds of results, plus the fact that our \nmilitary remains the most technologically sophisticated in the world, \nhave fostered a broad agreement that defense research is one of the \nbest investments that our country makes, one providing enormous long-\nterm returns to our military. Even with the cold war over, there are a \nnumber of reasons why now is the time to vigorously invest in defense \nresearch.\n\n  First, as the Department of Defense has noted, the two keys to this \nfull spectrum dominance, which is the cornerstone of our strategy as we \nmove forward--the two keys will be information superiority and, second, \ntechnological innovation.\n  The Department of Defense has been the preeminent Federal agency \nfunding the disciplines that undergird these two key enablers, for \nexample, supporting roughly 80 percent of the federally sponsored \nresearch in electrical engineering, 50 percent of that in computer \nscience and mathematics. No other organizations, public or private, can \nsubstitute for the unique role and focus of the Department of Defense \nin these research areas. We simply will not be able to achieve this so-\ncalled full spectrum dominance without a vigorous program of defense \nresearch.\n  A second important point is that the global spread of advanced \ntechnology and a nascent revolution in military affairs are creating \nnew threats to the United States which will challenge our ability to \nachieve full spectrum dominance. Those are threats requiring new \nresponses and requiring new technology. They include information \nwarfare; cheap, precise cruise missiles and the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Recent events in India and Pakistan, which I alluded to earlier, may \nhave concentrated our thinking on this last problem, this threat of the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction. In the words of the National \nDefense Panel, ``We must lead the coming technological revolution or be \nvulnerable to it.'' That said, right now we are in a relatively secure \ninterlude in our international relations. We are in a time where we can \nafford to work on transforming our military forces. While the world is \nstill a dangerous place, it will be even more dangerous in the future. \nSo now is the time for the defense research to be accomplished, which \nis needed to achieve this full spectrum dominance.\n  When you look, though, at DOD's current science and technology budget \nplans, they do not reflect these realities. The out-year budgets are \nbasically flat in real terms, out to the year 2003, at a level of \naround $200 million lower than the 1998 level. This is the money that \npays for the research and concept experimentation needed to invent and \ntry out new military capabilities. Worse yet, the budget of the \nDepartment of Energy for nonproliferation research is slated to decline \nby about 20 percent in real terms by the year 2003.\n  These budget plans are not consistent with the vision of full \nspectrum dominance. They are not consistent with the threats on the \nhorizon or with the opportunity that we have today. These two \namendments that I filed would promote budget plans that are consistent \nwith the vision, threats and opportunity. What they do is this: From \nfiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2008, the first amendment would give \nthe Secretary of Defense a goal--not a requirement, but a goal--to \nincrease the defense science and technology budget request by at least \n2 percent a year over inflation greater than the previous year's budget \nrequest. The other amendment gives the same 2 percent goal, 2 percent \nincreased goal to the Secretary of Energy for nonproliferation \nresearch.\n  The end result will be a defense science and technology budget that \nreaches at least $9 billion in today's dollars by 2008, an increase of \n$1.2 billion, or 16 percent over the 1998 level. The budget for \nnonproliferation research would increase it around 23 percent over \ntoday's level.\n  These budget increases are significant for research, yet they are \nmodest and achievable when you look at our overall defense budget. If \nyou look at a graph of the projected Science and Technology Program \nbudget under this agreement, you can see that the increases will be, \nNo. 1, gradual; that is, the total increase by 2008 will be less than \nsome year-to-year changes in the past. Also, the increase will be \nsmooth in that they will not be a huge change from the Defense \nDepartment's current plans at the start. They will also be reasonable; \nthe $9 billion endpoint is comparable with previous levels of science \nafter technology funding.\n  Achieving these increases will require some shifting the funds within \nthe DOD budget. The total amount shifted will be only around half a \npercent of the total DOD budget over 10 years.\n  I am extremely confident the Secretary of Defense will be able to \nmake this kind of gradual shift without damaging other priorities. I am \nalso quite sure that this is a priority need for our country.\n  Technological supremacy has been a keystone of our security strategy \nsince World War II. Supporting that supremacy has been this defense \nresearch. The coming decade is the time to start increasing the \ninvestment in our national security. These amendments are a modest \nbipartisan, sensible and achievable approach to make that investment. I \nam sure that these modest increases will yield substantial returns to \nour military.\n  I hope that when we get an opportunity to vote on these amendments \nthat my colleagues will join me and Senators Santorum, Lieberman, Lott \nand Frist in supporting both of these important amendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to address the ongoing debate in \nthe Senate connected to the pending business, I believe, regarding \nUnited States relations with the People's Republic of China.\n  As the Senate considers the Department of Defense authorization bill, \nS. 2057, a number of my colleagues and I have been working to try to \nfind a vehicle, or vehicles, through which to present amendments to \nthis bill, intended to put United States-China relations on the path \ntoward what we consider to be meaningful engagement. Many of our \namendments have already been filed. Two of these, one to combat slave \nlabor in China and the other to monitor People's Liberation Army \ncompanies operating in the United\n\n[[Page S6739]]\n\nStates, were adopted by voice vote last month. This shows, I believe, \nthe substantial support among Senators for measures upholding \nprinciples of freedom and human rights and measures protecting the \nnational security interests of the United States.\n  Today I would like to clarify the intents of the remaining amendments \nand the context in which we hope to offer them. Put simply, I and my \ncolleagues seek meaningful engagement with the Chinese Government, \nconsistent with our moral principles and with our national security \ninterests. On this, I believe, all Americans are agreed. Unfortunately, \nthis administration's policies towards China have, in my opinion, \nfailed to produce that kind of relationship. For that reason, I believe \namendments intended to promote meaningful engagement are necessary.\n  Some people have charged that any attempt to go beyond current \npolicies of what I consider to be hollow engagement with China will \nnecessarily lead to isolationism. I disagree. I believe a more reasoned \napproach lies between the extremes of appeasement on the one hand and \nisolationism on the other. The problem with current discussions \nregarding United States-China relations, in my view, is best \nillustrated by debates over most-favored-nation trading status. Until \nrecently, debates over our relations with China have focused almost \nentirely and exclusively on whether we should extend or revoke China's \nMFN status.\n  It is time, in my view, to move the discussion out of the MFN box and \nto find common means to achieve common American goals. Revoking MFN \nwould punish Americans with higher prices without significantly \naffecting the Chinese Government and its policies, and it would also \npunish innocent Chinese citizens by withdrawing economic opportunities \nprovided by United States trade and investment. Even in the short term, \nin my view, we should not underestimate trade and investment's positive \nimpact. ``Already,'' writes China expert Stephen J. Yates of the \nHeritage Foundation, Chinese ``employees at U.S. firms earn higher \nwages and are free to choose where to live, what to eat, and how to \neducate and care for their children.''\n  It is my belief that MFN, by itself, is a necessary element of any \nmeaningful engagement between the United States and China. However, MFN \nalone is not sufficient to bring the changes so sorely needed in China \nor to protect the principles and interests of the United States. \nUnfortunately, the Clinton administration has not pursued the policies \nnecessary to make meaningful engagement possible.\n  The administration has claimed that our current relationship with the \nPeople's Republic of China has improved through a process of \nconstructive engagement. On this view, the Chinese Government has \nimproved its behavior in a number of areas out of a desire to maintain \ngood relations with the United States. Specific examples have been \ncited, including the release of a small number of dissidents, movement \ntoward protection of intellectual property, and China's alleged \nsteadiness during the continuing Asian financial crisis.\n\n  I understand my colleagues' continuing hopes that these events might \nlead to better relations in the future between the United States and \nChina. However, in my view, these hopes must be tempered by a realistic \nassessment of current Chinese Government practices and behavior. We all \nwant the United States to be able to engage in an open and frank \nrelationship with the Chinese Government, one in which each side can \npresent its views on a broad range of issues, confident that the other \nside will promptly respond to their concerns and live up to \ninternational standards of human rights and mutual security.\n  Unfortunately, our relationship with China has yet to reach that \nstage of mutual trust and responsibility. In particular, a clear-eyed \nview of China's human rights record shows that the hollow engagement \nthat has characterized America's role in its relations with China in \nrecent years has not led to substantive reform. Although the \ninternational community roundly condemned the Chinese Government's \ncrushing of prodemocracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square along with \nthe killing of thousands of student protesters and the imprisonment of \nmany more, Chinese officials continue to claim their actions were \njustified. They continue to insist that their violent actions were a \nvalid response to a counterrevolutionary riot.\n  Indeed, Chinese officials now want to place our President at the \nscene of this crime as a sign of their righteousness. Likewise, even as \nthe administration continues to claim a new era of Chinese \nnonproliferation resulting from the recent summit, fresh reports have \narisen of Chinese assistance to Iranian missile programs and the \nChinese decision to abandon previous assurances to observe the Missile \nTechnology Regime's export control standards.\n  Finally, it is important to recognize that definitive investigations \nare underway regarding the administration's export control policy \ntoward China and its effect on national security. But it is also \nimportant to note that the administration has uniformly waived any \nsanctions for even the most egregious of Chinese actions harming our \nnational security interests.\n  The bottom line is that we currently lack the tools with which to \npursue meaningful engagement with China. Current policies of hollow \nengagement allow Chinese leaders to believe that the United States will \noverlook almost any action on their part simply in order to keep them \nhappy. This provides China's leaders with little incentive to change \ntheir behavior or beliefs to bring them more closely into alignment \nwith international standards.\n  The result is that our Government now constantly finds itself \nreacting to China's actions in an incoherent, ad hoc fashion. This has \nproduced an unfortunate and increasing abandonment of the principles of \nfreedom and defense of fundamental human rights on which our Nation is \nbased, as well as a failure to fully protect the national security \ninterests of the United States. The United States must, in my view, \nenunciate a clear and compelling policy disapproving Chinese violations \nof human rights and international conventions regarding national \nsecurity. This requires, at a minimum, that we recognize that China's \ncurrent leadership neither accepts nor acts upon the principle of \nfriendship in international or domestic relations.\n  Mr. President, I think this is an important debate. I think it is a \ndebate that we need to have here in the Senate. I regret that the \ncurrent procedural roadblocks that seem to exist will make it very \ndifficult for us to fully act through the amendments that many of us \nwould like to bring up and prevent us from having the kind of full and \nclear discussion in this debate that I think the Senate should make \nhappen. Consequently, I find myself a bit frustrated today. I would \nlike to applaud the Senator from Arkansas for the ongoing efforts he \nhas engaged in to try to bring these issues to the floor of the Senate, \nto try to make it possible for us to have the kind of debate that I \nthink many of us wish would occur.\n  I hope that his efforts with many of us working together can be \nultimately successful. If it cannot happen in the context of the \ncurrent bill, then I think a group of us will find other vehicles \ncoming to the floor of the Senate on which it can be possible for us to \nhave this debate. But whether it happens now or happens later, I think \nthe message to the administration should be clear and to the American \npeople it should be clear: We are deeply concerned about the human \nrights policies of China. We are deeply concerned about the \nimplications of their policies on American national security, and we in \nthe U.S. Senate are not going to sit idly by and allow these policies \nto continue without ultimately having the kind of full and detailed \ndebate, discussion and action that they require.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for about 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, it is with a sadness and real heavy heart \nthat I report to the Senate that the former chief counsel of the \nAppropriations Committee passed away this morning at 7 a.m. at NIH. \nAlbert McDermott was a longtime friend. He and I met during the \nEisenhower administration when he was the Assistant Secretary of Labor \nand I was Assistant Secretary of the Interior.\n  After having been with the Hotel-Motel Association for some 25 years, \nI convinced him to join the staff of the Rules Committee when I became \nthe ranking member of that committee. He came on board, as I recall, in \nabout 1991. He was a graduate of Georgetown Law School, a distinguished \nnaval officer in World War II who was in charge of an LCT, landing \ncraft tank, that hit Normandy beach several times, I believe.\n  He became the chief of staff of the Rules Committee when I became \nchairman, and then moved to the Governmental Affairs Committee and was \nchief of staff there. When I became chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I asked him to take on the job of counsel for the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  He retired from that position late last year. He was a grand friend, \nand I shall miss him very much. He was my best man when Catherine and I \nwere married and I was his best man when he married at the age of 70.\n  He has left behind his beloved wife, and she was a longtime friend. \nKrieks is a great friend now of my wife Catherine. She was also very \nclose to my first wife, Ann.\n  I announce to the Senate that there will be a visitation at Gawler's \nFuneral Home on Wisconsin Avenue from 7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on \nThursday and a memorial service at 10 a.m. at the Annunciation Church \non Massachusetts Avenue in Northwest.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hutchinson, I modify \nthe pending amendment with the additional text now at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n                               TITLE ____\n\n     SEC. ____. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Forced Abortion \n     Condemnation Act''.\n\n     SEC. ____. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n\n     SEC. ____. DENIAL OF ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES OF PERSONS \n                   IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ENGAGED IN \n                   ENFORCEMENT OF FORCED ABORTION POLICY.\n\n       The Secretary of State may not issue any visa to, and the \n     Attorney General may not admit to the United States, any \n     national of the People's Republic of China, including any \n     official of the Communist Party or the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China and its regional, local, and \n     village authorities (except the head of state, the head of \n     government, and cabinet level ministers) who the Secretary \n     finds, based on credible information, has been involved in \n     the establishment or enforcement of population control \n     policies resulting in a woman being forced to undergo an \n     abortion against her free choice, or resulting in a man or \n     woman being forced to undergo sterilization against his or \n     her free choice.\n\n     SEC. ____. WAIVER.\n\n       The President may waive the requirement contained in \n     section ____ with respect to a national of the People's \n     Republic of China if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is in the national interest of the \n     United States to do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to Congress containing a \n     justification for the waiver.\n       This title may be cited as the ``Communist China Subsidy \n     Reduction Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. ____. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the People's Republic of China has enjoyed ready access \n     to international capital through commercial loans, direct \n     investment, sales of securities, bond sales, and foreign aid;\n       (2) regarding international commercial lending, the \n     People's Republic of China had $48,000,000,000 in loans \n     outstanding from private creditors in 1995;\n       (3) regarding international direct investment, \n     international direct investment in the People's Republic of \n     China from 1993 through 1995 totaled $97,151,000,000, and in \n     1996 alone totaled $47,000,000,000;\n       (4) regarding investment in Chinese securities, the \n     aggregate value of outstanding Chinese securities currently \n     held by Chinese nationals and foreign persons is \n     $175,000,000,000, and from 1993 through 1995 foreign persons \n     invested $10,540,000,000 in Chinese stocks;\n       (5) regarding investment in Chinese bonds, entities \n     controlled by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China have issued 75 bonds since 1988, including 36 dollar-\n     denominated bond offerings valued at more than \n     $6,700,000,000, and the total value of long-term Chinese \n     bonds outstanding as of January 1, 1996, was $11,709,000,000;\n       (6) regarding international assistance, the People's \n     Republic of China received almost $1,000,000,000 in foreign \n     aid grants and an additional $1,566,000,000 in technical \n     assistance grants from 1993 through 1995, and in 1995 \n     received $5,540,000,000 in bilateral assistance loans, \n     including concessional aid, export credits, and related \n     assistance; and\n       (7) regarding international financial institutions--\n       (A) despite the People's Republic of China's access to \n     international capital and world financial markets, \n     international financial institutions have annually provided \n     it with more than $4,000,000,000 in loans in recent years, \n     amounting to almost a third of the loan commitments of the \n     Asian Development Bank and 17.1 percent of the loan approvals \n     by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n     in 1995; and\n       (B) the People's Republic of China borrows more from the \n     International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the \n     Asian Development Bank than any other country, and loan \n     commitments from those institutions to the People's Republic \n     of China quadrupled from $1,100,000,000 in 1985 to \n     $4,300,000,000 by 1995.\n\n[[Page S6741]]\n\n     SEC. ____.

In addition, other votes could occur prior to the \nscheduled weekly recess for our party conferences, which begins at \n12:30 p.m. on Tuesday. I thank all colleagues for their attention to \nthis matter.\n  Mr. President, I hope that while we only have another 50 minutes on \nthe bill prior to business, according to the pending order, that there \nwill be statements and other matters relating to this bill so that we \ncan make as productive use of the time as possible. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Virginia for \nthe statement he has made. I know all Members of the Senate will be on \nnotice accordingly.\n  I take this moment to speak generally to the amendment that is before \nthe Senate regarding China policy and the overall question before the \ncountry about China policy, as President Clinton prepares to leave for \nChina later this week.\n\n[[Page S6743]]\n\n  Mr. President, this debate is nothing new. Nonetheless, it takes on a \nspecial meaning and intensity, because it happens in the week in which \nthe President will go to China. I understand the Senator from Arkansas, \nwho is the proponent of most of the amendments, has stated over and \nover again that it was not his intention that these amendments be \nbrought up in the week in which the President was going to China, and I \nknow that is absolutely the fact. These amendments were filed earlier. \nHe had discussed them earlier. It just happens that here we are on this \nbill, and they are coming up.\n  I hope that we will proceed, may I say, with an appropriate sense of \nrespect for the mission that the President will carry out on all our \nbehalf, because, though we may have different sides of this American \npolicy towards China that we speak to on the floor, I know that we all \nhope and pray that the President's trip will be successful, in the \nsense that it will not only strengthen our bilateral relationship with \nChina, but will do so based on honest exchange and principle, including \nthe very principles that are the subject of some of the amendments that \nare before us, most particularly human rights, proliferation, which is \nto say security, and trade policy, and the others as well.\n  Mr. President, this question of our relationship with China is, in \nsome ways, the most difficult, complicated and yet the most important \nof our foreign and defense policies because of the size of China, the \nenormous changes that are occurring in China, and the significant role \nthat China will play in the next century as a true military, economic \nsuperpower. The question of our policy is often described as a choice \nbetween engagement or nonengagement, which is to say engagement, on the \none hand, or isolation and containment on the other.\n  Well, I favor engagement. I think that the truth is when you come \ndown to it, there are very few people here that I have heard in the \nSenate who really want to isolate China, or that is the stated \nintention of their policy. The question then becomes, I believe, not \nwhether or not to engage; China is too big for us not to engage with; \nwe are too sensible for us to try to isolate or contain this great \ncountry with such a long and proud history. The question then becomes, \nHow do we engage? And do we engage in a way that works together in an \nhonest, principled fashion to not only improve our relations--military, \neconomic, ideological, philosophical--but to improve the lot, the \nplight, the lives of people in China consistent with our own \nprinciples.\n  My fear is that some of the amendments that are offered here on this \nbill, and some of the statements of intention that have been made \nregarding American policy toward China, while they may want a form of \nengagement or they may acknowledge the inevitability of engagement with \nChina, they do so in a way that is confrontational, in some sense is \npunitive, perhaps without justification for all the punitive qualities, \nand in the end will put us in a course of conflict with China which \nmany of us feel is not necessary. That, I think, is the issue drawn by \nthese amendments. Yes, engagement, but what kind of engagement will it \nbe?\n  On the other side there is an engagement that would be so devoid of \nhonesty and principle that it would sacrifice America's national \ninterests and our traditional values, human rights being at the top of \nthem, which is to say it would be engagement for the sake of \nengagement, to yield, if you will, to the People's Republic of China in \nany point of conflict between us. That is as unacceptable as the policy \non the other side of isolation and attempted containment.\n  I think we have to see if we can work together here to find a common \nground on which we engage honestly and consistent with our principles \nand interests, which is to say we have an interest--military, economic, \nphilosophical--in engaging China in the world community, in building \npeaceful relationships and prosperous relationships with her, but that \nengagement must be honest in the sense that we do not conceal our \ndifferences, and principled in the sense that we do not yield on the \nprinciples that make us uniquely American.\n  I hope out of the kind of debate that--though it is awkward to have \nit the week that the President is going to China--but I hope that out \nof the debate that is occurring here on these amendments, and the \ndebate that I am sure will follow on MFN as the days and weeks go by, \nthat we will be able to find a common ground.\n  It is not surprising that this debate is occurring. China is not only \na big country and an important country, but it is a country with a \ndifferent culture and history from ours. It is a country that lived \nunder a remarkably rigid, ideological, Communist dictatorship for a \nlong period of time that has seen outbursts, spasmodic alterations in \nthe political status quo, and it is different from us. So these \ndifferences about how to engage China, what to expect of China, are not \nsurprising. And we express those in the debate that is occurring on \nthis bill.\n\n  My own strong support for the policy of engagement--honest, \nprincipled, direct engagement; one that I think is in our national \ninterest--is premised on a conclusion which is that that policy of \nengagement, begun 26 years ago by President Nixon, followed by every \nPresident since of both political parties, has worked. We have had \ntough times, crises in the relationship--cultural revolution two \ndecades ago; and very fresh, still stinging for us, the tragedy on \nTiananmen Square a little less than a decade ago.\n  But overall, if you look at the changes, the revolutionary changes \nwithin this country, China, I believe the facts indicate that the \npolicy of engagement has produced a China today that is significantly \ndifferent than the China of two decades ago of the cultural revolution, \nand one decade ago of the Tiananmen Square tragedy--an atrocity--that \nit is a country today that is moving in exactly the direction we would \nwant it to, remarkably toward a market economy--and I will speak in a \nmoment more to that--and also more in the direction of human rights \nthan before, though, God knows, not enough.\n  But remember, again, we are dealing with a culture and a country very \ndifferent from ours, a culture and a country during communism and \nbefore so large that it lived with the constant fear of the leadership, \nof the disintegration of this enormous national entity, a country in \nwhich leaders have traditionally portrayed themselves as riding on the \nback of a tiger. But the changes have most assuredly occurred.\n  It has been fascinating in the last month or so just to pay a little \nbit of extra attention to the newspaper reports from China, not so much \nthe political reports, but what might be called feature stories in the \npress. And they showed a China that is dramatically different, much \nmore like us than it was before.\n  There was a story a while back in one of the papers about the fact \nthat half of the villages in China have held elections. It was a \nconcerted effort by the leadership--not unlimited; that is for sure--\nbut a concerted effort by the leadership of China to introduce some \nform of participatory electoral system in half of the villages in \nChina, almost 500,000 villages.\n  There was another story about a professor at a university in Beijing, \na brilliant man, from the article, who had an idea for a new \ntechnology; this kind of thing that happens around America, \nparticularly in places like Silicon Valley. It did not happen in \nCommunist China. But he found his way to some capital, started a \ncompany, and is doing brilliantly. He is excited about his stock \noptions. Wow. That is not one of Mao's--I do not remember stock options \nbeing in Mao's little red book.\n  There was a different kind of story about a change in the use of the \nmedia. Remember, under Mao the television or the propaganda instruments \nonly had one--it was all straight ahead. It was all: ``Support Mao. \nSupport the State.'' There was a story about a gentleman who is \nproducing the most popular sitcom on television in China. He had been, \nI am proud to say, in my own State of Connecticut, in Waterford at the \nEugene O'Neill Theater for a period of months studying and saw ``The \nCosby Show'' and was inspired by it. I take some license here, but he \nwent back and created the Chinese version of ``Cosby,'' the most \npopular show in China at this point.\n  There was an announcement of the sale of 3 million state-owned \nresidences\n\n[[Page S6744]]\n\nto people, to citizens of China, property ownership fundamental to our \nview of the world, not theirs; tens of thousands of State-owned \nenterprises about to be privatized or closed down because they are \ninefficient.\n\n  Under the leadership I would describe as revolutionary, of the new \nPremier, Zhu Rongji, one of the ways in which the Communist State \ncontrols the lives and political behavior of all of its citizens is by \nemploying all of its citizens. Once you take these tens of thousands, \nhundreds of thousands, of State-owned enterprises, privatize them, and \npeople are not working for the State any more but working for private \nowners, you have the conditions for a whole new expression and \nexperience of freedom--remarkable, remarkable changes.\n  Let me talk about religion, because it is of real interest to me. I \nworked with colleagues and cosponsored one of the two bills before this \nbody that try to put religious freedom and protection from religious \npersecution and discrimination at the center of our foreign policy and \nimpose penalties on countries or at least alter our relationship with \ncountries that don't respect the bedrock American principle of freedom \nof religion.\n  Last March, Senator Mack, a colleague and dear friend from Florida, \nand I went to China. It happened to be Holy Week, the week before \nEaster. Senator Mack went to mass each day. The churches were more or \nless full.\n  Let me read from a New York Times article of just less than a week \nago, June 17, so you can get a flavor of the changes that are \noccurring, and yet the enormous changes that have not yet occurred that \nwe need to have occurring. I will read briefly from the New York Times \nof June 17, an article by Eric Eckholm, from Nanjing. The article \nbegins with a report that:\n\n       New Bibles stream forth from a computerized printing press \n     in this onetime southern capital at a rate of two and a half \n     million a year for sale to Christians all over China. [Bibles \n     in Chinese, of course.]\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Critics in the West point to the restrictions and \n     repression as evidence of systematic persecution, while the \n     Government's defenders here point, instead, to the relative \n     freedom most Christians now enjoy.\n       Paradoxically, the rising outcry abroad comes as \n     Christianity in China, especially evangelical Protestantism, \n     is growing explosively. The Rev. Don Argue [many of us are \n     privileged to know in this Chamber], recent president of the \n     National Association of Evangelicals in the United States, \n     says China may be experiencing ``the single greatest Revival \n     in the history of Christianity.''\n       Much of that growth has occurred with official \n     acquiescence, and though they remain a small minority in a \n     giant country, millions of Chinese people like Zhang Linmei, \n     a 32-year-old worshiper at St. Paul's [in Nanjing], find the \n     same comfort in religion that Christians do anywhere, without \n     worrying much about politics.\n       ``I feel life is meaningless in society at large,'' Zhang \n     said after services as she picked up her 5-year-old daughter, \n     dressed in her finest, from Sunday school.\n       ``This is the only reliable place in my life,'' Zhang \n     added.\n       ``The situation for religion is in many ways the best it's \n     been since 1949,'' [the year of the Communist revolution] \n     said Richard Madsen, an expert on Chinese religion at the \n     University of California at San Diego. Though the \n     Government still controls their growth and closely \n     monitors their activities, he said, the official churches \n     enjoy more autonomy [today] than [ever] in the past.\n       Even the illegal churches--[of course, here we get to the \n     problem] unregistered Protestant churches and openly pro-\n     Vatican Catholic groups--function without serious trouble in \n     many places, Dr. Madsen and others say. But those who refuse \n     to pledge support to the Government and its apparatus of \n     religious control, and those with unorthodox or ecstatic \n     styles of worship, can face harsh repression. The situation \n     is similar for other major religions here, including \n     Buddhists and Muslims. Many believers now enjoy relative \n     freedom, but Tibetan Buddhists who consider the Dalai Lama \n     their leader face repression.\n\n  Finally, a few more paragraphs which I think express the explosion in \nbelief and freedom to believe, and yet the repression that still exists \nfor those who trouble and offend particularly provincial \nadministrators, administrators of the various Chinese provinces, or \ntouch a vulnerable cord in the Chinese experience, which is the fear of \na loyalty to a force outside of China and beyond the Government.\n  I read again from the New York Times article of June 17 last week:\n\n       Officials say Catholics now number four million, while \n     outside researchers say the true total may be closer to 10 \n     million, with many secretly accepting the Pope as the true \n     head of their church.\n       The peculiar hybrid state of Christianity here reflects the \n     obsession of the Communist party with control: virtually any \n     organization, whether political or social or religious, must \n     gain party approval.\n       The party is an officially atheist organization that \n     asserts that religion will eventually wither away. But in a \n     policy spelled out in the early 1980's, the Government \n     officially guarantees freedom of religion--within prescribed \n     boundaries including a required allegiance to the state, \n     adherence to certain styles of worship and limits on church \n     construction, evangelizing and the baptism of children, among \n     other rules.\n\n  Of course, those are all unacceptable to us.\n\n       For those willing to accommodate, the 1990's seem a golden \n     time.\n       ``From our perspective, now is the best time ever for \n     implementing the policy of religious freedom,'' said Han \n     Wenzao, who as president of the China Christian Council is \n     the national leader of the official Protestant church and a \n     prime link to the Communist Government. ``The criterion \n     should be, is the word of God being propagated or not? [And \n     Mr. Han Wenzao says] It is and it's good.''\n\n  Well, that is a rational report, sobering and disappointing in the \ncontinuation of official sanctions, repression, anxiety about religion; \nand yet, clearly, the momentum is all in favor of faith. That, too, \nrepresents a maturing, a changing and development within the mind and \noutlook of the leadership of China. I think it is at least in part a \nreaction to the centrality that we have placed on religious freedom, \nabsent persecution, in our relations with the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  So, I hope we will pass one of these bills that set up a system in \nour Government to rank and report on the state of religious freedom in \nall the countries of the world. Of course, I don't favor a specific \naction regarding the People's Republic of China, because that tends to \nscapegoat them and it tends to create a confrontation between us \nseparately that is not necessary. They ought to be part of the overall \npolicy that I hope this Senate will adopt, that Congress will adopt, \nbefore this session ends and, most particularly, to the events of this \nweek.\n  I hope and believe that when the President meets with Jiang Zemin, \nwhen he speaks with the people of China publicly, he will raise this \nquestion of religious persecution in a way that he couldn't do if he \nwere not engaged and wouldn't do if we were not honestly and \nprincipally engaged; he will speak directly to why it is so important \nto us in America that countries with which we have normal, bilateral \nrelations respect the right of their citizens to worship God as they \nchoose. That was the initial, primal motivation for those who founded \nthis country. It is right there in the first or second paragraph--first \nsubstantive paragraph of the Declaration of Independence, in the first \namendment to our Constitution, the beginning of the Bill of Rights. It \nis what we are about. If we are not directly and principally engaged \nwith that, if our President of the United States does not go to China, \nthe kind of progress that I have described in which I say the glass is \ncertainly half full and getting fuller, the opportunities for that will \nbe lost.\n  I want to say just a word more about national security, because these \namendments, after all, are attached to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, S. 2057.\n  In a literal sense, a parliamentary sense, it seems to me personally \nthat these amendments are not germane. That is a matter of \nparliamentary conclusion, which I will leave to others. But I want to \nsay that the question of our relations with the People's Republic of \nChina, the question of how we engage and whether we engage with the \nPeople's Republic of China is at the center of our national security \npolicy, of our defense policy today and, even more so, in the next \ncentury.\n  We have many important security relationships in the world, beginning \nwith our allies in Europe, and in Japan. Our ability to manage our \nrelationship with the People's Republic of China will, in my opinion, \nas much as any other relation we have, determine whether or not we will \nlive in a world that remains secure in our time, but whether our \nchildren, and whether the pages here, as they grow to be adults, will \nlive in a world that is secure. That is the destiny of China--with 1.2 \nbillion people who are building a military, it is strategically \nlocated, an enormous country.\n  Look at the situations in the world which worry us now--most \nrecently,\n\n[[Page S6745]]\n\nthe explosions of atomic weapons by India and Pakistan on the Asian \nsubcontinent. Our ability to work with them, as we have been doing \nsince those explosions, greatly strengthens our capacity to limit the \npossibility that the conflict on the subcontinent will break into a \nworse conflict, and a nightmare would be a nuclear war.\n  Consider where we would be today in implementing the policy on the \nAsian subcontinent if we were not engaged with China, if we could not \nwork with the permanent five members of the Security Council and with \nChina on a problem such as that. Take the Korean peninsula. We have in \nexcess of 30,000 American soldiers there. It is probably the most \nheavily armed border in the world. Our ability to keep the peace there \nand, in fact, to begin to move beyond, in the absence of conflict, to \nbetter relations between the parties there is very important to us. It \nis materially helped by our engagement with China--our ability to work \nwith the two Koreas, China, and the United States to try to create more \nstability and ultimately, perhaps, a reunification of the two parts of \nKorea.\n  Take our interest in the Persian Gulf, in the Middle East--an \ninterest so clearly vital to our national security that we sent a half \nmillion troops there about 7 years ago in the Persian Gulf war. China \nand United States will begin to have shared interests--and perhaps even \nif we are not engaged, a shared competition, as China grows \neconomically--for the energy resources in the Persian Gulf area, for \nthe oil. We have to have a good relationship with China to be able to \nmanage that competition for energy in a way that doesn't break into \nconflict.\n  More immediately, the Middle East, Persian Gulf--always a tinderbox \nin our time--we deeply fear the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, of ballistic missiles, particularly in Iran. My sense is \nthat the engagement with China has assisted us materially in cutting \ndown the flow of component parts to the Iranians for the development of \nnuclear weapons, which is not so with missile proliferation, as far as \nI can tell. I hope and trust that the President will discuss that \ndirectly with the leadership of China in the summit that is to come \nlater this week.\n  But, again, an engagement with China offers us the prospect, in \nreturn for what China seeks in our bilateral relationship, including \nnot only economic gain but recognition, stature, involvement in world \norganizations--in return for that, hopefully, we will be in a position \nto convince the leadership in China to cut back on any of the component \nparts of ballistic missiles, which they are selling to Iran, or any \nother countries that threaten our security, because that is part of \nwhat it means to be engaged.\n\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, in this regard--and I know there are \nsome amendments that maybe have been put forth that deal with \nproliferation--this Chamber, a short while ago, passed the Iran Missile \nSanctions Act, also passed by the House, on its way to the President. \nThe concern expressed about that bill had mostly to do with its impact \non Russia as a major supply of component parts for missile construction \nin Iran. But Russia is not mentioned in that bill. That is a generic \nbill. That is the way we ought to deal with problems like \nproliferation--not to single out the Chinese, but, you know, the PRC, \nPeople's Republic of China, will be affected by that legislation, and \nentities within it will be deprived of doing business with the United \nStates if there is evidence that they are contributing to the ballistic \nmissile capacity of the Iranians. We would not have those opportunities \nif we were not engaged honestly and in a principled way.\n  So I draw the conclusion that though these amendments may, in one \nsense, parliamentary, be ill placed on this bill, that they touch a \nlarger issue. It is the right issue and the right point, which is that \nour ability to manage our relations with China in our time, and \nparticularly as we head into the next century, will substantially \naffect the national security of the United States.\n  Let us say we stopped engaging and we attempted to isolate or contain \nChina. Think of the turmoil that would cause to our allies in Taiwan, \nour great, dear friends and allies in Taiwan. Think about the prospect \nof an independent--disengaged from the United States--People's Republic \nof China, growing stronger in the next century. Could our allies in \nthat region--even our best ally, Japan--maintain as close a \nrelationship with us when China was an emerging strength and was \nhostile to the United States because we attempted to contain them? I \nthink not.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we can find a more constructive course to \ngo forward with than being unnecessarily punitive about everything that \nhappens in the People's Republic of China that doesn't please us. A lot \nwill happen there that doesn't please us. But it is in our overriding \nnational interest, militarily, economically, and ideologically, to \ncontinue to be engaged in an honest and direct way.\n  In my opinion, there is ultimately no choice. And I hope we can find \nways--short of some of the amendments that have been put onto this \nbill--to reason together and come up with common approaches because, as \nI said at the outset, as much as I support engagement, engagement \ncannot allow us to become spineless. I don't think it has been in our \ntime. Since President Nixon, and since Tiananmen, and President Bush, \nand on into President Clinton, I think we have been strong and \ndemanding. It is an appropriate role for Congress to continue to work \nwith the administration to make sure that is the case.\n  Finally, I will offer for the review of my colleagues, at some point, \na bill I was privileged to introduce last fall, in October, with three \ncolleagues, which constituted two Republicans and two Democrats, \nincluding myself; Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska; Chuck Hagel of \nNebraska, and Frank Murkowski. I believe it is Senate bill 1303. It is \nan attempt to create a legislative expression of support for a policy \nof honest, direct, tough principled engagement with China, that is in \nour interest, and to create some bilateral entities, commissions, and \nworking groups to work through in a demanding way--and some of them \nincluding Members of Congress --these points of conflict that we have \nwith China to see if we cannot build on them instead of striking down \nand undercutting the relationship as a result of those areas in which \nwe disagree.\n\n  I hope at some point to be able to bring this bill to the floor and \nto either in whole or in part as an amendment ask my colleagues to \nconsider it as an expression of a policy, but also as evidence of a \nparticular way to express that policy to establish a United States-\nChina trade and investment commission, to establish a bilateral energy \ncommittee, to establish a bilateral food committee, to establish a U.S. \nhuman rights commission to not only create a bilateral dialog on human \nrights, but for us to have an opportunity directly to speak to the \nChinese about how important it is to us, but also to create an \nopportunity to review the Chinese, province by province, in these areas \nof concern to us--human rights, proliferation, trade, environment--and \nto use a carrot instead of a stick, and to offer to those provinces \nthat measure up closer to our standards and ideals: OPIC insurance \nfinancing backing, clear access to Eximbank financing that is not \navailable now but only through a Presidential waiver to move \nconstructively, honestly, forward; an understanding that both peoples \nand both countries have to gain from this involvement, and particularly \nunderstanding that the people of China for whose freedom we work and \npray and from whose increasing freedom we take great joy.\n  They are the ones that I think will ultimately suffer as much as we \nwill from a policy of isolation and containment, and will gain from a \npolicy of direct and principled engagement.\n  I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to speak.\n  It would be my intention on the motion to table that the Senator from \nVirginia has said he will put in tomorrow to vote to table, because \nwhile I think this has been a constructive debate, I don't think this \nis the week to be taking action in the way that some of these \namendments would, and I don't favor most of the amendments as \nexpressing the kind of policy of engagement that I think is so much in \nour American national interests.\n  I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S6746]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that current \nbusiness be set aside for the purpose of immediate consideration of my \namendment No. 2405.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with respect, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I had the intention, and still have the \nintention at some later time, of reintroducing the amendment that is at \nthe desk.\n  What it effectively does is address the potential problem and \ninfluence that a company called COSCO, the Chinese Ocean Shipping \nCompany, will have on the United States.\n  Mr. President, the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company is Communist \nChina's largest shipping group. It has more than doubled the number of \nships that our entire U.S. Navy has. This group has been given \npreferential treatment by this country and other countries for some \nperiod of time. It wasn't long ago that they were given the opportunity \nto have ports at both ends of the Panama Canal, the Ports of Colon and \nCristobal, and our country was supportive of that.\n  This 25-year lease gives them an abundance of control in the Panama \nCanal and was to cost $22 million a year. But the deal that was made \nwould be to waive that amount of money, and to waive the labor laws and \nveto rights over a period of approximately 2 years.\n  Other areas where we have given preferential treatment to COSCO fall \nin the area of taxpayer-guaranteed loans.\n  COSCO was the first shipping company owned by Beijing government to \nreceive a U.S. Federal loan guarantee under a 40-year-old \nTransportation Department program designed to help American shipyards \nwin business. This was a $138 million loan, which constituted 87.5 \npercent of the cost of the projects to build four container ships in \nAlabama. The ships were never built. They did not go through. \nNonetheless, the permission was given.\n  There are many other areas where they have received preferential \ntreatment. Since the 1950s, ships from Communist nations have been \nforced to give 4 day's notice before they could dock near U.S. military \nestablishments. This was to give the U.S. officials early warning about \npossible spying and this type of thing. The restriction still applies \nto countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, Russia, and some of the other \nformer Soviet Republics. But in a deal that was worked out in December \nof 1996, the United States cut China's wait at a dozen sensitive ports \nfrom 4 days to 1 day.\n\n  Make sure we understand what we have done here. We have allowed this \ncompany to only have to wait 1 day, and all the rest of the Communist \nnations have to wait 4 days. Cambodia still has to wait 4 days. Vietnam \nstill has to wait 4 days. Russia still has to wait 4 days, but China \nonly 1 day.\n  U.S. firms still can't get sole-tenancy leases at Chinese ports, yet \nCOSCO got just such rights last year from Long Beach, CA. What a \nlease--a vacant U.S. Naval Station with no security check. What they \nare attempting to do now is to get the rest of that closed operation.\n  We are talking about several hundred acres very strategically \nlocated.\n  It is kind of interesting, since we have been giving such \npreferential treatment to the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company. Why are \nwe doing this?\n  I think it is important to understand that this shipping company is \nnot a part of the private sector. This is owned by the Chinese \nGovernment. It is owned specifically by the People's Liberation Army of \nCommunist China. So their interests are not just in mercantile--not \njust in ships--but also they have military interests. COSCO reports to \nthe Chinese Ministry of Communications, which falls under the State \nCouncil, which in turn is led by the Communist Party Politburo member \nand Premier Li Peng.\n  If we are looking at the problems that have come up and surfaced and \nhave caused many of us to be concerned, we might want to remember that \nback in March of 1996 a COSCO ship, the Empress Phoenix, transported \n2,000 illegal AK-47 automatic weapons to be used in street gangs in Los \nAngeles. It was intended to be sold to the California street gangs, and \nthis has been verified. The corporation was the Norinco Corporation, \nwhich is controlled by the People's Liberation Army. Fortunately, the \nguns were confiscated as a part of an FBI sting operation.\n  Mr. President, it is certainly no coincidence that the firm is also \nthe employer of record of Wang Jun, which is the well-known Chinese \narms dealer who attended a recent radio address in this country.\n  Mr. President, only last week the Washington Times reported that a \nCOSCO ship was on its way to Pakistan.\n  Now we are talking about shipping, carrying, nuclear technology and \nequipment in violation of an international nonproliferation agreement. \nWe are talking about carrying this information, carrying this \ntechnology, carrying this nuclear technology to Pakistan from China, a \nclear violation.\n  The COSCO ships have previously been used to transport military and \nstrategic cargoes, including components for ballistic missiles from \nChina and North Korea to such countries as Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, \nand just most recently, we learned last week, Libya.\n  So I think that we have a great deal of our Nation's security at risk \nby allowing them--continuing to allow them to have this lease.\n  With that in mind, I would again renew my unanimous consent request. \nI will wait and give adequate time for someone to come in, if there is \nan objection, but my unanimous consent request would be to set aside \nthe pending business for the immediate consideration of my amendment \nNo. 2405.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I respectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair hears an objection.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, in the few minutes we have, I would \nlike to respond to my good friend and colleague from Connecticut, to \nsome of the comments he made about the pending business and the \namendments I have offered regarding China.\n  He spoke of engagement and the necessity of the engagement policy, \nand as has so often been the case with administration defenders and the \ndefenders of the engagement policy, they would present a false \ndichotomy in that if you are not for the current administration's \npolicy, then you are an isolationist. I would suggest it is not \nengagement or isolation; it is how we are going to engage China.\n  I would further suggest that the policy this administration has \npursued has failed in engaging China adequately. That is evident in a \nwhole host of areas, not the least of which are the abuses addressed by \nthese amendments.\n  So when my good friend from Connecticut said that he is opposed to \nthese amendments, I was tempted to ask specifically what amendment is \nit--denying visas to those who perform forced abortions, or is it \ndenying visas to government individuals involved in religious \npersecution? What is it precisely that is objectionable about these? I \nwould think, rather than undermining the President's hand as he goes to \nChina, this in fact strengthens his hand, strengthens his ability to \ndeal in a more forthright way with those issues of concern to all \nAmericans.\n  My good friend from Connecticut also spoke in glowing terms of the \n``changed China.'' It is becoming more common to hear of the ``changed \nChina.''\n  In the edition of Newsweek magazine which just came out is a cover \narticle, a beautiful cover article, entitled ``The New China.'' ``The \nNew China.''\n  Well, I wish that as we looked at the experience of the Chinese \npeople today and what has happened since 9 years ago and the Tiananmen \nmassacre, we could be reassured that there were students to gather on \nthe Tiananmen plaza during the President's visit next week, in fact \nthey would receive a different greeting than they did 9 years ago when \nthey were mowed down with gunfire.\n  Well, is China different? Is it a new China? These are just reports \nin the\n\n[[Page S6747]]\n\nlast 3 weeks. New York Times, June 6: A bishop in the underground \nCatholic Church has been arrested, was detained on May 31 while \ntraveling to his village.\n  This is the changed China.\n  June 14, the Portland Oregonian reports that Chinese police \ninterrogated and threatened three dissidents who urged President \nClinton to press Chinese leaders on human rights during the summit. \nPolice ransacked the homes, confiscated their computers, took two to \nlocal precincts. June 14.\n  June 15, South China Morning Post: Dissidents in several areas \nincluding Shanghai and Weifang in Shangdong Province, the first stop \nfor Mr. Clinton, have complained of harassment. Incidents have included \nhome raids, detention, telephone tapping and confiscation of computers.\n  June 16, Japan Economic News Wire. In the runup to President Bill \nClinton's visit to China, a veteran Chinese dissident has been indicted \nfor helping another activist escape to Hong Kong.\n  June 18, Far Eastern Economic Review reports that Beijing warned the \nVatican, ``Don't use the Internet or other media channels to interfere \nwith Chinese religious affairs policies.'' And we could go on and on.\n  That is the last 3 weeks, Mr. President, of news accounts of what is \ngoing on in China. That is the ``new China.'' We want to present China \ntoday in some kind of rose-colored glasses, that everything is fine, \nwhen in fact it is not.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield? Will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I would love to yield to my good friend from \nOklahoma, but I have 5 minutes left. Unfortunately, the Presiding \nOfficer has assured me he is going to gavel me quiet at 3 o'clock, so I \nam going to have to talk very quickly.\n  The issue of religious freedom was raised, and my friend from \nConnecticut spoke once again in glowing terms of improved conditions in \nChina on the issue of religious freedom. While my friend quoted from \nthe New York Times--my good friend and distinguished colleague, whom I \nadmire greatly--I would like to quote from the State Department's \nReport on Religious Freedom in China just issued in the last--it is a \n1997 report just issued recently on China, and I will quote just a \nportion of this.\n\n       Some religious groups have registered while others were \n     refused registration and others have not applied. Many groups \n     have been reluctant to comply due to principled opposition to \n     state control of religion, unwillingness to limit their \n     activities or refusal to compromise their position on matters \n     such as abortion. They fear adverse consequences if they \n     reveal as required the names and addresses of members and \n     details about leadership activities, finances and contacts in \n     China or abroad.\n       Guided by a central policy directive of October 1996 that \n     launched a national campaign to suppress unauthorized \n     religious groups and social organizations, Chinese \n     authorities in some areas made strong efforts to crack down \n     on the activities of unregistered Catholic and Protestant \n     movements. They raided and closed several hundred house \n     church groups, many with significant memberships, properties \n     and financial resources.\n\n  And it goes on and gives many examples of that. So, in fact, our \nState Department--whatever else the New York Times may say, our State \nDepartment says that conditions in China are deplorable and that in \nfact there has been a crackdown on those who would defy the Government \nby not registering because of principled opposition to the Government's \npolicy.\n  Now, we say--and I have heard it argued even today--that the church \nand religious organizations in China are flourishing. Well, they are \ngrowing, but I would just suggest that they are growing in spite of \nGovernment policy, in spite of the persecution, not because there has \nsomehow been a blossoming of religious freedom in China.\n  As I think back to the early days of Christianity and how the Roman \nempire cracked down with great intensity upon the infant Christian \nfaith, the Christian faith mushroomed and spread all across the known \nworld at that time. But they did so in spite of intense persecution, \nand actually Christianity began to demise when suddenly it was made the \n``official religion.'' So to say somehow growth equates with freedom in \nChina today, I simply reject that.\n  I have much, much more that I would like to say. I do want to say a \nword about the President's plans to be received in Tiananmen Square. \nMrs. Ding Zilin, mother of a 17-year-old student who was killed in 1989 \nin the Tiananmen protest, said that she hoped President Clinton would \nmake a strong gesture. Her husband is associate professor of philosophy \nat the People's University in Beijing. They said this. They objected to \nthe pomp and ceremony in Tiananmen Square as the red carpet ``is dyed \nwith the blood of our relatives who have fallen.''\n  I wonder, with the emphasis upon property control, if the President \nwould feel the same about following protocol if those hundreds of \nstudents who were slain had included some American students, perhaps \nthere as foreign exchange students.\n  One thing is certain. When the President goes to Tiananmen, it will \nbe peaceful. It will be quiet. All dissidents will have been rounded \nup, and there will be no embarrassing protesters. When President Jiang \nZemin came to the United States, there were protesters. When Jiang was \nasked about it, he mocked the protesters, saying with a smile that \nperiodically he heard little voices and noises in his ear. There will \nbe no such embarrassing little noises in his ear when President Clinton \ngoes to Tiananmen Square.\n  How do we turn what I think is an unfortunate decision to go to \nTiananmen Square into something positive? Perhaps the President could \ngive a Reagan-like speech, when President Reagan went to the Berlin \nWall in 1987 and he said, ``Tear down this wall.''\n  It was Jiang who said that all of the protest in 1989 was ``much ado \nabout nothing.'' That was the President's attitude--much ado about \nnothing. Perhaps President Clinton could ask for an official apology. \nPerhaps he could ask for the release of the dissidents. They have never \ninvestigated; they have never apologized; they have never released the \ndissidents. Perhaps he could take a lead from the Italian President, \nwho last week, after the official reception, returned to Tiananmen \nSquare, where he prayed and where he meditated and where he remembered \nthose who fell. Perhaps the President, in going to Tiananmen, could \nbring a wreath in memory of those.\n  And then I would suggest this as well, that when the President raises \nthe issue of human rights, he does so not before a press briefing but \nthat he does so on his broadcast to the Chinese people. And if he will \ndo so, it will be at least a small step in turning what I think is an \nunfortunate image for the world to see, into something that can be \npositive in this trip to China.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor briefly today to \naddress the China-related amendments to the S. 2057, the DOD \nAuthorization bill, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian \nand Pacific Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations--the \nsubcommittee with jurisdiction over the subject matter of these \namendments.\n  Unfortunately, the proponents of these amendments chose a day to \ndebate these provisions when it was clear that many of the amendments' \ndetractors would be out of town. As a result, many of the latter are \nnot here today to participate in this important discussion. While I \nstrongly oppose these amendments, as I believe do a majority of the \nmembers of the full Foreign Relations Committee, I myself have \ncommitments preventing me from spending any significant time today on \nthe floor.\n  So in order to express the thrust of my position on these amendments, \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at \nthis point a copy of a ``Dear Colleague'' letter dated June 15, 1998, \nof which I am the primary signatory; a copy of my opening statement \nfrom a hearing before my subcommittee dated June 18, 1998; and finally \npages 1, 2 and 6 through 9 of a statement by Assistant Secretary \nStanley Roth.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1998.\n       Dear Colleague: When the Senate returns to consideration of \n     the DOD Authorization bill, S. 2057, we expect a series of \n     amendments to be offered concerning the People's Republic of \n     China. These amendments, if accepted, would do serious damage \n     to our bilateral relationship and halt a decade of U.S. \n     efforts to encourage greater Chinese adherence\n\n[[Page S6748]]\n\n     to international norms in such areas of nonproliferation, \n     human rights, and trade.\n       In relative terms, in the last year China has shown \n     improvement in several areas which the U.S. has specifically \n     indicated are important to us. Relations with Taiwan have \n     stabilized, several prominent dissidents have been released \n     from prison, enforcement of our agreements on intellectual \n     property rights has been stepped up, the reversion of Hong \n     Kong has gone smoothly, and China's agreement not to devalue \n     its currency helped to stabilize Asia's economic crisis.\n       Has this been enough change: Clearly not. But the question \n     is: how do we best encourage more change in China? Do we do \n     so by isolating one fourth of the world's population, by \n     denying visas to most members of its government, by denying \n     it access to any international concessional loans, and by \n     backing it into a corner and declaring it a pariah as these \n     amendments would do?\n       Or, rather, is the better course to engage China, to expand \n     dialogue, to invite China to live up to its aspirations as a \n     world power, to expose the country to the norms of democracy \n     and human rights and thereby draw it further into the family \n     of nations?\n       We are all for human rights; there's no dispute about that. \n     But the question is, how do we best achieve human rights? We \n     think it's through engagement.\n       We urge you to look beyond the artfully-crafted titles of \n     these amendments to their actual content and effect. One \n     would require the United States to oppose the provision of \n     any international concessional loan to China, its citizens, \n     or businesses, even if the loan were to be used in a manner \n     which would promote democracy or human rights. This same \n     amendment would require every U.S. national involved in \n     conducting any significant business in China to register with \n     the Commerce Department and to agree to abide by a set of \n     government-imposed ``business principles'' mandated in the \n     amendment. On the eve of President Clinton's trip to China, \n     the raft of radical China-related amendments threatens to \n     undermine our relationship just when it is most crucial to \n     advance vital U.S. interests.\n       Several of the amendments contain provisions which are \n     sufficiently vague so as to effectively bar the grant of any \n     entrance visa to the United States to every member of the \n     Chinese government. Those provisions not only countervene \n     many of our international treaty commitments, but are \n     completely at odds with one of the amendments which would \n     prohibit the United States from funding the participation of \n     a great proportion of Chinese officials in any State \n     Department, USIA, or USAID conference, exchange program, \n     or activity; and with another amendment which urges \n     agencies of the U.S. Government to increase exchange \n     programs between our two countries.\n       Finally, many of the amendments are drawn from bills which \n     have yet to be considered by the committee of jurisdiction, \n     the Foreign Relations Committee. That committee will review \n     the bills at a June 18 hearing, and they are scheduled to be \n     marked-up in committee on June 23. Legislation such as this \n     that would have such a profound effect on US-China relations \n     warrants careful committee consideration. They should not be \n     the subject of an attempt to circumvent the committee \n     process.\n       In the short twenty years since we first officially engaged \n     China, that country has opened up to the outside world, \n     rejected Maoism, initiated extensive market reforms, \n     witnessed a growing grass-roots movement towards increased \n     democratization, agreed to be bound by major international \n     nonproliferation and human rights agreements, and is on the \n     verge of dismantling its state-run enterprises. We can \n     continue to nurture that transformation through further \n     engagement, or we can capitulate to the voices of isolation \n     and containment that these amendments represent and negate \n     all the advances made so far.\n       We hope that you will agree with us and choose engagement. \n     We strongly urge you to vote against these amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n         Craig Thomas, Chairman, Subcommittee on East Asian and \n           Pacific Affairs, Committee on Foreign Relations; Joseph \n           R. Biden, Jr., Ranking Member, Committee on Foreign \n           Relations; Frank H. Murkowski, Chairman, Committee on \n           Energy and Natural Resources; John F.

Today the Subcommittee meets to consider \n     current Congressional views of the U.S.-China relationship. \n     If we had had this hearing just six months ago, I believe \n     that we'd be examining an entirely different climate. But due \n     to a variety of circumstances--the timing of the President's \n     visit to Beijing, a growing effort to emphasize human rights, \n     both the Loral and campaign finance allegations, a question \n     of foreign policy leadership in general and Asia policy in \n     particular on the part of the Administration, to name a few--\n     the Congressional spotlight is focused brightly on China, and \n     the light is harsh.\n       As of today, in this Congress there have been 25 pieces of \n     legislation introduced in the Senate and 51 in the House \n     dealing solely with China. That's excluding authorization and \n     appropriations bills, or amendments and riders to other non-\n     China specific legislation and is more than in the last three \n     Congresses. A majority of them involve sanctioning or \n     otherwise castigating China for its behavior in a variety of \n     fields, good examples being five bills presently pending \n     before this Committee: HR 967, 2358, 2386, 2570, and 2605.\n       One would require the United States to oppose the provision \n     of any international concessional loan to China, its \n     citizens, or businesses, even if the loan were to be used in \n     a manner which would promote democracy or human rights. This \n     same amendment would require every U.S. national involved in \n     conducting any significant business in China to register with \n     the Commerce Department and to agree to abide by a set of \n     government-imposed ``business principles'' mandated in the \n     amendment. On the eve of President Clinton's trip to China, \n     the raft of strident China-related bills and amendments \n     threatens to challenge our relationship just at a time in its \n     development when it is most crucial to advance vital U.S. \n     interests.\n       Several of the bills contain provisions which are \n     sufficiently vague so as to effectively bar the grant of any \n     entrance visa to the United States to every member of the \n     Chinese government. Those provisions not only contravene many \n     of our international treaty commitments, but are completely \n     at odds with one of the bills which would prohibit the United \n     States from funding the participation of a great proportion \n     of Chinese officials in any State Department, USIA, or SAID \n     conference, exchange program, or activity; and with another \n     amendment which urges agencies of the U.S. Government to \n     increase exchange programs between our two countries. \n     Finally, many of the provisions in the bills are redundant, \n     reflecting legislation which has either already passed out of \n     the Committee or out of the Senate.\n       Targeting China at this time strikes me as somewhat ironic. \n     In relative terms, during the last year China has shown \n     improvement in several areas which the U.S. has specifically \n     indicated are important to us. Relations with Taiwan have \n     stabilized and intergovernmental contacts have increased. \n     Several prominent dissidents have been released from prison. \n     Enforcement of our trade agreements on intellectual property \n     rights has been stepped up. Despite predictions to the \n     contrary, the reversion of Hong Kong has gone smoothly and \n     Beijing has maintained its distance. And at the height of the \n     Asian financial crisis, China agreed not to devalue its \n     currency thereby helping to stabilize the crisis.\n       Has this been enough change? Clearly not. But the question \n     is: how do we best encourage more change in China? Do we do \n     so by isolating one fourth of the world's population, by \n     denying visas to most members of its government, by denying \n     it access to any international concessional loans, and by \n     backing it into a corner and declaring it a pariah as these \n     bills would do?\n       Or, rather is the better course to engage China, to expand \n     dialogue, to invite China to live up to its aspirations as a \n     world player, to expose the country to the norms of democracy \n     and human rights and thereby draw it further into the family \n     of nations?\n       We're all for human rights--there's no dispute about that. \n     We agree on the message we want the Chinese to hear--stop the \n     human rights abuses, stop facilitating the proliferation of \n     dangerous weapons, stop the trade inequities. As the Chairman \n     of the Senate Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, \n     I have been extremely active in making clear to the Chinese \n     our disappointment with their actions in these and other \n     related areas. But the question is, how do we best achieve \n     human rights? I think it's through engagement.\n       In the short twenty years since we first officially engaged \n     China, that country has opened up to the outside world, \n     rejected Maoism, initiated extensive market reforms, \n     witnessed a growing grass-roots movement towards increased \n     democratization, agreed to be bound by major international \n     nonproliferation and human rights agreements, and is on the \n     verge of dismantling its state-run enterprises. We can \n     continue to nurture that transformation through further \n     engagement, or we can capitulate to the voices of isolation \n     and containment that these five House bills in particular \n     represent and negate all the advances made so far.\n       The purpose of this hearing is to explore the current \n     climate in Congress, to examine these bills, and to explore \n     alternatives to them that will continue to advance both our \n     interests and China's transformation.\n\n[[Page S6749]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n  Testimony of Stanley O. Roth, Assistant Secretary of State for East \n  Asian and Pacific Affairs, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Asia \n                  Pacific Subcommittee, June 18, 1998\n\n       Mr. Chairman, thank you for the invitation to address the \n     Subcommittee on the important issue of pending China \n     legislation in the Senate. This is, of course, a timely \n     hearing, with the President's historic trip to China only a \n     week away. I therefore welcome this opportunity to lay out \n     the Administration's position on the bills before the Senate \n     and look forward to engaging Committee members in a \n     productive dialogue on this matter.\n       My testimony will be divided into three parts. First, I \n     will review the reasons why a stronger, more constructive \n     relationship with China is in the U.S. interest. Second, I \n     will outline the Clinton Administration's strategy of \n     engagement, highlighting what we have accomplished while \n     noting the obstacles we still face. Finally I will explain \n     the Administration's position on each of the five China-\n     related bills currently before the Senate, examining the \n     impact such legislation would have on our ability to engage \n     the Chinese.\n\n\n                      china affects u.s. interests\n\n       Mr. Chairman, peace and stability in East Asia and the \n     Pacific is a fundamental prerequisite for U.S. security and \n     prosperity. Nearly one half the world's people live in \n     countries bordering the Asia Pacific region and over half of \n     all economic activity in the world is conducted there. Four \n     of the world's major powers rub shoulders in Northeast Asia \n     while some of the most strategically important waterways on \n     the globe flow through Southeast Asia. The US. itself is as \n     much a Pacific nation as an Atlantic one, with the states of \n     Alaska, California, Oregon and Washington bordering on the \n     Pacific Ocean and Hawaii surrounded by it. American citizens \n     in Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Marianas live closer to Asian capitals than to our own, vast \n     numbers of Americans work in the Asia-Pacific region, and an \n     increasingly large number of Americans trace their ancestry \n     back to the Pacific Rim.\n       For these and many other reasons, the U.S. has remained \n     committed to the Asia-Pacific region and has spent its \n     resources and blood defending and strengthening our stake in \n     the region. Since coming to office, President Clinton has \n     repeatedly made clear that America will remain an Asia-\n     Pacific power. We maintain a sizable military presence in \n     Asia; enjoy a vibrant network of mutual security alliances \n     with Australia, Japan, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea \n     and Thailand; and have significant economic ties with most \n     countries in the region. . . .\n\n\n                          pending legislation\n\n       The sponsors of the China-related legislation before the \n     Senate clearly share our goal of positively influencing \n     China's development. The bills in question seek to bring an \n     end to human rights violations, religious persecution, forced \n     prison labor and coercive family planning policies in China \n     and thus are very much in line with the Administration's own \n     objectives.\n       The question, once again, is one of approach. How do we \n     best effect those changes in the PRC?\n       H.R. 967 and H.R. 2570 both mandate a denial of visas to \n     Chinese officials alleged to be involved in religious \n     persecution (in the case of the former) or forced abortions \n     (in the case of the latter). While the Administration opposes \n     such repugnant practices and wholeheartedly agrees they must \n     be addressed, these bills would restrict our ability to \n     engage influential individuals in the very dialogue that has \n     begun to produce tangible results.\n       For example, the heads of the Religious Affairs and Family \n     Planning Bureaus are people we want to invite to the United \n     States again and again. The more Chinese leaders see of the \n     U.S., the more they are exposed to our point of view and our \n     way of life. We would be doing a disservice to the very \n     people we endeavor to help if we cut off dialogue with those \n     officials who shape the very policies we want to change. Such \n     unilateral action on our part, moreover, could prompt Beijing \n     to impose its own visa restrictions, further limiting the \n     ability of U.S. officials and religious figures to advocate \n     their views in China.\n       In addition, these bills impinge upon the President's \n     constitutional prerogatives regarding the conduct of foreign \n     relations of the United States. Decisions whether and when to \n     issue visas to foreign government officials necessarily \n     implicate the most sensitive foreign policy considerations, \n     concerning which the Executive requires maximum flexibility.\n       H.R. 2605, which requires U.S. directors at International \n     Financial Institutions to oppose the provision of \n     concessional loans to China, would have the effect of \n     punishing the Chinese people most in need of international \n     assistance. The United States, as a matter of policy, has not \n     since the Tiananmen Square crackdown supported development \n     bank lending to China except for projects designed to help \n     meet basic human needs. Concessional loans to China from the \n     World Bank, for example, are only granted for the purposes of \n     poverty alleviation. These loans support agricultural, rural \n     health, educational and rural water supply programs in \n     some of the poorest areas of the country. A vote against \n     such lending would thus be a vote against the Chinese \n     people.\n       Moreover, World Bank member donors agreed in 1996 that \n     China, owing to its improved creditworthiness, would cease \n     concessional borrowing. The Bank's concessional loans to \n     China are thus to be terminated at the end of FY1999.\n       H.R. 2358 is fundamentally different than the first three \n     bills in that it seeks to expand rather than limit U.S. \n     engagement in China. The bill allocates new monies for \n     additional human rights monitors at U.S. Embassies/Consulates \n     in China; authorizes funds to the NED for democracy, civil \n     society, and rule of law programming; and requires the \n     Secretary of State to use funds from the East Asia/Pacific \n     Regional democracy fund to provide grants to NGOs for similar \n     programs. Human rights reporting and the promotion of \n     democracy, civil society and rule of law have long been among \n     this Administration's highest priorities in China, and thus \n     we do not oppose, in principle, any of the above provisions. \n     We would note, however, that the East Asia/Pacific democracy \n     fund is a limited fund with competing demands. There is much \n     work to be done to promote democracy at this time of great \n     change in the Asia-Pacific, and thus we ask that Congress \n     give Secretary Albright maximum flexibility in allocating \n     these scarce resources.\n       The bill further requires the Secretary of State to \n     establish a Prisoner Information Registry for China. We are \n     sympathetic to the idea of establishing a prisoner registry \n     and recognize the importance of such a registry to our human \n     rights work. We caution, however, that the U.S. government is \n     not the right institution for the task. Aside from the \n     logistical difficulties of gaining access to the families and \n     friends of Chinese dissidents, U.S. Government contact with \n     such individuals could actually place them in further \n     jeopardy. We believe that NGOs are far better equipped to \n     carry out these kinds of contacts. Several groups and \n     individual activists, including Human Rights Watch, Human \n     Rights in Asia, and John Kamm, already maintain such lists. \n     Thus rather than undertake to compile and maintain an \n     accurate registry, the State Department might play a more \n     useful role in coordinating those groups already actively \n     engaged in this issue.\n       Finally, H.R. 2358 requires the Secretary of State to \n     submit a separate, annual human rights in China report to the \n     HIRC and the SFRC. Documenting and making public the human \n     rights situation in China is indeed of critical importance. \n     We have accordingly given a great deal of attention to China \n     in our annual ``Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.'' \n     The Department and our missions abroad expend enormous energy \n     and resources preparing this report, and the final product \n     routinely receives high marks for its thoroughness and \n     integrity.\n       An additional study on China would be redundant and thus \n     wasteful of taxpayer dollars. We already make extensive \n     efforts to cover those topics earmarked for attention in H.R. \n     2358: religious persecution, development of democratic \n     institutions and the rule of law. That said, we welcome \n     suggestions on how to improve the reports and would gladly \n     open a dialogue with the Congress on this important issue.\n       The last bill I want to address today, H.R. 2386, requires \n     the Secretary of Defense to produce a study of the \n     architecture requirements for the establishment and operation \n     of a theater ballistic missile defense system for Taiwan. Let \n     me state up front and emphatically that the Clinton \n     Administration remains firmly committed to fulfilling the \n     security and arms transfer provisions of the Taiwan Relations \n     Act. We have demonstrated this commitment through the \n     transfer of F-16s, Knox class frigates, helicopters and tanks \n     as well as a variety of air to air, surface to air, and anti-\n     ship defensive missiles and will continue to assist Taiwan in \n     meeting its defense needs.\n       Consistent with our obligations under the TRA, we regularly \n     consult with Taiwan as to how it can best address a broad \n     range of security threats, including the threat posed by \n     ballistic missiles. We have briefed Taiwan, as we have many \n     other friends, on the concept of theater missile defense \n     (TMD). Officials in Taiwan are currently assessing their own \n     capabilities and needs, an have not, to date, indicated \n     interest in acquiring TMD. Requiring a study of this kind \n     thus gets ahead of the situation on the ground in Taiwan and \n     may not even be consistent with the approach Taiwan officials \n     will ultimately want to take. We are accordingly opposed to \n     the legislation.\n       Again, let me restate that we are steadfast in our \n     commitment to meet Taiwan's defense needs. But while making \n     it possible for Taiwan to acquire the wherewithal to defend \n     itself, we must recognize that security over the long term \n     depends upon more than military factors. In the end, \n     stability in the Strait will be contingent upon the ability \n     of the two sides to come to terms with each other. For this \n     reason the Administration has encouraged Taipei an Beijing to \n     reopen dialogue, making it clear to both sides that dialogue \n     is the most promising way to defuse tensions and build \n     confidence. In that regard, we are encouraged by recent signs \n     of a willingness on both sides of the Strait to resume talks.\n       Mr. Chairman, as Secretary Albright has often said, there \n     is no greater opportunity--or challenge--in U.S. foreign \n     policy today than to encourage China's integration into the \n     world community. While the Administration shares fully the \n     concerns which inform\n\n[[Page S6750]]\n\n     the bills before the Senate today, we do not believe that \n     proscribing engagement with broad categories of Chinese \n     people and mandating U.S. rejection of aid intended to meet \n     basic human needs will help to change those policies and \n     practices with which we disagree.\n       These concerns can be best addressed by continuing to \n     engage Chinese leaders on the full range of security, \n     economic and political issues. President Clinton's upcoming \n     trip to China is intended to do just that, and thus is an \n     opportunity to make progress on the very human rights issues \n     addressed in today's legislation. Our strategy of engagement \n     has met with considerable success thus far, and I am \n     confident that with the support of the Congress we will \n     continue to make progress in the lead up to the summit and \n     beyond.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I know my friend from Arkansas has been waiting. I \njust want to say very briefly in response to my other friend from \nArkansas, the question, I think, and we will debate this more tomorrow, \nis whether things are better today for the people of China than they \nwere at the time of Tiananmen. I say much better. Are they where they \nought to be? No. Absolutely not. Is it moving in the right direction as \na result of our engagement? Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I know my good friend Senator Inouye is \nhere because he has a judgeship nomination he feels very strongly \nabout. I have waited here for over an hour now, and I ask unanimous \nconsent I be permitted to speak for 10 minutes on the Hutchinson \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing no objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say it is with some regret I rise \nin opposition to an amendment by my distinguished colleague and good \nfriend from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson. It is never pleasant to take \nan opposite viewpoint from your colleague, but I feel very strongly \nabout this, as does he.\n  Let me say, first of all, I have no quarrel or suggestion that any of \nthe information that Senator Hutchinson has just given us about \nconditions in China are incorrect. I do not know that they are correct, \nbut I am sure he has checked out the facts he just gave the Senate. \nWhat I want to say is, if you had been in China with me in 1978 at the \nend of the Cultural Revolution, and it was at the end of the Cultural \nRevolution, and if you had heard the stories or if you had read the \ndocumentation since the end of the Cultural Revolution about what went \non in China, I suggest this debate ought to be not about where China \nis, but how far she has come since 1978.\n  On the issue of religion in China, according to the New York Times, \nin 1979 there were three active churches in China. Today there are \n12,000. In addition to the 12,000 temples and churches in China, it is \nestimated that over 25,000 religious groups meet in the homes of \nmembers every week, and nobody has tried to stop that. On the contrary, \nwhen you think of the growth from 3 to 12,000, China should receive \nsome recognition for what they have done and the improvements they have \nmade.\n  Nobody in the U.S. Senate will take issue with some of the \naccusations here that have been made about China's opposition to \nreligions of all kinds. Nobody will argue that China has a good human \nrights record. Nobody will argue with very much of what has been said \nhere. What we are arguing here is a simple philosophical point that I \nfeel strongly about, and that is that China is 10 times more likely to \nallow the kind of progress that is going on there today, which has been \nabsolutely phenomenal, when they are engaged in dialog with nations \nlike the United States with whom they would like to have good \nrelations, than it would be if we try to tell a great nation of between \n1 billion and 2 billion people--25 percent of the Earth's population \nresides in China--they are much more likely to behave themselves when \nthey are dealing with people who constructively engage them than they \nare with people who ignore them and try to impose sanctions.\n  What if China said, ``We are not going to do business with the United \nStates anymore until they pay the United Nations dues? We are paid up. \nIt is the United States that is the deadbeat. They owe the United \nNations $900 million.''\n  You would hear a hue and outcry in this country that would drown out \nevery rock band in America.\n  Mr. President, China has a long way to go. Nobody argues that. But I \ncan tell you that by the President constructively engaging China, \npresumably he will talk to them forcefully about human rights, inquire \nand talk to them forcefully about the issue of forced abortion, talk to \nthem about religion, talk to them about political freedoms and how much \nbetter off they would be, talk to them about nuclear weaponry and how \nwe are relying on China to temper one of the most volatile dangerous \nregions in the world, between India and Pakistan.\n  If you read the Washington Post yesterday, read the interview with \nPresident Jiang, you heard him say that he was shocked to hear India \nuse, as one of its excuses for exploding a nuclear weapon--a weapon--he \nwas shocked that they used China as a threat to India as one of the \nreasons. China and India have not been big bosom buddies. I am not \nsuggesting that. As a matter of fact, it hasn't been too long since \nthey had a border war. But, in my opinion, China is not the reason they \nexploded a nuclear bomb. The reason they exploded a nuclear weapon is \nbecause the Indians and Pakistanis mistrust each other, and one of the \nmain reasons they distrust each other is because of their religious \ndifferences. If you look around the world, you will find most of the \nwars, most of the dissent going on in the world today is because of \nreligion--in Ireland, in Bosnia, in China, in India and Pakistan.\n\n  Mr. President, I think we ought to utilize China as a possible broker \nin the fight on the Korean peninsula, as well as between India and \nPakistan--that whole region of the world.\n  I heard something the other day. I don't know whether it is true or \nnot. I heard some guy on NPR talking about the criminal justice of the \nUnited States. There are 70,000 people in the United States in prison \nwho are innocent. That is not the best record in the world, if that is \ntrue. I expect it is probably close to true. Every day you read about \nsomebody who gets out of prison who has been there 10 years because he \nwas found, finally, to be innocent. Nobody's criminal justice system is \nperfect. I am not saying there are not a lot more people imprisoned in \nChina who are innocent. All I am saying is for any nation to hold \nitself out as perfect and to castigate other nations for being \nimperfect is the height of hypocrisy.\n  Mr. President, nobody disagrees with the issues that are being raised \nin this amendment, nor is anybody suggesting the President not engage \nthe Chinese very forcefully on those issues. We have a trade imbalance \nwith China. They sell us a lot more than we sell them. But I can tell \nyou, if you took away the $5 billion in goods we sell to China every \nyear, there would be a lot of jobs lost in this country, and the people \nwho sell in China, and other people who buy from China, are opposed, \nvery strongly opposed to this amendment.\n  Two final points. A lot of people have a very difficult time since \nthe Soviet Union disappeared. They have a very difficult time accepting \nthe idea that we don't have anybody to hate. We had the Soviet Union \nfor 70 years. It was so much fun. We didn't have to debate about who \nthe enemy was; we knew it was the Soviet Union. We built weapons \ngalore, trillions of dollars' worth, because of the threat of the \nSoviet Union.\n\n  The Soviet Union is not around anymore, and we have been searching \nfrantically for somebody with which to replace the Soviet Union, \nsomebody we could hate with a great deal of gusto and vigor.\n  I have watched for the past 2 years. I have watched the anti-China \ndecibel level rise to unprecedented rates. China has been elected. I am \nnot suggesting this amendment is offered because of the hatred for \nChina. I am telling you, you cannot keep 270 billion dollars' worth of \ndefense going a year unless you have an enemy. The military industrial \ncomplex has decided that is China, so we are going to continue to build \nweapons, and we are going to continue to make China the bad guy.\n  As I say, when you say these things, it looks as if you are being \napologetic\n\n[[Page S6751]]\n\nor defensive. I am not, not for a moment. I am simply saying that is a \nfact, and I can tell you, since those bombs exploded in India and \nPakistan, it is a very ominous sign, and I can tell you the threat to \ncivilization has gone up exponentially.\n  When the President is going to visit a country which has signed the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which has signed the Conventional \nWeapons Treaty, Conventional Weapons Convention, and which has agreed \nto quit shipping any information of any nuclear value to Iran, those \nare things that would never have happened if the Hutchinson amendment \nwas in place. I feel quite sure the Hutchinson amendment will be \ndefeated. I hope so.\n  He is my colleague, and I regret taking a position opposite him on \nany issue, but on this one, I can tell you, in my opinion, common sense \ndictates that the President do exactly what he is doing. I wish him \nwell. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6740-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Under the previous order, there are 2 hours \nfor debate on the nomination, equally divided.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the nomination.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, before I proceed, I thank my dear friend \nfrom Utah, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. \nHatch, for reporting out the nomination of Susan Oki Mollway. I also \nthank my friend from Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the committee, \nMr. Leahy, for his encouragement throughout this process. And, if I \nmay, I acknowledge and thank the majority leader of the Senate, the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, for scheduling this \nmatter this afternoon. I am certain the people of Hawaii are most \ngrateful for this.\n  Madam President, I am pleased to recommend to my colleagues for their \napproval the President's nominee to the U.S. district court for the \ndistrict of Hawaii, Ms. Susan Oki Mollway. Ms. Mollway was nominated to \nfill a vacancy created more than 3 years ago by the untimely and \nunexpected death of the Honorable Harold F. Fong.\n  An empty judgeship is considered a judicial emergency after 18 \nmonths. This seat has been vacant for more than twice that time. In \n1990, under Public Law 101-65, the Congress determined that Hawaii's \nFederal caseload called for increasing its Federal bench from three to \nfour positions. However, the Honorable Helen Gillmor was not confirmed \nfor that fourth seat until October 31, 1994.\n  Then Judge Fong passed away on April 20, 1995, returning Hawaii to \nthree sitting district judges. Thus, Hawaii has had the benefit of the \nfourth judgeship for less than 6 months since its authorization in \n1990.\n  For the year 1997, the weighted case filings for the three sitting \ndistrict judges in Hawaii was 706 cases per judge. To give you a sense \nof what this means, the Federal Judicial Conference's standard \nindication of the need for additional judgeship is 430 weighted case \nfilings per judge. Ours is 706. Needless to say, Hawaii has justifiably \nrequested that a fifth judgeship be approved.\n  When Judge Fong passed away, Senator Akaka and I undertook the job of \ninterviewing and considering nearly 40 candidates for this judgeship. \nAfter personally meeting with these candidates and reviewing their \nindividual backgrounds, Senator Akaka and I were pleased to recommend \nMs. Susan Oki Mollway to the President.\n  Ms. Mollway is ready for the position of U.S. district judge, and I \nbelieve she is absolutely worthy of your favorable consideration. The \nmajority of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary has given her the highest rating of ``well \nqualified'' for this judicial position.\n  By way of professional background, Ms. Mollway graduated at the top \nof her class from the University of Hawaii with a degree in English \nliterature. She received later her master's degree in the same field. \nThen Ms. Mollway went on to Harvard Law School where she graduated cum \nlaude in 1981.\n  For the past 17 years, Ms. Mollway has had a very successful \nlitigation practice with one of the largest and most respected law \nfirms in the State of Hawaii. She has been a partner in that firm's \nlitigation department since 1986. Her impressive litigation experience \nincludes a wide array of areas from Federal labor law to contract \ndisputes to lender liability and appearances before every level of the \nState and Federal courts, as well as a successful appearance before the \nU.S. Supreme Court in 1994.\n  Ms. Mollway has also taught appellate advocacy at the University of \nHawaii's William S. Richardson School of Law and has participated as an \narbitrator with Hawaii's court-annexed arbitration program. I have no \nhesitation in giving my highest recommendation to Ms. Susan Oki \nMollway.\n  Questions have been raised about Ms. Mollway's former membership on \nthe board of directorship of the American Civil Liberties Union of \nHawaii. More particularly, she has been asked to give her personal \nviews on such matters as same-sex marriage, mandatory minimum \nsentencing, the death penalty, and employee drug testing. Ms. Mollway \nhas responded to these questions and I believe has given a complete \naccount of her own activities with the ACLU. With respect to her \npersonal views, in most instances, Ms. Mollway has stated that she has \nnot formed any personal opinions.\n  More important, as one who may become a Federal trial judge, she \nclearly understands that her personal opinions are not relevant to the \ndecisions she will make as a judge. Rather, Ms. Mollway has \nunambiguously and repeatedly recognized in her responses the authority \nof the Constitution, Federal statutes as passed by the Congress, and \ncase precedent from higher courts.\n  Furthermore, Ms. Mollway has unwaveringly stated that there is \nnothing whatsoever that prevents her from abiding by and applying \napplicable law and precedent in cases that may come before her as a \nFederal district judge. I am certain she will do just that and serve \nthe Federal judiciary and the State of Hawaii with reason, balance, and \nintegrity.\n  Madam President, on a more personal note, I would like to make a few \ncomments about Ms. Mollway's family background, because I have known \nSusan Oki Mollway virtually all her life.\n  The question that comes before us is why did she join the ACLU? \nPeople do things because of background or some experience in life.\n  As a young law student, she began to research the life of Japanese-\nAmericans in the United States. And she came across rather strange \ndecisions made by the Court and also by the Congress of the United \nStates. These are chapters in the history of the United States that \nmany of us would like to forget. But I think it might be well if we \nreviewed them at this moment.\n  Ms. Mollway found out, for example, that in 1922 the Supreme Court of \nthe United States declared that Japanese were not qualified for \ncitizenship; in other words, they were singled out among all the \npeoples of the United States and said, ``You cannot be a naturalized \ncitizen.'' Everyone else could be.\n  Then in 1924, the Congress of the United States, in enacting the \nimmigration laws, declared that if people are not qualified for \ncitizenship, they may not immigrate to the United States. So once again \nthe Japanese were singled out and told that they may not come here as \nimmigrants.\n  Then we all know that on December 7, that day of infamy, the Japanese \nattacked Pearl Harbor. Soon thereafter,\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\non February 19, 1942, an Executive order was issued authorizing the \nArmy of the United States to establish, throughout the United States, \n10 concentration camps and to place in these camps, for the duration of \nthe war, all Japanese, whether they be citizens or not; and the vast \nmajority were citizens. They were never tried. They were never charged \nwith any crime. Due process was totally ignored. But there they were.\n  Then on March 17 of that year, 1942, a strange decision was rendered \nand made known. The Selective Service System declared that Japanese-\nAmericans would be designated 4-C. Most Americans may not be aware of \nwhat 4-C stands for. Madam President, 1-A is that that person is \nphysically and mentally fit to put on the uniform; 4-F is just the \nopposite. 4-C is the designation for ``enemy alien.'' And so on March \n17, 1942, I was declared an enemy alien. Ms. Mollway's father was also \ndeclared an enemy alien. But we proceeded to petition the Government, \nand I am glad to report that, about 9 months later, the President of \nthe United States issued an order saying that Americanism is not a \nmatter of race or color, Americanism is a matter of mind and heart, and \nauthorized the formation of a special combat team of volunteers.\n  The response was astounding to everyone. In Hawaii, over 85 percent \nof those eligible to put on the uniform volunteered. What is more \nastounding than that, hundreds of men who were behind barbed wires in \nthese camps also stepped forward to volunteer to be given the \nopportunity of demonstrating their Americanism and their loyalty.\n  Many Americans may not be aware of this, but this combat team, at the \nend of the war, was declared to be the most decorated in the history of \nthe United States Army. There is no evidence or history of any \nsubversive activity on the part of any member. Furthermore, in all of \nthe investigations that were held since the end of that war, they could \nfind not one instance of Japanese involvement in sabotage of fifth \ncolumn activities.\n  Ms. Mollway read these things, and she did research. And it is \nobvious for any young person who comes across information of that \nnature to be quite concerned. And she found that the ACLU was an \norganization that was concerned about the Constitution, to preserve and \ndefend that most sacred of documents of Americans. And she was \nespecially concerned about the Bill of Rights. So it was natural for \nher, just as I joined the ACLU because of my concern about the \nConstitution. But that does not make me any less an American.\n  But this chapter in our lives ends with a burst of glory. I am \ncertain Americans will remember that for the first time a mighty \nnation, a superpower, admitted their wrong and apologized, and \napologized to the 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry who were \nincarcerated without due process of law.\n  I am pleased to tell you that Susan Oki Mollway's father and I \nvolunteered and we served in this regiment. And Susan could have no \nbetter role model to guide her life, professionally or personally, than \nher own father, who happens to be a lawyer also. I am certain that she \nmirrors her father in her love of country, in her commitment to the \nConstitution, and in her patriotism.\n  Once again, Madam President, I wish to thank my distinguished friend \nfrom Utah, the chairman of the committee, for reporting this measure. I \nalso wish to thank Mr. Trent Lott, the majority leader of the U.S. \nSenate, for scheduling this matter. We will be forever grateful.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my dear colleague for his kind \nremarks on the floor. I just want to again express my regard for him \nand for the service he has given to his country, not only being an \neffective and very important and powerful U.S. Senator, but also as a \nhero, in my eyes, having served our country in the war and having \nsacrificed greatly for our country.\n  From my point of view, if he wants a judgeship nominee, he is going \nto be given the benefit of the doubt in every way. And I have to say, \nin the case of Susan Oki Mollway of Hawaii, I do support her for this \nposition as a United States district court judge. I plan to vote for \nher nomination, as I did in committee. If confirmed--and I believe she \nwill be confirmed--Ms. Mollway will be the 270th Clinton judicial \nnominee to be reported by the Judiciary Committee and confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  In light of this record of accomplishment and in light of some recent \nremarks made on the floor of the Senate, I thought it would be \nappropriate for me to spend a few minutes reviewing our record in \nprocessing President Clinton's nominees.\n  I have been working with White House Counsel Chuck Ruff to ensure \nthat the nomination and confirmation process is a collaborative one \nbetween the White House and the Members of the Senate. I think it is \nfair to say that after a few bumpy months in which the process suffered \ndue to inadequate consultation between the White House and some \nSenators, the process is now working rather smoothly. I think the \nprogress is due to the White House's renewed commitment to good-faith \nconsultation with Senators of both parties.\n  I strongly believe that we must do our best to reduce the 73 current \nvacancies in the Federal courts. But, frankly, there are limits to what \nwe can do given the administration's performance so far. The fact of \nthe matter is that, of the 45 nominees currently pending, 15 of those \nwere received during the last month alone. And it takes 3 to 6 months \njust to process Federal district and circuit court judges. These are \nvery tough positions. These are positions that are lifetime \nappointments, and they deserve the scrutiny that we have always applied \non the committee, whether the committee has been controlled by \nDemocrats or Republicans.\n  Of the 45 total judicial nominees that are pending, 10 are \nindividuals simply renominated from last Congress. Last year, the \nadministration renominated a total of 23 nominees from the 104th \nCongress. Thirteen of them have been confirmed, but some of the others \nhave some problems. That is why they were held over.\n\n  Of those 73 vacancies, 28 have not yet received a nominee, and it was \nonly a few months ago when better than half of the total vacancies of \naround 81 or 82 did not have a nominee. Like I said, we have received \n15 nominees within the last month. So, many of the vacancies come as a \nresult not of the committee's slow pace but of the administration's \ninaction.\n  Moreover, of the 115 judicial nominees sent forward to the committee \nthis Congress, 82 of them have had hearings. Of the 82 nominees who \nhave had hearings, 74 have been reported out of the committee. Of those \n74 nominees reported out of the committee, 66 have been confirmed and 7 \nare pending on the Senate floor. One of those seven will be confirmed \nshortly, I hope, in the form of Susan Oki Mollway.\n  Assuming most of these nominees the committee has processed are \nconfirmed, I think you will see that our efforts compare quite \nfavorably to prior Congresses in terms of the number of judges \nconfirmed at this point in the second session of the Congress, \nespecially if you look at the recent Democrat-controlled Congresses. \nFor example, during the second session of the 102nd Congress, when \nPresident Bush was in office and the Democrats controlled the Senate \nand therefore the Judiciary Committee, guess how many nominees had been \nconfirmed by July of 1992? Thirty. That is all. How many Clinton \nnominees this year will we have confirmed were we to stop confirming \njudges after today? Thirty-one. And we are not through with this \nsession yet. As of July 1, 1990, the Democratic Senate had only \nconfirmed 25 of the Bush nominees nominated that year. As of July 1, \n1988, only 21 of Reagan nominees confirmed that year had been confirmed \nby the Democrat-controlled Senate. So the plain fact is that we are \nright on track, if not ahead of previous Congresses.\n  Now, while I am concerned that some vacancies need to be filled, I \nthink there has been considerable distortion of the overall situation. \nThere is by no means an unprecedented level of vacancies. In fact, \nthere are more sitting judges today than there were throughout \nvirtually all of the Reagan and\n\n[[Page S6753]]\n\nBush administrations. As of today, we have 767 active Federal judges. \nIn addition, there are also well over 400 senior judges who can, and \noften do, hear cases.\n  Keep in mind that the Clinton administration is on record as having \nstated that 63 vacancies--a vacancy rate just over 7 percent--is \nconsidered virtual full employment of the Federal Judiciary. They were \nright; when we have around 60 vacancies, we have virtually full \nemployment. It is natural that there will always be some vacancies in \nlight of the turnaround time involved in receiving and reviewing \nnominees. That is as it should be. Seventy-three vacancies, however, is \na vacancy rate of 9 percent. Now, how can a vacancy rate from 7 percent \nto 9 percent convert ``full employment'' into a ``crisis''?\n  Moreover, compare today's 73 vacancies to the vacancies under a \nDemocratic Senate during President Bush's Administration. In May 1991 \nthere were 148 vacancies, and in May 1992 there were 117 vacancies. I \nfind it interesting that at that time I don't recall a single news \narticle or floor speech on judicial vacancies. So, in short, I think it \nis quite unfair and, frankly, inaccurate to report that the Republican \nCongress has created a vacancy crisis in our courts.\n  While the debate about vacancy rates on our Federal courts is not \nunimportant, it remains more important that the Senate perform its \nadvise and consent function thoroughly and responsibly. Federal judges \nserve for life and perform an important constitutional function, \nwithout direct political accountability to the people. Accordingly, the \nSenate should never move too quickly on nominations before it. I do not \nbelieve that we are moving too quickly on this nominee. This nominee is \ngetting considered today, and I hope that she passes.\n\n  Just this past year, we saw two examples of what can happen when we \ntry to move nominations along perhaps too quickly. In one instance, a \nsitting Federal district judge nominated for a very important Federal \nappeals court was forced to withdraw the nomination after he had a \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee when it was discovered that he had \nlied about certain details of his background.\n  In another instance, a nominee for a Federal district court was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee before all the details of her \nrecord as a judge on a State trial court were known. As it happens, the \ndistrict attorney in the nominee's city and the district attorneys' \nassociation in her home State have all recently come to publicly oppose \nthe nomination, setting forth facts demonstrating a very serious \nantiprosecution bias in her judicial record.\n  It is cases like these that underscore the importance of proceeding \nvery deliberately with nominations for these most important life-\ntenured positions. Even so, you can be too deliberate; you can delay \nthese too much. I think under my tenure as chairman of the committee we \nhave not done that. I hope that our colleagues on the other side \nrealize that.\n  In closing, I feel I should respond to some unfortunate remarks made \nrecently on the floor of the Senate. I am referring to a speech where \none of my colleagues accused the Senate majority of ``stalling Hispanic \nwomen and minority nominees'' because of ``ethnic and gender biases.''\n  Day in and day out, the Judiciary Committee routinely has evaluated \nand reported on literally hundreds of Clinton judicial nominees without \nany regard whatever to the nominee's race, gender, religion, or ethnic \norigin. And the Senate has gone on to confirm those Clinton nominees--\n269 of them, up until today. Should Susan Oki Mollway be confirmed, the \nnumber will be 270 judges. Indeed, according to statistics compiled by \nthe liberal judicial watchdog group, the Alliance for Justice, no fewer \nthan 70 of these nominees were women, 42 were African Americans, 13 \nwere Hispanics, and 4 were Asian Americans. These figures do not \ninclude the more than 235 Department of Justice and White House \nnominees--non-judicial nominees, if you will--approved by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee whom Republicans have confirmed for President \nClinton.\n  Anyone can cite individual isolated examples of unexpedited \nconsideration but I flatly reject that these amount to what my \ncolleague called a ``disturbing pattern'' of ``ethnic and gender \nbias.'' I do not think it would be appropriate for me at this point to \ndiscuss why each of his examples fails to support his point. Suffice it \nfor me to say here that members of the Judiciary Committee are well \naware that many nominees lack the support of home-State Senators, have \na record that raises serious questions of character and judicial \ntemperament, or have some other background difficulty that necessitated \nfurther investigation.\n  I do not believe it does the Senate well, nor do I believe it does \nthe Committee well, to engage in this sort of ``wedge'' politics. I \nhope my colleagues will refrain from such unproductive attacks. They \nare not only unproductive, they are unfair and, in my opinion, somewhat \nvicious.\n  To suggest that the Committee or this majority is motivated by \nimproper bias of any kind is simply wrong, and the record shows it. In \naddition, I will not allow such accusations to force us to abdicate the \nSenate's responsibility to ensure that the Senate adequately and fully \ndischarges its constitutional advise and consent function for nominees \nfor life-tenured judicial office.\n  Having said all of this, I would like to lend my support for Susan \nOki Mollway and to the distinguished Senators from Hawaii, both of whom \nI admire very much. I have to say that the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii, Senator Inouye, has known Susan Oki Mollway virtually all her \nlife. He has known her father, who also, likewise, is a hero.\n  I examined her record, and, yes, there are things that naturally \nraised the hackles of some on the committee, but I have to say that she \nis an extremely intelligent women with an extremely well balanced \nbackground. I have to say that I believe she ought to be supported here \non the floor today, and I intend to do everything I can to support her.\n  Susan Oki Mollway was nominated for district judge from the District \nof Hawaii on January 7 of last year. I personally apologize to my two \ncolleagues for this having taken so long to get to the floor. She has a \nB.A. and an M.A. in English from the University of Hawaii. That alone \nis pretty impressive, but she received her J.D. cum laude from Harvard \nUniversity in 1981. That is also pretty impressive.\n  Currently, she is a partner with the Honolulu firm of Cades, Schutte, \nFleming and Wright. She also currently serves as director to the Hawaii \nJustice Foundation and the Hawaii Women's Legal Foundation, both unpaid \npositions, organizations that focus on local issues and/or raise money \nfor charitable organizations. In addition, she was the recipient of the \nOutstanding Woman Lawyer of the Year award in 1987. She is an \nexceptional person--in my opinion, one who should be able to fill this \nposition in a way that will bring honor to the Federal courts. I hope \nthat is true. I have no way of being absolutely sure, but I am relying \non the recommendations of our two colleagues from Hawaii and the \nextensive background investigation the Committee performed on Susan Oki \nMollway. I hope our colleagues in the Senate will support her. I \nbelieve she is worthy of support.\n\n  I think my colleagues know that I take these nominations very \nseriously. We look at them very seriously. We do extensive background \nchecks and investigations, as did our friends on the other side when \nthey were in control of the committee. I try to be down the line, down \nthe middle, and I try to make sure people are treated fairly. \nNaturally, I resent it when somebody indicates in any conversation that \nthere may be some impropriety or improper bias involved with regard to \nsome of the nominees who have been or are currently pending before the \nSenate and/or the Judiciary Committee.\n  I am very concerned, as Judiciary Committee chairman, that we do our \njobs well. I am very concerned that we do them in a way that is fair. I \nam very concerned that we get the best people we can on the Federal \nbench. After all, these are lifetime appointments. It is often said \nthat Federal judges are the ``closest thing to God'' in this life \nbecause they have so much power, and once they are there, you really \ncan't\n\n[[Page S6754]]\n\nget rid of them. They are not really politically accountable or \ndirectly accountable to the American people because they don't have to \nstand for reelection, which I think is a very good thing because that \nkeeps the Federal judicial system above politics, hopefully, or at \nleast less involved in politics than any other branch of our \nGovernment. I think the judiciary has served our country well. I have \nseen great liberal judges and great conservative judges, and I have \nseen lousy liberal judges and lousy conservative judges on the Federal \nbench. Ideology isn't necessarily the determining factor as to whether \na judge will serve in the best possible manner as a member of the \nFederal bench.\n  So it is important that we find people of high caliber, high quality, \nhigh ethics, with good work habits, that are honest and decent, to fill \nthese positions. I believe Susan Oki Mollway fits all of those \ncategories.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I thank my distinguished friend from \nUtah for his warm and generous remarks. I am most grateful.\n  I yield to my colleague from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, it is with great pleasure that I take the \nfloor today to speak on behalf of Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, the \nPresident's nominee to the U.S. District Court for the District of \nHawaii.\n  I wholeheartedly support Ms. Mollway, who, if confirmed, will fill \nthe fourth seat on the Hawaii court. I also want to join with the \nremarks of my senior Senator, who eloquently and passionately spoke \nabout Susan Oki Mollway and her family. He also spoke about our \ninterviewing her for this position and how impressed we were with her \ncaliber, the kind of person that she is. I also want to thank chairman \nOrrin Hatch of Utah for his support and for reporting this out of \ncommittee, and also Senator Pat Leahy, the ranking member from Vermont \non the committee, and members of the committee for reporting this \nnominee out to the floor. I also want to thank our majority leader, \nTrent Lott of Mississippi, for permitting it to be on the floor today.\n  This has been a long journey for us. This position has been vacant \nsince the untimely passing of Judge Harold Fong in April of 1995. As \nthe senior Senator from Hawaii noted, the caseload in the District of \nHawaii continues to increase. This has been very, very difficult for \nHawaii. The recently adjusted 1997 Federal Court Management Statistics \nReport found that the U.S. District Court, District of Hawaii, is the \neighth busiest court out of 91 in the country, and the third busiest in \nthe ninth circuit.\n\n  Therefore, it is critical that the vacancy on the Hawaii court is \nfilled. Senator Inouye and I believe that Susan Oki Mollway is the most \nqualified candidate for this position.\n  Ms. Mollway enjoys the highest rating of ``well qualified'' from the \nmajority of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary. To quote some of her colleagues in Hawaii, ``We have \ncome to know her as a highly ethical, careful, dedicated, intelligent, \narticulate, caring, and energetic lawyer.'' Ms. Mollway is known for \nher professional skills, her sense of ethics, and a moral compassion--\nqualities needed for service on the Federal bench.\n  Senator Inouye has already recounted Ms. Mollway's education, \nprofessional, and family background. However, I do wish to point out \nthat, as a Harvard Law School graduate, she could have stayed on the \nmainland like so many of Hawaii's young people. Instead, she returned \nto Hawaii, the home of her parents, where she joined one of Honolulu's \nbest-known law firms --Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright.\n  As a specialist in civil litigation, Ms. Mollway handles a wide range \nof cases and has appeared before every level of the State and Federal \ncourts, including a successful appearance before the U.S. Supreme Court \nin 1994.\n  Ms. Mollway has responded fully to those who have questioned her on \nher former position on the board of directors of the Hawaii chapter of \nthe American Civil Liberties Union. Senator Inouye has mentioned this \nabout her. Prior to her board membership, the ACLU-Hawaii filed a \nfriend of the court brief in support of plaintiffs in the Hawaii same-\nsex marriage case. Although she was aware of ACLU-Hawaii's position and \nactivities in the same-sex marriage case, as a board member Susan \nMollway was never called on to play an active role.\n  Furthermore, Ms. Mollway understands that her personal opinions are \nnot relevant to the decisions she would make as a Federal judge. She \nhas stated that she recognizes the authority of the Constitution, \nFederal statutes as passed by the Congress, and case precedent from \nhigher courts as the judicial guidelines to follow in court \ndeliberation.\n  I believe my colleagues will agree with me that Susan Mollway's \ncredentials are impressive. She is an individual of the highest \nintegrity, whose dedication to her profession is admired by all. I am \npleased to lend my support to Ms. Mollway and urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of this nominee whose confirmation will bring the U.S. \nDistrict Court in Hawaii to its full complement.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am honored to have the opportunity \nto make some remarks on the occasion of this nomination. First, I want \nto say how much I respect both of the Senators from Hawaii. I believe \nthat they take very seriously the nomination of a U.S. district judge, \nand I believe they have sought to fulfill their responsibilities well \nin that regard.\n  Having been a practitioner in Federal court myself--full-time as a \nU.S. attorney for 15 years, and another 5 years or so in private \npractice--I have a deep feeling about the judiciary, what it needs to \nbe, and the standards it ought to uphold. I believe it ought to be a \ndisinterested applicator of the law, regardless of politics, ideology, \nand those sorts of things. I believe we ought to look for nominees that \ndo that. Both for my respect for the distinguished Senators from Hawaii \nand my respect for this nominee make it difficult for me to stand here \nand suggest, as I will, that we ought not to confirm this nominee for \nthe Federal bench. I have no doubt that she is a person of integrity \nand character. But I want to share some concerns that I have about this \nnomination, and why I think it ought not be confirmed.\n\n  Also, let me express my respect for the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. There is no finer constitutional lawyer in \nthis body than Senator Hatch. He is a man of integrity and ability. He \nworks hard every day in our committee to make sure nominees are given a \nfair shake, and that the nominations are moved along at a steady pace, \nas they continue to do. I know that he considered carefully the \nproblems that this nominee had before he agreed to vote in favor of \nthis nominee. I know he respects the opinion of both Senators from \nHawaii.\n  I note that the committee voted 12 to 6, with six Senators voting \nagainst the nomination. I think that suggests that there was a genuine \nunease by a considerable number of the committee with regard to this \nnominee.\n  It is impossible to know for sure what anyone will do on the bench. \nThis nominee may turn out to be a very restrained and rigorous judicial \nnominee and judge, consistent with some of the great judges in history. \nBut we have to look at the nominees' backgrounds and the positions they \nhave taken over the years to try to analyze how they might perform on \nthe bench.\n  The Senate is given under the Constitution the power to advise and \nconsent with the President. These nominees are lifetime appointees. \nThey will serve throughout their entire life making decisions day after \nday, week after week, month after month, year after year. And, as \nSenator Hatch said, they are not accountable to the people. It is \nreally the most anti-democratic aspect of our entire American \ngovernment, but I support it. I am not in favor of electing Federal \njudges. I therefore believe it is our responsibility to give careful \nthought to those to whom we give that position.\n  First, let me note one thing. It does appear that the district of \nHawaii is in\n\n[[Page S6755]]\n\nneed of a judge. Their caseload is 700 weighted cases per judge. It is \na heavy caseload. We have a judicial circuit in Alabama that has a \nhigher caseload, and it is, indeed, a high caseload. I am sure another \njudge is needed to do that work. I know all of us are active in various \nactivities. And I think it is appropriate that we be asked about those \nactivities when we are nominated for a position like this.\n  What do we know about this nominee? We know that she was a voluntary \nmember of the American Civil Liberties Union for a number of years--may \nstill be--and was an active member of the board of directors and a \nfundraiser for the Hawaii ACLU during 1995 and 1996.\n  During that time, the Hawaii ACLU took a number of positions. I am \ncertain that as a board member she did not sign those pleadings, and \nmaybe did not personally conduct in-depth research. In fact, I think \nshe suggested she has not researched each one of these issues. But I \nthink it is appropriate for us to ask about those positions, as we did \non the committee. She did not disavow any of them.\n  In 1996, in Hawaii, an ACLU executive or administrator stated, ``The \nlaws that discriminate based on sexual orientation are as reprehensible \nas laws that at one time protected segregation.''\n  The point of that discussion was testimony on the recognition of \nhomosexual marriages. And, in fact, the ACLU official was taking the \nposition that Hawaii should take on the question of affirming, \nratifying, respecting, and acknowledging homosexual unions. He was \nsuggesting that those who would oppose it would be the same as those \nwho opposed integration.\n  I would have to say that is outside the mainstream of law. As \nattorney general of Alabama, I had the occasion to have my staff do \nsome research on this. We found no place in the history of America that \nany State or government agency ever recognized a homosexual union. It \nis not recognized, to my knowledge, any place in any culture in the \nworld and reflects an odd and historically inaccurate view of the law. \nBut that was the organization's position, of which she was a board \nmember and a fundraiser.\n\n  In 1995, the ACLU opposed legislation that would have required HIV \ntesting for persons indicted for sexual crimes. I would suggest that \nthere is an extreme anxiousness and justifiable concern about these \nkinds of activities.\n  When a person is arrested for a sexual crime and there is a victim \nthat may have been infected with HIV, I think it is perfectly \nappropriate for a judicial authority require as a condition of the \nsuspect's release that person to be tested to see if they have passed \non such a horrible disease to the victim.\n  Also, I suggest that we have a large number of people in the ACLU \nactive in opposing all drug testing. That is a very, very important \nmatter of public interest. It is unfounded in constitutional law and at \nleast in most properly applied cases of drug testing. We will have more \ndrug testing in the future, because we are concerned about young people \nand others who are using drugs.\n  In 1995, the ACLU in Hawaii, of which this individual was a board \nmember and fundraiser, opposed an ordinance that banned overnight \nsleeping in parks.\n  We have learned in recent months pretty clearly that it is important \nand necessary for a city and police departments to take control of \ntheir streets. We learned in New York that the panhandlers and those \nwho are in the parks can, in fact, undermine public safety. Mayor \nGuiliani in New York has taken great leadership in that regard, and has \nsubstantially driven down the crime rate in New York.\n  It is small matters like this which sometimes turn into much larger \nmatters. This is the kind of frustration that cities and counties and \npolice departments around the country feel when they are challenged \nabout the steps they have to take to preserve public safety.\n  In 1965, the Hawaii ACLU, of which this nominee was a board member \nand fundraiser, opposed drug testing in the workplace, saying, ``The \nACLU opposes random and indiscriminate drug testing in the workplace, \nnot only on privacy grounds but also because such drug testing does not \ndetect current impairment.''\n  Madam President, one of the most beneficial acts that has been done \nto fight drugs in America, in my opinion, is drug testing in the \nworkplace. A businessman who cares about his employees, who sets a high \nstandard, who wants to eliminate theft, who wants to reduce accidents, \nwho wants to protect the health of his or her employees sends out a \nclear message that drug use is not acceptable in their company, and \nthey drug test fairly and objectively. The tests are very reliable \ntoday and make the workplace safer by protecting the lives and safety \nof employees, eliminating and reducing crime and theft by the \nemployees, and avoiding injury to those who come into contact with \nthose employees. Furthermore, they also encourage employees to stay \ndrug free. You are encouraging them by insisting on a high standard. \nAnd perhaps that employee when they go home will tell their wife or \nhusband who suggests that they might use drugs, ``No, we shouldn't do \nit. I am going to be tested at work.''\n  Drug testing has been a great success. But it has been a long, hard \nlegal fight. In case after case, the ACLU position has been rejected.\n  I must admit, as a person who has been involved in the fight against \ndrugs, that it concerns me that our nominee is a person who was a board \nmember of an organization that voluntarily went out and tried to \nobstruct workplace drug testing.\n  In 1995, the Hawaii ACLU opposed another common occurrence in \nAmerica, the very popular minimum sentence in criminal cases. State \nafter State after State has followed the Federal law that says that \nunder certain circumstances, crimes with certain prior convictions will \nbe punished with at least a minimum sentence if convicted. And that \nprocess has worked; I believe it has helped us identify repeat \noffenders, to lock them up for longer periods of time, and I am \nconfident that that is one of the primary reasons we have seen a \nreduction in crime among adults. We are doing a better job of \nidentifying serious, repeat, violent offenders through these ``three \nstrikes you're out'' laws and mandatory sentencing laws, and it is no \nsmall concern to me as a prosecutor, a Federal and State prosecutor, \nthat our nominee for this position has supported the position of the \nACLU that mandatory minimum sentences ought not to be approved.\n  In addition, the Hawaii ACLU has opposed a Federal Stop Turning Out \nPrisoners Act and the Community Notification of Sex Offenders Act. \nThose are some of the positions that they have taken during the 1995 \nperiod in which this nominee was a member of the board and a \nfundraiser. Now, when asked at our confirmation hearing if there were \nany policy positions of the Hawaii ACLU that she disagreed with while \non the board of directors, Ms. Mollway answered, ``I cannot think of \nany.''\n  Now, I believe that is a sufficient basis for a Senate Member to have \na serious concern about this nominee, and that is why at least six \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee cast a ``no'' vote. We respect those \nwho have nominated her; we respect her; but we have serious concerns \nabout her nomination to the Federal bench.\n  In addition, in recent years the ACLU has taken other positions that \nare outside the mainstream of legal and current American thought. They \noppose the death penalty. They oppose three-strikes sentencing laws \naround the country. They oppose school vouchers for sectarian schools. \nThey have opposition to V chips in televisions to screen out violence. \nThey oppose voluntary labeling of music albums as to their content. \nThey support the legality of partial-birth abortion. They support the \nconstitutionality and use of racial preferences and oppose some of the \nlaws that eliminate that. And they support the decriminalization of \ndrugs; that is, the legalization of drugs.\n  Such positions are not mainstream thought in this country. That is \nnot mainstream law that is being advocated. They have done some good \nthings over the years. They have taken some positions that were \ncourageous and were proved to be right and furthered our country, but \nthis nominee in the last few years was an active member of an \norganization that took some of the positions I just mentioned, in \ncourt.\n\n[[Page S6756]]\n\n  Now, I have voted for an ACLU member, maybe more than once, to be \nconfirmed, but I want to share some other things that concern me and \naffect my decision, and I hope other Senators will consider this as \nthey decide what standard they will use when they consider whether to \nconsent to this nomination.\n  This nominee will be a district judge within the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals that includes Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, \nArizona, Nevada and Alaska. Over the years that circuit has been \nrecognized as the most liberal circuit in America. It has also been \nrecognized as a court that has been out of touch with mainstream \nAmerican law. In the last term of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme \nCourt reviewed 28 cases that arose from the ninth circuit, and of those \n28 cases, they reversed 27 of them. This has been a pattern over quite \na number of years.\n  Just last month, the ninth circuit became the first circuit in \nAmerica to rule that the Prison Litigation Reform Act is \nunconstitutional. That was passed by this Congress. It was a \nmagnificent act to eliminate this repetition of appeals by prisoners \nthat have clogged courts for years, and I have seen it personally, and \nso many of them are extraordinarily frivolous. But it was carefully \nconsidered by this body. Every other circuit that has addressed this \nissue has upheld the constitutionality of the Prison Litigation Reform \nAct, including the 1st circuit, the 4th circuit, the 6th circuit, the \n8th circuit, and the 11th circuit. They have upheld it as \nconstitutional, but once again the ninth circuit is out of step with \nthat group.\n  Recently, in the last month or so, the Supreme Court harshly \ncriticized the ninth circuit for granting a habeas corpus petition--\nthat is, a petition by a prisoner--that had overturned the death \nsentence of a convicted rapist and murderer. In reversing this \nconviction, the ninth circuit opinion reversed a conviction that had \ngone to the California Supreme Court four times, that had gone to the \nU.S. Supreme Court two times. The defendant had been on death row for \nwell over 10 years and there was little dispute about his guilt or \ninnocence. And so the Supreme Court really was frustrated by this. This \nwas a midnight stay of execution, within 24 or 48 hours of the carrying \nout of this death penalty case that had been on death row for years and \nwas reversed by them.\n  Some would say, as Ms. Mollway did, I will follow the laws. Sometimes \nwe have to wonder what the law is in the ninth circuit. We know that \nthey have been extraordinarily sensitive to death penalty cases beyond, \nin my opinion, rationality. We know that in many cases the court-\nappointed attorneys' fees in death cases in California or in the ninth \ncircuit have exceeded $1 million for the court-appointed attorneys to \ndefend those who have been charged, since the appeals go on for years \nand years. And, as I recall, the amount of money spent on that in the \nninth circuit matches all the other circuits in America in expense.\n  So we have a problem with that, and we need judges who know what the \nlaw is, who make every effort to guarantee that the innocent are found \ninnocent, their convictions reversed if need be, and are given a fair \ntrial. That is absolutely guaranteed by our Constitution and should \nnever be denied. But, Madam President, when you have these kinds of \nappeals, it makes a mockery of the law, it undermines the public \nrespect for the law, it places the courts in disrespect, and I think \nthis circuit is rightly criticized for that.\n  Recently, the New York Times referred to the ninth circuit as ``the \ncountry's most liberal circuit'' and noted that it was viewed by a \nmajority on the Supreme Court as ``a rogue circuit.''\n  I would say that is a serious matter. I believe, based on this \nnominee's background, her positions on issue after issue, her \nactivities with the ACLU in Hawaii, that we have indications that \ninstead of being a part of a renaissance in the ninth circuit, to \nimprove the ninth circuit and bring it back into the mainstream of \nAmerican law, that she would, in fact, be more of the same: the same \nliberal, activist, anti-law-enforcement mentality that has gotten this \ncircuit out of whack with the rest of the Nation.\n  District judges are not circuit judges; I don't mean to suggest that \nthey are; but they are part of the circuit. It was a district judge \nrecently who ruled the California Proposition 209, the civil rights \ninitiative that would eliminate racial preferences, violated the \nConstitution of the United States. Fortunately, a panel of even the \nninth circuit unanimously agreed that was not correct and the court \nfound there is no doubt that Proposition 209 was constitutional. And \nthe Supreme Court refused to reverse that--in effect, affirmed that \ndecision.\n  So I would just say to my distinguished friends from Hawaii, we do \nneed to be careful about what is happening on our benches. We do have, \nin certain parts of this country, courts that are going beyond the \ntraditional role of judges, going beyond the traditional role of \ncourts. It is breeding a disrespect, it is undermining law enforcement, \nit is delaying the carrying out of justly imposed sentences, and we \nneed to make sure that we do something about that. I, for one, have \nstated publicly for some time now that I feel a special obligation and \na special concern to look at the nominees for the ninth circuit, to \nmake sure that those nominees are going to be part of a solution to \nthis problem rather than part of the problem.\n  Based on my analysis and my sincere belief about it, I have concluded \nthat I should vote ``no,'' and I will urge my fellow Senators also to \nvote no.\n  This nominee is a person of quality and intellect, but I believe she \nis not the right nominee at this time for this position.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am most grateful to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama for his reasoned argument on the matter before us.\n  In order to further clarify the record, if I may, Madam President, I \nask unanimous consent that a letter dated March 9, 1998, addressed to \nthe chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, with responses to \nadditional questions from Senator Thurmond and Senator Sessions, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the Letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright,\n\n                                      Honolulu, HI, March 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you very much for giving me the \n     opportunity to respond to additional questions from Senators \n     Thurmond and Sessions. I am enclosing my responses to the \n     questions delivered to me on March 9, 1998.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Susan Oki Mollway.\n       Attachments.\n\n   Answers of Susan Oki Mollway to Additional Questions from Senator \n                                Sessions\n\n       1. In your legal opinion, is the Prison Legal Reform Act \n     constitutional?\n       Yes. This law is presumed to be constitutional. It has been \n     upheld by several appellate courts (e.g., Hadix v. Johnson, \n     133 F.3d 940 (6th Cir. 1998); Benjamin v. Jacobson, 124 F.3d \n     162 (2d Cir. 1997); Plyler v. Moore, 100 F.3d 365 (4th Cir. \n     1996), Cert. den., 117 S. Ct. 2460 (1997)). I have no \n     personal views that would prevent me from following \n     applicable law in this or any other area.\n       2. In your legal opinion, is the 1995 Habeas Corpus Reform \n     constitutional?\n       Yes. This law is presumed to be constitutional. It has been \n     upheld as constitutional in Felker v. Turpin, 116 S. Ct. 2333 \n     (1996). Again, I have no personal views that would prevent me \n     from following applicable law in this or any other area.\n       If confirmed, you will preside over many employment \n     discrimination cases as a federal judge.\n       3. In a suit challenging a government racial preference, \n     quota, or set-aside, will you follow the 1995 Adarand v. Pena \n     decision and subject that racial preference to the strictest \n     judicial scrutiny?\n       Yes, if confirmed, I will follow Adarand v. Pena and \n     subject any government racial preference, quota, or set-aside \n     to the strictest judicial scrutiny.\n       4. In your legal opinion, how difficult is it for any \n     government program or statue to survive strict scrutiny?\n       It is extremely difficult for a government racial \n     preference, quota, or set-aside to survive strict scrutiny. \n     The program or statute must be narrowly tailored to meet a \n     compelling state interest. Adarand v. Pena makes it clear \n     that this is a very heavy burden to overcome.\n       5. Is the California Civil Rights Initiative \n     constitutional?\n       Yes. In Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson, 122 F. 3d \n     692 (9th Cir.), Cert. den., 118 S. Ct. 397 (1997), the Ninth \n     Circuit upheld the initiative.\n\n[[Page S6757]]\n\n       6. Is there a constitutional right to homosexual marriage \n     under the U.S. Constitution?\n       Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 185 (1986), and the Defense of \n     Marriage Act, which is presumptively constitutional, indicate \n     that there is no constitutional right to homosexual marriage \n     under the United States Constitution. I have no personal \n     belief that would prevent me from following applicable law in \n     this or any other area.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support Susan Oki Mollway's \nnomination to the federal district court in Hawaii. Her nomination has \nnow been pending before the Senate for two-and-a-half years. It is long \npast time to confirm this able nominee.\n  Ms. Mollway's credentials are impressive. She is a Harvard Law School \nGraduate and a partner at a prestigious Hawaii law firm, where her \npractice has included complex civil litigation. In 1987, she was voted \nOutstanding Woman Lawyer by the Hawaii Women Lawyers. She successfully \nargued a case before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1994.\n  Ms. Mollway has the support of every member of Hawaii's congressional \ndelegation, and the federal judges in Hawaii hold her in the highest \nregard. She would be the first Asian-American woman to sit on the \nfederal bench.\n  Some of our colleagues opppose this nomination because Ms. Mollway \nserved on the Board of Directors of the ACLU in Hawaii, at a time when \nthe ACLU was active in the same-sex marriage debate in that state. In \nfact, much of the ACLU's involvement in that debate took place long \nbefore Ms. Mollway became a member of the Board of Directors. In \naddition, Ms. Mollway has emphatically stated that she never voted on \nthe position the ACLU should take on this issue or on any other \nlitigation or legislation. The opposition to her nomination is \nunjustified, and it is no basis for denying confirmation.\n  Unfortunately, Ms. Mollway is just one of the many well-qualified \nwomen and minority nominees who have been arbitrarily delayed by the \nSenate and subjected to unfair ideological hazing.\n  In fact, in this Republican Senate, women are four times more likely \nthan men to be held up for more than a year. Forty-three percent of the \nnominees currently on the Senate calendar are women. In the last three \nmonths, the Senate Republican leadership has allowed only one woman to \nbe confirmed to the federal bench, while confirming 15 men. And, 16 out \nof 21 --that's 76 percent--of the nominees carried over from last \nyear's session are women or minorities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Ms. Mollway's nomination. It is time \nto end the logjam of qualified women and minority nominees. It is time \nto provide relief to the federal district court in Hawaii, whose \ncaseload has doubled in the last five years. It is long past time to \nconfirm Susan Oki Mollway. Her qualifications are outstanding and I am \nconfident that she will serve with great distinction on that court. \nFrankly, the Senate should confirm her--and apologize to her as well.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I want to say a couple of words about \nthis nomination. I am very pleased that Susan Mollway's nomination has \nfinally reached the Senate floor. As others have noted, it is a long, \nlong time in coming. I am told that it has taken 2\\1/2\\ years. But \ntoday she is finally going to get a vote, and I am confident that she \nwill be confirmed.\n  I think it is quite an impressive story. Susan Mollway, first \nnominated for the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii in \nDecember of 1995, was reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on April 25 of 1996. Nothing happened, of course, with that \nnomination, and she was renominated again on January 7 of 1997 and \nagain reported out favorably by the Judiciary Committee.\n  She must be the most patient woman in the world. For all this time, \nwith all this uncertainty, with all of the implications professionally, \nit has been a long wait, not only for her, but for Hawaii.\n  The seat which Ms. Mollway has been nominated to has been vacant now \nfor 3 years, since April of 1995. Were it not for the extraordinary \npersistence of our colleagues from Hawaii, the senior Senator, Daniel \nInouye, and the junior Senator, Daniel Akaka, we would not be here this \nafternoon. It is only their persistence and the extraordinary \ncredibility and, frankly, persistence that they have demonstrated for \nall this time that we are now celebrating this moment.\n  Their persistence is well invested. Susan Mollway is fully qualified \nand will be an extraordinary credit to the bench. She is a partner in \nthe Honolulu law firm of Cades, Schutte, Fleming and Wright where she \nwent upon graduation from Harvard Law School.\n  She has practiced in a broad range of areas, including a successful \nargument before the U.S. Supreme Court. She has won numerous awards, \nincluding the Hawaii Women Lawyers' Outstanding Woman Lawyer Award in \n1987.\n  The granddaughter of a ``picture bride'' and a plantation worker in \nHawaii, Ms. Mollway and her family have learned strength and commitment \nfrom their story. Her father left high school during World War II to \njoin a Japanese-American unit of the U.S. Army. Together with Senator \nInouye, he fought in Europe as part of the 442nd Regiment Combat Team, \nthe most decorated military unit of its size in World War II. At the \nsame time, people he knew were among the thousands of Japanese-\nAmericans interned by our own Federal Government. Later, Ms. Mollway's \nfather used his veteran's benefits to attend Harvard. Clearly, his \ndaughter now understands the great joy and honor of being an American, \nbut also the burdens and barriers faced by some in our society.\n  We are all proud of the distance we have come as a society in ending \nthe kind of discrimination faced by Japanese-Americans of Ms. Mollway's \nfather's generation, but the confirmation of this judge to be now U.S. \ndistrict judge will mark yet another step in this progress. Susan \nMollway is an outstanding nominee and deserves to be confirmed.\n  I, again, congratulate my two colleagues from Hawaii, and I call upon \nall of my colleagues to vote in her favor in 40 minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSessions and I be permitted to yield back the remainder of our time and \nthat at the hour of 5 p.m., a rollcall vote be taken on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, may I change that to 5:10?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Does the Senator wish to request the yeas and nays at this time?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6751-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Madam President, only 52 legislative days remain in this \nsession. Dozens of nominations are pending, and more than 400 items are \non the calendar. Being an election year, this\n\n[[Page S6758]]\n\nis a recipe for the explosion of a little-known procedure, but one that \nis extraordinarily important as the Senate moves to the end of the \nsession. I speak today about the issue of secret holds on nominations \nand legislation before this body.\n  Nowhere in the Constitution nor in our Federal statutes is there any \nmention of the right of a U.S. Senator to put a secret hold on a bill \nor a nomination. Nevertheless, this power is one of the two or three \nmost significant powers that a Member of the U.S. Senate can have. In \neffect, this power allows any Member of the U.S. Senate, in secret, to \nblock a nomination or a piece of legislation from even being considered \non the floor of this body.\n  I have talked to citizens at home about this. They are stunned that \nany Member of the U.S. Senate would have the power to be able to block \nsomething. But what really galls them is the right to do it in secret \nwithout there being any accountability whatsoever.\n  I am of the view that it is appropriate that Members of the U.S. \nSenate, in efforts to represent our constituents, have the power to \nmake decisions that are going to affect dramatically the lives of \nmillions of Americans. But I think that extraordinary power ought to be \naccompanied by real responsibility. Certainly if one Member of the U.S. \nSenate is going to block this body from even considering a bill or a \nnomination, it should be accompanied by public disclosure.\n  Our friend, Senator Grassley, has come on to the floor. The Presiding \nOfficer and our colleagues know that for more than a year he and I have \nbeen trying to bring some sunshine to the U.S. Senate. We have been \ntrying to change the rules so that if a Member does singlehandedly seek \nto block a nomination or a bill from coming to this floor, they would \nbe required, as part of the Standing Order of the Senate, to stipulate \nin the Congressional Record that they were, in fact, that individual.\n  We are moving to that part of the legislative session where the \nsecret hold is most abused. Very shortly, in this body we will begin a \ngame that I call legislative hide and seek. We will have holds on \nnominations and bills. Outside this Capitol Building there will be \nlobbyists trying to figure out who has put a secret hold on a \nparticular bill or nomination. And this entire process contributes to \nthe cynicism and skepticism that so many Americans have about our \ngovernment today.\n  Madam President and colleagues, it came to light in the fall of \n1997--which, as we all know, wasn't an election year--that there were \n42 holds in play at one time. As I mentioned, this game of legislative \nhide and seek was underway outside these Chambers.\n  At that time, Senator Grassley and I were able to win on a voice vote \nan amendment to change the Senate's Standing Orders to require public \ndisclosure of a hold. But then, in what was really the ultimate irony, \nour effort to end secret holds was secretly killed in a conference \ncommittee and vanished when the D.C. appropriations bill was brought \nback before the Senate.\n  I hope now with just over 50 legislative days remaining, that the \nSenate would on a bipartisan basis change this particular longstanding \ntradition--a tradition noted nowhere in the Constitution, our Federal \nstatutes or Senate rules--and bring some openness and some sunshine to \nthis body.\n  The hold started out as simply an effort to try to accommodate our \ncolleagues. If a Member of the U.S. Senate had a spouse who was ill or \na relative who faced a particular problem, they could, on a Monday, \nsay, ``I can't be there on Tuesday, would it be possible to hold things \nover for a couple of days so I could address a matter that was \nimportant to my constituents?''\n  That is not what Senator Grassley and I are talking about. We are not \ntalking about the right of a Senator to be present to discuss an issue \nimportant to them and to their constituents. We are talking about \nmaking sure that when a Member of the U.S. Senate digs in and digs in \nto block a particular nomination or a bill from either coming to the \nfloor or ever being considered at all, that at that point they would be \nrequired to disclose publicly that they are the individual who is \nblocking consideration by the Senate.\n  Under our amendment no Member of the U.S. Senate would lose their \npower to place a hold on a bill. A Senator's power would be absolutely \nunchanged with respect to the right to place a hold on legislation. All \nthat Senator Grassley and I are saying is when you put on that hold, be \nstraight with the American people. Let the Senate and let the American \npeople know that you are the person who feels strongly about a \nparticular issue. Make sure that it is possible, then, for us to find \nout where in the discussion of a particular nomination or piece of \nlegislation the Senate is considering there is a problem. This has not \nbeen the case, and this situation is getting increasingly serious.\n  In the two years since I have been here I have seen more and more \nabuse of this process. We are seeing in a number of instances that even \nthe Senators themselves don't know that a hold is being placed in their \nname. I have had Senators come to me and say, ``I learned that one of \nmy staff''--or someone else's staff--``put a hold on a bill,'' and the \nSenator I was working with didn't even know that a hold had been placed \non the legislation.\n  This ought to be an easy reform for the U.S. Senate. It simply would \nrequire openness, public disclosure, and an opportunity for every \nMember of the Senate and for the American people to know who, in fact, \nfeels sufficiently strongly about that bill, that they are the one \nkeeping this body from considering it.\n  A number of public interest organizations and opinion leaders have \ncome out in favor of the effort being pursued by myself and Senator \nGrassley. I will close my opening remarks and then yield my time to \nSenator Grassley, with just a quick statement from a Washington Post \neditorial that came out in favor of this effort.\n  The Washington Post said:\n\n       It's time members of the Senate stand up and answer to each \n     other and the public for such actions. What are they scared \n     of?\n\n  That, Madam President, is what this issue is all about. It doesn't \npass the smell test to keep this information from the American people. \nThere is not a town meeting in our country where it is possible for a \nMember of the U.S. Senate to say, ``I'm involved in making decisions \nthat affect millions of people and billions of dollars, but you know, \nI'm not going to tell you anything about it. I'm not going to let you \nin on this particular procedure.''\n  Again, this is a procedure that has evolved over the years, that is \nwritten down nowhere, not in the rules, not in the statutes, and not \neven in the Constitution.\n  Madam President, it is time to ensure that when Senators exercise the \nextraordinary powers that we are accorded in the Constitution and the \nlaws of our land, that those powers be met with responsibility, powers \nthat make it clear that when there is legislation affecting billions of \ndollars and countless Americans that we are going to let the public in \non the way the Senate does its business.\n  Senator Grassley and I filed our amendment to the Department of \nDefense authorization bill. It is our intention to bring this \nbipartisan amendment before the Senate at the earliest opportunity. We \nwant to make it very clear that between now and the fall, when we are \nlikely to have 60, 70, 80 secret holds and this game of hide and seek \nis being played all over the Capitol, Senator Grassley and I want to \nhave the Senate rules changed so that the public will know at the end \nof a session how and when these important decisions are being made.\n  Before I conclude, let me just say to my colleague from Iowa, who has \njoined us on the floor to speak after me this afternoon, I have enjoyed \nworking with him on many issues. I serve on the Senate Aging Committee, \nwhich he so ably Chairs, but I am particularly appreciative of the \nchance to work with him on this issue. We have had a bipartisan team \npursuing this matter for many, many months. We want it understood that \nthere is absolutely nothing partisan, nothing Democrat, nothing \nRepublican, about our desire to bring real openness and accountability \nto the U.S. Senate. This isn't about partisan politics. This is about \ngood government. This is about making sure that in the last days of a \nSenate session we are no longer playing legislative hide and seek, but \nare making decisions in a way that we are accountable to the public, \nand that the American people can follow. We want to contribute to \nconfidence in the way the\n\n[[Page S6759]]\n\nSenate does its business, rather than to what we face today, which is \nadditional skepticism and cynicism by virtue of the fact that the \nSenate does so much business at the end of a session in secret.\n  I thank my colleague from Iowa, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Parliamentary inquiry. Is there any time limits? I know \nwe vote at 5:00.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business until 5:10, \nat which time a vote will occur.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, before I start to debate this issue, I \nshould say thank you to my colleague from Oregon for his leadership in \nthis area. He has worked very hard on it. I have been very happy to be \nsupportive of him--and I am fully supportive of him. I have told him \nhow secret holds have affected me and now both he and I practice what \nwe preach--that is, we declare our intentions to put a hold on a piece \nof legislation if we decide to take that action. Obviously, being open \nabout placing a hold has worked for us and it is a sound practice.\n  I want to state the proposition that eventually what is right is \ngoing to win out in the Senate. I know that constituents are skeptical \nabout right winning out in this body, and I suppose sometimes it takes \na long time for right to win out; but I believe if you feel you are in \nthe right, and that you are pursuing the right course of action and, \nparticularly, as in this case, when your opponents don't have a lot to \nsay about what you are trying to do, I think you can be confident that \nyou are pretty much on the right course. There wasn't much opposition \nto this expressed on the floor of the Senate last year. My guess is \nthat there won't be a lot expressed this year either, and eventually we \nwill win. I think we will win this year. But if we don't, we are going \nto win sometime on this proposition because it is so right and because \nwe are not going to give up.\n  I know persistence pays because it took me about 6 years, ending in \n1995, to get Congress covered by a lot of legislation that it exempted \nitself from. A lot of laws were applicable to the rest of the country \nand were not applicable to those of us on Capitol Hill. That was wrong. \nIt was recognized as being wrong. So I presented the motions to \naccomplish the goal of getting Congress to obey the laws everyone else \nhad to follow. They were hardly ever argued against on the floor of \nthis assembly. But in the ``dark dungeons'' where conference committees \nare held, somehow those provisions were taken out--until after about 6 \nyears of discussing the issue of congressional exemptions, and the \npublic becoming more aware of this shameful situation, finally there \nwas enough embarrassment brought to Congress that we could not keep \nthat exemption from those laws any longer. So we passed the \nCongressional Accountability Act early in 1995. It was the first bill \nsigned that year by the President of the United States. We have ended \nthose exemptions that were so wrong.\n  I still remember that, early on in that period of time, how my \ncolleagues would just say privately to me, ``What a terrible \ncatastrophe it is going to be for the Congress to have to live under \nthese laws that apply to the rest of the Nation''--laws like civil \nrights laws, worker safety laws, et cetera. We have had to live under \nthose laws for 3 years now, and it hasn't harmed us at all. It has been \ngood for the country to have those of us that make laws have to \nactually understand the bureaucratic morass and red tape you have to go \nthrough to meet those laws, and some of the conditions on employment, \nsome of the working conditions in the office, some of the wage and hour \nissues that private employers have to go through. We understand those \nnow. We have to be sympathetic to their arguments more because we have \nto live under those laws.\n  Well, that is one example of right ultimately winning. That brings me \nto what is right about this. There are plenty of reasons for holds, and \nthere is nothing really wrong with holds. There is nothing that our \nlegislation says is wrong with holds. But the reasons can be purely \npolitical. Sometimes holds are put on for one colleague to use as \nleverage with another colleague, to move something that maybe another \nindividual is blocking. There can be truly flawed legislation, and \nmaybe there such holds legitimately allow more time to work things out. \nHowever, other holds can be purely a stalling tactic. A hold could be \nall could be for all of those reasons and more. It doesn't matter what \nthe reason is. We don't find fault with those reasons. We only say that \nthe people that are exercising the hold, for whatever reason, ought to \nsay so, and why.\n  It is going to cause the Senate, I think, with our amendment, to be \nrun more openly and efficiently. It is going to lift one of the veils \nof secrecy. It is not going to lift all of the veils of secrecy in a \nparliamentary body. I don't know that I would call that all of them be \nlifted. I am not sure I could even enumerate all of the layers of \nsecrecy that might go on. But this is one form of secrecy that is not \nlegitimate.\n  As I said, we do not ban holds or the use of them, for whatever \nreason they might be made. We just stipulate that they must be made \npublic so that we know who is putting the hold on. We would like to \nknow why the hold is being put on, but that is not even a requirement \nin our legislation. Just tell who you are. You don't even have to say \nwhy. It is pretty simple. It is pretty reasonable.\n  A lot of my colleagues, I think, fear retribution. If they are \nputting a hold on for a legitimate reason, why should they have to fear \nthat? Maybe the greater good of the body, the greater good of the \ncountry would be their motivation. They might think they would \nexperience some sort of retribution and that is why they may not want \ntheir hold to be known. I say that, after 2 or 3 years of practicing \nopen holds myself, there is no fear of a hold being known. I can tell \nyou this: I probably was somewhat nervous the first time I announced \nthat I was going to make public in the Congressional Record why I was \nputting a hold on. I thought that maybe I was opening myself up to a \nlot of retribution, a lot of trouble that I don't need. I probably \ndon't use holds very often. You could probably count the number of \ntimes on one hand that I would use a hold in the course of a Congress. \nRegardless, the times that I have done it, I can tell you that there is \nno pain. No harm came to me. There is no retribution that came to me as \na result of it from any of my colleagues. And 98 others beside Senator \nWyden and myself could do that, and they don't.\n  I can tell you about the problems I have had finding out who has a \nhold, why they have a hold; and then we have had these rotating holds \nwhere somebody has found out and some friend will put a hold on in his \nplace. You run those things down. It is not a very productive way to be \na Senator. If I can go to the Congressional Record and find out who \ndoesn't like my proposition, who doesn't like this nominee, et cetera, \nI can go to that individual and just talk up front about the reason, \nand I think it will even speed up the work of the Senate. If each \nSenator can be a little more efficient, then the Senate is going to be \na little more efficient body as a whole.\n  So this is one of those things that, from every angle--every reason \nfor making a hold open is a good reason. Look at all of the prospective \nopposition to it and the reasons for the opposition. First of all, \npeople don't very freely express opposition to it. But when they do \nexpress an argument against making holds open, it is not a very good \nreason to be against it. When you have these public policy arguments \nfor making holds open that are good, good, good, why should we waste \nany time? They just ought to be adopted; they ought to be a part of the \npractice and make the public's business more public. That is what the \nWyden-Grassley amendment is all about. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport us in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss our archaic \nand unjust Federal Dairy Policy: it is hopelessly out-of-date, \ncompletely out-of-touch with reality and an outrageous way to treat the \nhard-working dairy farmers of the Upper Midwest, particularly \nWisconsin.\n  Federal dairy policy has been putting small dairy farms out of \nbusiness at an alarming rate, Madam President. The Northeast loses 200 \ndairy farms per year, which is bad enough. Meanwhile, Wisconsin is \nlosing 200 per month, which is disastrous. That's about 5 dairy farms \nper day! The greatest force driving Wisconsin's dairy farmers out of \nbusiness and off the land is the current structure of the Federal Dairy \nProgram.\n  The Federal Dairy Program was developed back in the 1930's, when the \nUpper Midwest was seen as the primary producer of fluid milk. The idea \nwas to encourage the development of local supplies of milk in other \nareas of the country that had not produced enough to meet local needs. \nIt wasn't a bad idea for the 1930's, but those days are gone.\n  Six decades ago, the poor condition of America's transportation \ninfrastructure and the lack of portable refrigeration technology \nprevented Upper Midwest producers from shipping fresh fluid milk to \nother parts of the country. Providing an artificial boost to milk \nprices in other regions to encourage local production made sense, in \nthe 1930's, that is.\n  So, in 1937, we passed legislation authorizing higher prices outside \nthe Upper Midwest. These artificial bumps in prices are referred to as \nClass I differentials. Mr. President, this system is sometimes referred \nto as the ``Eau Claire'' system. Do you know why? Believe it or not, \nit's called the Eau Claire system because it allows dairy farmers to \nreceive a higher price for their milk in proportion to the distance of \ntheir farms from Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n  So the farther away you are from Eau Claire the better off you are. A \ndairy farmer, as any dairy farmer from Wisconsin, would tell you that a \nbetter name really for this system is the anti-Eau Claire system, \nbecause it doesn't treat farmers very well who live close to Eau \nClaire, Wisconsin.\n  The system's entire purpose was designed to put dairy farmers in \nWisconsin and its neighboring states at a disadvantage. And \nunfortunately it worked well--too well. Now, we look on as trucks from \nother regions of the country come into Wisconsin, historically \nAmerica's dairyland, with milk to be processed into cheese and yogurt. \nThe current Federal Dairy Program is now working only to shortchange \nthe Upper Midwest, and in particular, Wisconsin dairy farmers.\n  Madam President, it's time to change a system that is completely out \nof date and is short-changing upper Midwest dairy farmers to the brink \nof extinction.\n  But, instead, we have further aggravated the inequities of the \nFederal milk marketing orders system. Despite the discrimination \nagainst dairy farmers in Wisconsin under the Eau Claire rule, the 1996 \nFarm Bill provided the final nail in the coffin when it authorized the \nformation of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.\n  Madam President, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact sounds \nbenign, but its effect has been anything but, magnifying the existing \ninequities of the system. It establishes a commission for six \nNortheastern States--Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, \nRhode Island, and Connecticut.\n  The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission is empowered to set \nminimum prices for fluid milk higher even than those established under \nFederal Milk Marketing Orders. Never mind that the Federal milk \nmarketing order system, under the Eau Claire rule, already provided \nfarmers in the region with minimum prices higher than those received by \nmost other dairy farmers throughout the nation.\n  The compact not only allows the six States to set artificially high \nprices for their producers, it allows them to block entry of lower \npriced milk from producers in competing States. To give them an even \nbigger advantage, processors in the region get a subsidy to export \ntheir higher priced milk to noncompact States. It's a windfall for \nNortheast dairy farmers. It's also plainly unfair and unjust to the \nrest of the country.\n  Who can defend this system with a straight face? This compact amounts \nto nothing short of government-sponsored price fixing. It's \noutrageously unfair, and it's also bad policy: It blatantly interferes \nwith interstate commerce and wildly distorts the marketplace by \nerecting artificial barriers around one specially protected region of \nthe Nation; it arbitrarily provides preferential price treatment for \nfarmers in the Northeast at the expense of farmers in other regions who \nwork just as hard, who love their homes just as much and whose products \nare just as good or better; it irresponsibly encourages excess milk \nproduction in one region without establishing effective supply control. \nThis practice flaunts basic economic principles and ignores the obvious \nrisk that it will drive down milk prices for producers everywhere else \nin the country; you don't often hear about it but the compact imposes \nhigher retail milk prices on the millions of consumers in the Compact \nregion; it also imposes higher costs on every taxpayer because we all \npay for nutrition programs such as food stamps and the national school \nlunch programs that provide milk and other dairy products.\n  As a price-fixing device, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact is \nunprecedented in the history of this Nation. In its breadth and its \ndisregard for economic reality, it's in a class by itself.\n  Madam President, in addition to the current problems, language in the \nreported Agriculture Appropriations bill in the other body extends \nUSDA's rulemaking period by six months, thereby extending the life of \nthe Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact by six months. Wisconsin's \nproducers cannot withstand another six months of these unfair pricing \npolicies.\n  Wisconsin's dairy farmers are being economically crippled by these \npolicies. It's time to bring justice to federal dairy policy, and give \nWisconsin dairy farmers a fair shot in the market place.\n  In an effort to repair some of the damage that sixty years of this \nawful system has caused, I have worked with colleagues to bring the \ntrue nature of this system to light and offer some alternatives.\n  To strike at the heart of the problem, I have introduced legislation \nin the Senate to kill the notorious Eau Claire system. The measure \nsimply would forbid USDA from using Eau Claire, Wisconsin as the sole \nbasing point when pricing milk.\n  And I am cosponsoring legislation to repeal the Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact. I'm working hard to prevent the compact's extension and \nexpansion, and to prevent the formation of other regional dairy \ncompacts. Compacts of this kind are unfair and they need to be \nabolished along with this entire system which has been plaguing \nWisconsin farmers for more than sixty years.\n\n  Also, I have cosponsored the Dairy Reform Act of 1998, introduced by \nSenator Grams, which establishes that the minimum Class I price \ndifferential will be the same for each marketing order at $1.80/\nhundredweight. What could be more fair than that? Given a level playing \nfield, I know Wisconsin farmers can compete against any farmers in the \nnation.\n  The Dairy Reform Act ensures that the Class I differentials will no \nlonger vary according to an arbitrary geographic measure--like the \ndistance from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. This legislation identifies one of \nthe most bizarre and unjustly punitive provisions in the current \nsystem, and corrects it. There is no justification to support non-\nuniform Class I differentials in present day policy.\n  I first learned of the profound inequity of the Federal dairy program\n\n[[Page S6761]]\n\nwhen I served in the Wisconsin State Legislature. There, I spearheaded \nthe effort to provide state funds for a lawsuit against the United \nStates Department of Agriculture. Challenging the system, we argued \nthat USDA had no sound and justifiable economic basis for their milk \npricing system. The states of Wisconsin and Minnesota, working \ntogether, repeated that argument relentlessly in the courts for over \nten years in an effort to beat back the system.\n  In November of last year, the people of Wisconsin and Minnesota won \nthat case. Federal District Judge David Doty ruled in favor of a more \nequitable dairy pricing system and enjoined the Secretary of \nAgriculture from enforcing USDA's ``arbitrary and capricious'' Class I \ndifferentials. Madam President, in other words, a federal judge could \nfind no rational justification for this archaic system and ruled the \nwhole scheme illegal.\n  Although the case is now in the appellate court, I am optimistic that \nDoty's ruling will be upheld. As I said, Judge Doty found the current \npricing system ``arbitrary and capricious.''\n  Most recently, the USDA came up with a proposed rule that included \ntwo different options to replace the old system: Option 1A is virtually \nidentical to the status quo and is totally unacceptable to the majority \nof Wisconsin dairy farmers. Option 1B is a modest step in the right \ndirection and a good place to begin reform efforts. I was optimistic \nwhen Secretary Glickman announced USDA's proposed rule for milk \nmarketing order reform and his stated preference for Option 1B.\n  If there was any question of the intense, personal effect this \ndiscriminatory policy has on Wisconsin's dairy farmers, I would hope, \nafter visiting with over 500 producers, consumer advocates, and local \nofficials at an informal hearing in Green Bay, that USDA's doubts could \nbe put to rest.\n  At the USDA listening session in Green Bay, more than 500 people \nshowed up, demanding a fair shake. At the sessions in New York, Georgia \nand Texas, a total of 240 people showed up. Wisconsin had more than \ndouble the attendance than the other locations combined. That \ndifference in attendance didn't happen just because of Wisconsin's \ntradition of good citizenship. They showed up in Green Bay by the \nhundreds because they know they are getting a raw deal. Those \nWisconsinites showed up to demand reform. They showed up to demand a \nbetter system, a chance to preserve economic viability and the \nopportunity to continue their way of life.\n  Day after day, season after season, we are losing small farms at an \nalarming rate. While these operations disappear, we are seeing the \nemergence of larger dairy farms. The trend toward fewer but larger \ndairy operations is mirrored in most States throughout the Nation. The \neconomic losses associated with the reduction in the number of small \nfarms go well beyond the impact on the individual farm families who \nmust wrest themselves from the land.\n  The loss of these farms has hurt their rural communities, where small \nfamily-owned dairy farms are the key to economic stability. They \ndeserve better: we need a system in which their farms are viable and \ntheir work can be fairly rewarded.\n  In conclusion, I will continue to work with Wisconsin family farmers \nand other concerned Wisconsinites in the fight to preserve and protect \nour family dairy farms by restoring some semblance of fairness and \neconomic integrity to our outdated, out-of-touch, milk pricing system. \nIn the process, we will save an important piece of American \nagricultural history and a priceless part of Wisconsin's culture.\n  As USDA considers Federal Milk Marketing Order reform, I urge the \nDepartment to set aside 60 years of inequality and senseless \nregionalism to do what is best for this nation's dairy industry. These \npolicies are out-of-date, out-of-touch and, frankly, an outrageous way \nto treat Wisconsin dairy farmers. For those farmers, who are watching \nas their neighbors sell their livestock to cover their bills and \nabandon the land of their parents and grandparents, USDA's decision \ncould mean the demise or the survival of their way of life. It is time \nto do the right thing on dairy pricing policy. Wisconsin farmers demand \nit, Wisconsin's consumers demand it, and, above all, Justice demands \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6760-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to talk about an effort under \nway in this Congress to hamstring the agency charged with enforcing the \nFederal election laws--the Federal Election Commission. This effort is \nhappening very quietly under the guise of routine agency \nappropriations, but it has deadly serious consequences in terms of the \nindependence of the Federal Election Commission. I think it is \nimportant to call the Senate's attention to it and give notice that I \nintend to do everything in my power to make sure it doesn't happen.\n  Here is what is happening. The Appropriations Committee of the other \nbody has included a provision in the funding bill for the FEC that \nwould result in the firing of the Commission's general counsel and \nstaff director. That's right, Madam President. The Congress is now \ngoing to get involved in the personnel decisions of the FEC, the agency \nthat we have charged with overseeing us and the way we conduct our \nreelection campaigns. Some in the Congress want to fire two career \ncivil servants who are simply trying to do their job to make campaign \ninformation available to the public and enforce the election laws.\n\n  Lawrence Noble, the General Counsel, has served the agency since \n1987. John Surina, the Staff Director, has been in that position since \n1983. These are not political appointees. They were put in their jobs \nby a bipartisan majority vote of the Commission, as required by law. In \nfact, both of these individuals were unanimously approved by the FEC \nwhen they were appointed. They provide crucial institutional \ncontinuity, especially now that, as of last year, we have put a one-\nterm limit on the Commissioners themselves.\n  But now, unfortunately, some members of Congress apparently don't \nlike some things that the Commission has done. And so they are trying \nto engineer, what I would call, a quiet coup. They want to require that \nthese two staff positions be refilled every four years by an \naffirmative vote of four Commissioners. And they specify that this \nrequirement will apply to the current occupants of the positions. So \nMr. Noble and Mr. Surina will lose their jobs at the end of this year, \nunless the Commission votes to reappoint them.\n\n  Of course, the Commission itself is in great turmoil. Only two \nmembers are serving the terms to which they were appointed. Two members \nare holdovers, their terms having expired in April 1995. A fifth member \nis also a holdover, although the President has resubmitted his name. \nAnd the sixth slot has been vacant since October 1995. So the Congress \nhas hardly been blameless if the Commission seems at times to be at \nsea. And now here we are about to create two other vacancies, more \nturmoil and lack of direction at this crucial agency.\n  Madam President, specifying by law that top staff positions in the \nagency must be refilled every four years is unprecedented. The \nCongressional Research Service has told me that there are three \nindependent agencies--the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the \nFederal Labor Relations Authority, and the National Labor Relations \nBoard--where the General Counsel is actually a political appointee, \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In each of \nthese cases, the General Counsel has direct statutory authority.\n  But in every other independent agency, including the FEC--and there \nare lots of agencies, Madam President--the FCC, the SEC, the CPSC, the \nFTC, the CFTC, and many more. In all of these agencies, the General \nCounsel is appointed by either the Chairman or the entire body.\n  And guess how many of those General Counsels are required to be fired \nafter four years unless they are reappointed and reconfirmed by the \nappointing entity. The answer is none. Not one.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum from the \nCongressional Research Service on this issue be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: Honorable Russell D. Feingold, Attention: Bob Schiff.\n     From: Rogelio Garcia, Specialist in American National \n         Government, Government Division.\n     Subject: Appointments to Positions of General Counsel and of \n         Staff Director on Independent Regulatory and Other \n         Collegial Boards and Commissions.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ See footnotes at end of memorandum.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       This memorandum responds to your request for information \n     regarding appointments to the position of general counsel and \n     of staff director, or its equivalent, or independent \n     regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions. \n     Specifically, you inquired about the number of such positions \n     to which the President makes appointments with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate. You also wanted to know if the \n     positions included a fixed term of office, and, if they did, \n     what happened to the incumbent when the term expired.\n       The position of general counsel at three of 32 independent \n     regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions is \n     subject to Senate confirmation. (The position of staff \n     director, where it exists is not subject to Senate \n     confirmation in any of the 32 agencies.) The three requiring \n     Senate confirmation are the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission (EEOC), Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), \n     and National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The general \n     counsel positions at the three agencies are for fixed terms \n     of office. At the EEOC, the general counsel is appointed to a \n     4-year term, and remains in office at the end of the term \n     until replaced (42 U.S.C. 2000e-4(b)); at the FLRA, the \n     general counsel is appointed to a 5-year term, and must leave \n     office when the term expires (5 U.S.C. 7104(f)(1)); and at \n     the NLRB, the general counsel is appointed to a 4-year term \n     and must leave office when the term expires (29 U.S.C. \n     153(d)).\n       It appears that the above three general counsel positions \n     were made subject to Senate confirmation because of the \n     special responsibilities assigned directly to them by \n     statute. The general counsel for the EEOC is charged directly \n     with responsibility for the conduct of litigation regarding \n     the commission's enforcement provisions and civil actions.\\2\\ \n     The general counsel for the FLRA has direct statutory \n     authority to investigate alleged unfair labor practices and \n     file and prosecute complaints, as well as ``direct authority \n     over, and responsibility for, all employees in the office of \n     General Counsel, including employees of the General Counsel \n     in the regional offices . . .'' \\3\\ Finally, the general \n     counsel for the NLRB ``exercise[s] general supervision over \n     all attorneys employed by the Board (other than \n     administrative law judges and legal assistants to Board \n     members) and over the officers and employees in the regional \n     offices, and has final authority, on behalf of the Board, in \n     respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of \n     complaints under [29 U.S.C. 160], and in respect of the \n     prosecution of such complaints before the Board . . .'' \\4\\\n       The general counsels at the other 29 agencies, and the \n     staff director, where the position exists, are appointed \n     either by the agency's governing board, i.e., the board of \n     directors, or the chairman, subject to the general policies, \n     directives, or approval of the governing board. In at least \n     nine agencies, the governing board appoints the general \n     counsel, staff director, and other employees.\\5\\ In at least \n     five agencies, the chairman, governed by the policies and \n     directives of the governing body, makes the appointment.\\6\\ \n     In two agencies, the chairman makes the appointment on \n     ``behalf of the commission.'' \\7\\ In one agency, the chairman \n     appoints the general counsel and staff director, as well as \n     certain other officers, subject to the approval of the \n     commission.\\8\\ Finally, in one agency, the chairman makes the \n     appointment subject to disapproval by a majority vote of the \n     commissioners.\\9\\ None of the appointments is for a fixed \n     term of office. They are all indefinite appointments, and, \n     with two exceptions, the incumbents may be removed at any \n     time by the appointing authority.\\10\\\n       If I may be of further assistance, please call me at 7-\n     8687.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The position of general counsel in large independent \n     agencies, and at the department level as opposed to the \n     administration or bureau level, in each executive department \n     is subject to Senate confirmation.

Madam President, this is a whole new procedure \ninvented, I have to assume, because some Members of Congress are, in \neffect, out to ``get'' Mr. Noble and Mr. Surina.\n  Oh, and by the way, there is not a single agency where the Staff \nDirector is a political appointee or has to be reappointed by the \ncommissioners themselves after a set term. Not one. Frankly, Madam \nPresident, the inclusion of the Staff Director in this provision in the \nHouse Appropriations bill seems to me to be a smokescreen designed to \nmake this provision seem even-handed. What is really going on here, I \nbelieve, is that some in the Congress are trying to send a message to \nMr. Noble, the General Counsel, and through him, to the Commission. \nSome powerful members of Congress don't like some of the cases that Mr. \nNoble has recommended bringing. So they want him out.\n  In recent years, the FEC has undertaken a number of controversial \nactions in an attempt to enforce the law that the Congress has written. \nSome of these cases have taken on powerful political figures or groups. \nThe FEC pursued a highly publicized case against GOPAC, a group closely \nconnected to the Speaker of the House. It has an ongoing action against \nthe Christian Coalition alleging that that group illegally coordinated \nits activities with Republican candidates. And, of course, it has \npursued cases and rulemaking proceedings under a more expansive \ndefinition of what constitutes express advocacy than some in this \nCongress believe is appropriate.\n  All of these actions are objectionable to people on the Republican \nside of the aisle. But let's remember that there is a flip side. The \nCommission has assessed significant fines against the 1992 Clinton \ncampaign and the Kentucky Democratic Party. It has pursued litigation \nagainst the National Organization for Women and has pending cases \nagainst the California Democratic Party concerning its use of soft \nmoney, and the advocacy group Public Citizen, alleging that it \ncoordinated its activities with a primary opponent of the Speaker of \nthe House.\n  The bottom line, Madam President, is that the FEC is trying to do its \njob, even when we in Congress don't give it adequate resources to do \nit. And there is another crucial point about these actions. Each and \nevery one of the cases or rulemakings I have mentioned was approved by \na majority of the Commission.\n  Now that is significant, Madam President, because unlike most \nagencies, the FEC is evenly balanced with Republican and Democratic \nmembers. It was carefully designed not to allow either party to have \ncontrol. So a General Counsel can't just work with one party. In order \nto file a case, he must get at least four votes from the Commission, \nincluding at least one from each party. Now that leads to problems \nsometimes, because if the Commission deadlocks, a General Counsel \nrecommendation cannot go forward. But the bottom line is that every \nofficial action of the FEC must be bipartisan.\n\n  So what we have here, Madam President, is an effort to intimidate. \nThe proponents of this firing want to punish the FEC's General Counsel \nfor bringing forward recommendations to enforce the law. Even though in \nall of the cases I have mentioned, a bipartisan majority of the \nCommission has agreed with him.\n  I should mention one other recommendation that Mr. Noble has made \nthat has not received a majority vote of the Commission, and so is not \ngoing forward yet. Mr. Noble has recommended that the Commission takes \nsteps to reduce or eliminate certain kinds of soft money contributions. \nAnd we know there are some powerful Members of this body who disagree \nwith that idea.\n  You know, it is really fascinating that some of the same people who \nare pushing this provision, trying to remove the current General \nCounsel say that we don't need to enact campaign finance reform, we \njust need to enforce current law. Well, you can't argue that we need to \nenforce current law and at the same time be trying to fire the chief \nlaw enforcement officer of the agency. That just doesn't make sense. If \nthis provision goes through, and Mr. Noble is relieved of his duties at \nthe end of the year, it may be months before a new General Counsel can \nbe chosen that will get the bipartisan support that is required. So \nright after the 1998 elections, there will be no one to head up the \ncrucially important enforcement functions of the FEC.\n  Madam President, we cannot let that happen. We need to let the \nprofessional staff of the FEC do its job. Surely the 3 to 3 party split \non the Commission is enough to make sure that the Commission doesn't go \noff on a partisan vendetta. Now we need to stop the partisan vendetta \nthat this proposal represents.\n  That is why I intend to offer an amendment when the FEC's \nappropriation bill comes to floor to make clear that the Senate does \nnot want this House proposal to be part of the final bill. And I will \nurge the President to veto this bill if it is included. I certainly \nhope, Madam President, that those who want to see our election laws \nenforced will vote with me when that amendment is offered.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6762-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

A bill to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to \nestablish a Marine Mammal Rescue Grant Program, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                 the marine mammal rescue fund of 1998\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nNew Jersey, Senator Lautenburg, to introduce the ``Marine Mammal Rescue \nFund of 1998.'' This legislation will amend the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act of 1972 by establishing a grant program that Marine \nMammal Stranding Centers and Networks can use to support the important \nwork they do in responding to marine mammal strandings and mortality \nevents.\n  Since the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972, 47 \nfacilities nationally have been authorized to handle the rehabilitation \nof stranded marine mammals and over 400 individuals and facilities \nacross the country are part of an authorized National Stranding Network \nthat responds to strandings and deaths.\n  Mr. President, these facilities and individuals provide our country \nwith a variety of critical services, including rescue, housing, care, \nrehabilitation, transport, and tracking of marine mammals and sea \nturtles, as well as assistance in investigating mortality events, \ntissue sampling, and removal of carcasses. They also work very closely \nwith the National Marine Fisheries Service, a variety of environmental \ngroups, and with state and local officials in rescuing, tracking and \nprotecting marine mammals and sea turtles on the Endangered Species \nList. Yet they rely primarily on private donations, fundraisers, and \nfoundation grants for their operating budgets. They receive no federal \nassistance, and a very few of them get some financial assistance from \ntheir states.\n  As an example, Mr. President, the Marine Mammal Stranding Center \nlocated in Brigantine in my home state of New Jersey was formed in \n1978. To-date, it has responded to over 1,500 calls for stranded \nwhales, dolphins, seals and sea turtles that have washed ashore on New \nJersey's beaches. It has also been called on to assist in strandings as \nfar away as Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Yet, their operating \nbudget for the past year was just under $300,000, with less than 6 \npercent ($17,000) coming from the state. Although the Stranding Center \nin Brigantine has never turned down a request for assistance with a \nstranding, trying to maintain that level of responsiveness and service \nbecomes increasingly more difficult each year.\n  Virtually all the money raised by the Center, Mr. President, goes to \npay for the feeding, care, and transportation of rescued marine \nmammals, rehabilitation (including medical care), insurance, day-to-day \noperation of the Center, and staff payroll. Too many times the staff \nare called upon to pay out-of-pocket expenses in travel, subsistence, \nand quarters while responding to strandings or mortality events.\n  Mr. President, this should not happen. These people are performing a \ngreat service to Americans across the country, and they are being asked \nto pay their own way as well. And when responding to mortality events, \nMr. President, they are performing work that protects public health and \nhelps assess the potential danger to human life and to other marine \nmammals.\n  I feel very strongly that we should be providing some support to the \npeople who are doing this work. To that end, Mr. President, the \nlegislation I am introducing would create the Marine Mammal Rescue Fund \nunder the Marine Mammal Protection Act. It would authorize funding at \n$5,000,000.00, annually, over the next five years, for grants to Marine \nMammal Stranding Centers and Stranding Network Members authorized by \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Grants would not exceed \n$100,000.00 per year, and would require a 25 percent non-federal \nfunding matching requirement.\n  I am proud to offer this legislation on behalf of the Stranding \nCenters across the country, and look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure its passage. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \nthe exclusion for amounts received under group legal services plans \npermanent; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     EXCLUSION FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYER-PROVIDED GROUP LEGAL SERVICES\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nreinstate, and make permanent, the employee exclusion for amounts \nreceived under qualified employer-provided group legal services plans.\n  This bill amends section 120 of the Internal Revenue Code and becomes \neffective for tax years beginning after June 30, 1998. It provides that \nan employee does not have to pay income and social security taxes for a \nqualified employer-provided group legal services plan. The annual \npremium is limited to $70 per person. In order to qualify, a plan must \nfulfill certain requirements, one of which states that benefits may not \ndiscriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.\n  The tax exclusion of group legal services is not a new provision. In \nfact, prior to its expiration in June of 1992, employees had been \nallowed to exclude such benefits from their gross income since 1976, \nalbeit through seven extensions from Congress. I believe it is time to \nreinstate this measure on a permanent basis.\n  Employer-provided group legal plans have time and again proven their \nvalue in extending low-cost legal advice to working Americans. The \nreality for middle class wage earners is that they cannot afford the \nservices of an attorney and thus cannot afford to obtain advice for \nissues relating to child support enforcement, adoptions, wills, \nlandlord/tenant situations and consumer debt problems. Because it \nprovides access to legal advice, this employer-provided benefit assists \nworking Americans in avoiding the family disintegration and job \ndisruption that can result from neglected legal issues.\n  In New York, these plans affect hundreds of thousands of employees \nand members of their families. These New Yorkers are employed as school \nteachers, municipal workers, hotel and hospital employees, law \nenforcement personnel and thousands working in our many service \nindustries. Many of our citizens, though employed, are earning enough \nonly for basic necessities.\n  A working mother seeking to enforce an order of child support gains \naccess to the assistance of a lawyer through these legal benefit plans \nand avoids the need to rely on public assistance. A consumer debt \nproblem can lead to a garnished salary, and eviction, the loss of a \njob, and dependency on public assistance. The relatively minor cost of \nproviding this favorable tax treatment is repaid innumerable times by \nkeeping the wage earner focused on his/her job, keeping a family in \nhousing and intact, and removing the threat to moderate income workers \nto remaining self-sufficient.\n  Employer-provided legal benefit packages produce economies in both \nthe purchase of legal services for a large group and in the delivery of \nthose services at a reduced price. Because they provide a cost-\neffective approach, these employer-sponsored legal benefit plans are in \nthe best American tradition of pragmatic, voluntary group action to \nmeet common needs.\n  Restoring equity to the tax treatment of this benefit by placing it \non equal footing with other statutory fringe benefits is a goal worth \nachieving. As an aspect of middle class tax relief, a high return on \nthe cost of this benefit is realized for the estimated 2.5 million \nworking Americans who gain access to critical legal advice through its \noperation.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason why we should not reinstate and \nmake permanent this tax exclusion. In the past, the Senate repeatedly \naffirmed its commitment to assuring the availability of legal services. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to restore fair tax \ntreatment of employer-provided group legal services.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2200\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF EXCLUSION FOR EMPLOYER-\n                   PROVIDED GROUP LEGAL SERVICE PLANS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--Subsection (e) of section 120 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to amounts received \n     under qualified group legal services plans) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(e) Termination.--This section and section 501(c)(20) \n     shall apply to--\n       ``(1) taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976, and \n     before July 1, 1992, and\n       ``(2) taxable years beginning after June 30, 1998.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after June 30, 1998.\n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Mack, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Thurmond, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Hollings, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Smith of \n        Oregon, and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 2201. A bill to delay the effective date of the final rule \npromulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding the \nOrgan Procurement and Transplantation Network, to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                       organ donation legislation\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat addresses a potential crisis in our organ donation system. \nProposed regulations by the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS) would have devastating effects on community-based \ntransplant programs by prohibiting states from offering organs to their \nown sickest residents before making them available nationwide.\n  There is no more noble a deed than donating one's organs so that \nanother may live. In the past 15 years, the national transplant system \nhas saved over 200,000 lives. In my state of New Jersey, over 10,000 \npeople in the past 10 years have received life-saving transplants.\n  Notwithstanding this success, there is a critical shortage of organs \nfor donation. Less than one percent of Americans offer their organs for \ndonation upon their death. Eleven people die every day in this country \nwaiting for an organ.\n  The changes proposed by HHS, however well intentioned, fail to \nadequately address the national shortage of donated organs and create a \nsystem which may actually increase waiting times in many areas of the \ncountry. By directing the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to \ndevelop a system which removes geography as a\n\n[[Page S6768]]\n\nfactor in organ donation, the regulations will significantly increase \nwaiting times in states with efficient systems. For instance, at \nUniversity Hospital in New Jersey, the State's largest liver transplant \ncenter, the waiting period for a liver in 1997 was only 26 days, \ncompared to a 250 day national waiting period. Forcing facilities, like \nUniversity Hospital, to first offer donated organs nationwide will \nundoubtedly lead to longer waiting periods.\n  These unintended consequences will be felt most greatly among \npatients with disadvantaged backgrounds. In my State of New Jersey, we \nare extremely fortunate to have a system that is fair and efficient. \nNew Jersey's unique system of certificate of need and charity care \nensures that the most critical patients get organs first regardless of \ninsurance. A national organ donation system will force the smaller \ntransplant centers that serve the uninsured and underinsured to close \nas the vast majority of organs go to the handful of the nation's \nlargest transplant centers with the longest waiting lists. Without \naccess to smaller programs, many patients will be faced with the \nhardship of registering with out-of-state programs that may turn them \naway due to lack of insurance. Those who are accepted will be forced to \ntravel out of state at great medical risk and financial hardship.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today is a bipartisan \neffort. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Gorton, \nFeingold, Mack, Sessions, Thurmond, Landrieu, Breaux, Hollings, \nLautenberg, Kohl, Inhofe, G. Smith, and Shelby. Our bill will delay for \none year the Secretary's ability to issue regulations regarding the \nnation's organ donation system. The delay will allow HHS to further \nconsult with the medical community, particularly those serving low-\nincome patients, to develop workable guidelines for organ donation. In \naddition, the legislation calls on HHS to conduct a pilot study to \ndetermine the impact of any regulations before implementation. Finally, \nthe legislation finds that provisions of the proposed changes with \nrespect to standardized ranking and listing criteria, enforcement \nmeasures, and disclosure requirements are a potential good first step \nin improving the nation's organ donation system.\n  For the past 15 years, the national organ procurement and allocation \nsystem has existed without federal regulation. During this time, each \nState has developed a unique system to meet their individual needs. \nMany states, such as New Jersey, have focused on serving uninsured and \nunderprivileged populations. Clearly, improvements can be made to \nincrease the efficiency and effectiveness of organ donation nationwide. \nThe legislation I am introducing today will allow us to meet these \nobjectives by providing greater time for a more thoughtful debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask at this time that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2201\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The national transplant system, established by the \n     National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, has saved over 200,000 \n     lives. In 1998, 20,000 lives were saved by donated organs. \n     Approximately 60,000 Americans currently are awaiting an \n     organ transplant.\n       (2) Every 16 minutes a new name is added to the national \n     organ waiting list.\n       (3) Every day in the United States, 11 people on the \n     national waiting list die (more than 4,000 every year) \n     because there are not enough donated organs.\n       (4) Eliminating the geographic criteria for donor organ \n     allocation, as proposed by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, will have potentially negative consequences for the \n     nation.\n       (5) Eliminating the geographic criteria for donor organ \n     allocation will make organ transplants economically \n     prohibitive for a large percentage of the population, \n     especially for the 22 percent of transplant recipients \n     covered under the medicaid program.\n       (6) The following provisions proposed by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services with respect to organ donation are \n     appropriate and workable and should be studied--\n       (A) the standardized listing criteria for patient placement \n     on lists;\n       (B) the standardized criteria for determining current \n     medical status based on objective and measurable medical \n     criteria;\n       (C) the provision of enforcement authority; and\n       (D) the requirement of full and timely disclosure by \n     transplant centers of waiting list times and survival \n     statistics to potential patients.\n\n     SEC. 2. DELAY OF EFFECTIVE DATE OF FINAL RULE REGARDING ORGAN \n                   PROCUREMENT AND TRANSPLANTATION NETWORK.\n\n       (a) In General.--During the 1-year period beginning on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services may not modify regulations that, as of \n     such date, are in effect with respect to the operation of the \n     Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network under section \n     372 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 274), \n     including regulations under section 1138 of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-8) with respect to such \n     Network. During such 1-year period, the final rule published \n     in the Federal Register to establish part 121 in title 42, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, has no legal effect.\n       (b) Guidelines.--During the 1-year period described in \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall consult with appropriate individuals and organizations \n     in the medical community, including national and local organ \n     donation organizations (including those serving low-income \n     patients), to develop workable guidelines with respect to the \n     operation of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation \n     Network.\n       (c) Study.--Prior to the implementation of any \n     modifications to the regulations described in subsection (a), \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall conduct a \n     study to determine the impact of such proposed modifications \n     on indigent care, economic and geographic access to \n     transplantation services, transplantation outcome and \n     survival rate, and waiting list time by organ. The Secretary \n     shall ensure that any such modifications, together with the \n     results of the study, are open for public comment for a \n     period of at least 90-days prior to the effective date of \n     such modifications.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senator \nTorricelli, Senator Gorton, and others in introducing legislation to \ndelay the effective date of the final rule promulgated by the Secretary \nof HHS regarding the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. \nThis legislation is a crucial step in ensuring that implementation of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services' Interim Final Rule \nregarding does not jeopardize patients' access to life-saving human \norgans in regions of the country that have been providing organ \ntransplantation services efficiently.\n  Mr. President, organ donation, allocation and transplantation are \nextremely sensitive issues. They are issues that patients, families and \nhealth professionals agonize over because they quite literally can \ndetermine who lives and who dies. They agonize over these decisions \nbecause there are so many more people in need of organs than there are \norgans to transplant.\n  Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues a fact that may not \nbe well known, and that is that, according to statistics gathered by \nthe United Network for Organ Sharing, UNO, Wisconsin's two organ \nprocurement organizations--or ``OPOs'' as they are called--are two of \nthe most successful in the entire country with respect to the ratio of \norgans procured per million in the population. Those two OPOs, one at \nthe University of Wisconsin Medical School in Madison, the other at \nFroedtert Hospital in Milwaukee, have a truly impressive track record \nfor conducting the community education and outreach that is so \nimportant in helping people make the decision about whether or not to \ndonate organs. Through the tremendous work of Wisconsin's OPOs and our \n4 transplant centers, nearly 700 Wisconsinites received life-saving \nkidney, heart, liver, lung and pancreas transplants in 1997 alone.\n  Mr. President, as you and many other colleagues may already know, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services proposed a rule earlier this \nyear to revamp the way the nations donated organs are allocated.\n  Mr. President, the legislation my colleagues and I are introducing \ntoday would delay implementation of the Department of Health and Human \nServices' final rule on organ allocation pending further, more detailed \nexamination of the impact of that rule on regional dislocation, \ntransplantation outcome and survival rate, and waiting list time. While \nI have the highest regard for the intent behind the rule's issuance--\nthe promoting of fairness--I nevertheless have serious concerns about \nthe impact many of the proposed changes are going to have for states \nlike Wisconsin that are served by\n\n[[Page S6769]]\n\nsmaller, community-based transplant centers. It is simply not clear to \nme that using a so-called ``National list'' for potential organ \nrecipients would improve upon the current system for allocation or make \nthe system more ``fair.'' In fact, what specialists in the Wisconsin \ntransplant community have told me is that the opposite is true: that a \n``National list'' could dramatically increase ``cold ischemic time'' \nleading to higher rates of transplant rejection, and that a ``National \nlist'' would likely result in longer waiting times in areas such as \nWisconsin that have operated efficiently and successfully.\n  Mr. President, additionally study prior to implementation of the rule \nis vitally important to ensure that a federal agency doesn't take \naction that--while well-intentioned--inadvertently harms populations \nserved by smaller, community-based organizations. My hope is that \nfurther study over the course of the one year delay, combined with \nfurther cooperation between HHS, professional and community-based \norganizations will result in a final rule whose implementation will not \nharm regions of the country that--because of a tremendous amount of \ngrassroots work, patient and family education, and deep personal \ninvolvement by health care professionals--are currently well-served \nunder the current system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

MILITARY AVIATION ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A February 1998 General Accounting Office review of \n     military aircraft safety entitled ``Military Aircraft Safety: \n     Serious Accidents Remain at Historically Low Levels'' noted \n     that the military experienced fewer serious aviation mishaps \n     in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 than in previous fiscal years, \n     but there still remains a need for the Department of Defense \n     to improve significantly its procedures for investigating \n     military aviation accidents.\n       (2) This need was demonstrated by the aftermath of serious \n     military aviation mishaps, including the tragic crash of a C-\n     130 aircraft off the coast of Northern California that killed \n     10 Reservists from Oregon on November 22, 1996.\n       (3) The current Department investigation process for \n     military aviation accidents (the so-called ``two-track'' \n     investigation process), which involves privileged safety \n     investigations and public legal investigations, continues to \n     result in significant hardship for the families and relatives \n     of members of the Armed Forces involved in military aviation \n     accidents and a lack of overall public confidence in the \n     investigation process and may result in a significant waste \n     of resources due to overlapping activities in such \n     investigations.\n       (4) Although the report required by section 1046 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 \n     (Public Law 105-85; 111 Stat. 1888) stated that ``DoD found \n     no evidence that changing existing investigation processes to \n     more closely resemble those of the NTSB would help DoD to \n     find more answers more quickly, or accurately'', the \n     Department can still improve its aviation safety by fully \n     examining all options for improving or replacing its current \n     aviation accident investigation processes.\n       (5) The inter-service working group formed as a result of \n     that report has contributed to progress in military aviation \n     accident investigations by identifying ways to improve family \n     assistance, as has the formal policy direction coordinated by \n     the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n       (6) Such progress includes the issuance of Air Force \n     Instruction 90-701 entitled ``Assistance to Families of \n     Persons Involved in Air Force Aviation Mishaps'', that \n     attempts to meet the need for a more timely flow of relevant \n     information to families, a family liaison officer, and the \n     establishment of the Air Force Office of Family Assistance. \n     However, formal policy directions and Air Force instructions \n     have not adequately addressed the failure to provide primary \n     next of kin of members of the Armed Forces involved in \n     military aviation accidents with interim reports regarding \n     the course of investigations into such accidents, which \n     failure causes much hardship for such kin and results in a \n     loss of credibility regarding Air Force investigations into \n     such accidents.\n       (7) The report referred to in paragraph (4) concluded that \n     the Department would ``benefit from the disappearance of the \n     misperception that the privileged portion of the safety \n     investigation exists to hide unfavorable information''.\n       (8) That report further specified that ``[e]ach Military \n     Department has procedures in place to provide redacted copies \n     of the final [privileged] safety report to the families. \n     However, families must formally request a copy of the final \n     safety investigation report''.\n       (9) Current efforts to improve family notification would be \n     enhanced by the issuance by the Secretary of Defense of \n     uniform regulations to improve the timeliness and reliability \n     of information provided to the primary next of kin of persons \n     involved in military aviation accidents during and following \n     both the legal investigation and safety investigation phases \n     of such investigations.\n       (b) Evaluation of Department of Defense Aviation Accident \n     Investigation Procedures.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     establish a task force to--\n       (A) review the procedures employed by the Department of \n     Defense to conduct military aviation accident investigations; \n     and\n       (B) identify mechanisms for improving such investigations \n     and the military aviation accident investigation process.\n       (2) The Secretary shall appoint to the task force the \n     following:\n       (A) An appropriate number of members of the Armed Forces, \n     including both members of the regular components and the \n     reserve components, who have experience relating to military \n     aviation or investigations into military aviation accidents.\n       (B) An appropriate number of former members of the Armed \n     Forces who have such experience.\n       (C) With the concurrence of the member concerned, a member \n     of the National Transportation Safety Board.\n       (3)(A) The task force shall submit to Congress an interim \n     report and a final report on its activities under this \n     subsection. The interim report shall be submitted on December \n     1, 1998, and the final report shall be submitted on March 31, \n     1999.\n       (B) Each report under subparagraph (A) shall include the \n     following:\n       (i) An assessment of the advisability of conducting all \n     military aviation accident investigations through an entity \n     that is independent of the military departments.\n       (ii) An assessment of the effectiveness of the current \n     military aviation accident investigation process in \n     identifying the cause of military aviation accidents and \n     correcting problems so identified in a timely manner.\n       (iii) An assessment whether or not the procedures for \n     sharing the results of military aviation accident \n     investigations among the military departments should be \n     improved.\n       (iv) An assessment of the advisability of a centralized \n     training facility and course of instruction for military \n     aviation accident investigators.\n       (v) An assessment of the advisability of continuing to \n     ensure that military aviation safety investigation reports \n     are afforded protection from public release and use in \n     subsequent civil and criminal proceedings comparable to the \n     protection currently provided National Transportation Safety \n     Board investigation reports and accident investigation \n     reports.\n       (vi) An assessment of any costs or cost avoidances that \n     would result from the elimination of any overlap in military \n     aviation accident investigation activities conducted under \n     the current so-called ``two-track'' investigation process.\n       (vii) Any improvements or modifications in the current \n     military aviation accident investigation process that the \n     task force considers appropriate to reduce the potential for \n     aviation accidents and increase public confidence in the \n     process.\n       (c) Uniform Regulations for Release of Interim Safety \n     Investigation Reports.--(1)(A) Not later than May 1, 1999, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations\n\n[[Page S6773]]\n\n     that provide for the release to the family members of persons \n     involved in military aviation accidents, and to members of \n     the public, of reports referred to in paragraph (2).\n       (B) The regulations shall apply uniformly to each military \n     department.\n       (2) A report under paragraph (1) is a report on the \n     findings of any ongoing privileged safety investigation into \n     an accident referred to in that paragraph.

Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have an especially strong \ninterest in the history of illnesses and health concerns that follow \nmilitary deployments. We have all observed the effects of post-conflict \nillnesses among our Gulf War veterans who returned with poorly \nunderstood, undiagnosed illnesses, and our Vietnam veterans with health \nproblems related to exposure to Agent Orange. This legacy is not just a \nproblem of our most recent conflicts; our Atomic-era veterans are still \nfighting for recognition of health conditions related to radiation \nexposures they experienced in service to their country 50 years ago.\n  If there is any single lesson to be learned from this history, it is \nthat the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs \nhave not always been aggressive enough in pursuing the immediate health \nconsequences of military conflicts. Too many times our veterans have \nhad to wait years before post-conflict illnesses are recognized as real \nproblems that require firm commitments of research and treatment \nprograms. These delays have come at a cost to the veterans who have had \nto fight for this recognition, and they have come at a cost to the \ngovernment's credibility on this important issue.\n  I believe it is time to consider establishing an independent entity \nwith the capacity to evaluate government efforts to monitor the health \nof servicemembers following military conflicts, and to evaluate whether \nservicemembers are being effectively treated for illnesses that occur \nfollowing such deployments. There have been suggestions for the need \nfor such an entity within DoD and VA, but I believe that important \nhealth expertise outside these agencies is required as well. Indeed, it \nmay be that the best approach is one that pulls together expertise from \nVA, DoD, and health care professionals and researchers from centers of \nmedical excellence in fields such as toxicology, occupational medicine, \nand other disciplines.\n  Therefore, I would like to submit an amendment to the Department of \nDefense Authorization to require the Secretary to enter into an \nagreement with the National Academy of Sciences to assess the \nfeasibility of establishing, as an independent entity, a National \nCenter for the Study of Military Health.\n  The proposed Center for the Study of Military Health would evaluate \nand monitor interagency coordination on issues relating to post-\ndeployment health concerns of members of the Armed Forces, including \noutreach and risk communication, recordkeeping, research, utilization \nof new technologies, international cooperation and research, health \nsurveillance, and other health related activities.\n  In addition, this center would evaluate the health care provided to \nmembers of the Armed Services both before and after their deployment on \nmilitary operations. The proposed center would monitor and direct \ngovernment efforts to evaluate the health of servicemembers upon their \nreturn from military deployments, for purposes of ensuring the rapid \nidentification of any trends in diseases or injuries that result from \nsuch operations. Such an independent health center could also serve an \nimportant role in providing training of health care professionals in \nDoD and VA in the evaluation and treatment of post-conflict diseases \nand health conditions, including nonspecific and unexplained illnesses.\n  While some have argued that it is time to take some of these \nresponsibilities away from existing agencies, I would suggest that this \nis a matter for careful study and thoughtful deliberation. Therefore, \nthis amendment would require the National Academy of Sciences to assess \nthe feasibility of such an independent health entity. In their report \nto the Secretary of Defense, the Academy should provide a \nrecommendation of the feasibility of such an entity and justification \nfor such a recommendation. If such a center is recommended by the \nAcademy, their report should also provide recommendations regarding the \norganizational placement of the entity; the health and science \nexpertise that would be necessary; the scope and nature of the \nactivities and responsibilities of the entity; and mechanisms for \nensuring that the recommendations of the entity are carried out by DoD \nand VA.\n  Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, there have been too many times when I have heard agency \nofficials testify that poorly understood, unexplained illnesses are a \ncommon, inevitable occurrence of every military conflict.

DEBARMENT OF COMPANIES TRANSFERRING SENSITIVE \n                   TECHNOLOGY TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA \n                   FROM CONTRACTING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The People's Republic of China is an authoritarian \n     state that has acted and continues to act in a manner \n     threatening to her neighbors and the United States.\n       (2) A nuclear-capable power, China is believed to have \n     strategic missiles targeted at the United States.\n       (3) China launched ballistic missiles during the Spring of \n     1996 over portions of Taiwan in a show of force calculated to \n     influence the presidential elections in Taiwan\n       (4) Responding to United States affirmation of support for \n     Taiwan, a Chinese official in 1996 reportedly threatened a \n     United States city with destruction should the United States \n     act to defend Taiwan from an attack.\n       (5) Despite denials of hegemonic intent and criticism of \n     other nations for allegedly pursuing hegemony in the region, \n     China has attacked her neighbors, India and Vietnam, and \n     threatened others, notably the Philippines, over disputed \n     territory.\n       (6) Having brutally subjugated a long-independent nation, \n     Tibet, in 1950, China continues to pursue policies that are \n     clearly inimical to the Tibetan people. China systematically \n     violates the most basic human rights though the denial of \n     religious freedom, the jailing and persecution of the \n     political opposition, and the immoral policy of forced \n     abortion to control population growth.\n       (7) China is a proliferator of ballistic missile technology \n     and nuclear technology.\n       (8) China supported the development by Pakistan of \n     ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons.\n       (9) China supports missile development programs in Libya \n     and Iran.\n       (10) China provided cruise missiles to Iran that currently \n     threaten commercial shipping and United States naval vessels \n     in the Persian Gulf.\n       (11) China appears to have a policy aimed at coercing \n     United States companies as well as companies in over \n     countries to transfer technology in order to obtain market \n     access. According to a 1997 press report, ``no country makes \n     such demands across as wide a variety of industries as China \n     does.''. This has led one Administration official to \n     characterize as blackmail the insistence of China that ``to \n     sell here, you have to locate here, and give us \n     technology.''.\n       (12) A number of questionable transfers of sensitive United \n     States technology to China have occurred.\n       (13) In 1993, an American-backed joint venture transferred \n     sensitive communications technology to a Chinese company \n     headed by an official of the People's Liberation Army, \n     reportedly over the objection of various officials of the \n     Department of Defense and the National Security Agency.\n       (14) Advanced dual-use machine tools were sold to China in \n     1994 over the objections of a senior analyst of the Defense \n     Technology Security Agency. These machine tools subsequently \n     were found at a Chinese missile plant in violation of the \n     export license.\n       (15) Two United States defense contractors appear to have \n     transferred sensitive technical information to China in 1996 \n     that may have enabled China to dramatically increase the \n     reliability and capabilities of its space launch vehicles and \n     strategic missiles.\n       (b) Debarment.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall debar \n     from contracting with the Department of Defense, for a period \n     of time provided for under paragraph (2), any company that \n     has transferred sensitive technology to the People's Republic \n     of China without the prior authorization of the United States \n     Government.\n       (2) Debarment under paragraph (1) shall be for a period \n     determined appropriate by the Secretary, but not less than \n     five years.\n       (3) Debarment shall commence under paragraph (1) as of the \n     first day of the fiscal year commencing after the later of \n     the date of the determination by the Secretary that the \n     transfer in question occurred without prior authorization of \n     the United States Government.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``debar'' has the meaning given that term in \n     section 2393(c) of title 10, United States Code.\n       (2) The term ``sensitive technology'' means any military or \n     dual-use technologies or hardware covered by the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979, and the regulations implementing \n     that Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DeWINE AMENDMENT NO. 2826\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DeWINE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 2057, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 204, below line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1014.

INCREASED MISSILE THREAT IN ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States forces and allies in the Asia-Pacific \n     region face a growing missile threat from China and North \n     Korea.\n       (2) China has embarked on a program to modernize its \n     theater and strategic missile programs and has shown a \n     willingness to use ballistic missiles to intimidate its \n     neighbors. During Taiwan's national legislative elections in \n     1995, China fired six M-9 ballistic missiles to an area about \n     100 miles north of Taiwan. Less than a year later, on the eve \n     of Taiwan's first democratic presidential election, China \n     again launched M-9 missiles to areas within 30 miles north \n     and south of Taiwan, thereby establishing a virtual blockade \n     of the two primary ports of Taiwan.\n       (3) North Korea's missile program is becoming more \n     advanced. According to a recent Department of Defense report, \n     North Korea has deployed several hundred Scud missiles that \n     are capable of reaching targets in South Korea. North Korea \n     has started to deploy the No Dong missile, which will have \n     sufficient range to target nearly all of Japan, and is \n     continuing to develop a longer-range ballistic missile that \n     will be capable of reaching Alaska and Hawaii.\n       (4) Theater missile defenses are vitally needed to protect \n     American forces and interests in the Asia-Pacific region.\n       (5) The sale of United States ballistic missile defense \n     items to Taiwan is consistent with the provisions of the \n     Taiwan Relations Act, which states that ``the United States \n     will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and \n     defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to \n     enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense \n     capability.''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Restrictions on Deployment \n     of United States Theater Missile Defenses.--It is the sense \n     of Congress that the President should not adopt any policies \n     or negotiate any agreements that restrict the deployment of \n     theater missile defense systems operated by United States \n     forces or allies.\n       (c) Study and Report.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     carry out a study of the architecture requirements for the \n     establishment and operation of a theater ballistic missile \n     defense system in the Asia-Pacific region that would have the \n     capability to protect Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan from \n     ballistic missile attack. The study shall include a \n     description of appropriate measures by which the United \n     States would cooperate with Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan \n     and provide them with an advanced local-area ballistic \n     missile defense system.\n       (2) Not later than January 1, 1999, the Secretary shall \n     submit to the Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate a report containing--\n       (A) the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1);\n       (B) the factors used to obtain such results; and\n       (C) a description of any existing United States missile \n     defense system that could be transferred to Taiwan and Japan \n     in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act in order to allow \n     Taiwan and Japan to provide for their self-defense against \n     limited ballistic missile attacks.\n       (3) The report shall be submitted in both classified and \n     unclassified form.\n       (d) Sense of Congress Regarding Transfer of Ballistic \n     Missile Defense Systems.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President, if requested by the Government of Taiwan, \n     South Korea, or Japan and in accordance with the results of \n     the study conducted under subsection (c), should sell, at \n     full market value, to the requesting nation appropriate \n     defense articles or defense services under the foreign \n     military sales program under chapter 2 of the Arms Export \n     Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2761 et seq.) for the purpose of \n     establishing and operating a local-area ballistic missile \n     defense system to protect Taiwan, including the Penghu \n     Islands, Kinmen, and Matsu, South Korea, or Japan, as the \n     case may be, against limited ballistic missile attack.\n       (e) Statement of Policy Relating to United States Theater \n     Missile Defenses for the Asia-Pacific Region.--Congress \n     declares that it is in the national interest of the United \n     States that Taiwan be included in any effort at ballistic \n     missile defense cooperation, networking, or interoperability \n     with friendly and allied nations in the Asia-Pacific region.\n       (f) Sense of Congress Urging the President To Declare to \n     the People's Republic of China the Commitment of the American \n     People to Security and Democracy in Taiwan.--It is the sense \n     of Congress that the President should make clear to the \n     leadership of the People's Republic of China the firm \n     commitment of the American people to security and democracy \n     for the people of Taiwan and that the United States fully \n     expects that security issues on both sides of the Taiwan \n     Strait will be resolved by peaceful means.\n       (g) Sense of Congress Regarding Taiwan.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) the transfer of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of \n     China does not alter the current and future status of Taiwan;\n       (2) the future of Taiwan should be determined by peaceful \n     means through a democratic process; and\n       (3) the United States, in accordance with the Taiwan \n     Relations Act and the constitutional processes of the United \n     States, should assist in the defense of Taiwan in case of \n     threats or military attack by the People's Republic of China \n     against Taiwan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      HUTCHISON AMENDMENT NO. 2837\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by her \nto the bill, S. 2057, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of Title II, Subtitle B, (page 41, after line \n     23) insert the following new Section:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, partnerships among our federal \nlaboratories, universities, and industry provide important benefits to \nour nation. They help to create innovative new products and services \nthat drive our economy and improve our quality of life. Today I submit \nthe DOE Partnership Amendment to the National Defense Authorization \nBill for Fiscal Year 1999. This Amendment improves the capabilities at \nthe DOE sites for effective partnerships and interactions with other \nfederal agencies, with the private sector, and with universities.\n  I have personally observed the positive impacts of well crafted \npartnerships. These partnerships enhance the ability of the \nlaboratories and other contractor-operated facilities of the Department \nof Energy to accomplish their federal missions at the same time that \nthe companies benefit though enhanced competitiveness from the \ntechnical resources available at these sites.\n  I have also seen important successes achieved by other federal \nagencies and companies that utilized the resources of the national \nlaboratories and other\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\nDepartment sites through contract research mechanisms. Contract \nresearch enables these sites to contribute their technical expertise in \ncases where the private sector can not supply a customer's needs. \nPartnerships and other interactions enable companies and other agencies \nto accomplish their own missions better, faster, and cheaper.\n  I've seen spectacular examples where small businesses have been \ncreated around breakthrough technologies from the national laboratories \nand other contractor-operated sites of the DOE. But, at present, only \nthe Department's Defense Programs has a specific program for small \nbusiness partnerships and assistance.\n  All programs of the Department have expertise that can be driving \nsmall business successes. Historically, in the United States, small \nbusinesses have often been the most innovative and the fastest to \nexploit new technical opportunities--all of the Department's programs \nshould be open to the small business interactions that Defense Programs \nhas so effectively utilized.\n  I have been concerned that barriers to these partnerships and \ninteractions continue to exist within the Department of Energy. In \naddition, the Department's laboratories and other sites need continuing \nencouragement to be fully receptive to partnership opportunities that \nmeet both their own mission objectives and industry's goals. And \nfinally, small business interactions should be encouraged across the \nDepartment of Energy, not only in Defense Programs.\n  For these reasons, I introduced S. 1874 on March 27, 1998, the \nDepartment of Energy Small Business and Industry Partnership \nEnhancement Act of 1998, which was co-sponsored by Senators Thompson, \nCraig, Kempthorne, Bingaman, Reid, and Lieberman. The National \nCoalition for Advanced Manufacturing, or NACFAM, endorsed our actions \nwith S. 1874, describing it as ``a crucial step in reducing barriers to \ncooperation between the national laboratories and private industry, \nhigher education institutions, non-profit entities, and state and local \ngovernments.'' NACFAM also noted that this ``bill supports our shared \nconviction that collaborative R will further strengthen America's \nproductivity growth and national security.''\n  Today I submit, with Senator Bingaman as a co-sponsor, language for \namendment of the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year \n1999 that accomplishes almost the same goals as S. 1874. This Amendment \nwas developed through consultation with several of the co-sponsors, the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senate Committee on \nArmed Services, and the Department of Energy.\n  This Amendment removes barriers to more effective utilization of all \nof the Department's contractor-operated facilities by industry, other \nfederal agencies, and universities. The Amendment covers all the \nDepartment's contractor-operated facilities--national laboratories and \ntheir other sites like Kansas City, Pantex, Hanford, Savannah River, or \nthe Nevada Test Site.\n\n  This Amendment also provides important encouragement to the \ncontractor-operated sites to increase their partnerships and other \ninteractions with universities and companies. And finally, it creates \nopportunities for small businesses to benefit from the technical \nresources available at all of the Department's contractor-operated \nfacilities.\n  This Amendment supplements the authority of the Atomic Energy Act, \nwhich limited the areas wherein the Department's facilities could \nprovide research and other services, not in competition with the \nprivate sector, to only those mission areas undertaken in the earliest \ndays of the AEC. My Amendment recognizes that the Department's \nresponsibilities are far broader than the original AEC, and that all \nparts of the Department should be available to help on a contract basis \nwherever capabilities are not available from private industry.\n  One barrier at the Department to contract research involves charges \nadded by the Department to the cost of work accomplished by a site. At \nsome laboratories, these charges now range up to 25%. This Amendment \nrequires that charges to customers for research and other services at \nthese facilities be fully recovered, and sharply limits addition of \nextra charges by the Department to only 3%. The Amendment further \nrequires waiver of these extra charges for small business and non-\nprofit entities and provides a process for the Secretary of Energy to \ncontinue any pre-existing waivers.\n  The Amendment creates a five-year pilot program for external \ncustomers that enables facilities to examine their overhead rates and \ndetermine if an alternative lower rate serves to cover services \nactually used by these customers. For example, where companies or \nuniversities do not require secure facilities or do not utilize the \nextensive special nuclear material capabilities of the laboratories, \nthen the customer will be charged an overhead rate that excludes \nsecurity costs and environmental legacy costs. This pilot program will \nenable the Department and facilities to evaluate the impact of these \nlower overhead rates for one important class of external customers. The \nDepartment is required to report in 2003 on the interim results of this \nPilot and to provide recommendations on possibly continuing this Pilot \nand even extending it to include other federal customers.\n  The Amendment provides direct encouragement for expansion of \npartnerships and interactions with companies and universities by \nrequiring that each facility be annually judged for success in \nexpanding these interactions in ways that support each facility's \nmissions. The Amendment requires that the external partnership and \ninteraction program be considered in evaluating the annual contract \nperformance at each site.\n  And finally, the Amendment sets up a new Small Business Partnership \nProgram in which all of the Department sites participate. This action \nwill enable small businesses across the United States to better access \nand partner with any of the Department's contractor-owned facilities. A \nfund for such interactions up to 0.25 percent of the total site budget \nis available for these small business interactions.\n  With these changes, Mr. President, the Department of Energy \nfacilities will be better able to meet their critical national \nmissions, while at the same time assisting other federal agencies, \nlarge and small businesses, and universities in better meeting their \ngoals and missions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               THURMOND (AND DOMENICI) AMENDMENT NO. 2914\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. THURMOND (for himself and Mr. Domenici) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 2057, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n       Section 3307 of title 5, United States Code, is amended as \n     follows:\n       (1) by striking in subsection (a) ``and (d)'' and inserting \n     in its place ``(d), (e), and (f)''; and\n       (2) by adding the following new subsection (f) after \n     subsection (e); ``(f) The Secretary of Energy may determine \n     and fix the maximum age limit for an original appointment to \n     a position as a Department of Energy nuclear materials \n     courier, so defined by section 8331(27) of this title.\n       Sec. 2.

Mr. President, in considering the nomination of \nLouis Caldera before the Senate Armed Services Committee to be the \nSecretary of the Army, I raised the issue of the Washington Aqueduct--\nthe public water system for the Metropolitan Washington area that is \nowned by the Federal government and administered by the Corps of \nEngineers.\n  As my colleagues may recall, the conditions at the Washington \nAqueduct gained national attention when the Environmental Protection \nAgency issued a ``boil-water'' order in December, 1993 for the \nmetropolitan Washington region. There was significant concern that the \nwater supply for the nation's capital was contaminated. This incident \nbrought to light the significant capital improvements that are needed \nat the facility to meet current federal drinking water standards.\n  In order to address the tremendous water quality issues that are \nfacing the District, Arlington County, and the city of Falls Church, I \nincluded in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, Section 306 \nentitled the Washington Aqueduct. I wrote this section so that the \ncustomers of the Washington Aqueduct would have a reliable and safe \nsource of drinkable water. The Aqueduct is in need of many capital \nimprovements to insure that the water remains safe and drinkable. \nImprovements to the Aqueduct are self-financed by the users. It is \nestimated that significant costs remain, between $250 and $400 million.\n  To allow for these crucial improvements, Section 306 directs the Army \nCorps of Engineers to transfer the Washington Aqueduct, with the \nconsent of a majority of the three customers, to a non-federal, public \nor private entity. Since this effort would be a significant \nundertaking, the Safe Drinking Water Act gave the customers and the \nCorps three years, until August 6, 1999, to gain consensus. Congress \nauthorized the Corps to borrow funds from the Treasury during an \ninterim three year period to begin the necessary infrastructure \nimprovements. This borrowing authority totaled $75 million and would be \nrepaid by the ratepayers.\n  Recently, I learned that the Corps has signed a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding with the three customers for the Corps to retain \nownership of the Aqueduct.\n  There are problems with the Corps remaining the owner of the \nWashington Aqueduct, besides that this seems inconsistent with existing \nlaw. First and foremost, the Corps does not have the means to finance \nthe capital improvements that are needed. Once the three year borrowing \nexpires, the Corps only has means to finance daily operations at the \nCorps. Given the current condition at the Aqueduct, this is hardly the \nway to insure that the ratepayers have drinkable water. In addition, in \nthe event of another boil water scare, the Corps would have no means to \naddress the immediate problem. If the Corps does not have funding to \nperform needed upgrades to the Aqueduct nor have the financing to \naddress an emergency\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\nsituation, it seems to me that, consistent with current law, they \nshould not retain ownership of the Corps.\n  In questioning Mr. Caldera about this situation, I have received \nassurances that the Army will fully implement the provisions of the \nSafe Drinking Water Act. This Wednesday a meeting will be held with all \nthe relevant parties to develop a course of action on this matter. I am \nencouraged by Mr. Caldera's attention to this important regional issue. \nHe has pledged to work with me to resolve this impasse so that the \nregion can afford to proceed with the necessary modernization plan for \nthe Aqueduct. Without proceeding with privatization or the development \nof a new regional entity, I remain concerned that the schedule for \nimprovements will be delayed or that the citizens of this region will \nexperience severe water rate hikes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6828-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HUGH MC INTOSH\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I call this body's \nattention to Hugh M. McIntosh's special contribution to the performing \narts in the nation's Capital. Hugh has worked long and hard to foster \nthe growth and appreciation of the arts, particularly through his \nservice as a Trustee of the Ford's Theatre Society.\n  The Society is the not-for-profit organization that brings new \nmusicals, American classics, and other live entertainment to that \nhistoric stage. After the assassination of President Lincoln, Ford's \nTheatre was used as an office and warehouse until an act of Congress \ninitiated the Theatre's restoration, which was completed in 1968. This \nyear's Gala for the President celebrated these 30 years of memorable \nperformances illuminating the character and vibrancy of American life.\n  As a partner in the law firm of Vinson & Elkins, L.L.P., Hugh \nMcIntosh has guided Ford's governing board and staff through legal \nthickets, including contract negotiations with playwrights and agents, \nstrategic planning, development of ethical guidelines, and day-to-day \nlegal questions. Hugh has worked closely with Frankie Hewitt, the Ford \nTheatre Society's founder and producing artistic director, and with the \nNational Park Service, which administers the Theatre as a public \nmuseum.\n  Hugh is a discerning theater-goer, and his love of ``a good show'' \nhas fueled his enthusiasm for contributing backstage at Ford's. He is a \nstrong supporter of education and outreach programs that invites a \ndiverse audience to Ford's and aim to foster a greater appreciation of \nthe performing arts in the Washington area.\n  But as valuable as Hugh's legal expertise has been to Ford's Theatre, \nhis greatest contribution has been to bring wisdom, a sense of \nperspective, and quiet humor to the complex issues facing the Theatre's \nperforming artists and playwrights.\n  It is these special qualities, in fact, which will assure Hugh's \nsuccess in the new direction his life is about to take. This fall, Hugh \nwill begin studying theology at the Harvard School of Divinity. If Hugh \nis called to pastoral service, he may find many friends from Ford's \nTheatre in his pews.\n  At its June meeting, the Ford Theatre Society's Board of Trustees \nhonored Hugh McIntosh with a resolution thanking him for his invaluable \nservice to the Theatre. Mr. President, I ask that the text of this \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The text of the resolution follows:\n\n               A Resolution of the Ford's Theatre Society\n\n       Whereas Hugh M. McIntosh, Esq. has faithfully pursued the \n     interests of the Ford's Theatre Society as a Trustee; and\n       Whereas Mr. McIntosh has diligently rendered complex issues \n     comprehensible to the Board of Trustees and its Executive \n     Committee; and\n       Whereas Mr. McIntosh's gentle humor and patience have been \n     invaluable in many situations and occasions; and\n       Whereas Mr. McIntosh has energetically marshaled the \n     resources of many talented colleagues in serving Ford's \n     Theatre; and\n       Whereas Mr. McIntosh has determined that he must now pursue \n     another field of study, work and service;\n       Therefore be it Resolved, that the Trustees of the Ford's \n     Theatre Society offer Mr. McIntosh their profound \n     appreciation for his work; and\n       The Trustees express their gratitude to the firm of Vinson \n     & Elkins, L.L.P., for its dedication to the interests of \n     Ford's Theatre, and furthermore\n       The Trustees wish Mr. McIntosh all success in his new \n     endeavors.\n           (signed)\n     Samuel D.

DON \n                              PEOPLES, SR.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to \ncongratulate Mr. Don Peoples, Sr. of Butte, Montana for being \nrecognized as the 1998 recipient of the Distinguished Leadership Award \nby the Montana Tech Foundation.\n  I have known Don for many years and his commitment to the city of \nButte is certainly a reflection of his love for the All-America City! \nWhile serving as Butte's Chief Executive, Don lead a team of dedicated \nfolks that revived Butte's economy after the loss of a major mining \ncompany in 1982.\n  After serving ten years in that role, Don left local government to \nbecome a leading voice for the private sector. Today, he is President \nand Chief Executive Officer of MSE, Inc. MSE is now one of Butte's top \nemployers.\n  His company is currently working with the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration (NASA) on a variety of projects that will help \nlaunch the next generation space shuttle and other research projects. \nThe United States Defense Department is also working with MSE to \ndevelop technologies for use in pollution control and cleanup. The \ncompany is also researching new methods for heavy metal and mine waste \nremediation projects.\n  I believe that because of Don's tenacity, this kind of cutting edge \ntechnology is being tested in Butte, Montana.\n  I also applaud Don's commitment to many other organizations and \ncommittees in the mining city. He continues to make a difference \nthrough his affiliations with the United Way, Carroll College, St. \nJames Community Hospital, Butte Central Schools, and so many other \nworthwhile causes.\n  I must also acknowledge Don's wife Cathy and their four grown \nchildren--Don, Jr., Tracey, Doug, and Kevin--as they celebrate this \nhonor. I am convinced that their love and support have helped Don \nachieve so many goals throughout the years.\n  I always say Montanans have very special qualities. Mr. Don Peoples, \nSr. is truly a special Montanan and for that I congratulate \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6829-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6829-S6830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMEMORATION OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF CIVIL WAR MEDICINE\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would to take a moment to \nspeak about the National Museum of Civil War Medicine, in Frederick, \nMaryland, which I recently had the great honor of once again visiting.\n  On September 17, 1862, the Union and Confederacy engaged in a massive \nengagement at Sharpsburg, Maryland, which was also known as the Battle \nof Antietam, so named after the small creek around which Union troops \nwere consolidated. Confederate General Robert E. Lee and his 40,000 \nSouthern troops were pitted against Federal General George B. McClellan \nand 87,000 Union soldiers. Quotations researched by the Antietam \nNational Battlefield staff and volunteers help us visualize the battle \nand its toll.\n\n       On the forenoon of the 15th, the blue uniforms of the \n     Federals appeared among the trees that crowned the heights on \n     the eastern bank of the Antietam. The number increased, and \n     larger and larger grew the field of the blue until it seemed \n     to stretch as the eye could see, and from the tops of the \n     mountains down to the edges of the stream gathered the great \n     army of McClellan.--Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, CSA, \n     Commander, Longstreet's Corps, Army of Northern Virginia.\n       We were massed `in column by company' in a cornfield; the \n     night was close, air heavy . . . some rainfall . . . The air \n     was perfumed with a mixture of crushed green corn stalks, \n     ragweed, and clover. We made our beds between rows of corn \n     and would not remove our accouterments.--Private Miles C. \n     Huyette, Company B, 125th Pennsylvania Infantry.\n       Suddenly a stir beginning far up on the right, and running \n     like a wave along the\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\n     line, brought the regiment to its feet. A silence fell on \n     everyone at once, for each felt that the momentous `now' had \n     come.--Pvt. David L. Thompson, Company G, 9th New York \n     Volunteers.\n       In the time that I am writing every stalk of corn in the \n     northern and greater part of the field was cut as closely as \n     could have been done with a knife, and the slain lay in rows \n     precisely as they had stood in their ranks a few moments \n     before. It was never my fortune to witness a more bloody, \n     dismal battlefield.--Maj. General Joseph Hooker, USA, \n     Commander, I Corps, Army of the Potomac.\n\n  Antietam became the bloodiest day in American history. At the close \nof the day, more men were wounded or killed at Antietam than on any \nother single day of the Civil War: 12,410 Union troops, and 10,700 \nConfederates.\n\n  Whether Union or Confederate, when a soldier fell on the battlefield, \nhe was an American. Frederick, Maryland, was the recipient of the \nthousands of fallen soldiers.\n  The National Museum of Civil War Medicine, in Frederick, seeks to \nhighlight the sacrifice made by countless American soldiers in their \nquest to advance the values of this great nation that was, as Abraham \nLincoln explained, ``conceived in liberty.'' In fact, those slain on \nthe battlefield at Antietam were prepared for burial in the very \nbuilding that now houses the National Museum of Civil War Medicine.\n\n       The force of a mini ball or piece of shell striking any \n     solid portion of a person is astonishing; it comes like a \n     blow from a sledge hammer, and the recipient finds himself \n     sprawling on the ground before he is conscious of being hit; \n     then he feels about for the wound, the benumbing blow \n     deadening sensation for a few moments. Unless struck in the \n     head or about the heart, men mortally wounded live some time, \n     often in great pain, and toss about upon the ground.--History \n     of the 35th Massachusetts Volunteers.\n       Under the dark shade of a towering oak near the Dunker \n     Church lay the lifeless form of a drummer boy, apparently not \n     more than seventeen years of age, flaxen hair and eyes of \n     blue and form of delicate mould. As I approached him I \n     stooped down and as I did so I perceived a bloody mark upon \n     his forehead . . . It showed where the leaden messenger of \n     death had produced the wound that caused his death. His lips \n     were compressed, his eyes half open, a bright smile played \n     upon his countenance. By his side lay his tenor drum, never \n     to be tapped again.--Pvt. J.D. Hicks, Company K, 125th \n     Pennsylvania Volunteers.\n\n  ``It is well war is so frightful,'' General Lee wrote, ``otherwise we \nshould become too fond of it.'' Indeed, this museum allows the visitor \nto get a feel for the ravages of war. Located in the museum are \nnumerous exhibits detailing how Civil War-era doctors and nurses dealt \nwith the wounded and near-dead who were brought off the battlefield to \nbe cared for.\n\n       Comrades with wounds of all conceivable shapes were brought \n     in and placed side by side as thick as they could lay, and \n     the bloody work of amputation commenced.--George Allen, \n     Company A, 6th New York Volunteers.\n\n  The former Surgeon General of the United States, C. Everett Koop, has \nremarked that the Civil War represented a ``watershed in American \nmedical history.'' The visitor to this museum becomes keenly aware of \nthis, and learns of Civil War-era medical advances in the fields of \nanesthesia, surgery, sanitation, and the introduction of mobile medical \ncorps to the armed forces.\n\n  Mr. President, I find that I have a personal bond to the town of \nFrederick, this museum, and what it represents. My great-grandfather, \nCharles Kempthorne, was a member of Company Three of the Third Regiment \nof the Wisconsin Infantry Volunteers. He, like many other brave \nsoldiers, was wounded on September 17, 1862, at the Battle of Antietam. \nIt was in the town of Frederick that his wounds were treated and he \nbegan his convalescence. In time he was transferred to Washington, \nD.C., where he served until he was honorably discharged on June 29, \n1864.\n  Commemoration is indeed an important duty, not only to honor the \ndead, but also to keep alive the ideals that they died for. Mr. \nPresident, I am pleased to see that the National Museum for Civil War \nMedicine has undertaken the important task of remembering a crucial \ncomponent of Civil War history.\n  I would like to commend those people who have made the National \nMuseum of Civil War Medicine a reality. Dr. Gordon E. Dammann, Dr. F. \nTerry Hambrecht, JaNeen Smith, Debbie Moone, and volunteers Dianne \nMarvinney, Rebecca Coffey, Bill Witt, among many others, are doing an \nexcellent job with the museum.\n  On behalf of my great-grandfather, Charles Kempthorne, I say thank \nyou to the community of Frederick for its compassion so many years ago, \nand as a citizen I commend the National Museum of Civil War Medicine \nfor helping those of us today realize that the cost of freedom did not \ncome easy, but was often achieved with the loss of blood and life by \nbrave Americans on both sides.\n\n       Both before and after a battle, sad and solemn thoughts \n     come to the soldier. Before the conflict they were of \n     apprehension; after the strife there is a sense of relief; \n     but the thinned ranks, the knowledge that the comrade who \n     stood by your side in the morning never will stand there \n     again, bring inexpressible sadness--Charles Carleton Coffin, \n     Army Correspondent, Boston Journal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6829-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING RICK JAMESON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \npassing of one of the great leaders of Michigan's conservation \ncommunity. On Saturday, my friend Richard Jameson, the executive \ndirector of the Michigan United Conservation Clubs, succumbed to liver \ncancer. Rick was 48 years old.\n  Rick was an environmentalist and an avid outdoorsman whose roots \nextended beyond our state. A native of Oklahoma, he received his \nbachelor's and master's degrees in natural resources management from \nMichigan State University and began working for the Michigan United \nConservation Clubs in 1976. Rick's expertise and hard work were quickly \nrecognized and in 1980 he headed back to his home state to serve as \nexecutive director of the Oklahoma Wildlife Federation. He continued in \nthat capacity for eight years until 1988, when MUCC was fortunate \nenough to lure him back to serve as assistant executive director.\n  Rick was a strong and dedicated environmentalist. Among his \naccomplishments was the passage of Michigan's beverage container \ndeposit law; a law which has been widely acknowledged as greatly \nreducing litter in our state. Rick also played a vital role in \nproviding Michigan voters the opportunity to pass a constitutional \namendment that will ensure a constant source of funds for Michigan's \nstate parks.\n  Rick was also an avid outdoorsman. Here, too, he achieved important \nsuccesses. He was instrumental in securing the overwhelming approval of \na campaign which will guarantee that Michigan game animals are managed \non the basis of sound biological science. He also helped defeat another \ninitiative which would have virtually eliminated bear hunting in the \nstate of Michigan.\n  In short, Mr. President, I believe that Rick Jameson was one of the \nfew individuals who truly understood the importance of both \nconservation and sportsman's rights. He spent his life's work \nprotecting both as few others could.\n  And Rick was a fighter. Despite suffering the effects of both his \nillness and the chemotherapy he was undergoing, Rick continued to work \nas long as possible. My office consulted with him as recently as last \nmonth, soliciting his input on legislation I have drafted and on other \nbills pending in the Senate. When it came to conservation, hunting and \nfishing, there was no one in the state whose opinion I trusted more \nthan Rick's.\n  Rick is survived by his wife of 18 years, Robbie, his daughter, \nChristine, and two brothers. My thoughts and prayers go out to \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6830-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6830-S6831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT V. OGLE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute \nto the retirement of Robert V. Ogle, an extraordinary individual who \nhas rendered thirty-five years of federal service not only to the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, but also to the nation.\n  Mr. Ogle, who resides in Virginia Beach, Virginia, will soon enter \ninto retirement after a lifetime of service in the Norfolk District of \nthe United States Army Corps of Engineers. With the exception of a year \nof study in Washington and six months in the Naval Air Reserve, his \nentire career has been spent in the Planning Division of the Norfolk \nDistrict Corps of Engineers.\n  During his time in the Norfolk District, Mr. Ogle's expertise and \nprofessionalism facilitated his ascendance to\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\nthe Chief of the Planning Division. His responsibilities included \nReconnaissance Studies, Feasibility Studies, Limited Reevaluation \nReports, and General Reevaluation Reports associated with the General \nInvestigation Program. In addition to these responsibilities, Mr. \nOgle's innovation was illustrated by his incorporation and development \nof a Technical Review process that serves to ensure sound decision-\nmaking practices. Preceding his duties as the Chief of the Planning \nDivision, Mr. Ogle served within the Norfolk District as the Chief of \nthe Plan Formulation Branch, the Director of Planning, and the Chief of \nthe Hydraulics and Hydrology branch.\n  Throughout his thirty-five year career as a professional engineer, \nMr. Ogle has received numerous awards and distinctions in recognition \nof his exceptional career. Among them, Mr. Ogle has twice received the \nCommander's Award for excellent work within the Norfolk District. Mr. \nOgle is also a member of the Virginia Society of Professional Engineers \nand the American Society of Civil Engineers. In addition, he has \nreceived the Exceptional Performance Rating eight times during his \ncareer, a distinction that exemplifies his commitment and service to \nour nation.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Ogle's thirty-five years of federal service and \nhis exceptional performance ratings serve as a testament of his \ndedication to the environmental improvement of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia and our country. I urge my colleagues to stand and join me in \npaying tribute to Robert V. Ogle, and in wishing him happiness and \ncontentment in his well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6830-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRINTED CIRCUIT INVESTMENT ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, \nSenator Mack and Senator Grams, in sponsoring the ``Printed Circuit \nInvestment Act.'' This legislation will remove a significant barrier to \ntechnological investment and innovation in this country by updating the \ntax code's treatment of the electronic interconnection industry.\n  Mr. President, manufacturers of printed wiring boards and printed \nwiring assemblies currently must depreciate their production equipment \nover a 5 years period. Given the speed with which technological \nadvances continue to come in our high-tech industry, 5 years is an \nunreasonable amount of time for depreciation. In effect, the tax code \nis penalizing these companies for keeping up with their competition in \nthe global marketplace. This not fair, nor is it in accordance with our \nnational interests. In the fast-paced information age in which we live, \nwe cannot afford to hobble our high-tech companies with outdated tax \npolicies.\n  This is why I am pleased to support legislation reducing to 3 years \nthe time over which companies in the electronic interconnection \nindustry must depreciate their production equipment. Through this \nmeasure we can encourage greater investment among electronic \ninterconnection manufacturers and keep our high-tech industry \ncompetitive in the global marketplace.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/22/senate-section/article/S6831-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.
