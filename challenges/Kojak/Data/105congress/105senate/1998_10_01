Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce to my colleagues \nReverend Allen Novotny. He is our guest Chaplain today and I hope some \nof you will take the time to introduce yourself. Fr. Novotny is the \nPresident of Gonzaga College High School, a Jesuit high school for boys \nlocated only a few blocks away from the Capitol.\n  In 1821, the Jesuits founded Gonzaga which operates in the tradition \nof teaching and learning established by the founder of the Jesuits, \nIgnatius of Loyola. Throughout our nation's history--through the Civil \nWar, the Great Depression, the World Wars, and the civil rights \nmovement, Gonzaga has maintained its commitment to teaching and \nlearning in the heart of Washington's inner-city, on a street it shares \nwith leaders of business and government, on a block where it ministers \nto and comforts the least fortunate of society.\n  It is both ironic and appropriate that Gonzaga be situated just a few \nblocks from our nation's Capitol Building. Gonzaga, like so much of the \nUnited States, is a melting pot. Gonzaga combines the largest minority \npopulation of any Jesuit High School in the United States with one of \nthe lowest tuitions in the Washington area. Gonzaga is a realized \nmission of social and economic diversity that offers all who attend the \nschool a glimpse of the full life spectrum. Gonzaga combines service to \nthe community--taking the form of service projects both in the U.S. and \nabroad, student-assisted tutoring for underprivileged children, and an \non-campus, student-assisted McKenna Center & Food Wagon homeless \nshelter--with top academics and athletics. Gonzaga is, in other words, \na complete educational experience.\n  I hope my colleagues will take the time to learn more about Gonzaga's \nspecial character. Gonzaga has served the Washington community well \nand, under the steady leadership of Fr. Novotny, I believe it will \ncontinue to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11211-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S11212]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the \nconference report to accompany the Strom Thurmond National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. I want to thank all the members \nof the conference committee for their hard work and cooperation. To \ngive the Members of the Senate some insight into the complexity and \nmagnitude of the work involved in the conference process, we had to \nreconcile nearly 1,000 funding differences and craft compromises for \nover 570 legislative issues in disagreement between the House and \nSenate bills. The conferees succeeded in settling the many difficult \nissues in this complex process only by putting the national interest \nabove all others. I particularly want to thank Senator Levin, the \nranking member of our committee, for his continued leadership and \nsupport.\n  I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Senator Coats, \nSenator Kempthorne, and Senator Glenn. This is their last defense \nauthorization bill. On behalf of the committee and the Senate, I wish \nto thank them again for their dedication to the national security of \nour country and their support for the young men and women who serve in \nour armed services. We will miss their valuable counsel next year.\n  Mr. President, I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the \nstaff of the Senate Armed Services Committee in bringing our conference \nprocess to closure. We on the committee are very proud of our staff. \nThey are a model of bipartisan competence and everyone in this body is \nindebted to them for their dedication to excellence. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a list of the members of the staff be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I also wish to recognize the members and \nstaff of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We have worked \nmore closely together this year than ever before. I want to express on \nbehalf of the Armed Services Committee our appreciation to Chairman \nStevens and to the members and staff of the Defense Subcommittee for \ntheir cooperation and support.\n  Working together, we have produced a bill which keeps the Department \nof Defense on a steady course and is consistent with the balanced \nbudget agreement. It is a sound bipartisan approach to some very \ndifficult policy issues. This is reflected in the fact that for the \nfirst time in memory, all of the conferees in both committees have \nsigned the conference report. This bill sends a strong signal to our \nmen and women in uniform and their families that we are fully committed \nto supporting them as they perform their dangerous missions around the \nworld.\n  The conference report addresses three challenges to maintaining a \nstrong national defense in the 21st century: the training and readiness \nof our military forces, the modernization of weapon systems and other \ndefense equipment, and the preservation of quality of life programs for \nour military personnel and their families. The conference report, for \nexample, authorizes funding of increases to a number of readiness \naccounts totaling nearly $1 billion above the administration request.\n  We have also authorized the construction of six new ships, increased \nthe procurement of new tactical aircraft, and provided an increase of \napproximately $90 million for advanced space systems and technologies \nas well as an increase of about $132 million for strategic force \nupgrades.\n  In the conference, we have authorized a 3.6-percent pay raise and a \ncomprehensive series of accession and retention bonuses and special pay \nto reduce the financial sacrifices involved with military service. In \norder to enhance the quality of life for our service personnel and \ntheir families, we have authorized increases totaling $666 million \nabove the request for military construction and family housing.\n  The conferees have also crafted a number of management initiatives to \nensure that limited budgets are managed more efficiently and that the \nburdens of service for our men and women in uniform are kept to a \nreasonable level. The bill includes provisions to ensure that \ncommercial sole-source spare parts are procured in a cost-effective \nmanner. The conference report authorizes a series of initiatives to \ntest new health care benefits for Medicare-eligible military retirees. \nThe bill also requires the Department of Defense to address the Year \n2000 information technology issues in a more comprehensive fashion.\n  Mr. President, this conference report is a sound and balanced \napproach to meeting our national security needs with constrained \nresources. It is my hope that the Senate will vote to adopt the report \noverwhelmingly.\n  This is the 40th defense authorization conference report on which I \nhave worked since joining the Armed Services Committee in 1959. It is \nthe fourth and last as chairman of the committee as I have announced my \nintention to step down as chairman at the end of this year while \nretaining my seat on the committee. I regard my work on the committee \nto ensure a strong national defense as among the most important \naccompishments of my public service. My tenure as chairman over the \nlast 4 years has been the culmination of that service. Words cannot \nexpress the pride and appreciation I feel for the honor my colleagues \nhave bestowed by designating this authorization bill as the Strom \nThurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.\n  Looking back over the national security issues that have challenged \nthe United States over the past 40 years and turning forward to the \n21st century, I am very concerned about maintaining our ability to meet \nforeign policy ambitions with declining defense resources. If we do not \nchange course soon, present and projected defense investment levels \nwill expose the people of the United States to unacceptable levels of \nrisk. We will have abdicated our fundamental responsibility to provide \nfor a strong common defense.\n  We are in the midst of a period of unprecedented commitment of U.S. \nmilitary forces in peacetime. The United States is using military \nforces to respond to a growing spectrum of international aggression, \nethnic unrest, and domestic conflict. The operational tempo of each of \nour services is at an all time high as we respond in a sustained manner \nto crises in Africa, the Persian Gulf, and the Balkans. As we struggle \nwith supporting these operational deployments, the backlog of \nmodernization and real property upgrades continues to climb. Moreover, \nthe imperative of maintaining our defense technological superiority \nover the next 10 to 15 years will soon generate a further requirement \nfor substantial new investment.\n  Yet our defense spending is declining. The authorization for new \nbudget authority in this conference report is $270.5 billion, which is \n$2.6 billion below the inflation-adjusted level for fiscal year 1998. \nWe are currently spending barely more than 3 percent of our gross \ndomestic product on defense. This level is consistent with defense \nspending during the Depression-ridden 1930's. That level is projected \nto decline even further to 2.6 percent by 2002. We cannot hope to meet \nincreasing foreign policy commitments with such declining resources.\n  We are already seeing the effects of this mismatch of resources and \ncommitments. The Chiefs of the military services indicate that they \nhave now hit rock bottom in readiness and modernization. We are seeing \nincreasing spare parts shortages, increased cannibalization, declining \nunit operational readiness rates, cross-decking of critical weapons, \nequipment and personnel. Personnel retention rates--especially for \nskilled personnel such as pilots--are in a steep decline.\n  These trends have been evident for the last several years. The \nleadership in the military services, distinguished observers in the \ndefense community, such as former Secretary of Defense Schlesinger, and \neven the political leaders in the Department of Defense have been \nsounding warnings of increasing peril for our national security. Now \neven the President has been forced by the mounting evidence to \nrecognize\n\n[[Page S11213]]\n\nthe impact of underfunded administration requests and to call for an \nimmediate increase in defense spending. In a letter to me last week, \nthe President called for a series of steps to redress defense \nunderfunding, including an increase of $1 billion in fiscal year 1999 \nand a process for revising the programmed spending in the future years \ndefense plan. I commend the President for this proposal and look \nforward to working with the administration to make it a reality. I ask \nthat the full text of the President's letter be printed in the Record \nat the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. The extent of current and future readiness problems \nwere laid out in stark detail Tuesday morning by the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The \nservice Chiefs all testified on the manner in which our current \nreadiness is fraying and the long-term health of the Total Force is in \njeopardy. While additional funding in fiscal year 1999 will help \naddress the most pressing short-term concerns, it is imperative that we \nprovide significant continuing increases in funds for modernization \nabove that for additional pay and benefits. The Marine Corps estimates \na shortfall of $1.8 billion per year in modernization over the Future \nYears Defense Program under the current administration projections. The \nArmy estimates an annual $3 to $5 billion per year shortfall during the \nsame period. We must embark on a course of sustained increases in \ndefense investment over the next several years.\n  Mr. President, at the beginning of this Congress, I called for \ndeveloping a clearer strategic context within which to design an \neffective, affordable national defense to meet our foreign policy \ncommitments. The need for this clarity has never been greater. With the \nbelated recognition by the President of the need for increased defense \nresources, we have an opportunity to free the determination of U.S. \nstrategy from being a by-product of the budget process. As I said in \nFebruary 1997, let us seize the day. We must work in a cooperative, \nbipartisan fashion to avert a certain military decline. The first step \nin that process is the rapid and overwhelming approval of this \nconference report.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 Staff of the Armed Services Committee\n\n       Charlie Abell, John Barnes, June Borawski, Philip Bridwell, \n     Les Brownlee, Stuart Cain, Monica Chavez, Chris Cowart, Dan \n     Cox, Madelyn Creedon, Rick DeBobes, Marie Fabrizio Dickinson, \n     Katy Donovan, and Shawn Edwards.\n       Jon Etherton, Pamela Farrell, Richard Fieldhouse, Maria \n     Finley, Jan Gordon, Creighton Greene, Gary Hall, Larry Hoag, \n     Melinda Koutsoumpas, Larry Lanzillotta, George Lauffer, Henry \n     Leventis, Peter Levine, and Paul Longsworth.\n       David Lyles, Steve Madey, Mike McCord, Reaves McLeod, John \n     Miller, Ann Mittermeyer, Bert Mizusawa, Cindy Pearson, Sharen \n     Reaves, Cord Sterling, Scott Stucky, Eric Thoemmes, Roslyne \n     Turner, and Banks Willis.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, September 22, 1998.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Preserving our military's readiness has \n     been the top priority of my national security program. Since \n     I first took office, increasingly greater shares of our \n     Defense budget have been allocated to ensuring that our armed \n     forces are ready to respond and have the tools to accomplish \n     their mission. Although we have done much to support \n     readiness, more needs to be done.\n       This year alone, important steps have been taken to protect \n     military readiness. For FY 1998, we worked with the Congress \n     to secure both an additional $1 billion in military readiness \n     funds through a budget reprogramming and a $1.85 billion \n     emergency funding package to cover the costs of unanticipated \n     operations in Bosnia and Iraq. For FY 1999, my Administration \n     proposed a Defense budget request that increased funding for \n     personnel and operations programs over the 1998 appropriated \n     levels and a $1.9 billion emergency budget amendment to fund \n     the ongoing peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. Passage of \n     this emergency funding is critical to avoid a readiness \n     crisis in the fiscal year that begins on October 1. I \n     strongly urge the Congress to approve these requests.\n       We also have done a lot on our own to address the burden on \n     our men and women who have been deployed at higher than \n     anticipated rates. We established standards for deploying \n     units and intensively manage the force to minimize the \n     possibility that units exceed these standards. We cut Air \n     Force temporary duty assignments in half. And we are cutting \n     back, by 25 percent over the course of five years, the total \n     number of exercise days. Additionally, we reduced or replaced \n     some overseas deployments with units on stand-by in the \n     United States.\n       My Administration has sought ways to get a greater \n     readiness return from each dollar spent implementing better \n     management practices, cutting overhead, and reducing base \n     infrastructure. Working together, we can identify methods for \n     eliminating wasteful spending. I need your help in addressing \n     these objectives if we are to ensure that our men and women \n     in uniform receive the best training and equipment possible \n     in the most cost effective manner. They deserve no less.\n       I recently met with Secretary Cohen and the Commanders-in-\n     Chief of our U.S.-based and overseas forces to receive a \n     status report of the units under their command. As always, \n     the dedication of our civilian and military leaders to the \n     troops' well being was clearly evident in their reports. I \n     was particularly satisfied to hear that our forces are \n     capable of carrying out our national military strategy and \n     meeting America's defense commitments around the globe. They \n     are, in the words of the Chiefs, the best-trained and best-\n     equipped forces in the world.\n       Notwithstanding this assessment of our overall posture, the \n     Secretary and the Chiefs identified several concerns that \n     must be addressed to sustain high military readiness levels. \n     To address our readiness needs, I believe several steps are \n     in order:\n       1. We must act now to provide additional resources in FY \n     1999 for operations and personnel programs important to \n     military readiness. This includes resources to minimize \n     shortfalls in certain critical spare parts, Navy manpower, \n     and Army unit training activities. I have asked key officials \n     of my Administration to work together over the coming days to \n     develop a fully offset $1 billion funding package for these \n     readiness programs.\n       2. I have instructed the Office of Management and Budget \n     and the National Security Council to establish with Secretary \n     Cohen and General Shelton a separate process within the \n     context of the FY 2000 joint budget review that will examine \n     the longer-term military readiness issues raised at my \n     meeting with the CINCs. Meeting this challenge will require a \n     multi-year plan with the necessary resources to preserve \n     military readiness, support our troops, and modernize the \n     equipment needed for the next century. I anticipate this \n     examination will result in a series of budget and policy \n     proposals for the FY 2000 Defense budget and the Future Years \n     Defense Program. Our challenge is to strike a balance between \n     providing sufficient resources for military readiness while \n     maintaining fiscal discipline and appropriate funding levels \n     for other investments necessary to sustain a growing economy.\n       The security of the nation depends on our military forces' \n     ability to quickly, effectively, and successfully prosecute \n     their mission. Ensuring that these forces are trained and \n     ready is a priority upon which we all can agree.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to join with \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee in bringing to the floor \nthe Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n1999. It is truly a fitting honor for our chairman that this conference \nreport which is named in his honor has been signed by not only all the \nSenate conferees on both sides of the aisle, but also by all conferees \nfrom the House National Security Committee on both sides of the aisle.\n  I am sure that I speak for all of our colleagues in saying just how \nmuch we appreciate the leadership that Senator Thurmond has provided on \nthis bill, the fair and even-handed manner in which he has managed the \ncommittee not just on this bill, but as long as he has been a chairman \nof this committee, as well as how much we appreciate the lifelong \ndedication that he has brought to the national defense. We look forward \nto many, many more years of working with him. He has expressed his \nappreciation for having the bill named after him. I just want to tell \nhim that it is my very strong personal feeling that it has been a \npleasure for me to work with him to bring forward measures such as this \nthat are so critical to the national defense. We will miss him as \nchairman, but we will not miss him as a member of the committee, \nbecause he will continue to be an active member of the committee.\n\n  Mr. President, this is also the last defense authorization act for \nseveral of our colleagues on the committee, as Senator Thurmond has \nnoted. Senator Glenn, Senator Coats and Senator Kempthorne will all be \nleaving us at the end of this year. All three have\n\n[[Page S11214]]\n\nmade great contributions to the work of the committee and to the \nnational security of our country. They will be greatly missed, and I \nknow many of us will have more to say about that during the next few \ndays.\n  The conference report that we bring to the Senate today is the \nproduct of more than 6 months of work, including a full 2 months in \nconference with the House. Overall, we have reached a bipartisan \nconference report that advances the security of our country in the best \ninterests of the men and women in uniform. I am particularly pleased \nthat on a series of issues that were important to the Department of \nDefense and the Department of Energy and to the administration, we have \nbeen able to eliminate or modify positions that would have led to a \nveto.\n  First, we eliminated a series of House provisions that would have \nbarred any exports of satellite or related technology for launch in \nChina, and also the provision which we eliminated also would have \nprohibited participation in launch failure investigations. So we have \neliminated a number of provisions. However, the conference report does \nprovide that the licensing of applications to launch satellites in \nChina will be returned to the State Department. However, that return \nwill be delayed until March 15, 1999. In the interim, there is a \nrequirement for the Secretary of State to plan for a more timely and \norderly licensing process.\n  The only effective difference since January of 1996 between the \nlicensing being done by State or Commerce has been the long delays that \nexist in the State Department's processing of license applications. The \ndelay in the effective date of the transfer from Commerce to State will \ngive the administration time to take steps to speed up the State \nDepartment's licensing process and provide the new Congress with an \nopportunity to review the transfer in a less politically heated \natmosphere after the elections.\n  It is critical for American security that American satellites \ncontinue to be launched in large numbers, both because, as Senator Bob \nKerrey has pointed out, most of our intelligence information comes from \nopen sources, such as satellites, and because the satellite \ntransmission of programming is critically important to forcing open \nclosed societies whose dictatorships threaten American interests. The \ncompromise embodied in the bill before us should protect our national \nsecurity interests by helping to ensure that American satellites will \ncontinue to be launched in appropriate numbers and in a timely and \nsecure manner.\n  Second, we have eliminated a House provision that would have \nprohibited the Secretary of Energy from even considering the less \ncostly of the two options for renewed tritium production. It would have \nachieved this result by prohibiting the production of tritium in a \ncommercial facility, even though tritium is widely used in commercial \nproducts and is not a special nuclear material like uranium or \nplutonium.\n  The provision in the bill will provide a level playing field for the \nselection of an option for future tritium production by delaying the \nimplementation of the decision made by the Secretary of Energy to \nselect either option until October 1, 1999, the beginning of the next \nfiscal year. This approach will provide Congress an opportunity to \nreview the Secretary's decision--whatever it may be--before it is \nimplemented. It will have no adverse impact on our national security \nbecause we will not need a new source of tritium for several years. The \nSecretary's decision could not be implemented in any case until funding \nis approved by Congress, and Secretary Richardson has indicated that \ndelaying implementation of his decision until October 1 of next year \nwill have ``minimal impact'' on future tritium production.\n  Third, we eliminated a House provision that would have prohibited \ngender-integrated training at the basic training level in all three \nmilitary services. This prohibition was opposed by the uniformed \nmilitary, opposed by a majority of the Senate, and it would have led to \na veto by the President. The bill does contain provisions that, (a), \ndirect the Secretaries of the military departments to provide for \nseparate and secure housing for male and female recruits with sleeping \nareas separated by permanent walls and served by separate entrances; \nand, (b), prohibit afterhours access to sleeping areas by unescorted \nmembers of the opposite gender. These provisions are consistent with, \nand would in fact codify, the current policies of the Department of \nDefense.\n  Fourth, a Senate provision was dropped that would have made it harder \nfor the Secretary of Defense to downsize and close unneeded military \nfacilities. I recognize that many Members on both sides of the aisle \nsupported this provision. However, the provision was strongly opposed \nby the civilian and uniformed leadership of the Department of Defense \nand would have led to a veto. I am personally hopeful that in the next \nsession of Congress we will at least authorize one additional round of \nbase closings.\n\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased with the outcome on several issues \nthat have been important to the Department of Defense, including the \nadoption of a Senate provision authorizing Bosnia funding on an \nemergency basis; the decision to fund cooperative threat reduction \nprograms at a level close to the one proposed by the administration; \nand, most importantly, the decision to fund a 3.6-percent pay raise for \nour men and women in uniform. Nothing is more important to our national \nsecurity than their well-being and high morale.\n  Mr. President, this conference report is the product of hard-fought \ncompromise, and I cannot say, of course, that I support every provision \nin it.\n  I would have preferred that we not fund seven C-130s and one F-16 \nthat the Department of Defense says it doesn't want and doesn't need.\n  I would have preferred that we not cut into the readiness of our \nArmed Forces by reducing the Department's operations and maintenance \naccounts below the administration's budget request.\n  I would have preferred that we not include a House provision that \nunfairly singles out a single facility by prohibiting the China Ocean \nShipping Company from leasing a facility at the Long Beach Shipyard \nthat was closed in the last base closure round.\n  I would have preferred that we not reach outside of our jurisdiction \nto resolve a complicated tax dispute between two States.\n  On balance, I think we have succeeded in reaching a fair resolution \non the issues in the conference. I am convinced that we have a very \nsolid compromise of the major issues, and I hope the President will \nsign the bill.\n  Again, I will conclude by thanking our chairman, Senator Thurmond, \nfor the open and the bipartisan manner in which he conducted the \nconference on this bill. Senator Thurmond and his staff have made every \neffort to include the minority at every stage of the deliberations. I \nalso thank the chairman and ranking minority member of the House \nNational Security Committee, Congressman Spence and Congressman \nSkelton, for their cooperation in bringing the conference to a \nsuccessful conclusion.\n  Of course, none of this could have been accomplished without our \nstaffs. I want to express the appreciation we all feel on the committee \nto the staffs of the Armed Services Committee--both the majority and \nminority staffs--for the extraordinary effort they put into this bill \nand this conference. It was a long, long conference. It just simply \nwould not have been possible to achieve the result we did without the \noutstanding work of David Lyles, Les Brownlee, and their dedicated \nsupporting cast. I also extend my thanks to the staff of the House \nNational Security Committee and the House and Senate legislative \ncounsels for their help in preparing this large bill.\n  Mr. President, it is a good conference report. It strengthens our \nnational security. I know our colleagues will be pleased to join me in \nsupporting the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 1999.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nSenator Levin for the kind words he said about me. He has done a fine \njob. We could not have done this work without him.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S11215]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nfor the quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I believe I have 90 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I regret that I am here this morning making \nmy remarks, because in this piece of legislation we have preempted the \nStates and their ability to tax. Under the Buck Act, it gave that \nresponsibility to the States. But in here we are preempting the States.\n  The Presiding Officer understands the problem between Oregon and \nWashington. But Oregon has passed a law that exempts residents of \nWashington. So, therefore, the States have worked out their problem. \nHere, the Federal Government, Big Brother, has to tell the States what \nthey can do. I think it is highly unfair. I think it is unprecedented \nwhere the Armed Services Committee has gone around the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Senators can't come to this floor and say that the chairman of the \nFinance Committee says this section is all right. It has to go before \nthe Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is the committee of \njurisdiction here--not the Armed Services Committee.\n  The occupant of the Chair is one of the finest jurists in the Senate, \nhaving been, I believe, Attorney General of his State.\n  The law says:\n\n       No person shall be relieved from his liability for any \n     income tax levied by any State, or by any duly constitutional \n     taxing authority therein having jurisdiction to levy such a \n     tax by reason of his residing within a Federal area, or \n     receiving income from transactions occurring or services \n     performed in such areas, and such State, or taxing authority, \n     shall have full jurisdiction and power to levy and collect \n     such tax in any Federal area within such State to the same \n     extent and with the same effect as though such area was not a \n     Federal area.\n\n  That is the Buck Act.\n  The Armed Services Committee has altered or broken that statutory \nprovision. They preempted the States. They went around the Finance \nCommittee. Now they are altering the Buck Act.\n  As I said, Mr. President, this is regrettable, for me to think that \nmy colleagues would have such a sweetheart deal that when the State of \nKentucky and the State of Tennessee were in the process of negotiation \nand working out their problems, they were told it would be worked out \nin Washington and not to worry about it; therefore, the negotiations \nwere cut off, and the sweetheart deal was started.\n  I want to call the attention of my colleagues to the provision in the \ndefense authorization bill which I consider to be one of the most \nmisplaced, misguided, and unfair proposals I have seen in my 24 years \nin the Senate. I am referring to a tax proposal in this defense \nauthorization bill which preempts the State of Kentucky from \nadministering its own tax laws.\n  Let me repeat that.\n  I am referring to a tax provision in the defense authorization bill. \nWe are now establishing, Mr. President, the precedent that defense \nauthorization bills can become vehicles for State tax provisions.\n  The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over tax issues in the Senate. \nBut the Finance Committee did not report this legislation. The Finance \nCommittee did not report any other legislation with this tax proposal \ncontained in this defense authorization bill. It is not even a Federal \ntax issue. This is not a Federal tax issue. This is a tax provision in \nthis bill which dictates to States how they administer State income tax \nlaws.\n  The Republican Party has always been States rights. That is one of \ntheir long suits. I have heard in campaigns all my life, ``States \nrights.'' And now in this bill you are preempting States rights. We are \npreempting my State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, from deciding for \nitself how to administer its own income tax laws on work performed \nwithin the State of Kentucky by private sector employees. It is an \noutrage that my colleagues who are conferees from the other side of the \naisle agreed to include this provision in the final bill.\n\n  Mr. President, Fort Campbell is a military facility which straddles \nthe Kentucky-Tennessee border. It is located partially in Trigg County \nand Christian County in my State and partially in Tennessee. There are \nFederal employees working at Fort Campbell who reside in both Kentucky \nand Tennessee, and there are private sector employees working at Fort \nCampbell, some on a full-time basis, some on a contractual or part-time \nbasis.\n  How would you like to be sitting at the table having lunch, and the \nworker across the table from you, working for the same company, doing \nthe same job as you, pays no tax, but you have to pay yours?\n  For Kentucky employees, there is no exemption from the sales tax in \nTennessee. That will be the next bill that will be in the Chamber, and \nI am going to encourage my colleagues to do that so all you have to do \nis show your driver's license and where your residence is and you are \nexempt from Tennessee sales tax, which is one of the highest in the \nNation.\n  According to groups such as the Federation of Tax Administrators, \nwhich is an organization comprised of the top revenue officials from \nall 50 States and the District of Columbia, it is a fundamental \nprinciple of taxation that workers are taxed where the work is \nperformed. Workers are taxed where the work is performed. That is the \nbasic rule. There are exceptions to the rule, of course, but the \nexceptions come from agreements negotiated between States--negotiated \nbetween States. States can agree to a variety of ways to treat income \ntax earned within one State's borders by out-of-State residents--States \nrights. And we recognized that a long time ago even in the Buck Act.\n  But this is for the States to decide. Congress should keep its nose \nout of their business. But not this Congress, not this majority, and \nnot this defense authorization bill. Do I want to be against the Strom \nThurmond defense authorization bill? Of course, I do not. I do not want \nto be against the Wendell H. Ford aviation bill either. But what is in \nthis bill is not right.\n  That is my responsibility as a Senator, and I am surprised that my \ncolleague on the other side, who is a major player with the Republican \nParty, did not defend his constituents rather than his party. We are \nlosing $4 million a year. Not even the Congressman from the First \nDistrict raised a peep about it. Who are you supposed to be \nrepresenting up here in this body or in the other body? You are \nsupposed to be representing your State and your constituency.\n  A dispute arose when some Tennessee workers objected to paying income \ntaxes on work performed within the borders of Kentucky. Legislation was \nintroduced in the House to impose a Federal solution on the States. \nHearings were held. The House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on \nApril 17th of last year on this issue. The Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee held hearings on October 24 of last year. To my knowledge, \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee held no hearings. The Senate Armed \nServices Committee held no hearings on this issue during either session \nof this Congress. The reason is obvious. Because the Armed Services \nCommittee has absolutely no jurisdiction over this issue--none. The \nconferees for this defense authorization bill have no business \nattaching language which preempts State tax laws as part of this \ndefense authorization bill. It has no place in this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Let's go back now to the House hearing of last April. What kind of \ntestimony did that committee hear? It heard that the Kentucky tax \nstructure met all appropriate constitutional standards for fairness and \nnondiscrimination. The committee was\n\n[[Page S11216]]\n\ntold that the ability of States to define their own tax structure \nwithin the bounds of the Constitution was ``one of the core elements of \nsovereignty preserved to the States under the Constitution.''\n  That committee was told that if Congress jumped in and preempted \nState laws in this case, ``It will by definition create a preferred \nclass of taxpayers that benefits at the expense of all other taxpayers. \nCurrently, all workers, public and private, in Kentucky are subject to \nthe same rules. This should not be disrupted by the Congress without a \nstrong policy rationale.''\n  The House committee was also told that the proposal to grant special \nstatus to Tennessee residents violated the spirit of the Unfunded \nMandate Act of 1995. I wonder how many colleagues on the other side in \n1995 voted for the unfunded mandate bill. Are you going to fund this \nunfunded mandate? No. It breaks that law. You are taking away by \nmandate funds that belong to my State. It is under the unfunded mandate \nlaw of 1995.\n  Do you think this bill is not going to go to court? You can bet your \nsweet bippy that once the President signs it, if he does, this portion \nof the bill will be in court. It is wrong. It is wrong from the start; \nit is wrong from the middle; it is wrong from the end.\n  The House committee was also told that if Congress believes that the \nimpact of Federal workers employed on installations crossing the \nborders of two States should be offset, it should provide the funding \nnecessary to offset the cost imposed on the States affected and not \njust preempt legitimate taxing authorities. This is what the committee \nwas told, but the committee didn't pay any attention to that--it is our \nway or nothing. What Kentucky is getting is nothing. I am not going to \nallow this bill to go forward without having an opportunity, which I am \ndoing now, to express to my colleagues my outrage and what their \noutrage should be. Pretty soon, I will tell you, 240 installations that \nare subject to the same law--subject to the same law, 240 in this \ncountry--will want the same. So what are you going to look forward to \nnext year? Are you going to preempt all these States? Be fair. Be fair.\n\n  So, let me repeat one section of that sentence that the committee in \nthe House was told:\n\n       . . . if Congress feels the impact of federal workers \n     employed on installations crossing the border of two states . \n     . . should be offset, it should provide the funding necessary \n     to offset the costs imposed on the states affected and not \n     just preempt legitimate taxing authority.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee heard \nsimilar testimony during its hearing last August. The Senate Armed \nServices Committee, however, heard no such testimony because it held no \nsuch hearings and has no jurisdiction over this issue. Nevertheless, \nwithout any floor debate, a provision was snuck into the House version \nof the defense authorization bill on the House floor. Where was my \nCongressman from the First District when that happened to his employees \nand to his State? I do not know where my House colleagues from Kentucky \nwere on this issue when this issue arose. Maybe they did not notice. \nMaybe they were just asleep at the switch. But either way, not a finger \nwas lifted by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stop it.\n  Let me explain to my colleagues why this provision is so offensive. \nThe provision preempts the State of Kentucky from applying its own tax \nlaws to Federal workers at Fort Campbell. But it does not stop there, \nit is broader. It also exempts private sector employees, such as \ncontractors, who perform work at Fort Campbell. Private contractors are \nexempt. This goes well beyond any precedent which exists anywhere else \nin Federal law.\n  What it means is that when two contractors bid on work to be \nperformed on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell, a Tennessee contractor \nis going to have a built-in advantage over a Kentucky contractor \nbecause of the special exemption written into this defense \nauthorization bill. Can you imagine what other Senators would be doing \nthis morning if this had happened to them? Maybe, with this precedent, \nit will. Why don't we try to prevent it?\n  The House language is overly broad and, in my opinion, extremely \nunfair. No such language is included in the Senate version of the bill. \nHowever, I was very concerned about the attempt to sneak this in. I \ninformed my colleagues on the committee of my strong concerns with this \ntax proposal on June 25th, when the bill was debated on the floor.\n  I should say at this point that the ranking member of the committee, \nthe Senator from Michigan, acknowledged that tax issues had no place in \na defense authorization bill, he shared my concern about the broad and \nmisguided precedent set by this proposal to preempt State tax laws, and \nhe fought to keep it out of the final bill. However, apparently among \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle, this was a done deal. I \ndo not believe the issue was even a matter of serious discussion by the \nRepublican conferees. So here we are on the Senate floor with a \nsweetheart deal being cut on a tax provision which preempts State law. \nI thought I had seen it all.\n  Mr. President, this tax provision raises serious constitutional \nquestions. This provision raises serious constitutional questions. Back \nin June I inserted in the Record a legal memorandum from the Office of \nthe Attorney General of Kentucky which raised serious constitutional \nquestions about this tax preemption proposal. I am sure the issue of \nwhether to challenge the constitutionality of this tax preemption \nproposal will be studied carefully, should this bill become law--and it \nwill be.\n  Let me also inform my colleagues that revenue officials in my State \nhave had contact with those in the State of Tennessee. This is the \nright way to solve this problem. The States of Washington and Oregon \ndid. But once the word was out that Congress will attempt to impose a \nFederal solution regarding this matter, the discussions between the two \nStates became a moot point. Why should they spend the time and \nresources necessary to reach a compromise agreement when Congress was \nconsidering preempting State law and imposing a solution which favors \njust one side? What incentive was there to negotiate? Big Brother in \nWashington was acting to impose a solution on a matter which is \nnormally left to the States to work out on their own.\n  Mr. President, a sweetheart deal cut by the Republican conferees is \ngoing to cost my State about $4 million per year. Let there be no \nmistake about my Governor's opposition to this tax preemption \nprovision. Let me read from his letter of June 25, 1998, from Governor \nPaul Patton of Kentucky.\n\n       I am writing to express Kentucky's opposition to the \n     Thompson amendment currently under consideration by the \n     United States Senate. The issue addressed by this legislation \n     is the tax imposed by the Commonwealth on income earned \n     within Kentucky by non-resident federal workers.\n\n  He went on to lay out why.\n\n       We are attempting to resolve this issue through a joint \n     effort with Tennessee Governor Sundquist's office. This \n     matter is one to be settled at the State level, and not an \n     issue for Congress to resolve.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       In closing, I would like to reiterate the Kentucky taxation \n     of non-residents working in Kentucky is fair in concept and \n     in practice. To exempt all non-residents or a special group \n     of non-residents who work in Kentucky would be unfair. If I \n     may provide you with any other information on this issue, \n     please feel free to contact me.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter from the Governor \nof Kentucky be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Kentucky,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Frankfurt, KY, June 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Wendell Ford,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: I am writing to express Kentucky's \n     opposition to the Thompson amendment currently under \n     consideration by the United States Senate. The issue \n     addressed by this legislation is the tax imposed by the \n     Commonwealth on income earned within Kentucky by non-resident \n     federal workers.\n       The protest by federal workers employed at the Fort \n     Campbell military base against the imposition of the Kentucky \n     income tax has centered on their contention that the tax is \n     unfair to them. All income in question is taxed the same \n     whether earned by a resident or non-resident of Kentucky. \n     Only the income earned within the Commonwealth of Kentucky is \n     taxed. It would be unfair to tax the income of residents but \n     not the income of non-residents doing the same job in the \n     same place. Indeed, if this were the case, it would make \n     sense for Kentucky residents\n\n[[Page S11217]]\n\n     working on the Fort Campbell base to move to Tennessee to \n     avoid the Kentucky income tax.\n       On June 23, 1998, Kentucky's Attorney General sent to me a \n     memorandum which offers a compelling and reasonable argument \n     against the constitutionality of the Thompson amendment under \n     the Commerce Clause. A consequence of this amendment would be \n     its detrimental impact on the Kentucky communities which \n     surround Fort Campbell. The legislation would exceed \n     Congressional authority and would likely be proven as \n     unconstitutional. Congress granted the states the power to \n     tax income, and on several occasions, courts have held that \n     states can assess an income tax to nonresidents who earn \n     their income in that state. Congress can reduce the states' \n     power of taxation, but only through an amendment within the \n     confines of the Commerce Clause.\n       We are attempting to resolve this issue through a joint \n     effort with Tennessee Governor Sundquist's office. This \n     matter is one to be settled at the state level, and not an \n     issue for Congress to resolve. The impacts of the Thompson \n     amendment would far surpass Fort Campbell. These impacts \n     would extend to the employees of every federal institution \n     within close proximity with state borders.\n       In closing, I would like to reiterate that Kentucky's \n     taxation of non-residents working in Kentucky is fair in \n     concept and in practice. To exempt all non-residents or a \n     special group of non-residents who work in Kentucky would be \n     unfair. If I may provide you with any other information on \n     this issue, please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul E. Patton,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. FORD. The State preemption provision in this bill is also \nstrongly opposed by the Federation of Tax Administrators. Let me read \nfrom a June 24, 1998 letter from Mr. Harley T. Duncan, the executive \ndirector of the Federation of Tax Administrators:\n\n       I am writing concerning amendments to the defense \n     appropriations bills (S. 2057) which would preempt Oregon, \n     Kentucky and Nebraska from applying their income tax to \n     certain federal employees (and in some cases, contractors) \n     who work in those states, but reside in bordering states with \n     no income taxes. . . .\n       These amendments have been separately considered earlier in \n     the 105th Congress as H.R. 1953. The Federation of Tax \n     Administrators is an association of the principal tax \n     administration agencies in the 50 States, the District of \n     Columbia, and New York City. The Federation has adopted a \n     policy which urges that the Senate reject H.R. 1953 and any \n     similar language which may be offered as an amendment to \n     other bills.\n       We ask the Senate to recognize that, throughout the history \n     of income taxation, both federal and state, workers are taxed \n     by the jurisdiction where the work is performed. This system \n     represents the keystone of taxation. State lawmakers make \n     exceptions to this system to address individual circumstances \n     where strict adherence to the principle leads to undesirable \n     results. In particular, in those instances where sound fiscal \n     and government policy permit, a State may enter into a \n     reciprocal agreement with a bordering State to permit \n     taxpayers to file a single return in the state of \n     residency. Kentucky is at the forefront of such policy \n     refinements.\n\n  They are complimenting my State for being in the forefront of these \npolicy refinements.\n\n     --it has a reciprocal agreement with every border state that \n     has a broad-based individual income tax.\n       The U.S. Constitution imposes substantive constraints on \n     the manner in which such states may structure their tax \n     systems. These constraints ensure that the tax imposed meets \n     fundamental tests of fairness in dealing with all citizens. \n     The Constitution further ensures that state taxes do not \n     impose undue burdens on interstate commerce or the federal \n     government. The taxes imposed by these states meet these \n     requirements and should not be preempted. There is no \n     question that states have the legal authority to tax the \n     income of nonresidents working in Oregon, Kentucky or \n     Nebraska.\n\n  It goes on, Mr. President:\n\n       Further, the language exempts from taxation wages paid to \n     Federal workers . . . but it exempts from tax income paid to \n     all individuals who work in Fort Campbell in Kentucky.\n\n  A special group is set out here.\n\n       This encompasses not only contract employees who work \n     directly for the military . . . but also includes employees \n     of private companies who run businesses or perform services \n     on the bases, including such businesses as restaurants and \n     road maintenance firms. These are clearly private business \n     people, not federal workers.\n\n  But they are exempt. They are exempt under this particular bill.\n\n       Finally, and most importantly, if change is necessary, it \n     is within the power of the states involved to do so. This is \n     an issue for state lawmakers, not federal lawmakers. \n     Lawmakers in Kentucky and Tennessee are seeking an equitable \n     solution that would not impose an unfair burden on either \n     state. . .\n       The Senate is faced with an opportunity to demonstrate good \n     faith to the principles contained in the Unfunded Mandates \n     Act of 1995.\n\n  And we are not doing that.\n\n       If Congress feels that the impact of federal workers \n     employed on installations crossing the borders of two \n     states--one of which imposes an income tax and another which \n     does not--should be offset, it should provide the funding \n     necessary to offset the costs imposed on the states affected.\n\n  This is signed Harley T. Duncan, executive director, Federation of \nTax Administrators.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. \nDuncan be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             Federation of Tax Administrators,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1998.\n     Hon. Wendell H. Ford,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: I am writing concerning amendments to \n     the defense appropriations bills (S. 2057) which would \n     preempt Oregon, Kentucky and Nebraska from applying their \n     income taxes to certain federal employees (and in some cases \n     contractors) who work in those states, but reside in \n     bordering states with no income taxes (Washington, Tennessee \n     and South Dakota).\n       These amendments have been separately considered earlier in \n     the 105th Congress as H.R. 1953. The Federation of Tax \n     Administrators is an association of the principal tax \n     administration agencies in the 50 states, the District of \n     Columbia and New York City.

(The agreements do not \n     function with non-income-tax states such as Tennessee, and \n     thus they are not applicable in this case.)\n       The U.S. Constitution imposes substantive constraints on \n     the manner in which states may structure their tax systems. \n     These constraint ensure that the tax imposed meets \n     fundamental tests of fairness in dealing with all citizens. \n     The Constitution further ensures that state taxes do not \n     impose undue burdens on interstate commerce or the federal \n     government.

There is no \n     question that states have the legal authority to tax the \n     income of nonresidents working in Oregon, Kentucky or \n     Nebraska.\n       What this amendment would do is carve out a special tax \n     benefit for workers who choose to live (or move) out of state \n     that would not be available to any other employees working at \n     the same location. Further, the language exempts from \n     taxation wages paid to federal workers in Oregon and \n     Nebraska--but it exempts from tax income paid to all \n     individuals who work in Fort Campbell in Kentucky. This \n     encompasses not only contract employees who work directly for \n     the military (for instance, school teachers), but also \n     includes the employees of private companies who run \n     businesses or perform services on the base, including such \n     businesses as restaurants and road maintenance firms. These \n     are clearly private businesspeople, not federal workers. If \n     Kentucky is to be preempted from taxing individuals who work \n     for the federal government, we particularly urge the Senate \n     to adopt language that more precisely defines the matter. \n     (More precise definitions have been offered by the Pentagon.)\n       Finally, and most importantly, if change is necessary, it \n     is within the power of the states involved to do so. This is \n     an issue for state lawmakers, not federal lawmakers. \n     Lawmakers in Kentucky and Tennessee are seeking an equitable \n     solution that would not impose an unfair burden on either \n     state. Oregon has already passed a law that exempts from \n     taxation those federal employees who work on the dam in \n     Oregon. (We would emphasize that to continue to include \n     Oregon in this bill is unnecessary and an insult to the \n     elected officials of that state.)\n       The ability to define their tax systems within the bounds \n     of the Constitution is one of the core elements of \n     sovereignty preserved to the states under the Constitution. A \n     central feature of this sovereignty is the ability to tax \n     economic activity and income earned within the borders of the \n     state, and it is vital to the continued strong role of the \n     states in the federal system. State taxing authority should \n     be preempted by the federal government only where there is a \n     compelling policy rationale. There is no such rationale \n     present here.\n       The Senate is faced with an opportunity to demonstrate good \n     faith to the principles contained in The Unfunded Mandates \n     Act of\n\n[[Page S11218]]\n\n     1995. If Congress feels that the impact of federal workers on \n     installations crossing the borders of two states--one of \n     which imposes an income tax and the other of which does not--\n     should be offset, it should provide the funding necessary to \n     offset the costs imposed on the states affected.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Harley T. Duncan,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures also strongly oppose the State tax preemption provided in \nthe defense authorization bill. Let me read from an August 7, 1998, \nletter to the conferees. This was written to the chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, the Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nThurmond. ``Federal preemption of legitimate State taxing authority.'' \nThe National Conference of State Legislatures wrote to the chairman and \nsaid this is wrong:\n\n       On behalf of the National Conference of State Legislatures, \n     I am writing in opposition to Section 1045 of the House \n     version of the National Defense Authorization bill (H.R. \n     3616). NCSL opposes federal action that preempts the states' \n     constitutional authority to tax income earned within their \n     borders . . . We urge you to preserve the States' \n     sovereignty--\n\n  Preserve the States' sovereignty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the National Conference \nof State Legislatures be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               National Conference\n\n\n                                        of State Legislatures,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 7, 1998.\n     Re Federal preemption of legitimate State taxing authority.\n\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thurmond: On behalf of the National Conference \n     of State Legislatures, I am writing in opposition to Section \n     1045 of the House version of the National Defense \n     Authorization bill (HR 3616). NCSL opposes federal action \n     that preempts the states' constitutional authority to tax \n     income earned within their borders. Such federal legislation \n     leads to inequitable, unfair and unlevel state tax policies \n     and establishes a precedent for increased restrictions on \n     source taxation.\n       Section 1045 of the House bill would preempt state taxation \n     of federal workers in three locations. NCSL believes that the \n     states in question should be allowed to determine how to tax \n     workers who reside in one state and work in another, free \n     from federal intrusion.\n       We urge you to preserve the states' sovereignty right to \n     define their own tax systems by removing. Section 1045 from \n     the conference report on the bill. Finally, should the \n     conferees include the provision in the final bill, we urge \n     you to find an offset for the cost. Burdening the states with \n     an unfunded mandate violates the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     of 1994. The cost associated with the loss of states tax \n     revenue, due to change in federal policy, should be borne \n     exclusively by the federal government.\n       We look forward to working with you on this issue. Should \n     you have additional questions, please contact our committee \n     staff, Gerri Madrid, at (202) 624-8670.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Johnson,\n       Chair, Federal Budget and Taxation Committee, Ohio House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, apparently all of these requests to the \nRepublican conferees to keep this State preemption provision out of the \ndefense bill fell on deaf ears. The conferees either did not listen or \ndid not care. One way or another, this was a done deal, a sweetheart \ndeal, a special tax provision which favors one set of workers over \nanother for the same work performed, at the same location, despite \nState law.\n  We are sitting at the same table. We are both working for the same \nemployer. We are both doing the same job. We are both drawing the same \npay, but you do not pay any taxes because you are a resident of \nTennessee. I am a resident of Kentucky, and I pay my taxes.\n  Mr. President, all of the requests to the Republican conferees to \nkeep this State tax provision out of the defense bill fell on deaf \nears. I wanted to repeat that. It is a special tax provision which \nfavors one set of workers over another. It also gives the employers, or \nthe companies, an advantage when they bid, because they don't have to \npay the tax under this.\n  As I said earlier, the next bill ought to be exempting Kentucky \nresidents from the sales tax in Tennessee. Just show your driver's \nlicense and your address and place of employment, and you don't pay the \ntaxes, one of the highest sales tax States in the Nation because their \nincome comes from the sales tax.\n  I hope my colleagues understand the precedent that is being set here. \nWe are preempting State law--preempting State law--and establishing a \nspecial tax status for a group of not just Federal employees, but \nprivate sector workers who perform their work entirely within one \nState's borders. It is a very broad precedent. There is no stated \npolicy rationale for this special preemption and special tax status we \nare granting. It is a precedent that will haunt my colleagues.\n  I want my colleagues to understand how many other Federal facilities \nare in similar situations. When the workers at these facilities, not \njust the Federal workers, but the private sector workers as well, when \nthese workers find out about the sweetheart deal at Fort Campbell, they \nare going to be asking their Senators, ``Why can't we get a good deal \nas well?''\n  I have asked the Federal Tax Administrators just how many other \nFederal facilities are similarly situated. We have a preliminary list, \nbut it is only preliminary. It probably does not include everything. \nThe partial list we have shows there are 240 Federal facilities around \nthe country that are on or near the borders of two or more States with \nsignificantly different income tax structures.\n  We talk about how hard it was to work out this bill, how many issues \ncame before the committee. In the future, if this is the precedent that \nis being set, the Armed Services Committee will be in the tax business; \nthey will be in the finance business; they will be preempting State \nlaws and will not be looking after the right thing they should be \ndoing, and that is the defense of this great country of ours.\n\n  I want to share this with my colleagues because more than 20 other \nStates are affected. I think about 20 other States. That is 40 \nSenators--pretty good bunch of Senators. In other words, Senators from \nat least 20 other States are in jeopardy of having to face this same \nissue.\n  What have you done to the future of the military bill, the defense \nauthorization bill? What have you done to it? You have turned it into a \nfinance bill, not a defense bill. And I say to my colleagues, if they \nare from one of these States, you might be standing up here next year. \nOnce the private sector employees find out about the special tax \npreemption, they may be lobbying their Senators next year to exempt \nthem from the State tax laws in your State.\n  Let me read a list, and this is only a partial list: Arkansas has 7 \ninstallations. Arizona has 7. California has 50--50 installations \nsimilar to the one in Kentucky. Think about that when the two Senators \nfrom California will have to say--it goes all the way from military \nfacilities, such as Fort Irwin Naval Weapons Center, Sierra Army Depot, \nthe Grand Mesa National Forest.\n  Connecticut has 2. Georgia has 1. Maine has 1. Oh, I remember the \nargument here between Maine and New Hampshire. They are left out of \nthis bill. They are left out of this bill because both of them \napparently are on the other side. I was for Maine.\n  Massachusetts has 1. Mississippi has 8. Mississippi is probably the \nmost vulnerable State of all of them because of their border situation. \nCan you imagine what would happen if all of these employees went to the \ntwo Senators in Mississippi and said, ``Right across the line here in \nTennessee they receive tax exemptions. What about us? What about us? \nWhat's fair for the goose is fair for the gander.''\n  Missouri has 6. Montana has 10. They are not in this bill. Nebraska \nhas 1. New Jersey has 20--New Jersey has 20. New Mexico has 6. New York \nhas only 1. I was surprised at that. But North Carolina has 13--North \nCarolina has 13. Oregon has 20. Pennsylvania has 1. I heard a lot about \nthe Philadelphia Naval Yard last year.\n  South Carolina has 1. South Dakota has 3. Tennessee has 3. Utah has \n37. Think about that. Utah has 37 installations similar to the \nsituation in this bill.\n  What about those employees--Federal employees, private sector \nemployees--who were not exempt? Can you\n\n[[Page S11219]]\n\nimagine what the two Senators from Utah are going to face when they \nunderstand that other States were preempted and created a special tax \ngroup?\n  Vermont has 2. The State of Washington has 37.\n  What about the Indian reservations? Oh, we get into a good one \nthere--Indian reservations. What about State workers at Indian casinos \nlocated on tribal lands? I do not understand. Why, the little leak in \nthe dike here is beginning to take away the whole dike; and it could.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of these \nlocations in the various States be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n 240 Federal Facilities Potentially Affected by the Precedent (Located \n                       on or Near State Borders)\n\n\n                              arizona (7)\n\n       Hoover Dam.\n       Davis Dam.\n       Glen Canyon Dam.\n       Parker Dam.\n       Imperial Dam.\n       Several National Forests.\n       Military Installations near Yuma.\n\n\n                              arkansas (9)\n\n       Federal prison in Forrest City.\n       Corps of Engineers projects at Beaver Lake.\n       Corps of Engineers projects at Bull Shoals Lake.\n       Corps of Engineers projects at Norfolk Lake.\n       Corps of Engineers projects at the Arkansas River.\n       Fort Chaffee Army base.\n       Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge.\n       White River National Refuge.\n       VA Hospital in Fayetteville.\n\n\n                            california (50)\n\n       Military Facilities--Fort Irwin, Naval Weapons Center, \n     Sierra Army Depot.\n       National Forests--Eldorado, Inyo, Klamath, Modoc, Plumas, \n     Rogue River, Shasta-Trinity, Sierra, Siskiyou, Six Rivers, \n     Stanislaus, Tahoe, Toiyabe.\n       National Parks and Monuments--Clear Lake National Wildlife \n     Refuge, Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National \n     Park, Kings Canyon National Park, Lava Beds National \n     Monuments, Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge, Modoc \n     National Wildlife Refuge, Mojave National Preserve, Mt. \n     Shasta Recreation Center, Redwood National Park, Tule Lake \n     National Wildlife Refuge, Yosemite National Park.\n       U.S. Bureau of Reclamation--Boca Dam, Imperial Diversion, \n     Laguana Diversion, Lake Tahoe Dam, Prosser Creek Dam, Senator \n     Wash, Sly Park, Stampede Dam, Colorado Dinosaur National \n     Monument.\n       Routt National Forest.\n       Arapaho National Forest.\n       Roosevelt National Forest.\n       Rocky Mountain National Park.\n       Pawnee National Grassland.\n       Comanche National Grassland.\n       Great Sand Dunes National Monument.\n       Rio Grande National Forest.\n       San Juan National Forest.\n       Mesa Verde National Park.\n       Uncompahgre National Forest.\n       Colorado National Monument.\n       Grand Mesa National Forest.\n\n\n                            connecticut (2)\n\n       U.S. Naval Submarine Base, Groton.\n       U.S. Coast Guard Academy, New London.\n\n\n                                Georgia\n\n       Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base.\n\n\n                                 maine\n\n       Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.\n\n\n                             massachusetts\n\n       Hanscom Air Force Base.\n\n\n                            mississippi (8)\n\n       Holly Springs National Forest.\n       NASA Test Site, Bay St. Louis.\n       Vicksburg National Military Park.\n       U.S. Corps of Engineers District Office, Vicksburg.\n       Natchez Trace Parkway.\n       Meridian Naval Air Station.\n       Columbus Air Force Base.\n       TVA, Tupelo.\n\n\n                              missouri (6)\n\n     Federal Locks and Dams:\n       No. 20 near Canton.\n       No. 21 near West Quincy.\n       No. 22 near Saverton.\n       No. 24 near Clarksville.\n       No. 25 near West Alton.\n       No. 27 near St. Louis.\n\n\n                              montana (10)\n\n       Kootenai National Forest.\n       Lolo National Forest.\n       Bitteroot National Forest.\n       Beaverhead National Forest.\n       Custer National Forest.\n       Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area.\n       Yellowstone National Park.\n       Glacier National Park.\n       Crow Reservation.\n       Blackfeet Reservation.\n\n\n                                nebraska\n\n       Gavins Point Dam.\n\n\n                            new jersey (20)\n\n       McGuire Air Force Base.\n       Fort Dix Army Installation.\n       U.S. Naval Air Station, Lakehurst.\n       Pomona Naval Training Airport.\n       U.S. Naval Recreation Target Area, Ocean City.\n       Ft.

Mr. President, I also want to make clear to my colleagues \nthat this special tax preemption provision in the bill is a clear \nviolation of the spirit of the Unfunded Mandates Act. I have said that \nbefore, but I want to make it clear. This provision will cost my State \n$4 million in lost revenue. What are we doing to offset the loss from \nthe special tax preemption provision in this bill? Nothing. Absolutely \nnothing. Not a thing.\n  Mr. President, if this special provision had been offered on the \nSenate floor, I would have offered a second-degree amendment requiring \nus to at least study the broad scope of the precedent we were setting \nhere before we acted. I am not sure a great deal of thought has been \ngiven to the far-reaching effect of this one little amendment in the \ndefense authorization bill. It was a special political decision, and \nthat special political decision will have ripples that will turn into \nwaves in the future.\n  Mr. President, had this special provision been offered on the Senate \nfloor, I would have asked for a study. Let's think through this one. We \nare preempting the States; we are telling the States how they can tax \nand how they cannot tax. This is not a Federal tax. This is a State \ntax.\n  I think my colleagues would have been shocked at how broad this \nprecedent is by applying this sweetheart deal at Federal facilities \nacross the country. They would be embarrassed to find out the extent to \nwhich we are meddling in State tax law matters on a defense \nauthorization bill--all to create a special State tax status for a \nselect group of Federal and private sector workers. I think my \ncolleagues would want to know this information.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the amendment I \nwould have offered be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . STUDY ON NON-RESIDENT WAGE EARNERS AT FEDERAL \n                   FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall conduct a study \n     which--\n       (1) identifies all federal facilities located within 50 \n     miles of the border of an adjacent State;\n       (2) estimates the number of non-resident wage earners \n     employed at such federal facilities; and\n       (3) compiles and describes all agreements or compacts \n     between States regarding the taxation of non-resident wage \n     earners employed at such facilities.\n       (b) The Secretary shall transmit the results of such study \n     to the Congress not later than 180 days after the enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the proponents of this special deal suggest \nthat Tennessee employees receive no services from the State of Kentucky \nand, therefore, should be entitled to their special exemption. Mr. \nPresident, this is simply not the case. Let me read from a July 11, \n1997, letter from the Kentucky Revenue Cabinet outlining the services \nthe State of Kentucky provides to those workers.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that these are Federal and private \nsector workers who perform their work within the borders of the State \nof Kentucky.\n\n       Roads--Fort Campbell is accessible from both the Kentucky \n     side and the Tennessee side. Most workers enter the base at \n     the gate nearest their work station. This means, for example, \n     that most hospital workers enter on the Tennessee side . . . \n     and most school workers enter on the Kentucky side using \n     Kentucky maintained roads (the school is in Kentucky).\n       Water and sewer services-- . . .\n       Electrical service--Most is supplied directly to the base \n     by the Tennessee Valley Authority. One housing area, however, \n     is supplied by the Pennyrile Electric Cooperative, a \n     Kentucky-based electric company.\n       Cooperative Fire Protection [is there]. . . .\n       Schools--The school system on the Fort Campbell base is \n     fully self-contained and federally funded. It is limited \n     [however] to the children of active duty military personnel . \n     . .\n       Police Protection--. . . .\n       Unemployment Benefits--. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, we talk about exempting the Tennessee employees from \npaying Kentucky tax, but the Federal civilian workers who become \nunemployed can apply for benefits from the State where they work or the \nState where they live. If a Tennessee resident working in Kentucky \nbecomes unemployed and applies in Tennessee, a transfer is made from \nthe Kentucky fund to the Tennessee fund to pay that worker's \nunemployment claim.\n  What is wrong with that agreement? I don't think anything. The result \nis that wherever the claim is filed, Kentucky funds pay the claim.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter from Alex W. Rose, \ncommissioner, Department of Law, Kentucky Revenue Cabinet, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  Revenue Cabinet,\n\n\n                                    Office of General Counsel,\n\n                                     Frankfort, KY, July 11, 1997.\n     Re H.R. 1953--Fort Campbell.\n     Mr. Harley Duncan,\n     Federation of Tax Administrators,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Harley: The Revenue Cabinet has gathered some \n     information on the Fort Campbell issues of whether employees \n     who live in Tennessee and work on the Kentucky side of the \n     Fort Campbell installation receive any benefits from the \n     state of Kentucky.\n       The question of what services Kentucky provides is quite \n     broad. I will attempt to itemize below what we have \n     investigated and the results.\n       Roads--Fort Campbell is accessible from both the Kentucky \n     side and the Tennessee side. Most workers enter the base at \n     the gate nearest their work station. This means, for example, \n     that most hospital workers enter on the Tennessee side (the \n     hospital is in Tennessee), and most school workers enter on \n     the Kentucky side using Kentucky maintained roads (the school \n     is in Kentucky).\n       Water and Sewer Service--Self contained on the base.\n       Electric Service--Most is supplied directly to the base by \n     the Tennessee Valley Authority. One housing area, however, is \n     supplied by the Pennyrile Electric Cooperative, a Kentucky \n     based electric company.\n       Cooperative Fire Protection--Local communities in both \n     Kentucky and Tennessee have agreements with Fort Campbell to \n     assist in the event of a major fire or other emergency.\n       Schools--The school system on the Fort Campbell base is \n     fully self-contained and federally funded. It is limited to \n     the children of active duty military personnel stationed at \n     the military base.\n       Police Protection--All police protection is self-contained. \n     Responsibility for Fort Campbell and all federal military \n     bases rests with the federal/military police.\n       Unemployment Benefits--Federal civilian workers who become \n     unemployed can apply for benefits from the state where they \n     work or the state where they live. If a Tennessee resident \n     working in Kentucky becomes unemployed and applies in \n     Tennessee, a transfer is made from the Kentucky fund to the \n     Tennessee fund to pay that worker's unemployment claim. The \n     result is that wherever the claim is filed, Kentucky funds \n     pay the claim.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you in your efforts \n     concerning H.R. 1953. It is our belief that the civilian \n     employees who work on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell \n     definitely receive some benefits from the state of Kentucky.\n       The Kentucky Revenue Cabinet greatly appreciates the work \n     FTA is doing on H.R. 1953. Harley, we can't thank you and \n     your staff enough. If I can be of further assistance, please \n     let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Alex W. Rose,\n\n                                  Commissioner, Department of Law,\n                                         Kentucky Revenue Cabinet.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, had this conference report been on a Senate \nbill, I would have offered a motion to recommit the bill to conference \nto strip this special State tax preemption provision from the bill. It \nis quite unfair, and I think everybody understands that.\n  They are doing a political favor, because the Senators who represent \nthat\n\n[[Page S11221]]\n\nState are from another party. I do not understand why my colleague, who \nis a member of that party, would allow this to happen to his State. I \nthought we were here representing our constituents, not our party. I \nthink it is disappointing that both my colleagues here in the Senate \nand the Congressman from the First District in my State allowed this to \nhappen without at least raising their voice in objection.\n  However, I understand the option is no longer mine to offer any kind \nof amendment or any kind of motion to recommit. Since this is a House \nbill and it has already been approved by the House, thereby dissolving \nthe conference, I understand the rules. I think I know the rules \nreasonably well here--not quite as well as Senator Byrd or, hopefully, \nthe Parliamentarian, but I have no illusions about what the outcome of \nthat vote might have been. After all, a sweetheart deal is a sweetheart \ndeal.\n  I did want to draw attention to this provision. It is patently \nunfair. It has no place in this bill. The committees that put this bill \ntogether have no jurisdiction over the issue whatever. I think it is a \ndark mark on this piece of legislation as it relates to States rights, \ngoing outside the jurisdiction of the committee. I think it leaves a \nblack mark and a black cloud over this piece of legislation. This \nspecial tax preemption provision is terrible policy. We should not be \ndictating to States how to administer their own tax laws. We should not \nbe imposing our will on the States in matters that have nothing to do \nwith the Federal law and are traditionally and constitutionally left to \nthe States to resolve.\n  We hear a lot of rhetoric from the other side of the aisle that is \nnever matched by the actions we see around this place. They say ``lower \ntaxes,'' but fail to say how they will offset them without causing more \ndeficits. They say ``less government,'' without saying where they will \ncut. They say ``no more unfunded mandates,'' but continue to impose \nunfunded mandates on the States. And this is, in the strictest \ninterpretation, an unfunded mandate. They say ``States rights,'' but \ncontinue to pass special proposals like this one, which preempt State \nlaw, even in the areas that have been left to the States for the last \n200 years.\n  Once again, Mr. President, we see that the rhetoric does not match \nthe reality. When my friends on the other side see that expanding the \nrole of Federal law fits their purposes, the rhetoric about States \nrights goes out the window. When they create a special tax exemption by \nimposing a $4 million cost onto another State, the unfunded mandates \nrhetoric goes out the window.\n  Mr. President, I am very disappointed we have seen this issue, the \npreemption of State tax law, legislated this way on a defense \nauthorization bill. It is bitterly opposed by my State and it ought to \nbe bitterly opposed by every other Senator on this floor.\n  I say to my colleagues, you have created a broad precedent here that \nI believe will come back to haunt you. I will not be here on the floor \nto see it play out but I can see it coming. The next time, it won't be \nKentucky that will be hit. It very well may be the State of one of the \nMembers who sat on the conference.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator has 40 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FORD. I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and I \nask that the time be equally charged.\n  Mr. FORD. I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. FORD. Since I objected, I will use some of my time.\n  I was hoping that the proposer of this amendment would be here on the \nfloor so we could discuss it a little bit more. I have been here, now, \nfor about 30 minutes--I guess, a little better--trying to discuss my \nside, and I don't want to lose my time on the basis that the opposition \nor the proponent is not here. I am more than willing to let the time \ncome off of the time of the managers of the bill but I prefer the time \nnot come off of mine. If the chairman of the committee and the manager \nof the bill would like to do that, I would have no objection. If he \nprefers not to do that, I hope he will encourage the Senators from \nTennessee to come to the floor.\n  The only problem I have here before I suggest a quorum is, I would \nnot want to be preempted from taking the quorum off--which I could--and \nthen we would have to go through the process. Would the Senator give me \nthe assurance he would not object if I want to take the quorum off?\n  Mr. THURMOND. No objection.\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during \nthe quorum be charged equally to the four entities that have time on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe conference report we are considering today. This report includes a \nprovision that will provide relief to approximately 2,000 citizens of \nmy State of Tennessee who are being unfairly taxed by the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky. These people are civilian employees at Fort Campbell who \nlive in Tennessee and work on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell.\n  They are being required to pay income tax to Kentucky. But they \nreceive no services from Kentucky.\n  I understand that it has been stated on the floor this morning that \nTennessee is taking unfair advantage of Kentucky, that perhaps we will \nbankrupt the State or do grievous harm to them--basically a conspiracy \namong Democrats and Republicans, apparently, Tennesseans and \nKentuckians, to perpetrate somewhat of an outrage against the good \nfolks of Kentucky.\n  I am sorry that we can't debate it based strictly on the merits of \nthe action being taken, because it is a very, very meritorious \nobjective consideration of what we are doing here today. On any \nobjective consideration in terms of sound policy, or in terms of \nfairness, this provision stands and survives.\n  We are not taking unfair advantage of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, \nour good neighbors to the north. What we are doing, as attested to by a \nvote of 15-to-0 out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, is righting \na wrong and correcting an inequity.\n  The Commonwealth of Kentucky has gotten used to being able to tax \nTennesseans--levy income tax on them--without providing any services to \nthem. Weaning from a situation like that I guess perhaps can be \nsomewhat painful, but I don't think it is going to do grievous harm to \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky, which I understand had a $306 million \nsurplus last year, and is perhaps beside the point.\n  But when we are talking about fairness and equity, and some of the \nother things we are discussing today, and the fact that we are \ndiscussing basic principles and so forth, and who looks out for the \nlittle guy, we are basically dealing with civilian employees working at \nFort Campbell with average incomes of about $30,000 a year. So these \nTennesseans are paying about $1,800 a year to Kentucky for nothing in \nreturn. So let's just put that in a little bit of perspective.\n  Of course, it is not just the Tennessee-Kentucky situation, it is two \nother situations where the Federal facility straddles the State border. \nThis provides relief for the State of Washington also. It also provides \nrelief for the State of South Dakota. I don't see the Members of the \nState of Oregon, which is affected by it, or the State of Nebraska, \nwhich is affected by it, to seem to have any problems either with\n\n[[Page S11222]]\n\nthe constitutionality or the fairness of their situations. The \nsituations are basically the same.\n  But we have an issue here today with regard to Tennessee and \nKentucky. So be it.\n  As I said, these are civilian Federal employees. They work in Fort \nCampbell, KY. As it is well known, 80 percent of Fort Campbell is in \nthe State of Tennessee. The mailbox is Kentucky. It is referred to as \nFort Campbell, KY. There are several Federal civilian employees who \nlive in Tennessee and who work on the Kentucky side. Some of them have \nworked on the Tennessee side for a long time and are assigned on the \nKentucky side. They have nothing to do with that. It is not within \ntheir power, if they want to remain employed. And thereby Tennessee \ndoes not have an income tax. Kentucky does. They pay the maximum sales \ntax and other taxes in Tennessee, plus the income tax of Kentucky. They \nenter the Federal facilities on the Kentucky side by a Federal route. \nThey do not go on the property of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to enter \nthe place where they are working.\n  As I said, there are no services provided. I understand there was \nsome reference made to some resident facilities being provided with \nwater or some services. Of course, these people do not avail themselves \nof that. I can't imagine anything other than a most dire emergency \nwhere fire, water, sewer, and police protection, and all of that is \nprovided by the Federal Government. If the problem gets so big, I \nimagine folks in Tennessee and Kentucky would come in and try to help \nout. But basically, in terms of basic services--fire, police, sewer, \nand water--none of those services is provided by the Commonwealth of \nKentucky for the benefit of these employees. Basically what they are \ndoing is paying income taxes for nothing received.\n  As I said, these people are not in the military. There is already an \nexemption for the military employees. They can only be taxed in their \nState of residence.\n  This is a situation where literally some people have been transferred \nand moved across the street, or even down the hall in their own \nbuilding, and become subject, just because of that move, to Federal \nincome tax or to income tax from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. When \npeople in that situation--who live in Tennessee, work in Kentucky, only \ngo on Federal property to get to their job, come right back, no \nservices--if those individuals go on unemployment, they can't go to the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky and get unemployment benefits.\n  We had a witness before the Governmental Affairs Committee, when this \nwas taken up, who makes $15,000 a year--$15,000 a year, and three \nkids--is a Federal civilian employee, lives in Tennessee, and works on \nthe Kentucky side. When she went on hard times and had to apply for \nfood stamps, she applied to the State of Kentucky and was turned down.\n  There was another witness who appeared before our committee who had \nbeen in the Air Force for 20 years, grew up in Kentucky, and paid \nKentucky taxes far 20 years; then he moved to Tennessee; then he was \nassigned at Fort Campbell on the Kentucky side while he was living in \nTennessee--the typical kind of a situation we are addressing. His \ndaughter applied to the University of Kentucky. He sought instate \ntuition rates. He was denied that. He was treated as out-of-State for \npurposes of tuition when his daughter wanted to go to the University of \nKentucky.\n  In other words, he is a Tennessean under some circumstances, when it \nbenefits the Commonwealth, and a Kentuckian in other circumstances, \nwhen it benefits the Commonwealth.\n  As I said, it is not just Tennessee that is involved here. Employees \nat the Gavin's Point Hydroelectric Dam are in a similar situation. This \ndam is a Federal facility maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers and \nit straddles the Missouri River. The Missouri River is the border \nbetween South Dakota and Nebraska. The 35 South Dakotans who are \nemployed at the dam are subject to Nebraska income tax on half their \nwages earned on the dam. Nebraska claims that because half of the \nGavin's Point Dam is in the State of Nebraska, half the wages earned by \nSouth Dakotans on the dam are subject to Nebraska income tax. But these \nSouth Dakotans only travel into Nebraska while they are working on the \nFederal dam and they receive no benefits from Nebraska for the taxes \nthat they are required to pay. They are ineligible for Nebraska \nunemployment benefits and accident insurance benefits.\n  Likewise, Washingtonians employed at the Columbia River hydroelectric \ndams were subject to tax by the State of Oregon until just recently.\n  These dams are Federal facilities maintained by the Army Corps of \nEngineers. They straddle the Columbia River. The Columbia River is the \nborder between Washington and Oregon. One-hundred and forty \nWashingtonians working on these dams only cross into Oregon when their \nwork takes them across the midpoint of the dams. Oregon had required \nthese employees to keep detailed records regarding the exact amount of \nthe time they spent on the Oregon side of the dam in order to obtain a \ntax refund from Oregon for time worked on the Washington side of the \ndam. Oregon also required Washington residents to pay income tax on a \nprorated amount of their vacation pay based upon the percentage of time \nduring the year worked on the Oregon side of the dam. Because employees \nat the dam cross back and forth multiple times a day, Oregonians' \nrecordkeeping requirements forced the Federal employees to waste a good \nportion of their workday documenting their movements across the dam.\n  The Washington residents working on the Columbia River Dam receive no \nbenefits from the State of Oregon. They are not eligible for instate \ntuition rates at Oregon schools. They are not eligible for Oregon \nunemployment compensation benefits. In fact, when a Washingtonian who \nwas laid off from Washington at one of the dams applied for Oregon \nunemployment compensation, he was denied. But when he later received \nunemployment benefits from Washington, Oregon tried to tax those \nbenefits.\n  I recognize that the Oregon State Legislature enacted a bill last \nyear to exempt Washingtonians employed at the Columbia River Dam from \nOregon income tax. But it appears that the State was only reacting to \nthe other body's swift movement of H.R. 1953. Oregon is continuing to \nrequire Washington residents to file W-2 forms in Oregon. Therefore, \nWashingtonians fear that Oregon may repeal the recently enacted \nexemption in the absence of Federal legislation.\n  Now, there is no question that with the passage of the Buck Act in \n1940, States have the authority to tax Federal employees, but over a \nperiod of time, after due deliberation by Congress, there have been \nexceptions that have been made to this. There has been an exception for \nthe military. There has been an exception for Members of Congress. \nThere has been an exception for Amtrak employees, for example, \nemployees who, of course, travel over several States. There was an \nexemption with regard to the ability to tax pension income from \nnonresidents. So these have been exemptions, and we can argue and \ndebate the wisdom of each of these exemptions, but it has been long \nrecognized.\n  There is no question about the constitutionality, incidentally. The \nwitnesses even before our committee who did not think that what we were \ndoing was the best way to go, I don't think raised any questions \nconcerning the constitutionality of what we were doing.\n  Congress clearly has the right constitutionally to move in this \nregard. We can debate the merits of each of these exemptions, but there \nhas been no question over the years after due deliberation there have \nbeen exemptions carved out on the basis of what is right and on the \nbasis of fairness. This idea that we are opening up Pandora's box and \nit is going to affect anybody who works near a Federal facility or \nanything of that nature is certainly a misplaced concern. But that is \nnot something that has been affected here--not employees who are near a \nborder. We are talking about a specific situation where you have a \nFederal facility straddling two States. One State does not have a State \nincome tax and the other State does. That is a very, very specific and \nnarrow situation with which we are dealing.\n  It does not affect national parks, for example, where local \ngovernments\n\n[[Page S11223]]\n\nhave much more to do with providing emergency services and things of \nthat nature than the Commonwealth of Kentucky or the other two States \naffected here, the State of Oregon and the State of Nebraska, provide \nin these situations.\n  I agree that Congress should tread carefully when it acts to limit \nthe taxing authorities of States, but these three situations addressed \nby the conference report are exceptional, and I believe they meet the \nelevated threshold which has been set by Congress for preempting a \nState's taxing authority.\n  At this time I would like to thank my distinguished colleagues who \nhave served as conferees on the Strom Thurmond National Defense \nAuthorization Act for including this important provision in the final \nbill. I would also like to thank my friends from Tennessee, Congressman \nBryant and Senator Frist, for their hard work on behalf of these 2,000 \nTennesseans. I am pleased they are finally getting the tax relief they \ndeserve. I urge all of my colleagues to support this conference report.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I am delighted that the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee would come to the floor to explain his reasons for using the \nArmed Services legislation in an authorization bill for a tax \nprovision.\n  One of the things my distinguished friend said is that Kentucky \nprovides no facilities. Well, if a person who is employed at Fort \nCampbell files for unemployment benefits in Tennessee, guess who pays \nfor it. Guess who pays for it. Kentucky reimburses Tennessee. Isn't \nthat a service?\n  I heard talk about other States. Let's talk about our States--the \nroads that enter at the nearest gate. Sure, we have electrical service \nthat is provided. That comes out of Kentucky into Fort Campbell. We \nhave cooperative fire suppression. If they say it is serious, both \nTennessee and Kentucky would be there.\n  Unemployment benefits--I am surprised the Senator would say that we \ndon't pay anything. We reimburse Tennessee for the unemployment. \nKentucky pays. He raised the fact that the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee held a hearing on this but the Finance Committee did not. \nWhen did the Governmental Affairs Committee take over for the Finance \nCommittee?\n  The Senator has talked about Oregon quite a bit. I have a copy of a \nletter to the Senator, written from the director of the Department of \nRevenue, saying that they settled their own problem, that Oregon passed \ntheir bill and the States worked it out. There is no need for them to \nbe included in this legislation. Here is the letter, dated October 21, \n1997. The Senator had it almost a year, but yet they put Oregon and \nWashington in this legislation and they don't need it. The States have \nworked it out themselves.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to Senator \nThompson from the director of the Oregon Department of Revenue be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 Oregon Department of Revenue,\n\n                                      Salem, OR, October 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     U.S. Senate, Chair, Committee on Governmental Affairs, Senate \n         Dirksen, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to alert you to a piece of \n     proposed federal legislation that is scheduled for a hearing \n     this Friday. The proposal, contained in H.R. 1953, would \n     place a federal prohibition upon the state of Oregon that \n     would not allow Oregon to impose an income tax on Washington \n     residents whom are federal employees working on the dams that \n     span the Columbia River.\n       We were alerted to this problem earlier this year and were \n     successful in obtaining legislation at the state level that \n     exempts these Washington residents from Oregon income tax \n     effective January 1, 1997. A copy of the bill, which has been \n     signed into law by our Governor, is enclosed (See Sections 6 \n     and 7 of Enrolled Senate Bill 998). We have been in contact \n     with the Army Corps of Engineers and have jointly developed \n     procedures that will ensure that the affected workers will \n     not be taxed on this income and will receive a full refund of \n     any amounts withheld prior to the passage of the bill.\n       I am concerned that the federal government is proceeding \n     with legislation to address a problem that Oregon has already \n     resolved. We take very seriously our responsibility to \n     establish and maintain a tax system that is fair to all \n     citizens regardless of their state of residency. As such, we \n     are generally opposed to external mandates believing that \n     they impinge on Oregon's sovereign right to define its own \n     tax system. Accordingly, any efforts on your part to remove \n     Oregon from this federal mandate would be greatly \n     appreciated.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to express my concerns about \n     this proposed legislation. Please feel free to contact me if \n     you want to discuss the issue further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Elizabeth Harchenko,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator says that this only applies to two States \nreally, or very few. But the precedent here is the dangerous thing. We \nstart under the Buck Act, and I am sure the Senator, being a legal \nexpert, is fully familiar with the Buck Act and what it says about the \nState's ability to tax its own. Now, if he is not familiar with that, I \ncan help him a little bit in trying to explain the Buck Act.\n  But the two States were in the process of negotiating when they were \ninformed, or at least the Tennessee side was informed, that it would be \ntaken care of here. And it was being taken care of, so the negotiations \nwere called off.\n  I remember when Tennessee called a special session to prevent \nKentucky contractors from doing business in Tennessee. This is a long-\nterm thing. It is just not the first one. I go back into the early \n1960s when this occurred.\n  So, Mr. President, I understand what the Senator is trying to do, but \nI wonder how he voted on the unfunded mandates bill. You are \neliminating $4 million a year--$4 million a year--from Kentucky's \nincome. Are Kentuckians excused from the high Tennessee sales tax? Why \nnot? Why wasn't that put in this bill? If you are going to be exempt \nfrom our income tax, why don't you exempt Kentuckians, who are \nidentical employees with an identical employer? What about the \nrestaurants and the canteens and the cleaners and such that are going \nto be exempt under this, the private sector? This is a broad, broad \npiece of legislation. Broad, broad.\n  Let me read the Buck Act. Of course, we have the authority, I guess, \nto do that, but is it right? There are 240 known installations similar \nto this situation. And Mississippi is one of the most vulnerable States \nin the country as it relates to this type of legislation.\n  The Buck Act says:\n\n       No person shall be relieved from his liability for any \n     income tax levied by any State, or by any duly constitutional \n     taxing authority therein, having jurisdiction to levy such a \n     tax by reason of his residing within a Federal area or \n     receiving income from transactions occurring or services \n     performed in such area. And such State or taxing authority \n     shall have full jurisdiction and power to levy and collect \n     such tax in any Federal area within such State to the same \n     extent and with the same effect as though such area was not a \n     Federal area.\n  That is the Buck Act.\n  My colleague lays out exempting military employees. When I served in \nWorld War II, we got exempted then. You only paid taxes in the State \nwhere you resided. That is nothing new. That is 55 years old, I guess--\nsomething near that. It has been here for 55 years.\n  He talked about Amtrak employees. They are on a train, they are going \nacross the country. Would they pay tax in every State? Of course not. \nThat is common sense, to let them pay tax in the State where they \nreside.\n  We have a lot of employees on the Interstate Highway System. They \nlive in one State and they work in several States, as they construct \ninterstate highways through various States. They are exempted. That is \ncommon sense.\n  But, to take an exemption and cost a State $4 million--what kind of \nsurplus does Tennessee have? He refers to the surplus of Kentucky. What \nkind of surplus does Tennessee have? That has nothing to do with the \nprinciple and the character of this provision under the armed services \ndefense authorization bill.\n  The Senator can argue all he wants to, but when he talks about in-\nState and out-of-State college, that individual renounced his Kentucky \ncitizenship and moved to Tennessee. You enjoyed him moving over there. \nYou probably welcomed him with open arms. But then you come in here and \nsay he cannot get exemption in another State? Why didn't he go to \nTennessee, if he likes it so much? We have a few universities there \nthat are pretty good. They\n\n[[Page S11224]]\n\nget State exemption, residential exemption. He just happened to want to \ngo to a better school. So, you fuss about that. They moved to \nTennessee. Anybody else from any other State would not be exempted. \nTennessee would not exempt a Kentuckian residing in the State of \nKentucky to go to a Tennessee school. That seems to me a pretty thin \nreason for having this section of the armed services bill.\n  Mr. President, I go back to the point--I have heard many, many \nSenators in this body talk about States rights. There is a lot of \nrhetoric here. There is a difference between talk and action--talk and \naction. The talk is States rights. The action is taking it away.\n  This bill is going to pass. There is no question about that. I have \nno illusions. I have counted votes around here longer than the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, and I understand what the vote will be. But you have \nsomething in the legislation that is not right, that is not fair, that \nthe States were in the process of trying to work out and to negotiate. \nThen the word comes from Big Brother: ``Don't you worry about it, we'll \ntake care of it. Big Brother is going to preempt the States. Big \nBrother is going to take care of a few residents in this legislation.'' \nThere are other States that have already settled. The Senator from \nTennessee has the letter setting it out and objecting to what he is \ntrying to do here because they worked it out as a State. You preempt \nthe States.\n  What would happen if we were preempting Tennessee? Oh, it would be a \nbear in here. There would be growling and fighting and fuming and \nfussing over preempting Kentuckians in Tennessee. I hope my colleague \nfrom Kentucky, Senator McConnell, will offer an amendment or something \nnext year so Kentuckians who are in the same position will not have to \npay the outrageous Tennessee sales tax. Just have a drivers license, \nshow it, so we can be exempt.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I forgot to inquire as to the time \nsituation. I understand we had 30 minutes. May I ask if time was kept \non me before, how much time I have remaining on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee controls 14 minutes \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, just in response on some of the points \nthat my friend from Kentucky made with regard to whether or not the \nother States need this and whether or not it is worked out permanently \nto their satisfaction, I think probably the Members of this body who \nrepresent those States would be the best witnesses. If the Oregon \nsituation is worked out, then perhaps Senator Gorton and Senator Murray \nwill oppose me on this. But I do not think they do. I think the two \nSenators from the State of Washington do not feel like it has been \nworked out.\n  Just as the situation is with South Dakota. I think the distinguished \nminority leader of this body supports this provision in the \nlegislation. So, regarding the Tennessee/Kentucky situation, the \nnegotiations that my friend refers to, I think the result was a bit \ndifferent than what has been alluded to. My understanding was there was \none meeting in August and the suggestion was that Tennessee absorb the \ndifference; that we give these Tennessee employees a credit and the \nState of Tennessee absorb the difference. That was not considered to be \nfair by the people in Tennessee, so those negotiations broke down.\n  With regard to the college tuition situation, at issue here is not \nthat this gentleman moved from Kentucky back to Tennessee; that is for \nsure. The issue is he was working on the Kentucky side and paying \nKentucky income taxes and still not getting that benefit from Kentucky. \nThat is the point. I believe, if my colleague will check--I suppose we \ncannot resolve it here this morning--but I think, if my colleague will \ncheck, he will see that when the situation is reversed, my \nunderstanding is when Kentuckians work on the Tennessee side, they get \nTennessee instate tuition.\n  I do not want to get into an extended battle between the States here. \nWe enjoy a common border and friendly relationships and all that. But \njust on the basis of fairness, I believe we are doing a little bit \nbetter in that regard, in terms of comity, in terms of out-of-State \ntuition for workers who work at Fort Campbell. It is just simply based \nupon the proposition that a person should not have to go across the \nborder, down the hall or down the street or across the street and so \nforth, when he is assigned new duties, not use any of the Kentucky \nfacilities, and have to pay Kentucky income tax and not get any of the \nbenefits, whether it be college instate tuition or not.\n  I would also point out to my colleague with regard to Kentucky \nemployees working at Fort Campbell who work on the Tennessee side, as \nfar as ``on the post'' is concerned, they do not pay Tennessee sales \ntax. If they go off the post they will pay Tennessee sales tax, but \nthen they are using Tennessee facilities. The point is just simply not \nwell founded any way that you look at it.\n  With regard to the States rights issue, that is something that, of \ncourse, is of concern to all of us. A lot of people strongly believe in \nfederalism and that the proper role of the States should be preserved \nin the relationship between the State and the Federal Government. I \nwould simply point out that with regard to most of these issues, it has \nto do with the relationship between the State governments and the \nFederal Government, and the Federal Government's relationship with the \nStates and their policies vis a vis the Federal Government.\n  This has to do with the way a State government is treating the \ncitizens of another State. Ever since we have had the interstate \ncommerce clause in the Constitution, that has been something that has \nbeen appropriately addressed by the Congress of the United States.\n  So I do not want to beat a dead horse here either. I feel, as does my \ncolleague from Kentucky, that we are not going to change very many \nvotes on this debate. But, in closing, I hope our friends in Kentucky \ndo not feel that this is some kind of a power grab, something that is \nunfair to them, something that we have them over the barrel on.\n  This is something that is supported by Democrats and Republicans in \nthis body. It is very narrowly tailored. My friend refers to 240 other \nsituations. They are not similar. The only comparable or analogous \nsituations would be those situations where Federal facilities straddle \na State border, and there are only three of them, and those are the \nthree that we deal with here.\n  We are trying to do what we often do in this body, and that is finely \ntailor a remedy for something that doesn't affect many people. It \ndoesn't affect many people at all. But with regard to those who are \naffected, it is important for those folks who on average are making \n$30,000 a year. It is something we have been trying to work out for 10 \nyears. We have not been able to. I would rather not have to come to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate and resolve this matter this way, either. \nAfter trying all other avenues, we were left with no choice.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and extend my good wishes and \nrespect to the senior Senator from the Commonwealth of Kentucky who has \nfought so long and hard for his State. I never look forward to having \nto come to the floor and take him on in any circumstance, especially \nwhen he is defending or representing and taking the side of the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky, because I know his heart and soul is in it. I \nrespectfully disagree with him on this. I think it is the right thing \nto do. I think it is fair to these employees, and I urge its adoption. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's flattery, but in \nthis case, it won't get him anywhere.\n  Let me correct one thing, if I can. The Senator said we were exempt \nfrom sales tax. That is not true. We checked this morning. You pay tax \nat restaurants, dry cleaners--all that--you pay the sales tax on the \nbase. On the base, you pay it. We called down there this morning. Now, \nif you want to call again, that is fine. I know where it is. I have \nbeen there. They have trooped out the troops for me. They jumped with \nparachutes and all that. It is obvious my name won't be on any building\n\n[[Page S11225]]\n\ndown there, however, but that is all right. I don't really worry about \nthat.\n  What I worry about is what is being done here and the precedent that \nis being set. They talk about they are all similar. The two other \nlocations are dams. They are dams. They go across a river. They connect \nthe States. That is a very small area. This is 105,000 acres that we \nare talking about here. This is a different facility, different \nsituation, different problem altogether. One is a hydro; the other one \nis a dam. I say to my friend, in those two cases he is defending here, \nit is limited to Federal employees. In the Tennessee-Kentucky problem, \nit is not. You did not limit it to Federal employees. You went to \nprivate sector contractors and their employees. That is the reason the \n$4 million is there and there is no unfunded mandate help for my State.\n  It is quite different. This is as broad as broad can be, with a \ncapital B. It is not only Federal employees. The others are very \nsmall--35 employees. They are hydroelectric and dams, both of them. \nThis is 105,000 acres.\n  We pay sales tax, as Kentucky residents, on the base. You exempt \nprivate contractors and their employees, and it costs us plenty. People \nwill say, ``Ford, this is fair.'' Fair to whom? I can bring the \ndocument--I don't have it here with me--but tuition was part of the \nnegotiations. I wouldn't negotiate either if it was going to be settled \nhere and you know what is going to happen. But the rights of the \nminority should be protected. I can't change the vote. Mine is the only \none that I can handle, that I can guarantee, but we ought to be \nprotected.\n  I have seen a lot of debate here in a little over 24 years. The \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina has seen a lot more. But most \nof the time, almost without exception, both sides have wanted to \nprotect the minority, and here there is no protection.\n  Mr. President, as we are being stampeded here, I think it is highly \nunfair, it is uncalled for, and this is very one-sided. We pay the \nunemployment, reimburse Tennessee, we help with electricity, we help \nwith roads--we do all those things. You act like we don't do anything. \nBut if you have unemployment benefits and Kentucky pays a Tennessee \nresident and reimburses the State--Kentucky doesn't do anything.\n  It is very difficult for me to understand when they start talking \nabout precedents set here. That is for active duty military. They pay \nthe tax, if any, in the State in which they are a resident. The Senator \nbrought up Amtrak employees. You can get on a train in New York and \nwind up in California. Do you pay in each one of the States you go \nthrough? Of course not. That is just common sense.\n  You can have a construction worker who is building interstate \nhighways and can go through several States. You wouldn't expect him to \npay tax in every State. So common sense says pay the tax in the State \nin which he is a resident.\n  Here it is different. If you are a resident of Tennessee and work in \nKentucky, you don't pay any tax. If you are a private sector employee \nand you are at a Federal facility, you don't pay any tax. The Tennessee \ncontractor who would offer a bid at Fort Campbell has a sweetheart deal \nbecause a Kentucky contractor, or any other contractor, will have to \npay the taxes, but Tennessee will not.\n  Big Brother says we are going to settle State taxes, not Federal \ntaxes, State taxes, and put it on the defense authorization bill. It \nhas never been to the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction. And \nthe testimony that was received in the House was something that I think \nwe should go back to.\n\n  The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on October \n24th of last year. The House held a hearing on April 17th of last year. \nTo my knowledge, the Senate Armed Services Committee held no hearings \non this issue in either session of this Congress. The reason is \nobvious: because the Armed Services Committee had absolutely no \njurisdiction over this issue--none.\n  The conferees on the defense authorization bill, in my judgment, have \nno business attaching language which preempts State tax as part of the \ndefense authorization bill.\n  Let's go back to the House hearing of last April. What kind of \ntestimony did that committee hear? It heard that Kentucky's tax \nstructure met all appropriate constitutional standards for fairness and \nnondiscrimination. That is the testimony. That committee was told that \nthe ability of States to define their own tax structures within the \nbounds of the Constitution was ``one of the core elements of \nsovereignty preserved to the States under the Constitution.'' It may be \nconstitutional, but it is ``one of the core elements of sovereignty \npreserved to the States under the Constitution.''\n  The committee was told that if Congress jumps in and preempts State \nlaws in this case, ``it will by definition create a preferred class of \ntaxpayer * * *. Currently all workers--public and private--in Kentucky \n* * * are subject to the same rules. This should not be disrupted by \nthe Congress without a strong policy [mandate].''\n  The House committee was also told that the proposal to grant special \nstatus to Tennessee residents violated the spirit of the Unfunded \nMandates Act of 1995. The committee was told, ``if Congress feels that \nthe impact of federal workers employed on installations crossing the \nborders of two states * * * should be offset, it should provide the \nfunding necessary to offset the costs imposed on the states affected \nand not just preempt legitimate taxing authority.'' That is the \ntestimony. That is what the committee was told.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee I believe \nheard similar testimony during the hearing last August. The Senate \nArmed Services Committee, however, heard no testimony--the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, however, heard no such testimony--because it held \nno such hearing and had no such jurisdiction over this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Nonetheless, without any floor debate, a provision was snuck into the \nHouse version of the defense authorization. So I ask where my Kentucky \ncolleagues were.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. FORD. Glad to.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nfloor manager, Senator Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. I ask the Chair, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 38 seconds.\n  Mr. FORD. Well, I understand why the Senator from Tennessee does not \nwant to debate this; because he is wrong. I like him. He is a nice \nfellow, friendly. Oh, you could not ask anybody to be any friendlier \nthan the Senator from Tennessee. And I have always enjoyed his acting. \nIn fact, I have seen some reruns. I have enjoyed watching those a \nsecond and third time. I look for him. But that does not mean he is \nwrong or right all the time. But in this case he is wrong.\n\n  And I wish this would not happen because, I say to my colleagues, \nwhen we start telling the States how to tax, when we take that \nauthority away from the States, then we have gone a long way in \ndisrupting what the Founding Fathers said this country should be made \nup of.\n  So I will not leave this Senate without having made this statement. I \nunderstand where the votes are. I understand what is going to happen to \nthis bill. But at some point, I believe, sincerely, that it will be in \ncourt. And the constitutionality of this and the preemption of States' \nability--not a Federal tax but a State tax--they give a preferred class \nof taxpayer here. You have two people sitting across the table, having \nlunch, and both are working for the same company; both do the same job; \nboth make the same money; but the fellow from Tennessee pays no tax; \nthe fellow from Kentucky pays it on a military installation.\n  There are 240 of these, at least, out there. And as I said, \nMississippi is going to be one of the most vulnerable States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Levin for \nhis use, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields the time?\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and it be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S11226]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year 1999 Strom \nThurmond defense authorization conference report. I congratulate the \nmanagers of this bill for their exemplary work. In particular, I would \nlike to express my most sincere gratitude and appreciation to Chairman \nThurmond for his service to the Senate and for his service to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I know that this was one of the most contentious \nconferences in the past decade, particularly because of the U.S. \nsatellite licensing provisions. However, I am pleased that this \nconference report contains a provision shifting the jurisdiction for \nU.S. satellite licensing from the Commerce Department back to the State \nDepartment, where I believe the national security of this country can \nbest be protected. This action is a step away from the controversial \npolicy that President Clinton established in 1996 and it is a step \ntoward enhanced national security. I hope the President, in signing \nthis bill, will walk forward with us.\n  In addition, I am very pleased by the addition of several China-\nrelated provisions that I spoke in behalf of--sponsored some of those--\nthat I believe will limit the role of the oppressive Chinese regime and \nUnited States complicity in their actions.\n  In particular, this conference report includes a provision requiring \nthe Departments of Defense and Justice, FBI, and the CIA to compile a \nlist of known PLA commercial fronts operating in the United States. \nThis provision also authorizes the President to monitor, to restrict, \nand to seize, if necessary, the assets of, and ban the operation of, \nsuch PLA companies within these United States.\n  Furthermore, the Senate adopted and included in the conference report \na provision authorizing funding for additional customs agents to \nenforce the existing ban on slave labor products, an ongoing problem. \nThese products are produced in slave-labor conditions in China and are \nsold to American consumers, unbeknownst to the consumer. These sections \ncall upon the President to strengthen international agreements to \nimprove monitoring of slave-labor imports.\n  There is yet a further provision that I am heartened the conference \nhas included regarding Radio Free Asia. This provision would fund 24-\nhour-a-day Radio Free Asia broadcasts throughout China in each of the \nmajor dialects. This provision will allow the Voice of Freedom to \npenetrate through the oppressive veil now muting the Chinese people.\n  I want to make one final observation. Last week, in declaring the \nsuccess of his country in combating the floods raging throughout China, \nPresident Jiang Zemin compared that success to the success of stemming \nthe tide of democracy and praising their crackdown at Tiananmen Square. \nI think I need say little more, Mr. President, as to the ongoing \nproblems of an oppressive regime in China. I applaud the chairman and \nthe conference for including these very important provisions in the \nconference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Indiana, Mr. Coats.\n  Again, I want to say, since the Senator is leaving this year, he has \nbeen one of the ablest men on the Armed Services Committee. The Armed \nServices Committee and the Senate will greatly miss this individual. \nAgain, I commend him and wish him well in all of his undertakings.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his kind words. I \nwant to return that compliment, because it has been a distinct \nprivilege and pleasure for me to serve under the able leadership of our \nchairman, Senator Thurmond. Senator Thurmond is, perhaps, not one of \nbut perhaps the most remarkable individual I have ever known, someone \nwho has committed a lifetime and more of political service to his \nfellow man and to his Nation, and who has served as a Rock of Gibraltar \nin support of a strong national defense. Serving on the committee with \nhis leadership has been a great privilege for me, as well as it has \nbeen with all my colleagues who serve on the Armed Services Committee.\n  This committee of the Congress is the least partisan of all the \ncongressional committees. We put the national defense and national \nsecurity above partisanship. We work together in a team fashion. While \nwe don't always agree across the aisle on every issue, we do find \nconsensus. Our purpose is to protect and support our men and women in \nuniform, and protect the citizens of the United States by giving them \nthe very best defense that we can purchase for their investment of tax \ndollars.\n  This particular bill is to be commended in many ways. It addresses \nsome of the quality of life and readiness and modernization issues that \nwe have been struggling with. As chairman of the Airland Committee, I \nhave had the privilege of overseeing a very considerable amount of \nspending that goes into modernizing our forces. We haven't been able to \ndo everything that has been asked, but we certainly have taken \nimportant steps in trying to make sure that our defense forces are \ncapable of meeting the threat and are unparalleled in terms of their \nsuperiority.\n  As a member of the Personnel Subcommittee, as former chairman of that \ncommittee, I am pleased that we have continued to address some of the \nimportant issues of pay and housing that are necessary to maintaining \nthe spirit and moral of the people in our force. But, we have a great \ndeal more to do in this area.\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff testified just a couple of days ago about \nthe state of readiness for today and tomorrow. Readiness is a function \nof quality of life, of training, and of adequate infrastructure. Two of \nthese three areas--the infrastructure, the housing, the equipment, the \nfacilities, the tools which we provide our service members with, and \nthe quality of life--are strained and in many cases inadequate. The pay \nis too low and military benefits are in question. We are losing good \npeople, too many good people. A great deal needs to be done in this \narea.\n  A great deal also needs to be done on the whole infrastructure front, \nnot only in providing necessary facilities, but in terminating that \ninfrastructure which is no longer needed. Too often we have perpetuated \nthat infrastructure that is no longer required, and done so at great \nexpense.\n  I have also been engaged in the whole question of defense \ntransformation. How can we transform our national defense from a cold-\nwar effort that has been unparalleled in the history of national \ndefense--not only this country, but in this world. How can we transform \nthat into a national security apparatus our defense structure to \naddresses the threats of the future, which will be different from the \nthreats of the past. That is a monumental undertaking. I have suggested \na number of ways in which this could be done. I have joined with my \ncolleagues on the committee, particularly Senator Lieberman, to define \na process by which we can make those decisions, utilizing both inside \nand outside experts.\n  We have attempted, through this process, to ask the necessary \nquestions and to make the necessary decisions about how we move \nforward. In that regard, in the future some very difficult but \nnecessary decisions and tough choices are going to have to be made \nabout how we spend our limited defense resources.\n  While we all acknowledge and hopefully will provide some additional \nfunds to address the readiness concerns addressed by the Joint Chiefs, \nwe are a long way from successfully allocating the resources we have \navailable to us in the very best way that will give us the national \nsecurity apparatus we need to address future threats. Tough decisions \nhave to be made because we have the tendency to continue to fund \nsystems that we already have in the force. Decisions are often made, \nboth in the Pentagon and in the Congress, about maintaining what I call \n``legacy'' systems--systems that have had a long shelf life, that are \nvery near and dear to our heart, produced in our district, or systems \nwe have related to over the\n\n[[Page S11227]]\n\nyears. There is a great tendency to perpetuate these legacy systems and \nnot give sufficient resources and weight to the new systems that are \nnecessary to address the new threats of the future.\n  My challenge to the Congress, and my challenge to the Department of \nDefense, is to step up and make the unpopular choices, make the very \ndifficult choices to divest legacy systems and structures which are no \nlonger required, or whose value will depreciate quickly in the future, \nso that we can free up the resources that we must to address the \nquestion of providing the right national security apparatus that \nembraces the potential for a revolution in military affairs and \naddresses the threats of the future.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman, Senator Thurmond, and the \nranking member, Senator Levin, for their leadership of a truly \nbipartison effort which achieves an effective balance across the \nquality of life of our servicemembers and their families, the readiness \nof the force, and the modernization of our systems as we enter the 21st \ncentury.\n  This accomplishment is of particular note because this defense bill \nadheres to the budget agreement of approximately $270 billion, a 1.1 \npercent decline in real terms over last year's defense budget, and it \nis approximately 35 percent below the cold war heights.\n  This defense authorization includes numerous provisions that will \nenhance military quality of life. It includes a 3.6 percent pay raise \nfor military personnel. It also provides an increase of $660 million in \nmilitary construction projects, over $250 million of which will fund \nbarracks, dining facilities, and military housing. And this bill \ndirects three health care demonstrations for our military retirees who \nare Medicare eligible.\n  This bill also adds over $800 million to the key readiness accounts \nof our active and reserve forces. We are all aware of the stress that \ncurrent operations such as those in Bosnia or the Persian Gulf have on \nmilitary readiness. The funds we have added will support infrastructure \nmaintenance, training, and the availability of parts and supplies to \nsustain readiness levels.\n  Despite the gains we have made in areas of quality of life and \nreadiness, we are still well short of the $60 billion procurement goal \nstated by Secretary of Defense Cohen and his predecessor Secretary \nPerry which was to have been achieved in fiscal year 1998.\n  Here we are again proposing a procurement level for fiscal year 1999 \nthat is below $50 billion. Correspondingly, service modernization \naccounts remain on the margin--well short of the level required to \nrecapitalize our joint capabilities for the 21st century.\n  And now I would like to comment on several modernization issues from \nmy perspective as chairman of the Airland Subcommittee.\n  The Army is moving to consolidate the gains from the Force XXI \nprocess and to investigate smaller, faster, more lethal, and more \ndeployable forces. But the Army's modernization strategy to pursue this \ntransformation is lacking in areas of aviation, armored vehicles, and \ntrucks, and we have provisions addressing these issues.\n  And I must say that we have made progress in addressing reserve \ncomponent modernization thanks to the fine work of Senator Glenn, the \nranking member of the Airland Subcommittee, to structure a coherent \nprocess for the consideration of Guard procurement. First, the budget \nrequest included nearly $1.4 billion in procurement for the guard and \nreserves--about a 50 percent increase over last year. And this bill \nprovides another several hundred million. Clearly, the Senate's \nbipartisan efforts are having a positive affect on total force \nintegration.\n  This bill also supports TACAIR modernization programs of the services \nand we have taken additional prudent steps to ensure these programs \nstay on track.\n  Last year, I spoke at length about my concerns with F-22 cost \noverruns and demonstrated performance. And I must acknowledge that I \nhave these concerns as a supporter of F-22 development. But based on \nthe testimony of the Air Force and the assessment of the General \nAccounting Office, there are many who share a deep concern over whether \nwe can maintain support for the F-22, whose costs are approaching $200 \nmillion per aircraft, if the program does not adequately demonstrate \nperformance and cost control.\n  This bill takes a very important further step to put key oversight \nprovisions in place that fence the contract award for advance \nprocurement of lot II F-22 until:\n  10 percent of testing is complete (the minimum specified by the \nDefense Science Board); or, the Secretary of Defense certifies that a \nlesser amount of flight testing is sufficient, and provides his \nrationale and analysis for that certification; however, the funds are \nfenced until the F-22 flies at least 4 percent of flight tests--the \namount now planned prior to contract award--have been completed.\n  This provision holds the Department to its own plan at a minimum and \nplaces the emphasis squarely on the demonstrated performance of the F-\n22 program. No performance, no money.\n  This bill also contains a provision on a new joint experimentation \ninitiative that is fundamental to defense transformation.\n  The Congress has been keenly aware of the need to transform our \nmilitary capabilities to address the potentially very different \noperational challenges of the future. The National Defense Panel Report \nargues that these challenges--which include among other things, \nasymmetric challenges in power projection, information operations, and \nweapons of mass destruction--may place this Nation's security at far \ngreater risk than we face today.\n  This provision includes a sense of Congress on the designation of a \ncombatant commander with the mission for developing, preparing, \nconducting, and assessing a process of joint warfighting \nexperimentation. Secretary Cohen has signed a charter assigning this \nmission to USACOM in Norfolk. And the provision lays out a set of \nreporting requirements from this CINC to keep Congress informed of the \nstatus of transformation.\n  The process of joint experimentation is designed to investigate the \nco-evolution of advances in technology, with changes in the \norganizational structure of our forces, and the development of new \noperational concepts. Accordingly, the purpose of joint experimentation \nis to find those technologies, organizations, and concepts which \nprovide true leap-aheads in joint warfighting capabilities.\n  And just as important, it is the purpose of joint experimentation to \nidentify those technologies and concepts which are failures. Some will \nconsider the cost of these failures as wasteful. But quite the \ncontrary. The true failure would be continuing to invest in systems \nbefore we really know what will or will not work on the battlefields of \nthe 21st century. And given the level of defense budgets, we cannot \nafford to invest in systems which fail to contribute markedly to our \nfuture warfighting capabilities.\n  Previously in our history we have found ourselves unprepared for \nthreats we faced at the outset of war. Our Nation rallied to eventually \novercome these threats, but at a cost--not only in fiscal terms, but in \nlives.\n  In the very near future, technology will enable a different range of \nthreats we must be prepared for. The process of joint experimentation \nsupported in this bill will be central to ensuring our Armed Forces are \nprepared to successfully meet the national security challenges of the \n21st century.\n  This bill makes great strides in improving the quality of life, \nreadiness, and modernization of the force; and in laying the framework \nfor the transformation of defense capabilities for the 21st century.\n  Yet there is much more work that needs to be done. The Joint Chiefs \ntestified on Tuesday that defense budgets are not adequate to sustain \ncurrent readiness and to keep our defense forces on firm footing for \nthe future.\n  But defense budgets will likely not increase to the levels requested \nand this will leave the Pentagon, the administration, and the Congress \nwith some tough decisions which must be made. And we need to know what \nthese decisions are and when they need to be made. I proposed that \nanother quadrennial defense review and national defense panel be \nestablished in the year 2000 to conduct another comprehensive \nassessment of defense strategy, policy, and programs. I trust that the \ndefense committees will work to include those provisions in next year's \nbill.\n\n[[Page S11228]]\n\n  I would like to thank and acknowledge the distinguished service of \nthe chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond \nand the distinguished ranking member of the Airland Subcommittee, \nSenator Glenn for their tremendous stewardship of defense issues in \nthis Defense authorization bill.\n  We often ask ourselves: ``Where have the heroes gone?''. Well I know \nwhere two of them have been, and that is working side-by-side with many \nof us deliberating defense issues. I commend them for their service and \nwish them the best in all future endeavors. In closing, this bill has \nmy full support, and I strongly encourage all Members to support it.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, again, I wish to thank the Senator for \nhis good work on the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the conference report on the \nFiscal Year 1999 Defense authorization bill. The House and Senate \nconferees have produced a worthwhile defense bill that deserves to be \napproved.\n  Before the conference, the House version contained several provisions \nthat the administration had threatened to veto. We worked effectively \nin our deliberations with the House to resolve these differences and \nfind satisfactory solutions.\n  Gender integration in basic military training is the first of these \nimportant issues. In the Fiscal Year 1998 Defense Authorization Act, \nCongress established a bipartisan panel to review gender integration in \nbasic military training. That commission has started its work and will \nreport to us next year. The conference compromise on this issue will \nenable the commission to finish its work, while requiring each of the \nservices to provide separate, safe and secure housing for male and \nfemale recruits with the sleeping areas separated by permanent barriers \nand limited access.\n  The second of these issues is production of tritium for the nation's \nstrategic arsenal. The Secretary of Energy has already initiated a \ncomprehensive analysis to determine the best way to produce this \nmaterial. That study will be concluded by December 31, 1998. The \nconference report includes a provision to withhold funds for the \nimplementation of the Secretary of Energy's recommendation until full \nand complete congressional review next year.\n  The conference report provides needed support for our military forces \nwhile maintaining a realistic balance between readiness to take care of \nimmediate needs, and investment in new systems for the future. The \nreport also includes a fully funded and well-deserved 3.6 percent pay \nraise for military personnel.\n  We also tried to deal with the important and complex issue of \nmilitary retiree health care. The report includes a provision for the \nDepartment of Defense to initiate a comprehensive test plan to evaluate \nthe best method to provide health care to retired military personnel \nand their families. The Department of Defense will establish two \ndemonstration plans, which will be evaluated before any future \nimplementation. The first plan will allow selected retirees to enroll \nin the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. The second plan will \nimplement a redesigned pharmacy benefit for Medicare-eligible DOD \nbeneficiaries at two sites. This plan will also provide needed \ninformation for reducing out-of-pocket costs for military retirees.\n  Protecting the safety of our service men and women was also high on \nour priorities in the conference. The daily operations of our military \nforces have obvious risks and dangers. All branches of the Armed Forces \nhave made progress in improving safety, but more remains to be done. I \ncommend the Department of Defense for its accelerated installation of \nneeded additional safety systems on military aircraft that carry \npassengers. The conference report includes additional funding for \naircraft safety modifications.\n  Our troops are at risk from high tech attacks as well. The growing \nfrequency and sophistication of such attacks on the Pentagon's computer \nnetworks demonstrate the need for improved protection of critical \nnetworks. The conference report recognizes the importance of this \neffort and supports the Air Force cyber-security program.\n  In the past 8 years, the Navy-Marine Corps team has responded to over \n90 contingencies--almost one per month. As the ranking Democrat on the \nSeapower Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, I am pleased \nthat the conference report provides the support necessary for our naval \nforces as they modernize to meet the challenges of tomorrow.\n  The report includes the necessary advance procurement funding for \nfiscal year 1999 for the Navy's next aircraft carrier, CVN-77. The \nNavy's procurement schedule for this carrier, revised from its budget \nsubmission of last year, will be under the cost cap mandated in last \nyear's Defense Authorization Act. Also, much of the new technology \nbeing developed for the next generation aircraft carrier, the CVX, will \nbe included in CVN-77.\n  The budget request for the 30 Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters is \nincluded in the report. The Super Hornet combines the outstanding \ncharacteristics of earlier F/A-18 models with cutting edge technology \nin an affordable aircraft with significantly improved performance and \nendurance.\n  In addition, the Marine Corps' MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft \nprocurement for next year was increased to eight. The Osprey is a \nvertical take-off and landing aircraft designed to replace the Marine \nCorps' aging fleet of CH-46 and CH-53 helicopters.\n  The constructive compromises we reached during the conference on \ncritical issues have produced a comprehensive bill which provides \neffectively for our national security, and which contains no provisions \nthat would draw a veto.\n  I also join in commending the distinguished leadership of the \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond. He \nhas worked effectively with all of us to see that our national security \nand the needs of our service men and women are met in this legislation. \nIt has been a privilege to work with Senator Thurmond as chairman, and \nI look forward to continuing our work together on this important \nissues. It is especially fitting that this bill is named in his honor.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Strong Thurmond National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today as we consider the fiscal year \n1999 Defense authorization conference to draw the Senate's attention to \nwhat appears to be a brewing controversy over the state of our \nmilitary's readiness. Yesterday, the Committee on Armed Services held a \nhearing with Joint Chiefs to discuss some readiness issues that \nrecently have been brought to the committee's attention. I believe \nthere are very legitimate concerns regarding recruiting and retention \ntrends, increased Personnel Tempo, as well as pay and benefits \ncomparability, spare parts availability, and growing depot and real \nproperty maintenance issues to be examined.\n  I agree that we must pay very close attention to these issues because \nwe are asking our men and women in uniform to do more today than we \never have during peacetime. We are asking them to do more, not so much \nwith ``less,'' but with fewer and fewer people and that is placing a \nstrain on our military. I believe we must proceed very, very carefully \nbefore any further reductions are considered.\n  I am concerned that our problem may be more basic than these issues I \nhave just mentioned. I have come to this Senate floor many times over \nthe years and have spoken repeatedly in the Armed Services Committee to \nvoice my concerns over the drawdown in our end strength. In my view, I \ndon't believe we should have gone below 1.6 million in our active duty \nend strength.\n  I am concerned that with fewer than 1.6 million in end strength our \nmilitary strategy becomes a bit of a myth, Mr. President. I don't think \nwe can fight two contingencies today with an end strength of 1.4 \nmillion. I'm not confident we could repeat Desert Storm and embark on a \nsecond contingency if something broke out in Korea.\n  1.6 million is not a number I pulled from thin air. Rather, it is \nbased on a time-proven formula that requires a force that basically is \ndivided in three. One third of the force is forward deployed and \nfighting, one third of the force is training for deployment or in \ntransit and one third of the force is maintaining the other two-\nthirds--\n\n[[Page S11229]]\n\nmanning the Pentagon, plowing the runways, etc.\n  In the Persian Gulf, we had about 575,000 Americans deployed. That's \none major regional contingency or one major theater war (MTW) as we are \nnow calling them. To repeat Operation Desert Storm, we need an end \nstrength of at least 1.6 million. Today, we appear to be falling below \nthe manning levels necessary to conduct our peacetime operations let \nalone credibly maintain a combat force capable of carrying out two \nnearly simultaneous major operations.\n  Mr. President, let me add at this point that I believe those \ncommitments are important. We have alliance deployments in Japan, \nKorea, and Europe. We are conducting peacekeeping operations on the \nKuwait border and in the Western Sahara. Our so-called ``Operations \nOther Than War'' also require American service members to be deployed \nto the Sinai, to Bosnia, to the Persian Gulf in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia \nand on the border between Peru and Ecuador. We've had deployments to \nRwanda, Angola, Somalia, Haiti and Cambodia to name a few other \noperations that have all contributed to the services' high OPTEMPO and \nPERSTEMPO. I support these operations.\n  We literally have saved millions of lives through our presence in \ntroubled areas of the world and I believe that that is an appropriate \nuse of our military forces. The cold war may be over but the killing \nhas not stopped. The United States has no territorial ambitions but we \ndo need to remain engaged. The constant demands on our personnel around \nthe world, however, are not without consequence. We are asking the men \nand women in our military services to be deployed for longer periods \nand more often than we have in the past. They have served well through \na difficult and turbulent period.\n  I understand, and I hope my colleagues understand, the rationale for \ncontinued reductions in our end strength. End strength cuts are being \nmade in order to generate cash to pay for modernization programs. I \nagree that our service members deserve the best and most modern \nequipment available but I do not agree that reductions should be made \nsimply to generate cash. Even if modernization programs can reduce \nmanpower requirements in the long term, in the near term, we still need \npeople to carry out our important worldwide commitments. The time has \ncome to step back and consider how we are going to achieve our goals. \nWe may need more funding for modernization. In my view, we also need \nfunding for more people.\n  We also need to impose more discipline before simply raising the \ntopline. We should have given the Department base closure authority so \nwe could get unneeded bases off the books. And we should impose more \ndiscipline on ourselves. This year we added about $2 billion in items \nthat the Services didn't request in the procurement and research and \ndevelopment accounts. We added over $600 million in military \nconstruction add-ons. It is only in the past few years that the \nCongress has agreed that when adding military construction projects, \nthose projects should at least be projects that the Defense Department \nwants. Even meeting that criteria, I am not sure that annually adding \nhundreds of millions of dollars for military construction projects just \nto ``bring home the bacon'' is necessarily the best approach to \nestablishing and funding national security priorities.\n  I am supporting this conference report because on balance I believe \nit is a good conference report but I do believe that the Congress needs \nto focus more carefully on true spending priorities particularly as we \nare learning that there may be some readiness funding problems.\n\n\n           HELPING OUR MILITARY AND SUPPORTING OUR DIPLOMACY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the Strom Thurmond National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. Naming this bill after \nmy good friend Strom Thurmond is a fitting tribute to one of the \nSenate's greatest defenders of America's military interests. I urge \neveryone to take a minute to read Section 1, which highlights Senator \nThurmond's distinguished record of service and leadership.\n  As always, finding the right compromises to protect our national \nsecurity while still living within our budget caps has been hard. \nRecent events in Iraq and Kosovo, and the attack on our embassies in \nTanzania and Kenya are stark reminders of why our diplomatic efforts \nmust be supported by a robust military.\n  I compliment the Committee on Armed Services, under the leadership of \nChairman Thurmond and Senator Levin, for its dedicated effort to \naddress some of our nation's critical national security needs. While I \ndo not agree with everything in the conference report, on balance I \nbelieve this bill does a great deal of good.\n  On the personnel front, I know that all of us are pleased with the \n3.6 percent pay raise. We know that our patriotic men and women in \nuniform do not serve in order to make money, but that doesn't change \nthe needs of their families and themselves for adequate recompense. \nThis is a solid step in the right direction.\n  Along the same lines, I thank the conferees for joining me in \nsupporting an increase in hazardous duty incentive pay for mid- and \nsenior level enlisted aircrew personnel. This necessary increase \nreflects our commitment to the experienced aircrew personnel without \nwhom our planes could not fly vital missions in Bosnia and Iraq.\n  I was also pleased to see that this bill recognized the increasingly \nvital role of our Guard and Reserve personnel in the new Total Force. \nAs that old Oldsmobile commercial said, ``this is not your father's'' \nmilitary. Guard and Reserve personnel are absolutely vital to meeting \nAmerica's leadership commitments around the world, to protecting \ncommunities here at home, and to defending national security. Among \nother things, this bill authorizes the payment of selective \nreenlistment bonuses, increased funding for Guard and Reserve training, \nthe restoration of up to 800 military technicians (dual-status), and \nfunds for the Guard's Youth ChalleNGe program and STARBASE program.\n  The conference report continues Congress's effort to address the \nstrains on our ability to provide high quality health care to our \nmilitary retirees. Both houses of Congress are agreed that more work \nneeds to be done in this area and the demonstration projects included \nin this year's bill are part of that process.\n  In looking at some of the provisions in this bill that address \nforeign relations issues, I am less sanguine. As I said when the Senate \ndealt with this bill, I do not support the Sense of Congress provision \nthat endorses NATO missions with ground forces that would not include \nany American troops. This is a dangerous precedent that encourages the \nerosion of American leadership in NATO.\n  This bill also addressed satellite transfers. While we do not want to \nhandicap America's satellite manufacturers and telecommunications \nfirms, the most important consideration must always be to safeguard \nnational security. The changes made in the licensing system appear to \nmake sense, despite their being adopted on the basis of a very \nincomplete analysis of a complex issue. Transferring licensing \nauthority back to the State Department--the same agency that licensed \nthe controversial Loral satellite launch in February 1996--may help, so \nlong as the State Department is given the resources to do the job \nright. This conference report permits the Department of State to keep \nall the fees it collects for registration by the Office of Defense \nTrade Controls--the office which administers licenses for military \nexports--a sensible approach that is also contained in the Department \nof State authorization bill. Now the Commerce, Justice, State \nappropriations conference must adopt a similar provision; otherwise we \nwill be giving the State Department an unfunded mandate that it will be \nunable to fulfill. We run the risk of exacerbating the problem of \nperpetually under funding of our foreign policy tools.\n  One provision addressing foreign policy that I was very pleased to \nsee retained is the amendment that I authored calling for a report on \nthe peaceful employment of former Soviet experts on weapons of mass \ndestruction. The slightly revised provision is now found at section \n1309. Section 1309 requires detailed reporting on the\n\n[[Page S11230]]\n\nformer Soviet experts who are at risk of recruitment by a rogue state \nor terrorist group. I am confident that this language will not require \nthe Department of Defense to produce an impossibly detailed analysis. I \nam pleased to note that the revised provision will permit the Secretary \nof Defense to inform Congress of ways to increase the number of former \nSoviet arms experts whom we assist in their transitions into new \noccupations. That is a vital national security objective, and it will \nbecome even more vital in the coming years as Russia's nuclear \nestablishment is substantially downsized and more of their nuclear \nweapons experts are left to find new ways to earn a living.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the Strom Thurmond National Defense \nAuthorization Act is a comprehensive bill that addresses many of our \nmilitary needs. As I have said, there are some provisions that concern \nme. But, overall, I believe this bill provides some of the bricks that \nmake up the foundation of our national security policy. It takes \nimportant steps to improve the quality of life for our most critical \nnational security asset--our military personnel. My overall concern \ncontinues to be that it should not take terrorist attacks to realize \nthat spending more on our first line of defense--our foreign policy--is \nan equally vital part of our national security policy.\n\n\n                               sec. 1512\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, the Chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, after whom this defense authorization bill is \nnamed.\n  Section 1512 of this bill requires the President to certify to \nCongress 15 days prior to any export to the People's Republic of China \nof missile equipment or technology, as defined in the Annex to the \nMissile Technology Control Regime, that such export is not detrimental \nto the U.S. space launch industry, and that such export will not \nmeasurably improve China's missile or space launch capabilities.\n  The intent of this section is not to prevent the export of commercial \ncommunications satellites to the PRC, consistent with U.S. law and \nnational security and foreign policy interests, nor to harm our \ndomestic satellite industry. The purpose of this section is to ensure \nthat exports of such satellites and related technology to China will \nnot harm U.S. security. As long as sufficient export controls are in \nforce and are being enforced, such exports are consistent with our \nnational security.\n  Furthermore, this certification requirement for exports to China is \nnot intended to prevent the export of commercial technology for \nemergency repair of civilian equipment, such as navigation systems \nrequired for safe flight of passenger aircraft. If a U.S.-made aircraft \nrequires emergency repair or replacement of its navigation system while \nin China, we would not want to delay such required repair unreasonably.\n  I wish to ask the Chairman if he shares this view of Section 1512.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I agree with the view expressed by my \ncolleague, the Ranking Minority Member of the Armed Services Committee. \nHe has stated correctly the views of the Senate and the House in \nagreeing to Section 1512 during the conference on the defense bill.\n  With regard to concerns that the requirement for a 15-day advance \ncertification concerning the export of items listed in the MTCR Annex \nto the PRC would delay the ability to provide spare parts for in-\nservice civilian commercial aircraft in an emergency while in the PRC, \nit is not the intent to delay the export of items for emergency repair \nof in-service civilian commercial aircraft while in the PRC.\n  This view, however, should not be mistaken as a green light to \nstockpile technology and spare parts which are on the MTCR Annex above \nwhat is necessary to provide emergency service for in-service \ncommercial aircraft.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for helping to clarify the intent of this provision.\n\n\n                             C-130 Tragedy\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in November 1996, there was a tragic \naccident off the coast of California that claimed the lives of 10 out \nof 11 airmen, the crew of an Air Force Reserve C-130 aircraft out of \nPortland. All of these crewmen were from my home state of Oregon.\n  This was a devastating loss for all of us, but most of all for the \nfamilies of those airmen who lost their lives. After any tragedy like \nthis, the first question on everyone's minds is ``why?'' Why were my \nloved ones taken from me? This is what the families of these airmen \nwanted to know, but no one would give them a straight answer.\n  After many, many months of frustration, these families came to me and \nmy colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, to get the Air Force to tell \nus exactly what happened.\n  As a result of working with these families, with the Air Force, and \nwith the committee staff, and with Senator Levin in particular, we were \nable to craft some language that is now included in the Defense \nAuthorization Conference Report that we are considering today. This \nlanguage takes a two pronged approach to dealing with the pressing \nissues the families have raised: improving crash investigations, and \neliminating the secrecy in which these investigations are shrouded.\n  Specifically, the language directs the Defense Department to review \nthe way it conducts aviation accident investigations so that they are \nconducted in as thorough and objective a manner as possible, including \nmaking sure crash investigators receive the best training, and ensuring \nthat the military department coordinate and share information on fleet \nsafety. The bill also urges the Pentagon to seek the advice of the \nNational Transportation Safety Board in improving investigation \nprocedures, and I intend to make sure their valuable input is part of \ntheir review.\n  Secrecy has long been the hallmark of these investigations and has \nkept loved ones in the dark about what happened and why. We have worked \nto reduce the secrecy involved in the investigations of tragedies, and \nthis legislation takes a solid step forward in providing families and \nthe public with better information.\n  That's why this language also requires the Department of Defense to \nissue regulations to provide to family members periodic reports on the \nprogress of investigations. I also spoke with Secretary Cohen about \nthis recently, and he has pledged to make a solid effort to make sure \nfamilies are kept informed of the progress of investigations.\n  It's important that we eliminate secrecy from these proceedings. The \nlast thing we should do is add to these terrible tragedies by keeping \nthe families in the dark about the status of these investigations. From \nday to day, from week to week, from month to month, these families had \nto cope with not only the incredible pain of losing a loved one, but \nwith the incredible frustration of not knowing the status of the \ninvestigation into their deaths. This new language seeks to put an end \nto this type of treatment. We owe it to the men and women who give \ntheir lives for their country.\n\n\n                           tritium provision\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, yesterday the Chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Thurmond, along with Senators Warner, Smith, and Kyl \nentered into a colloquy on the tritium provision in the pending \nNational Defense Authorization Act Conference Committee Report.\n  While I was not available to participate in that colloquy, I would \nlike to make a few comments on this subject.\n  First and foremost, the restoration of tritium production is \nabsolutely critical. Without tritium, our entire nuclear deterrent \nwould be left inoperable. Our nuclear warheads cannot function without \nreplacement tritium. And time is wasting.\n  For those who do not know, tritium is a radioactive gas that is an \nessential component of modern nuclear weapons. It decays at a rate of \nfive-and-a-half percent per year, so it has to be continually replaced. \nWe have not produced tritium in this country since 1988, when the \nreactors at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina were shut down. \nSince that time the Department of Energy has examined countless options \nand technologies, but has not yet selected a new source. We cannot \nafford to delay this program. The potential costs of delay are too \ngreat.\n  The Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, had a \ndifficult Defense Authorization conference with the House this year.\n\n[[Page S11231]]\n\nChairman Thurmond and the other members of the Committee negotiated \nover 570 legislative provisions and more than 1,000 funding differences \nwith the House. The final result was a strong bipartisan bill. In fact, \nfor the first time in many years, all the members of the conference, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, signed the final conference report.\n  Tritium was one of the most difficult issues that had to be \naddressed. The House and Senate bills had wildly differing provisions \non this topic. In addition, there was a Presidential veto threat on one \nof the House tritium provisions. Chairman Thurmond, as always, put all \nother interests aside and delivered a compromise that put the national \nsecurity interests of the U.S. ahead of all other interests. I am \nconfident that his provision will keep the tritium program moving \nforward.\n  However, there remain some disagreements as to the best method to \nproduce tritium. It's not my place to comment on that today. I will say \nthat under this conference agreement, Energy Secretary Richardson will \nbe required to select his preferred technology in December of this \nyear. I expect him to meet that requirement.\n  I might also say to Secretary Richardson that the conference report \nrequires him to submit along with the President's fiscal year 2000 \nbudget request, a plan to implement whichever technology he selects in \nDecember. I expect him to identify the funding requirements, schedule, \nand legislation necessary to restore tritium production in time to meet \nDefense Department requirements. In order to be credible, his \nimplementation plan must include adequate funding in fiscal year 2000 \nand beyond.\n  This matter is too important to the national security of the United \nStates to be undermined by deficient budget requests or lack of \nattention on the part of DOE.\n  Furthermore, I put my colleagues on notice that I intend to be fully \nengaged in the debate when this matter comes before the Senate next \nyear. Let me assure all interested parties that I intend to ensure that \nonly one interest will dictate the outcome of that debate--the national \nsecurity interests of the United States. The safety and security of the \nAmerican people require all of us to ensure that there are no further \nunnecessary delays--for any reason.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I'd like to join my colleagues in \nsaluting the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the \ndistinguished Senator Strom Thurmond, whose leadership, together with \nthe ranking member, Senator Levin, has produced the fiscal year 1999 \nDefense authorization bill which is named in the chairman's honor. \nThank you, Mr. Chairman, for your untiring efforts, both for putting \ntogether this bill and for your long and distinguished service to our \nnation. We are a grateful Senate and a grateful nation.\n  Achieving this year's defense bill has been no easy task. Every \ndefense budget represents the outcome of an annual debate concerning \ncompeting national security priorities. Everyone is familiar with the \nlitany of our defense needs: procurement and modernization, quality of \nlife for defense personnel, operations and maintenance, research and \ndevelopment, training, medical care, and so forth. This year is no \ndifferent.\n  Much has been said about the lack of funding for procurement and \nmodernization of military equipment. Certainly, by historical standards \nwe are far below cold war levels. But our defense needs have changed \nand will continue to do so. We need to look carefully at the \ncapabilities and quantities of weapons that we will need in the \nfuture--particularly in areas where technology could provide lower cost \nalternatives of getting the job done.\n  Nevertheless, in this year's conference report the Congress is taking \na step towards meeting those procurement needs. Funding for procurement \nis up from $49.1 billion requested by the President to $49.9 billion \nauthorized by the conference.\n  The conference also took steps to increase funding for quality of \nlife priorities. Funding for military construction and family housing \nwas increased from $7.8 billion to about $8.5 billion.\n  But those increases come at a cost. In balancing priorities while \nremaining within the budget agreement cap, this budget pays the bill by \nreducing funding in other categories. Funding for research and \ndevelopment, operations and maintenance, and Department of Energy \ndefense activities, for example, were funded at lower levels than \nrequested by the Administration.\n  Are those tradeoffs the correct ones from the point of view of our \nnational security? Or are they the outcome of partisan negotiations to \nmeet parochial needs?\n  I remain concerned that the teamwork that's needed between the \nDepartment of Defense, the Administration, and the Congress to produce \na defense budget that meets our real military priorities is flawed. \nWhile the Congress took steps to increase procurement funding, many of \nthose purchases do not reflect the priorities stated by the military \nservices themselves. The cost of those purchases were bought by cuts to \nreadiness accounts that must now be repaired through an emergency \nsupplemental agreed to by the President.\n\n  Similarly, we risk mortgaging our long term security future by \ncutting funding for research and development, particularly for basic \nresearch. I am pleased, however, that this bill includes a provision \nthat sets successively higher goals for research and development \nfunding during the next decade. I am hopeful that implementation of \nthat provision can enable us to avoid having research and development \nremain the billpayer for future defense spending increases.\n  I applaud this bill for its many specific provisions that serve the \nsimultaneous interests of my New Mexico constituents and the nation's \nsecurity.\n  The bill contains $4.3 billion for weapons activities at the \nDepartment of Energy National Labs, approximately half of which will \nsupport work being done at Los Alamos and Sandia.\n  That work will support the stockpile stewardship program that will \nenable us to ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons \nstockpile without building new ones and without testing old ones.\n  I am hopeful that continued funding for the stockpile stewardship \nprogram will enable us to move forward in the Senate with ratification \nof the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty next year.\n  The bill also includes essential funding for the Cooperative Threat \nReduction and the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention programs \nintended to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials \nthrough cooperative efforts with Russian nuclear laboratories and \nscientists. Our laboratories in New Mexico are working closely with \ntheir Russian colleagues to benefit the security of both nations \nagainst the threat of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of \nterrorists or rogue governments.\n  The bill also provides essential funding to remedy the disrepair of \nthe nation's finest weapons testing facility, White Sands Missile \nRange, in southern New Mexico. Without those funds, we won't be able to \nassure the technologies and military capabilities to have the effective \nfighting forces we will need for the nation's future defense.\n  The bill also includes key quality of life improvements for our \nmilitary personnel at Cannon, Kirtland, and Holloman Air Force bases. \nUnits from those bases have served honorably and effectively in Bosnia \nand the Persian Gulf. The personnel and their families assigned to \nthose bases appreciate the support they are given in this year's \ndefense bill.\n  Mr. President, I support this conference report and urge my collegues \nto vote in favor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me commend the senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Thurmond, and Senator Levin for having \ncompleted work on this important conference report on the Strom \nThurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. I \nparticularly want to express my appreciation to Senator Thurmond and \nSenator Warner and their staff for working with me and my staff to \naddress the provision that the House of Representatives had attempted \nto include (section 1216) which would have negatively impacted the \nexport capabilities of U.S. vendors of civilian nuclear power \nequipment. I am pleased to say that the Senate conferees were able to \nreplace the House language regarding nuclear exports with an acceptable \nnotification requirement in Section 1523.\n\n[[Page S11232]]\n\n  Mr. President, as some of my colleagues are aware, the House of \nRepresentatives had added language that would have changed the \nreporting requirements for nuclear exports and added a congressional \ndisapproval process. The change in the export law contemplated by the \nHouse of Representatives was unwise and unnecessary.\n  A change in the reporting requirements was unnecessary because the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission closely regulates the export activities \nof U.S. nuclear vendors. The nuclear export licensing process by law \nrequires not only public notice of export license applications as soon \nas they are received by the N.R.C., but also the opportunity for public \nintervention with the N.R.C. prior to issuance of a license. Moreover, \nthe N.R.C. is not allowed to issue an export license for any nuclear \nequipment and technology unless the government of the recipient nation \nhas negotiated, signed and implemented a bilateral agreement for \nnuclear cooperation with the United States. Such agreements provide the \nUnited States with a broad array of inspection rights and control over \nthe fuel cycle. I am unaware of any allegations that, under this \nregime, the United States has exported any nuclear material or \ntechnology which has been diverted for military or proliferation \npurposes. Since our export control system appears to be working, it is \ndifficult to see why it should be altered or supplemented.\n  A change in the reporting requirements was unwise because it would \nnegatively impact U.S. exporters of civilian nuclear power equipment \nwithout advancing any national security goal. Although the author of \nthe provision made clear that his proposal was designed to add \nrestrictions to trade in civilian nuclear power equipment and \ntechnology with China, it would have impacted many other countries, \nincluding Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and \nTaiwan who purchase U.S. nuclear goods. I am convinced that, faced with \nnew restrictions, all these countries would be extremely reluctant to \ndeal with U.S. suppliers. Certainly, European and Canadian suppliers \nwould use such new restrictions as part of their commercial armory to \nargue that, for these countries, dealing with U.S. suppliers is \ncomplex, time absorbing, and subject to political whims, while their \nprocedures are simple and straightforward.\n  Some members may want to block trade with China in civilian nuclear \ngoods and technology. But, my colleagues should recall that President \nClinton sent to Congress the certifications necessary to implement the \nReagan Administration's 1985 Agreement for U.S.-China Peaceful Nuclear \nCooperation on January 27, 1998. The Congress considered those \ncertifications for 30 legislative days, as provided by law. Existing \nlaw provided the opponents of the certifications with every opportunity \nto challenge the Administration's determination. However, no attempt \nwas made to pass a resolution of disapproval of those certifications, \nand consequently, the 1985 Agreement went into effect on March 19, \n1998. Any changes made after the fact would be seen as aimed at \nimpeding or delaying such cooperation and, as such, could seriously \nundercut the non-proliferation assurances China provided as a condition \nof implementing the nuclear cooperation agreement. Moreover, as a \nmatter of principle, moving the goalposts regarding certification after \nthe fact is unfair.\n  Mr. President, again, I want to thank the managers for their \nassistance on this important matter.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to register my \nopposition to the fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense Authorization \nconference report. Sadly, we continue to spend precious military \nresources on unneeded, unwanted, pork-barrel projects, all at the \nexpense of our military's legitimate needs.\n  Mr. President, our military needs to be lean and mean, not weighed \ndown with unnecessary, unwanted, expensive pork. We don't need to spend \nmore money, we need to spend money more wisely. Our military leaders \nhave begun to recognize this and some of my colleagues in Congress have \nrecognized it. I hope we can work together toward a more wisely funded \nmilitary.\n  I am not alone in my call for more efficient and accountable military \nspending. Lawrence J. Korb, President Reagan's Assistant Secretary of \nDefense, recently issued a rebuke of the state of the Pentagon's \nmilitary spending. He said,\n\n       The problem is not lack of money or aging equipment . . . \n     the Pentagon is buying the wrong weapons. The military \n     behaves as if it is still in an arms race with the Soviet \n     Union, buying $2 billion bombers, $3 billion submarines and \n     $5 billion aircraft carriers . . . Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, \n     North Korea--throw in Libya or whoever else you want--all of \n     them together don't spend as much on the military as we do.\n\n  Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. There is no Cold War. It's \nover. We need to move toward a 21st century military force. This \nconference report fails to adequately modernize our armed forces and \nmove toward that goal.\n  As my friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, has so eloquently stated \nyear after year, it's unconscionable that we spend billions of dollars \non pork-barrel projects that the Pentagon doesn't need and doesn't \nwant.\n  Mr. President, we can't afford to pretend we're still dealing with \nthe Cold War Soviet threat. Military leaders agree that we need \nlighter, faster and more agile forces. This strategy does not include \nwholesale purchase of cumbersome B-2 bombers, new attack submarines, or \nCold War-era heavy tanks.\n  One particular program epitomizes the worst of pork-barrel politics. \nThe C-130 air cargo planes have sapped billions of dollars from vital \nmilitary programs even though our military leaders are incessant in \ntheir pleas to end the harmful practice of forcing the Pentagon to buy \nmore planes than it needs.\n  Mr. President, since 1978, the Congress has added a whopping 263 C-\n130s for which our Department of Defense has not asked. That's right--\nthe taxpayers have paid for 263 C-130s the Pentagon didn't need. If you \nlined them up wing to wing, that would be six and a half miles of \nunwanted airplanes, with the taxpayers on the hook for $22.4 billion. \nThis assault on military planning hamstrings readiness, equipment, and \ncompensation for our soldiers. As we all know, these are the precise \nareas which the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified this week were at \ngreatest risk. Politicians who want to bring home the bacon at \ntaxpayers' expense should not be second-guessing the judgment of our \nmilitary leaders in this way.\n  This conference report follows in the dubious footsteps of its \nancestors by authorizing 7 C-130s, while the Pentagon asked for only \none. Not only does it take from other procurement money, but DoD must \ndivert operations and maintenance money to look after all these \nunneeded planes. This is the height of irresponsibility and \nshortsightedness.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to congratulate my distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley. He held a hearing on Tuesday to \ndiscuss accounting fraud at the Pentagon. His continued efforts to rein \nin obvious and debilitating fraud at the Pentagon need to be applauded. \nPerhaps the Senator's most important finding is summed by his quote, \n``If we put adequate controls on the money we have, there should be no \nneed for more defense spending.''\n  That, Mr. President, sums up my point, as well. We don't need to \nthrow good money after bad with pork-barrel spending in our military \nbudget. What we need to do is spend our money more wisely. That is how \nwe will move toward a lean, efficient, and effective military. This \nconference report does not move toward the new 21st century military \nforce.\n  I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President I rise today to discuss the Defense \nAuthorization bill. I support this bill and believe the Conferees have \nacted appropriately and supported the vital needs of our national \nsecurity. However, I strenuously object to one provision that I believe \nis a grave mistake.\n  Section 1075 of H.R. 3616 inserts language which would have the \neffect of changing the tax structure of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \nMr. President, this is a terrible and misguided assault on the rights \nof Kentucky to levy income tax. I believe this decision sets a \ndangerous precedent and will harm citizens of my state.\n\n[[Page S11233]]\n\n  Fort Campbell is a unique military post which straddles the Kentucky-\nTennessee state lines. As a result, many residents of Tennessee go to \nwork every day across the border in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \nCurrently, those who work on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell are \nsubject to Kentucky's state income tax. Section 1075 takes away \nKentucky's ability to legally enforce its state tax on these employees. \nAs a result, Kentucky will lose millions of dollars a year in revenue. \nI am unable to come up with any justification for the Armed Services \ncommittee to impose its will on the Commonwealth of Kentucky in this \nmanner.\n  Mr. President, for the Armed Services committee to take this action \nastonishes me. This issue should be debated and resolved by the \nimpacted states. By imposing this solution, the Armed Services \ncommittee has effectively foreclosed any opportunity for future \nnegotiations.\n  My colleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford, has made lengthy remarks on \nthis issue, and I agree with much of what he said. However, I do take \noffense at the partisan barbs, as they are unwarranted and \nunproductive. Perhaps the diatribe was cathartic, but cheap shots get \nus no closer to the solution.\n  That said Mr. President, like my colleague from Kentucky, I will vote \nfor final passage of this bill. It contains a number of items that I \nencouraged the committee to adopt, and I thank them for their \nconsideration.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate adopted the \nconference report on H.R. 4103, the Department of Defense \nAppropriations bill. I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss a \nrelatively small part of this budget which has a huge impact on my \nstate.\n  Outside of the City of New Orleans, we have one of the few remaining \nshipyards in the country that still builds ocean-going ships for the \nNavy. Avondale Shipyards is a key employer in the area. With over 5,000 \nworking men and women, it is the largest private employer in the \nregion. Louisiana has a proud maritime tradition, and has a particular \nexpertise in ship building. As a shipyard of tremendous capacity and \ninfrastructure, and the host of the Maritime Excellence Center, \nAvondale has played an important part in the development of this \nindustry.\n  However, Avondale has also maintained a record of labor relations \nwhich Judge Evans of the National Labor Relations Board termed \n``outrageous and pervasive.'' This is not the image of Louisiana's \ngrowing maritime industry that I want projected. I believe that \nLouisiana should be the world leader in shipbuilding, but I also \nbelieve that we cannot attain that status through substandard wages and \nunsafe working conditions. Many manufacturing sectors in our country \nhave been faced with international competition that created difficult \ntimes. The way these industries rebounded was not to turn back the \nclock on progress made in working conditions and wages. Instead, our \nindustrial sector did just the opposite: they grew more hi-tech and \nmore specialized; they invested in their workers, and they invested in \nnew technologies. This is the only route to true success and \nleadership. Louisiana's shipyards will never be able to compete with \ncountries like China and the Phillippines on the basis of wages--the \nkey is to concentrate on American strengths: technology, craftsmanship \nand quality.\n  That is my goal for Avondale. To help them become a world leader, and \ntransition away from practices which threaten that objective. The \nseemingly endless dispute between management and labor at Avondale is a \nhuge impediment to the process. I am ready to work with anyone who in \ngood faith seeks to resolve the problem. In this spirit, I have talked \nto the Navy about Avondale and inquired about the significance of labor \nrelations in Navy contracts. Let me be clear, I did not make these \ninquires to block contracts from being awarded to Avondale. It benefits \nno one to have workers loose their jobs and the state diminish its \nindustrial base in order to make a point. This is especially true when \nwe should have a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision on the union \nelection in the near future.\n  I voted for the Defense Appropriations bill, because I believe in a \nstrong defense. I also voted for the Defense Appropriations bill \nbecause I believe in a strong Avondale. The government provides over \neighty percent of Avondale's contracts. The shipyard cannot function \nwithout them. I have no intention of jeopardizing Avondale's future. My \nsole objective is to facilitate my state's future success in the \nmaritime field. Avondale must be part of that success. This long-\nstanding labor dispute should be resolved at the earliest possible time \nto achieve that end.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer strong support for \nthe Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n1999. As several of my colleagues in the Senate have also recognized, \nwe owe a great deal of gratitude to Senator Thurmond. As a soldier and \nas a Senator, he has fought to defend our country and safeguard our \nnational interest.\n  I thank Senator Thurmond his unceasing commitment and untiring \nservice to this country and its institutions.\n  Mr. President, this legislation contains many positive things for the \nstate of New Mexico--both in the programs funded and the changes made \nto enhance research and development efforts.\n  The most significant contribution made by this legislation to R \nefforts in our state will be realized by eliminating several barriers \nto cooperation between national laboratories and the private sector. \nThe partnerships among our federal laboratories, universities, and \nindustry provide important benefits to our nation.\n  A substantial amount of benefits are attainable in New Mexico, given \nthe unique assets in this state. These partnerships help to create \ninnovative new products and services that drive our economy and improve \nour quality of life.\n  I am pleased that this year's conference ruled favorably on so many \nof the requests for increases that I put forward. Many of these \nincreases will leverage unique assets and capabilities in New Mexico to \nensure that our national interests are protected.\n  The bill authorizes $4.5 billion for Department of Energy defense \nactivities, much of which is done at Sandia National Laboratories and \nLos Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), in addition to DOE's Lawrence \nLivermore facility in California. Approximately $2.5 billion of this \nauthorization will be spent in New Mexico.\n  In addition, the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste \nManagement programs are authorized at $5.44 billion. Of that, \napproximately $415 million will be spent in New Mexico for waste \nmanagement functions, environmental restoration activities, technology \ndevelopment efforts, nuclear materials and facilities stabilization \nfunctions, and a variety of cost-cutting and program support \ninitiatives.\n  Several other important items for defense efforts in New Mexico that \nare authorized in the bill.\n  For example, this year's authorization for the High Energy Laser \nSystem Test Facility (HELSTF) at White Sands Missile Range is $23 \nmillion, including $8 million for solid state laser research. An \nadditional $10 million is authorized for further research in the \nTheater High Energy Laser (THEL), an effort jointly funded and \nsupported by Israel.\n  The Exploratory Development of Advanced Weapons technology at \nKirtland's Air Force Research Laboratory is authorized at $129 million \nfor the coming year.\n  A total of $40.2 million is also authorized to support the Advanced \nRadiation Technology Program at Kirtland's Air Force Research \nLaboratory (AFRL). The lab is using its expertise in laser technologies \nto develop a new deep space imaging system, in addition to a special \ninteractions development program.\n  $24 million is authorized for Space and Missile Rocket Propulsion \nProgram. The Air Force Laboratory at Kirkland is involved in this \nprogram.\n  The Ballistic Missile Technology Program is authorized at $16. This \nfunding was not included in the President's request. Kirkland AFRL and \nWhite Sands Missile Range are involved in this program.\n  $75 million is authorized for the Advanced Spacecraft Technology \nProgram, $32 million more than the budget\n\n[[Page S11234]]\n\nrequest. These funds will advance space plane development, the \nClementine microsatellite program at Kirkland AFRL, and the Satellite \nOrbital Transfer Vehicle which is worked on at the New Mexico \nEngineering and Research Institute.\n  In a related endeavor, a total of $10 million is authorized for the \nScorpius Low-Cost Launch program. This program utilizes assets at New \nMexico Tech in Socorro and will be tested at White Sands in the coming \nmonths.\n  The Airborne Laser Program is authorized at $235 million. The Special \nPrograms Office for this critical Air Force effort in theater missile \ndefense is located at Kirkland, and this program relies heavily on \nbasic research in directed energy and adaptive optics at the AFRL \nthere.\n  The Air Force Operational Test & Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) at \nKirkland is authorized at $29.5 million. This is $5 million more than \nthe President's budget request and will support the Initial Operational \nTest and Evaluation Center's independent operational tests to evaluate \nweapon systems operational effectiveness and suitability.\n  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Flat Panel \nDisplay Program is authorized at $41. This includes an earmark of $7 \nmillion for High Definitions Systems in integrated command and control \ntechnology.\n  The Warfighter Information Network is authorized at $132.1 million \nfor procurement of weapons communications equipment, including the \nEchelon Above Corps (EAC) communications program. This authorization \nlevel includes a $35 million increase to continue modernization of the \nArmy's tactical voice and data communication system. Laguna Industries \nat the Pueblo of Laguna is involved in producing these shelters.\n  $21.9 million is authorized for Ground Penetrating Radar Program & \nLandmine Warfare & Barrier Technology, including a $2 million increase \nfor a ground radar and vehicle mounted mine detector.\n  Also, this legislation authorizes military construction for several \nprojects critical to the viability of New Mexico's military \ninstallations.\n  This bill authorizes $6.8 million for the Nuclear Weapons Integration \nFacility and $1.8 million for the Fire Training Facility, as well as \n$6.4 million to improve family housing at Kirkland.\n  Holloman is authorized $1.3 million for improvements to its War \nReadiness Materials Warehouse and $11.1 million to construct a state-\nof-the-art physical fitness center.\n  $3.6 million is authorized for improvements to family housing at \nWhite Sands Missile Range, and a $3.3 million authorization is included \nto allow New Mexico's National Guard to build the Taos Armory.\n  An additional $8 million is authorized to support the Big Crow \nProgram Office--DoD's only asset for testing high power stand-off \njamming capability in electronic warfare scenarios.\n  These are some of the major programs related to U.S. military \ncapabilities and research and development efforts that reside in the \nstate of New Mexico. I thank Chairman Thurmond and the Senate Armed \nServices Committee for recognizing and supporting the many \ncontributions to our national security needs that are based in New \nMexico.\n  Unfortunately, however, I cannot pretend that the measures contained \nin the legislation will ensure U.S. security. I cannot in good \nconscience purport that this legislation--or any legislation--can solve \nthe current crisis faced by the armed forces.\n  The strength of the U.S. military cannot simply be measured in \nnumbers of soldiers or the state-of-the-art weapons they possess. The \nfortitude of this country's military is not only based on advanced \nweaponry, but rather is also a reflection of the strength of its \nmorale.\n  Mr. President, the morale of our military is under siege. When \nretired colonels are heard commenting that in their half a century of \nhanging around soldiers they have seldom seen the cutting edge of our \nfighting forces so dull, nor morale lower, there is good reason for \nconcern.  Rather than focusing on the hardware issues encapsulated in \nthe term ``modernization,'' I would like today to emphasize the \nproblems with readiness, morale and quality of life. Equipment is \nsecondary to the well-being of the men and women in uniform. The best \nweapons cannot bring about victory without adequate training in their \nuse and the firm loyalty of the soldier to buttress the military \nobjectives fought for.\n\n  We are now in our fourteenth year of decline in defense spending. \nWhat can no longer be ignored is that the increase in non-traditional \ndeployments coupled with down-sizing is steadily eroding readiness and \nmorale.\n  Our reduced force structure is overextended. Overextension is eroding \nretention rates, quality of life, operational readiness, and, most \nimportantly, morale. Whereas the U.S. military had 22 foreign missions \nduring the 1980s, they have already been involved in 36 foreign \nmissions since 1990.\n  At the same time, our forces have been down-sized by 35 to 40%. In \naddition, forward basing has decreased by two-thirds--from 39 major \ninstallations to 13. This translates into more forces based in the U.S. \nwhile deployments are overseas.\n  The result? More frequent and longer deployments, due to down-sized \nforces and up-sized involvement in foreign missions. The OPS TEMPO \nrequired under these constraints lead to grueling days even after \nreturning home from prolonged overseas missions.\n  Some soldiers are currently required to spend up to 150 days away \nfrom their families annually. Then, upon returning home, they still \nhave too many additional duties to really spend quality time at home.\n  Retention rates continue to plummet, especially in the Air Force. \nThis is not happening because we are not offering generous pay bonuses \nto re-enlist. Last year, 800 pilots refused re-enlistment bonuses of \n$60,000. The Air Force is planning to increase these bonuses to \n$110,000, but the Air Force is also planning for this problem to get \nworse.\n  Why? Although military planners contend that competition with a \nbooming U.S. economy and the private sector is the cause for defection, \nthe reality is more complex and points to the same problems already \ndiscussed. Heavy deployment schedules and no down-time between \ndeployments cause stresses on service personnel, especially those with \nfamilies.\n  A related issue is that the men and women in our armed forces \nincreasingly believe that their loyalty is a one-way street. In \naddition to demanding more for less from our soldiers, their quality of \nlife is also eroding.\n  The United States, the wealthiest and most powerful country in the \nworld, currently has military men and women who require food stamps to \nprovide for their families. The Defense Department says it would be \n``too expensive'' to solve this problem.\n  Housing for our military families is also inadequate. According to a \nstudy from the Defense Science Board, 62 percent of our barracks and 64 \npercent of our family housing are unsuitable. In the face of this, the \nPresident's request for military construction and family housing for \n1999 was $1.1 billion less than Congress provided in 1998.\n  Some in Washington are saying this is a money problem. It is a money \nproblem, but it is also more than that. It is also a leadership \nproblem, and it is a question of how competently our defenses are being \nmanaged.\n  Our pilots and other specialists are leaving the services in droves \nnot just to get better paying jobs; they are also leaving because they \nare being worn out; and they are not getting the support they need from \ntheir own leadership. They are being worn out by repeated deployments. \nAnd they are not always convinced that what they are being asked to do \nmakes sense.\n  Back home their spouses resent the military for turning their \nfamilies into single-parent households. And the quality of life offered \nto these military families can't begin to compensate.\n  Is it any wonder that with a booming economy and plenty of good jobs \navailable in the private sector that our soldiers are voting with their \nfeet? Is it any surprise that given inadequate housing for the families \nback home that they rarely see due to deployments abroad for missions \nthey don't understand that our soldiers are frustrated, ill-prepared \nand low on morale?\n  Perhaps most disturbing, I am beginning to see too many reports that \nthe\n\n[[Page S11235]]\n\nleadership is not addressing the real problems. There seems to be an \nemerging question of the confidence in our military's senior \nleadership. There is a growing concern that the top leadership is not \nwilling to make the hard decisions to restrain our military missions to \nthe available human and material resources or to expand those resources \nto meet the increasing demand.\n  That brings us back to the question of money. There is simply not \nenough money in the defense budget as it is currently projected to do \neverything that needs to be done. There is an effort underway to \nprovide emergency supplemental funding for military readiness. I \nsupport that effort. However, this will not solve the bigger problems.\n  Our military leaders are beginning to agree. In a recent Armed \nServices Committee Hearing with the Joint Chiefs, U.S. military leaders \nfinally conceded that they do, indeed, have a severe problem. The $1 \nbillion in supplemental funding will help, but according to the most \nrecent Joint Chiefs' testimony, between $10 to $13.5 billion would be \nnecessary in the coming year to meet U.S. defense needs.\n  One thing is blatantly clear. We must strive to adequately feed, \nhouse, and train our most precious military resource--the men and women \nin our armed forces. To do this will mean more resources for our \ndefense budget and it will mean better management of the resources--\nhuman and material--that we already have.\n  For next year, for the fiscal year 2000 budget, I believe, we need to \nstart the new millennium by at least stopping the ebbing tide and end \nthe 15 year decline.\n  Each year the Armed Services Committee is given the difficult task of \nbalancing between current and long-term readiness under current budget \nconstraints. In recent years, they have had the impossible task of \nensuring that personnel, quality of life, readiness, and modernization \nprograms are adequately supported, while funding levels remain \ninsufficient to achieve that objective.\n  The Committee recognizes, as do most of us concerned about our \nnational defense, that combat readiness of our armed forces is at risk. \nThe risk is a function of older equipment resulting from inadequate \nmodernization and a force structure too small to meet ongoing demands. \nAging equipment and weary soldiers cannot possibly defend this country \nadequately. Nor can dominance result from this equation.\n  I am gravely concerned about preparedness, modernization and \nprocurement. However, I am most concerned about the human element of \nour armed forces. The best equipment and the most rigorous training \ncannot compensate for too lengthy, too frequent deployments and time \naway from loved ones.\n  Mr. President, the solution is clear. We must stop the ebbing tide in \nour national defense budget. If we don't the hollowing out of our \nmilitary forces will continue. Our national security will be at risk \nduring a time of international uncertainty and growing threats. Our \nsoldiers deserve better and U.S. citizens are counting on us.\n  Mr. THURMOND. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to thank the leadership of the \nSenate for their cooperation and support in bringing this conference \nreport to the floor for approval of the Senate. The bipartisan support \nof both the majority and the minority leaders is critical to successful \npassage of the conference report of such magnitude.\n  The majority leader, Senator Lott, a former member of our committee, \nrecognizes the importance of this bill and has always given his full \nsupport and assistance in passing a bill of this nature. I thank him \nfor his time and support and all he has done in this respect.\n  I extend my appreciation to the leadership staff and the floor staff \nfor their assistance which is essential to passing this large, complex \nbill.\n  In that connection, Mr. President, I wish to especially commend Les \nBrownlee, staff director of the Armed Services Committee. He has \nrendered yeoman service to this committee, and I can't say enough in \nsupport of all he has done. George Lauffer, the deputy staff director, \nhas also been most faithful and has done an outstanding job. We \nappreciate that and thank him for what he has done in this connection. \nI also wish to thank David Lyles on the other side, and those who \nworked with him, for their fine cooperation and support. They have been \nmost cooperative and have rendered a great service.\n  Mr. President, we appreciate the work of two House Members. We thank \nFloyd Spence, who happens to be from my State, for handling the House \nbill. He is an outstanding gentleman of character and ability, and I \nthank him for all he has done in cooperating with us on the defense \nlegislation. Ike Skelton, a Democrat, who works with Congressman \nSpence, has also been cooperative and helpful, and I express my \nappreciation to him, too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in his capacity as a Senator from \nthe State of Washington, suggests the absence of a quorum and, without \nobjection, directs that the time be divided equally between the two \nsides.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield that to the able Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Is it possible \nfor me to ask unanimous consent to go into morning business rather than \ntake from Senator Thurmond's time? I wanted to talk about the 40th \nanniversary of NASA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an order that a vote occur on the \ndefense authorization bill at noon. The request is in order and will \nprobably be charged against both sides.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If that is acceptable, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave 5 minutes to speak on the 40th anniversary of NASA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11211-5", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11235-S11236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF NASA\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on October 1, 1958, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created. No other \nGovernment agency better represents the hopes and experiences of our \nNation during the course of its existence than NASA. To recall why that \nis so, let's look back to where we were 40 years ago.\n  In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the world's \nfirst artificial satellite. Many have claimed this had a ``Pearl \nHarbor'' effect on the American people and galvanized public opinion in \nfavor of an aggressive U.S. space program. Americans believed that the \nSoviet Union had gained a significant technological advantage over the \nUnited States--bomb shelters were built at an even more rapid rate as \nwe turned our attention to the space race.\n  Then-Senator Lyndon Johnson, from my state of Texas, said that the \nlaunch of Sputnik was ``* * * a new era of history dawning over the \nworld.'' He warned a Texas audience that, ``The mere fact that the \nSoviets can put a satellite in the sky * * * does not alter the world \nbalance of power. But it does mean they are in a position to alter the \nbalance of power.''\n  Shortly thereafter, Senator Johnson introduced legislation to create \nNASA and harnessed the energies, talents, and aspirations of a nation \nembarking on a bold, new enterprise. The act reflected a remarkable \nunanimity by the American people and a commitment to science and \nexploration.\n  NASA wasted no time in bringing America into the space race. Shortly \nafter it was formed, NASA conducted several exciting programs that \nlaunched us ahead of the Soviet Union in our quest to conquer space.\n  One of the most important initiatives involved human space flight--\nMercury's single astronaut program, Project Gemini's operations and \nProject Apollo to explore the Moon. These names conjure up strong \nimages of fearless astronauts doing the impossible. In 1961, Alan B. \nShepard became\n\n[[Page S11236]]\n\nthe first American to fly in space. Of course, we remember him because \nhe died just recently. In 1962, John Glenn, who now serves with us in \nthe U.S. Senate, became the first American to orbit the Earth. Project \nGemini allowed two astronauts to travel in space. On Gemini IV, Edward \nWhite became the first American to conduct a space walk.\n  In 1969, just 11 years after the creation of NASA, and less than a \ndecade after President Kennedy committed America to the project, Apollo \n11 landed on the Moon and Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made the \ndramatic ``leap'' for mankind. NASA completed five more lunar missions \nand learned much about the origins of the Moon, as well as how to \nsupport humans in outer space. Twelve American astronauts walked on the \nMoon during the six Apollo missions. Nothing symbolizes the uniqueness \nof this great Nation better than the American flag flying on the lunar \nsurface.\n  In 1975, NASA joined hands with its former competitor in the space \nrace and cooperated with the Soviet Union to achieve the first \ninternational human space flight. This project successfully tested \njoint rendezvous and docking procedures for spacecraft from the United \nStates and the Soviet Union.\n  In 1981, the advent of the space shuttle ushered in a new era of \nspace travel and exploration. By creating a reusable launch vehicle, \nNASA was making access to space now more affordable. The disaster of \nthe Challenger brought the shuttle program to a rapid standstill. It \nwas a harsh reminder that the exploration of space is a dangerous and \nunpredictable undertaking. Seven astronauts gave their lives on that \nmission in an effort to further our knowledge of the universe. We owe \nthem and their families our eternal gratitude and respect.\n  Two years after the Challenger disaster, we returned to space. \nThrough mid-1998, NASA has safely launched 65 shuttle missions. These \nmissions have included a wide variety of scientific and engineering \nmissions. There are currently four shuttles in NASA's fleet and NASA is \nworking with the private sector to reduce the cost of space flight even \nmore. Two experimental vehicles, the X-33 and X-34, are prototypes for \ncheaper, more efficient reusable launch vehicles that would provide \ncommercial entities with access to space. I commend NASA for continuing \nto look to the future and the challenges that lie there.\n  One of our colleagues, John Glenn, is scheduled to return to space on \nOctober 29th. It was in NASA's earliest days that John Glenn made \nhistory by bring the first American to orbit the Earth. Now he is \nmaking history again by being the oldest person to fly in space.\n  Looking forward to the next 40 years, NASA's future is as bright as \nits past. NASA's core mission of any future space exploration will be \nman's departure from Earth orbit and journeys to the Moon or Mars. This \nwill require extended, even permanent, stays in space and has led NASA \nto begin construction of the International Space Station.\n  In 1984, Congress authorized NASA to build the space station as a \nbase for further exploration of space. A project of this magnitude was \ncertain to face a multitude of unkonwns--and NASA has confronted many \nof them. As has always been the case, though, NASA will overcome these \nobstacles and we will reap the rewards of doing so.\n  For example, NASA has developed a unique technology, a bioreactor, \nthat allows medical researchers to produce breakthrough results by \ncreating ``artificial'' human tissues outside the human body. This \nbioreactor has provided new knowledge in cell science and tissue \nengineering that will bring exciting advances in medicine and the \ntreatment of disease. This amazing technology is already being used by \nscientists who are growing ovarian tumor samples so they can conduct \nstudies outside the body and without harm to the patient.\n  The absence of gravity on the space station also will allow new \ninsights into human health and disease prevention and treatment, \nincluding heart, lung, and kidney function, cardiovascular disease, \nosteoporosis, and immune system functions.\n  In recent years, NASA has obtained scientific data from space \nexperiments that is five times more accurate than that on Earth. None \nof these benefits will be available unless we have a space station on \nwhich we can perform adequate research.\n  The space station is the greatest peaceful scientific international \nendeavor undertaken. This is our future and space is one of the last \nunexplored regions of our universe. It holds untold knowledge and could \ncatapult us into even greater understanding of our world and yet \nundiscovered worlds. Yes, the station will provide us with fantastic \nscience--but that is only one of the known positives of this great \nendeavor. The unknowns are limitless and could provide us with \nunimaginable discoveries. We are on the very cusp of launching the \nfirst elements in November of this year, with the second element to \nfollow in December.\n  Since its inception in 1958, NASA has accomplished many great \nscientific and technological feats. NASA's technology has been adapted \nfor many nonaerospace uses by the private sector. We can thank NASA for \nso many things--from car phone technology, satellite imagery, the CAT \nscan, to Velcro and freeze dried ice cream. At its fortieth \nanniversary, NASA remains a leading force in scientific research and is \none of the best examples of the American spirit and our can-do \nattitude.\n  We are proud of what NASA has achieved, and on this 40th anniversary \nwe do have a number of accomplishments to celebrate.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11235-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11236-S11237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF NASA\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. We both \nshare a keen interest in space. I will also be speaking on the topic of \nthe 40th anniversary of NASA, which is today.\n  Mr. President, next month, from launch pad 39B at Cape Canaveral, the \nSpace Shuttle's main engines will fire up, the solid rocket motors will \nignite, and the crew of seven will be sent off into orbit around our \nhome planet. One of those seven will be the distinguished Senator from \nOhio. More than 36 years after his first flight, John Glenn will again \norbit the earth in a United States spacecraft.\n  I have here a picture of Senator Glenn taken 36 years ago with Dr. \nWernher von Braun in Huntsville, Alabama, my home State. They are shown \nhere discussing a proposed lunar landing craft. What an imagination, \nwhat a vision, what an exploring capacity they had. Shortly after that \nfirst orbital flight, they were already planning a trip to the moon--a \nvision that many thought could never be achieved and was achieved so \nsuccessfully.\n  Senator Glenn's remarkable story is a subplot to the remarkable story \nof the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. On October 1, \n1958, just six months before the distinguished Senator from Ohio was \nnamed as one of the original Mercury astronauts, NASA was born. Today, \nNASA marks its 40th anniversary of service to this Nation.\n  It is hard to believe that more than 40 years have passed since the \nSoviet launch of Sputnik. Spurred by concern over the Soviet advantage \nin space, the Eisenhower administration proposed the creation of a \ncivil space agency to lead our Nation in the exploration of space. \nForty years later, the Soviet Union no longer exists. But NASA stands \non the threshold of a new millennium, the undisputed world leader in \nspace exploration.\n  The agency's achievements and discoveries during that 40-year period \nhave changed our world in many ways. Those who are familiar with the \nspace program talk frequently of the many ``spinoffs'' from the \nprogram. There are, in fact, many products and services that are \nobviously and directly attributable to the space program.\n  For instance, many Americans do not leave home in the morning before \nchecking the weather forecast. Being from Mobile and just sitting \nthrough a hurricane, this was particularly true for me this past \nweekend. Of course, weather satellites orbiting the earth have \nrevolutionized weather forecasting. Many of us check the forecast by\n\n[[Page S11237]]\n\nturning on the television networks that distribute their signals by \nsatellite. Indeed, I saw a writer interviewed recently. He said he \nrealized just how significant this global communications system was \nwhen he was on a dirt road in Africa and he picked up a cell phone and, \nthrough a satellite, called his home in Ohio.\n  There are a great number of beneficial byproducts of NASA's work that \nare less obvious. Indeed, many credit the micro-miniaturization of \nelectronics, which was driven by the needs of the space program, with \nushering in the whole technological revolution and the information age \nthat we are now experiencing.\n  As important as the tangible benefits from the space program have \nbeen, I believe the intangible benefits have been even more \nsignificant. What value can we assign to our victory in the space \nrace--to our come-from-behind win against a totalitarian rival? What \nwould have been the military and foreign policy implications of Soviet \ndomination in outer space?\n  But Cold War implications aside, NASA's success has been an important \nfactor in elevating our national spirit. For America, exploration is \nimperative. We will never be content to sit back as observers while \nothers take the risks and are rewarded with new discoveries. \nExploration can take many forms, but, probably more than anyone else, \nNASA exemplifies our spirit of exploration.\n  There was a time, earlier in our Nation's history, when Alabama and \neverything west of the Appalachians comprised the frontier. Today, \nspace is the frontier. Since its inception 40 years ago, NASA has been \ncharting the path in this new and exciting territory.\n  On October 7, 1958, just one week after it came into existence, NASA \nformally approved Project Mercury to send a man into orbit around the \nearth, investigate his capabilities and reactions to space and return \nhim safely to earth. Project Mercury produced genuine American heroes, \nlike the late Alan Shepard and then-Lieutenant Colonel John Glenn.\n  On May 25, 1961--shortly after Alan Shepard's suborbital flight, and \nmonths before Senator Glenn became the first American astronaut to \norbit the earth in February of 1962--President Kennedy set a high mark \nfor the young space program. Speaking to a joint session of Congress, \nhe established a national goal of landing a man on the moon and \nbringing him safely back to earth, and this was to be accomplished \nbefore the decade was out.\n  As we all know, the nation and NASA were up to the challenge. On July \n20, 1969, an Apollo lunar landing craft carrying Neil Armstrong and \nBuzz Aldrin touched down on the surface of the moon. That remarkable \nachievement stands as one of the proudest moments in American history, \nand one of the greatest achievements in the history of mankind.\n  Since Apollo, NASA's accomplishments have been legion, in aeronautics \nas well as space, in unmanned exploration as well as human space \nflight. While it is hard to match the thrill of the first moon landing, \nthe expansion of scientific knowledge flowing from NASA's later \nprograms has truly been historic.\n  As we look to the future, NASA cannot, and would not, rest on its \nlaurels. Within the first few months after its 40th Anniversary, NASA \nwill launch the STS-95 science mission, with Senator Glenn on board, \nwill launch the first U.S. element of the International Space Station, \nand will launch its next great observatory, the Advanced X-Ray \nAstrophysics Facility.\n  Following close on the heels of those missions will be the first \nflights of the X-34 technology demonstrator and the X-33 reusable \nlaunch vehicle prototype, as well as the launch of the U.S. Laboratory \nModule for the Space Station.\n  All of this is scheduled to occur before this millennium closes. With \nproper support from the Administration, the Congress and the public, \nNASA will continue to lead the world in exploration well into the next \nmillennium.\n  I am proud of the role that my home state has played and continues to \nplay in the space program. Even before NASA was formed, Dr. Wernher von \nBraun and his team of rocket scientists with the Army Ballistic Missile \nAgency in Huntsville were developing new rocket systems. A modified \nJupiter-C rocket, developed by von Braun's team, answered Sputnik by \nplacing the Explorer I Satellite into orbit on January 31, 1958.\n  This is a remarkable picture taken at the ABMA Fabrication Lab in \nHuntsville in 1959. Shown here are the original seven Mecury \nastronauts, who are touring the facility with Dr. von Braun. From left \nto right we see: Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, John Glenn, \nScott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, Deke Slayton, and Dr. von Braun.\n  In 1960, 4000 employees of the ABMA in Huntsville were transferred to \nNASA's control, and Dr. von Braun became the first Director of the \nGeorge C. Marshall Space Flight Center. Von Braun and the Marshall \nCenter would be responsible for the Redstone rocket, which lifted Alan \nShepard into outer space, and for the giant Saturn V rocket, which \npropelled Apollo 11 to the moon.\n  Marshall Space Flight Center is still NASA's center of excellence for \nspace propulsion, as well as NASA's lead center for Space \nTransportation Systems Development and for Microgravity Research. \nCompanies and universities in Alabama also continue to play important \nroles in the space program.\n  So I have reason to be proud of Alabama's contributions. But \nuniversities, corporations, and NASA installations throughout the \ncountry play important roles in the space program and in space-based \nresearch. Our whole nation can be proud of our accomplishments in \nspace, and in NASA's important aeronautics research.\n  We have succeeded because we are willing to take risks. And we have \nbeen unwilling to quit when we encounter difficulties and setbacks.\n  The tragic Apollo fire cost the lives of three brave astronauts. But \nwe persevered, and the Apollo program made giant leaps for mankind.\n  During launch in 1973, the Skylab space station sustained damage that \nthreatened to render it useless before it ever was put into service. \nCreative engineering salvaged that very important program.\n  The Challenger explosion in 1986 was a terribly painful event. We all \nmourned with the families of those brave explorers. But, following that \ntragedy, NASA was able to regroup, and has since safely flown 65 Space \nShuttle missions, with a tremendous harvest of scientific results.\n  Perhaps it is this knack for overcoming adversity that makes NASA so \nspecial. Space is a harsh environment, and setbacks are inevitable. The \nrisks are real. But NASA has done an extraordinary job of coping with \nthe difficult situations that they have confronted. Many times the \npeople of NASA have turned potential failures into remarkable \nsuccesses.\n  Now, as we stand on the threshold of a new century--indeed, a new \nmillennium--our whole nation can be proud as we look back on NASA's \naccomplishments in its first 40 years. And we can be optimistic as we \nlook ahead.\n  Optimistic that our spirit of exploration is alive and well. \nOptimistic that we will continue to see tangible and intangible fruit \nfrom our investment in space. Optimistic that our children's lives will \nbe richer because we dare to reach for the stars.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate NASA on its 40th anniversary. I look \nforward to continuing to work hard to support this program in the \nfuture. Unfortunately, the administration's budget for the last 4 years \nhas shown a net reduction in funding for NASA. I have spoken on that \nbefore. The budget we approved this year represents a small reduction \nagain this year over last year's budget for NASA. I think it is time \nthat we recognize our character as a nation, that we not cut NASA, that \nwe recognize that it symbolizes who we are as a people. We should \nrecognize that NASA symbolizes our best and highest instincts as a \nnation, and that we ought to be space explorers as Lewis and Clark \nexplored the frontier, and as we have explored the seas and so many \nthings.\n  Mr. President, I want to again say how much I have been honored to \nserve with astronaut Glenn, Colonel Glenn, and Senator Glenn. He has \nbeen a high representative of this Senate. We cheer him on again as he \ngoes forward to his next flight 36 years after the first.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11236-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11238-S11239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11238]]\n   STROM THURMOND NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                        1999--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as remains on our \nside in the stead of the Democratic leader, as manager on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the defense authorization \nconference report that is before us today.\n  In particular, I would like to thank the conferees for their support \nof an amendment I offered in the Senate dealing with Russia's tactical \nnuclear weapons. I was pleased to have the cosponsorship of Senators \nKempthorne, Kennedy, Bingaman, and Levin when this amendment was passed \nby the Senate in June. I would like to thank them again for their \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, my amendment focuses on an issue that I believe has \nreceived too little attention. That is the question of the tactical \nnuclear weapons in the Russian arsenal. Those weapons, that are \nthousands in number, are among the most vulnerable to acquisition by \nterrorists and dictators.\n  The conferees' approval of my amendment is timely. Recent stories in \nthe Washington Post have indicated that the international terrorist, \nBin Laden, may have made attempts to purchase Russian nuclear weapons \nand that Iraq's nuclear program is much further along than previously \nexpected. Unfortunately, the chances are increasing that the Bin Ladens \nand Saddam Husseins of the world may acquire nuclear weapons. That \ndanger increases as Russia's economic meltdown continues. As Russian \nsoldiers go unpaid and funding for security systems comes under \npressure, Russia's massive tactical nuclear arsenal becomes the world's \nbest source of warheads for terrorists and others who wish this world \nill.\n  Mr. President, the threat of tactical nuclear warheads being sold and \nthe threat of them being stolen is growing.\n  This chart refers to a CIA comment on the ``loose nukes'' question. \nAs they responded to an inquiry from my office:\n\n       We cannot rule out the possibility that a small number of \n     nuclear warheads are missing. The Russian nuclear accounting \n     system is archaic and inefficient. Years of crisis have left \n     once-elite troops impoverished. . . . We take claims of lost \n     warheads seriously.\n\n  On the question of tactical nuclear warheads, I offer these \nobservations--the first from the Congressional Research Service:\n\n       Questions exist about the locks employed on [Russia's \n     tactical nuclear weapons] and possible breaches in security \n     at storage facilities. Many now believe that the risk of \n     acquisition or use by rebels, criminals, or rogue military \n     leaders may be greater for tactical nuclear weapons than it \n     is for strategic nuclear weapons.\n\n  From the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, I quote:\n\n       Because of their larger numbers, smaller size, and in some \n     cases simple design and relative ease of employment, non-\n     strategic nuclear weapons pose more difficult command, \n     control, and safety concerns than do strategic nuclear \n     weapons.\n\n  Mr. President, the point is that there is a threat. There is a threat \nof these thousands of tactical nuclear weapons that the Russians still \nhave in their arsenal being diverted to the uses of those who are a \ndanger to all of us. Terrorist use of a tactical nuclear warhead could \nbe devastating.\n  This is a comparison to what happened out in Oklahoma City. That \nfertilizer bomb was .0002 of a kiloton. The ``Fat Man'' atomic device \ndropped in 1945 was 14 kilotons. The smaller tactical weapons of today \nare 10 kilotons. The larger tactical nuclear weapons of today have a \nyield of as much as 300 kilotons.\n  I think we need to understand the destructive potential of these \nweapons in the Russian arsenal.\n  Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal is still massive. We can go back to \n1991. The United States had roughly 15,000 tactical nuclear weapons at \nthat time; the Soviet Union had 20,000. If we look today, the United \nStates is down to 1,600 tactical nuclear weapons; the Russians still \nhave from 7,000 to 12,000.\n  My colleagues know that there are treaties that deal with strategic \nsystems and conventional systems. There is nothing on tactical nuclear \nsystems. That is why I believe the amendment that is in this bill is \nimportant.\n  I believe it is time for Congress to:\n  No. 1, go on record as concerned about the significant ``loose nuke'' \ndangers associated with Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile and its \ngrowing strategic relevance;\n  No. 2, call for the Russians to make good on the 1991 and 1992 \nGorbachev and Yeltsin promises to deeply reduce tactical nuclear \nweapons, just as the United States has followed through in good faith \non President Bush's promises in September of 1991;\n  And, No. 3, get more information from the Pentagon and the \nintelligence community about this threat.\n  This chart perhaps sums it up best. The bottom line on Russian \ntactical nuclear arms is, to quote General Eugene Habiger, former \nCommander in Chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, on March 31, 1998:\n\n       It is time for us to get very serious about tactical \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  Indeed, it is time for us to get very serious. This amendment is a \nbeginning.\n  I thank the Armed Services Committee for their support for this \namendment.\n  I would like to take a moment more to thank those members of the \nArmed Services Committee who will no longer be in the positions they \ncurrently occupy. We are going to miss Senator Dirk Kempthorne of \nIdaho, a wonderful man, somebody who has become a good friend. I am \ngoing to miss him very much. And Senator Dan Coats will also be \nretiring, and is also a terrific person. Dan Coats has been in many \nways the conscience of the Senate, somebody we can look to time and \ntime again for moral leadership.\n  Of course, I also want to recognize the chairman. This is the last \nbill that we will have before us with Senator Thurmond as chairman of \nthe committee.\n  Senator Thurmond, we want to recognize the enormous contribution that \nyou have made to this body and the enormous assistance that you have \nprovided to all of us.\n  I also want to recognize Senator Glenn who will be retiring. He will \nbe going into space. Senator Glenn has been rock solid on these issues. \nWe are certainly going to miss him in this Chamber.\n  Senator Thurmond is not leaving us, thank goodness. I have a feeling \nSenator Thurmond will probably be here long after I have left and \nperhaps long after most other Members have left. He has been able to \nstay in this Chamber for longer than anyone else in our history. Even \nthough he is stepping down as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nI have no doubt that Senator Thurmond will continue to lead us in many \nother ways.\n  I want to recognize those who will be either changing their roles or \nleaving the Senate as we consider this bill for the final time this \nyear.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the able Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his kind remarks and commend him for the great service \nthat he has rendered to the Senate during his tenure.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this defense bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield any time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the 40th anniversary of NASA is \nhistoric. It does have an impact on my State of California. I want to \ntake a moment and wish NASA a happy birthday. I want to salute the fact \nthat they have captured the world's imagination with missions such as \nthe Mars Pathfinder and the Hubbell Space Telescope. Experiments and \ntechnological feats performed on Space Shuttle missions are paving the \nway for a permanent presence in space.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I join my colleagues in recognizing the \nmany historic achievements that the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration has made in its forty years of service.\n  This is a particularly exciting period for our space program, not \nsimply because NASA is celebrating its 40th Anniversary but more \nimportantly because of the major advances being made in the exploration \nof our solar system.\n  As I said, in recent years, NASA has captured the world's imagination \nwith missions such as the Mars Pathfinder and the Hubble Space \nTelescope. Experiments and technological feats performed on Space \nShuttle missions are paving the way for a permanent presence in space.\n  One of the most telling signs of our changing world is that, NASA, \nwhose original mission was national defense in the cold war with the \nSoviet Union, is now working with Russia to develop the first \nInternational Space Station.\n  I am very proud to say that some of NASA's most valuable research has \nbeen accomplished in my home State of California. In 1958, the Jet \nPropulsion Lab in Pasadena built and controlled the first United States \nsatellite sent into orbit. In the four decades that have followed, JPL \nhas contributed to the exploration of most of the known planets in our \nsolar system.\n  The full list of JPL's role in planetary exploration is far too long \nto address here. But I want to mention one recent accomplishment. In \nDecember of 1996, NASA launched the Mars Pathfinder, another JPL built \nand controlled spacecraft.\n  The Pathfinder successfully placed a rover on the surface of the red \nplanet that beamed-back pictures that were viewed around the world with \nawe. I actually had the unique pleasure to visit JPL last year and was \nactually able to send commands up to the rover and then watch and see \nthe rover move based on the command. It was rather amazing because the \ncomputer I was on actually went to a station in the desert which then \nbeamed it directly to Mars, and so a few minutes after I pressed the \ncommand into the computer, I actually watched the rover move on the \nplanet Mars. It was an amazing experience.\n  California is also home to one of NASA's premier research \nlaboratories, the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory. NASA Ames provides \nresearch in the fields of supercomputing, software development, and \nautomated reasoning. As the lead center for Aviation Operations \nSystems, Ames manages the research effort in air traffic control and \nhas the major responsibility for wind tunnel testing and simulation.\n  As California has been a major partner in NASA's success in the past, \nwe will continue to lead as we move into the 21st century. NASA has \ndeveloped a strategic plan that will build on its accomplishments with \na renewed focus on scientific research and the application of a new \ncutting-edge technology. I am confident that California will continue \nto provide the backbone for this program.\n  I want to take a few moments to talk about what I believe is one of \nthe most remarkable feats in the history of a space program filled with \nremarkable feats. Later this month, the Space Shuttle Discovery will be \nembarking on Mission STS-95. As we know, our colleague, Senator John \nGlenn will be making his second trip into space on this flight. While \nhis presence will certainly be missed here in the Senate, I know my \ncolleagues share my pride in his achievements and wish him the best on \nhis historic return to space.\n  On February 20, 1962, John Glenn piloted the ``Friendship 7'' \nspacecraft on the U.S.'s first manned obtial mission. During the almost \n5 hour flight, Senator Glenn worked on some of the first technical and \nmedical experiments ever performed while orbiting the Earth.\n  Now, more than 35 years after that first flight, Senator Glenn will \nsoon be returning to space. It is interesting to note some of the \nadvancements that have been made since that first ground breaking \nflight.\n  The shuttle's flight will last 9 days instead of 5 hours, it will \norbit the planet at 345 miles an hour rather than 16, and it will \ncircle the Earth 144 times rather than 3. The comparison between these \ntwo flights capsulizes the advancements that have been made in the \nspace program and it is remarkable that one man will experience both.\n  Senator Glenn has done more to promote our space program than perhaps \nany other person. Millions of people held their collective breath as he \nled the country into orbit of the Earth in 1962 and the world will \nagain watch as he leads NASA into the next century.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pride and respect that I pay tribute \nto the many achievements NASA has made in its first 40 years. I know \nthat I stand with the rest of the nation in anticipation of what will \nbe accomplished in the next 40.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11240-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11240-S11269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                KING COVE HEALTH AND SAFETY ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3676\n\n           (Purpose: Amendment in the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``King Cove Health and Safety \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (a) King Cove, Alaska is a community in the westernmost \n     region of the Alaska Peninsula with a population of roughly \n     800 full-\n\n[[Page S11241]]\n\n     time residents and an additional 400 to 600 workers who are \n     transported in and out of the community a number of times a \n     year to work in the local fish processing plant and on \n     fishing vessels;\n       (b) the majority of the full-time residents are indigenous \n     Native peoples of Aleut ancestry that have resided in the \n     region for over 5,000 years;\n       (c) the only mode of access to or from King Cove is via \n     small aircraft or fishing boat, and the weather patterns are \n     so severe and unpredictable that King Cove is one of the \n     worst places in all of the United States to access by either \n     of these modes of transportation;\n       (d) the State of Alaska has initiated the King Cove to Cold \n     Bay Transportation Improvement Assessment to confirm the need \n     for transportation improvements for King Cove and to identify \n     alternative methods of improving transportation access with \n     comprehensive environmental and economic review of each \n     alternative;\n       (e) the State of Alaska has identified a road between King \n     Cove and Cold Bay as one of the alternatives to be evaluated \n     in the transportation planning process but for a road to be a \n     viable option for the State of Alaska, the Congress must \n     grant a legislative easement within the Izembek National \n     Wildlife Refuge (``Refuge'') across approximately seven miles \n     of wilderness land owned by the Federal Government;\n       (f) there are fourteen miles of roads within the wilderness \n     boundary of the Refuge which are currently traveled by \n     vehicles;\n       (g) any road constructed in accordance with such easement \n     would be an unpaved, one-lane road sufficient in width to \n     satisfy State law; and\n       (h) the combined communities of King Cove and Cold Bay have \n     approximately 250 vehicles.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish a surface \n     transportation easement across Federal lands within the \n     Refuge and to transfer 664 acres of high value habitat lands \n     adjacent to the Refuge in fee simple from the King Cove \n     Corporation to the Federal Government as new wilderness lands \n     within the Refuge in exchange for redesignating a narrow \n     corridor of land within the Refuge as nonwilderness lands.\n\n     SEC. 4. LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n       If the King Cove Corporation offers to transfer to the \n     United States all right, title, and interest of the \n     Corporation in and to all land owned by the Corporation in \n     Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of T 57 S, R 88 W, Seward \n     Meridian, Alaska; and any improvements thereon, the Secretary \n     of the Interior (``Secretary'') shall, not later than 30 days \n     after such offer, grant the Aleutians East Borough a \n     perpetual right-of-way of 60 feet in width through the lands \n     described in sections 6 and 7 of this Act for the \n     construction, operation and maintenance of certain utility-\n     related fixtures and of a public road between the city of \n     Cold Bay, Alaska, and the city of King Cove, Alaska and \n     accept the transfer of the offered lands. Upon transfer to \n     the United States, such lands shall be managed in accordance \n     with Section 1302(i) of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act, shall be included within the Refuge, and \n     shall be managed as wilderness.\n\n     SEC. 5.

If within 24 months of the date the King Cove \n     Corporation offers to transfer to the United States all \n     right, title, and interest of the Corporation lands set forth \n     in Section 4 of this Act, the Secretary and the Aleutians \n     East Borough fail to mutually agree on the following--\n       (1) a final land exchange and a grant of a right-of-way \n     pursuant to Section 4; and\n       (2) the right-of-way specifications, and terms and \n     conditions of use set forth in sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this \n     Act.\n\n     then the Aleutians East Borough shall have the right to \n     select a 60 foot right-of-way for the construction, \n     operation, and maintenance of certain utility-related \n     fixtures and of a public road from lands described in Section \n     7 of this section, and to identify logistical staging areas \n     and construction material sites within the right-of-way. If \n     an agreements is not reached within 6 months after the \n     Aleutians East Borough notifies the Secretary of its \n     selection, then the right-of-way is hereby granted to the \n     Borough.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will proceed under the theory that \none picture is worth 1,000 words, although I am not suggesting that you \nare not going to get 1,000 words, as well. In any event, in order to \nset the stage for the debate on King Cove, I think it necessary to \neducate and familiarize the Members of this body as to what this issue \nis, where it is, and why it is so important to the residents of the \nsmall community of King Cove, on the Aleutian Islands, population 700, \nwho have no availability of surface transportation for medical care. As \na consequence of the lack of surface transportation for this community, \n11 of the residents of that small community have perished in medevac \nflights out of the area over the last decade.\n  I think I should also identify Senate bill 1092 that is before this \nbody, specifically, the substitute that I have offered, which exchanges \nsurface estate.\n  The substitute that I offer exchanges the surface estate of some of \nthe higher value wetlands privately owned by one of the Native village \ncorporations in King Cove within the refuge in exchange for a simple \ngrant of right-of-way across Federal lands that would allow the \nresidents of King Cove reliable access to the Cold Bay Airport; hence, \nmedical care when emergencies exist.\n  Further, we are not asking for an appropriation. I think it is fair \nto note that there are no funds requested. This is simply an \nauthorization for land exchange, something that is ordinarily done \nwithin the Committee of Energy and Natural Resources, which I chair, on \na daily basis.\n  The real concern here is the people of King Cove. Now, many of the \nMembers of this body have had an opportunity to meet with the Aleut \nresidents of King Cove as they visited Washington, DC, as they visited \nMembers' offices and made a unique appeal, an appeal based on the \nrigors of living in a wilderness area with a harsh environment, and the \nexperiences they have had in not being able to avail themselves of the \ntransportation system that ensures that they can safely get to \nhospitals for medical assistance when there is an emergency.\n  As I said, 11 residents of my State have already died flying into or \nout of the area. Many of them were seeking to get badly needed medical \nattention in an emergency. Still others died while waiting on the \nground for weather to clear enough to attempt to make these potential \nlife-saving flights.\n  Let me show Members what part of Alaska we are talking about. Alaska \nis a pretty big chunk of real estate. We have 33,000 miles of \ncoastline. Of course, Juneau, our capital, sits here. Anchorage, our \nlargest city, is at the\n\n[[Page S11242]]\n\nhead of Cook Inlet, roughly in this area. Fairbanks, where my home is, \nis in the interior. Point Barrow is adjacent to the Arctic Ocean. \nPrudhoe Bay is on the Beaufort Sea. But we have another area on the \nAleutian Islands and this area extends almost to Japan. This area \nincludes the community of King Cove which is on the Pacific Ocean side. \nAcross a small base is the area where we have a large airport that was \nleft over from World War II. To identify the specific area on a scale \nmap, we can see Cold Bay here, and then King Cove here.\n  We have unique weather patterns spawned as a consequence of the \nJapanese current moving along the Aleutian Islands and clashing with \nthe cold, interior Bering Sea, creating some of the worst weather in \nthe world. No question it has been documented as such.\n  We have the village of King Cove, 700 people year-round, and a small \nindustry associated with fish packing, freezing and processing. Then we \nhave a large complex built during World War II, consisting of crosswind \nrunways. I will show pictures of runways in Cold Bay and King Cove.\n  Let me show the first picture which shows a gravel strip, about 3,700 \nfeet, which is the access for the residents of King Cove. There is a \nroad that goes along the side of the mountain. That is the road that \ncomes in from the village. The interesting thing about this and the \nlocation is this is the best they could do for an airfield because of \nthe topography and the realization that the winds are extraordinary in \nthis area. There are numerous cases of pilots landing in small single \nor twin-engines with the wind sock at one end blowing one way and the \nwind sock at the other end blowing the other way. That is the harsh \nreality because the wind from the Bering Sea comes one way, the winds \nfrom the Pacific Ocean come the other. They simply clash over this area \nand create this extraordinary complexity of winds. It is not \nnecessarily fog, it is not necessarily heavy snowfall, it is tremendous \nturbulence in wind.\n  Here is another airfield located at Cold Bay. This was part of the \neffort during the Second World War in preparation for the invasion of \nJapan, to build this large facility, over 11,000 feet, the main runway. \nThe population here is about 130 people. Most are Government employees \nwith the FAA, operating this runway. This is also a backup for an \nemergency, should any of the space shuttles have to land in this \nparticular area based on their orbits.\n  The point is, there is daily jet service into Anchorage from here. I \nthink there was only 1 day last year where the winds were such that \nthey couldn't bring in aircraft.\n  This is how you go from King Cove to Cold Bay to start your visit to \nAnchorage to visit with friends or to get out, if you will, of King \nCove to go virtually anywhere. You have to go over here. The only way \nto get there is to fly. If you are in an emergency situation, you have \nanother set of facts. The point is this runway represents reliability \nin transport. You see these little roads here around Cold Bay that have \nbeen in existence since the Second World War.\n  It is interesting to note that there are some 32 to 47 miles of roads \nthat are in the wilderness. Make no mistake. I have driven the roads. \nThey are there. They are not maintained because there is little \nmaintenance necessary for them. But they are drivable. They are \ndrivable by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and others.\n  Let me proceed with some more pictures because I promised to give you \nan opportunity for a feeling for this area relative to pictures that \nhave been taken over an extended period of time.\n  Now, I want to show the land area and the proposed road so we can get \nan idea of what we are talking about here in relationship to the issue. \nThe colors in solid brown are the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. \nThat is this area here. Then we have the wilderness areas in the \ncheckered brown with the white in it. You can see it is extensive, but \nit is not conclusive in that it connects. There is the major portion \nhere, and then over toward Cold Bay there is another area, and there \nhas been an area that has been left aside down here. So the wilderness \nareas don't connect together.\n  The existing roads are worth evaluating a little bit, Mr. President, \nbecause they cover roads not only in the wilderness up here, which are \ndrivable, but they go into the wildlife range where you can go and \nphotograph and you can hunt geese. They go into the wilderness area \nhere.\n  The proposal now is to have a road from King Cove to Cold Bay. That \nis the issue. In order to bring that road around, you have to go into \nthat area of wilderness because you can't cross the bay because of the \nwater depth and the costs associated with the bridge, and we are really \ndealing with 700 people now.\n  So what are the alternatives? I am prepared to discuss those later. \nIt is important to know what the quid pro quo is here, because we think \nit is a win for the environment, with the recognition that the Native \nassociation is prepared to give their land, which is colored here in \nthe basic green areas and the yellow areas, in exchange for access \nthrough this area. The quid pro quo is they are proposing that about \n580 acres to be added to the wilderness in return for this 7 miles of \nroad, which would be through this wilderness area. The only difference \nis that we are not putting it into wilderness. I have a difficult time \ntrying to communicate this to some of the other Members and the public \nbecause we are proposing a land exchange.\n  By this 580 acres entering into the wilderness in the exchange, as a \nconsequence of that, we would have a situation where there would be the \nroad in a refuge but not a wilderness. By adding to the wilderness, we \nhave done just that, taken land that the Native corporations have--and \nthat is private land--and added that to the wilderness, and then \nexchanged with these specific areas designated in white--a land \nexchange--putting this in a refuge. So the road will not go through a \nwilderness; it would go through a refuge.\n  We have numerous occasions where there have been similar land \nexchanges and roads are going in refuges. This is not unique or a \nprecedent. If you look at this area and you are concerned about \nwaterfowl, note these two peninsulas that are privately owned by the \nNative corporation. They are proposing to give those and add to the \nwilderness. These are integral points inasmuch as they represent \npeninsulas and, as a consequence, the waterfowl primarily dominate \nthrough those particular areas. So this is the route of the proposed \nroad.\n  We are not asking for funding. No appropriation here. This is a land \nexchange only to benefit the people of King Cove. And, hopefully, the \nquestion is, how many more lives do we have to lose before we get some \nrelief?\n  I want to go through some of the other charts, in general, to give \nyou an idea of why some of the alternatives suggested by others simply \ndon't work.\n  This is a photo of Izembek when there is a storm. I don't know if you \nhave ever been terrified, but I have. I have been out in boats in some \nof these storms. This is how you get from King Cove to Cold Bay across \nIzembek when there is a storm. And these are real storms. We have cases \nwhere a pregnant woman is put aboard a fishing boat in a storm like \nthis. She gives birth to the child in the galley, and they have to open \nthe oven and make an incubator out of tin foil and the child survives. \nI will show other pictures of just what kind of bodies of water we are \ntalking about.\n  Mind you, the uniqueness here is that you have Bristol Bay and the \nBering Sea on one side and the Pacific Ocean, and this is the area \nwhere all the storms basically are initiated on the west coast and down \nto California. This photo shows Izembek Bay in a storm. How would you \nlike to subject yourself to that? You and I are accustomed to taking a \nroad to the hospital and having access to some reasonable way, without \nhaving to subject yourself to conditions likes this.\n  Somebody said, ``Well, what happens on a clear day?'' That depends on \nwhat season you are in. This photo happens to depict the wintertime \nwhen the bay is frozen over. That is factual. There is your ambulance \nin the wintertime. How would you like to try that? That is the harsh \nreality that happens at certain times in the winter. You are not going \nto move a Hovercraft over that, and you are certainly not going to move \na boat. What happens sometimes is that they do have a vessel in,\n\n[[Page S11243]]\n\nand they try to move people from a small boat up to the dock, and they \nmove them in a cargo net. How would you like to get off your boat and \ninto a cargo net under those conditions?\n  That is living in rural Alaska today. It is the harsh reality. We \nhave some other pictures that I want to show you relative to the harsh \nreality of living in Alaska.\n  These are people who have died because there was no access out of \nKing Cove. This is Tom Phillips, who lost a leg in a boating accident. \nHe died in a plane crash in a medevac airplane trying to fly into Cold \nBay. Christine Dushkin suffered a heart attack and died of exertion \nwhile climbing onto a Cold Bay dock from a small boat. Mary Dobson \nsuffered from frequent seizures but could not get timely medical care \nduring bad weather. Darien Gorsinger, a community leader, died in a \nplane crash while evacuating an injured Seattle fisherman. Walter \nSamuelson waited 3 days after a heart attack to get out of King Cove. \nSarina Bear, who was born prematurely on a fishing boat, lost half of \nher body weight on a 3-hour fishing boat trip to Cold Bay. Earnest Mack \ndied in Anchorage after 4 days of delay while trying to get out of King \nCove. Kathy Hoff, a King Cove nurse, died in a plane crash on a \nMedicare mission out of King Cove. John Datolli, a bush pilot, died in \na plane on a medical mission to King Cove.\n  This is the harsh reality and the situation as it exists. Some \nsuggest, let's do another study, let's look for another alternative. In \nthe meantime, my constituents are dying. I know how you would feel if \nthey were your constituents.\n  Here are some headlines from some of our Anchorage newspapers, the \nAnchorage Daily News and the Anchorage Times: ``Six Killed in a Plane \nCrash,'' ``Plane on Mercy Mission Crashes; 4 Believed Dead,'' ``Four \nDie in Cold Bay Crash,'' ``Plane Hits Hillside at King Cove; 6 Die,'' \n``Pilot Dies In Crash.''\n  This happens because it is really tough out there. It is so tough, as \na matter of fact, that the people are saying, let us have the \nopportunity that other Americans enjoy, which is access by road. This \nis the road in this photo, Mr. President. That is what they look like. \nThese were roads that were built during the Second World War. There is \nso little traffic that there is very little maintenance. This sign over \nhere is a U.S. Fish and Wildlife sign. That goes over to Outer Point. I \ngo out there virtually every Columbus Day, unlike my good friend, whom \nI have the utmost respect for, who has never been there. He has never \nexperienced it. I have. This is what we are talking about. These are \nthe roads that are out there.\n\n  Here is another picture. This is the topography of the area, what the \ncountry looks like. It is flat. It is barren. There are no trees. There \nis grass. There are lots of ponds. There are lots of birds that come \nthrough in the fall. They move on.\n  You can go on these roads. You can take an old 4X4 and wander around \nand see the country. Mind you, these roads are in the wilderness, 47 \nmiles of them.\n  When you say we are driving through the heart of the Izembeck \nWilderness with this road connection, you are not facing reality. These \nroads are already there. They are not all of the wilderness.\n  I will show you where these roads are, because we have a detailed map \nwhich shows the road in and out of the wilderness. It gives you an \nidea.\n  These aren't highways we are building. They are not superhighways. \nThey are just an adequate road that you can take a 4X4 over, \nrecognizing that when you put a little gravel around and maybe have \nfour or five cars a week, it is not very much traffic. But depending on \nthe circumstances, at least somebody can get out.\n  This is an aerial picture of the topography of the general area and \nwhat we are looking at. I think it is important that you reflect on \nwhat the area looks like today. This is a little difficult to see, but \nI am going to do the best I can, because it is in black and white. It \nis an aerial photograph. It is an official photograph. It is not \nsomething that has been doctored up or lines have been drawn in.\n  But this general area down here is the edge of the Cove Bay runway, \nand these are the roads in black that go through the general area. \nThese are the roads that wander in through the wilderness designation. \nThis is the line right here, the boundary. The wilderness is on this \nside. All of these roads are in the wilderness. They are already there.\n  What we are proposing is simply an extension of this road of 7 miles \nto go in with a land exchange--taking the area out of the wilderness, \nputting it in the refuge, and putting a road extension in. We are not \nasking for any money, we are simply asking for an exchange and an \nauthorization; that is it.\n  Here are the existing roads that wander over here. Here is another \nwilderness boundary over here, a little chunk over here. There are \nroads to the west of that. When I go out there goose hunting, we \nusually wander out here, or wander up through here in the wilderness, \nand go out over here--any number of places that are there. To suggest \nthat we are creating something that is not there is totally unrealistic \nand unfounded.\n  Again, I want to go through the remainder of the charts, because I \nthink you are beginning to get a feel for what the country looks like \nand what we are up against. Hopefully the staff, who has not practiced \nthis, will make sure that we show all the other charts before we get \ninto some of the things that the Senator from Montana and the Senator \nfrom Arkansas take for granted that are unavailable in Alaska.\n  While they are going through some more of the visuals, let me make a \ncouple more points.\n  What has happened to our Native people when wilderness boundaries and \nrefuges have been designated is that the concerns of the people have \nbasically been overlooked. The Aleut people have lived in King Cove for \nover 5,000 years. The substitute that I offer today would provide \nrelief for access. That is really all we are talking about. We are \ntalking about appealing to real people who have a need that others in \nthe United States enjoy.\n  We are somewhat isolated in Alaska. We have four time zones down \nhere. We have three. I think we are about 5,000 miles from Washington, \nDC, to Alaska. The area of King Cove is about 1,700 miles from Seattle, \n632 miles west of Anchorage. In fact, it is interesting to note that it \nis twice as far from here to King Cove as it is from Tokyo to King \nCove. That gives you some idea of the isolation.\n  I have indicated that the weather conditions out there are such that \nwe have the uniqueness of wind sheer turbulence and what we call \nventuri wind conditions, which makes flying a real experience. When you \nadd this to the fact that it is a mountainous area with sharp valleys, \nyou find conditions for what we have had in a series of disasters. As I \nhave indicated, on that 3,300-foot runway you have wind blowing at \neither side.\n  You might say, ``Well, the Senator from Alaska is exaggerating. That \ncan't occur all the time.'' It occurs almost every day, Mr. President. \nIt can occur for days on end. It can occur for weeks on end. Sometimes \na week or 10 days will go by before they can get a flight in and out of \nKing Cove, if one can wait. This is simply an inconvenience which \nAlaskans accept, however, since the main livelihood of the Aleutian \npeople is derived from fishing in the treacherous seas of Bristol Bay.\n  Medical evacuations are a common occurrence. Surprisingly enough, \nthey happen twice as much in this community as any other place in \nAlaska. With only the help of midlevel practitioners, help in an \nemergency must be sought in other locations. This is not a concept that \nmany in this body are familiar with. We take for granted health care. \nIt is only a few steps away. Certainly this is the case where we are \nright now in most of our hometowns. But out in the Aleutian Chain, it \nis not that simple.\n  Let me interrupt for a moment to comment on a few things.\n  This is a sign that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife puts out as an \nadvisory. This is our Government speaking, not me. It says:\n\n       Visitors [to the area] should bring extra food and rain \n     gear should weather close in.\n\n  This is in the refuge advisory:\n\n       The refuge is famous for inclement weather, usually in the \n     form of wind, rain, and fog. Fog, drizzle, and overcast skies \n     are often succeeded by violent storms and bitter cold snaps \n     that slow down all activity. It is not unusual for an entire \n     year to go by with only a few days of clear skies.\n\n\n[[Page S11244]]\n\n\n  I don't know what that means to anybody. But it puts you on notice.\n  Let's see how residents of Arkansas and Montana access health care. I \nreadily admit I do not know all the specifics of health care in these \nstates, but I do know how to make up a chart. I do know how to make a \npoint.\n  Here are the major hospitals in Montana and their accessibility by \nState and Federal highways. The green lines are the U.S. interstate \nhighways, the red lines are the U.S. highways, and the black are the \nMontana State routes. Every place you see an ``H,'' you see a major \nhospital. Hopefully, I haven't missed any. But I am sure my friend from \nMontana would be happy to correct me if I have.\n  But the point is, the people of Montana have access to health care in \nan emergency.\n  Let's wander over to a Southern State. My friend from Arkansas and I \nhave had conversations about this. I know how he feels about equity.\n  Here are the major hospitals in Arkansas accessible by Federal \nhighway. I would be happy to show this a little closer if there is any \ndifficulty in seeing it. These are the hospitals in the State of \nArkansas on the road systems. There are 10 hospitals, I am told, in \nLittle Rock. The point is the residents in the State of Arkansas have \naccess by road to health care. Now, these are hospitals that have \nfacilities to take care of emergencies.\n  Let's look at Alaska when we talk about cases of dire emergencies. We \nhave Anchorage. Here is health care in Alaska. These are hospitals with \ncritical care units. We have one in Anchorage, AK, an area one-fifth \nthe size of the United States, and an area that has 33,000 miles of \ncoastline--a big hunk of real estate. The Senator from Texas is not \nhere so I won't comment that it is two-and-a-half times the size of \nTexas. I might lose his support.\n  This is our road system--a little bit on the Seward Peninsula around \nNome, Teller, a road from Prudhoe Bay down through Fairbanks, down to \nValdez, Anchorage, Homer, Kenai, a little bit of road in southeastern \nAlaska. Anchorage is our area of primary critical care. So when you \nhave a situation in a village out here at King Cove in the Aleutian \nIslands, you need access to it. You need access to an airport where you \ncan get an airplane, a jet airplane into Anchorage which is 600 miles \naway.\n  So things are not that simple in Alaska. They are tough. We have a \nfirst-rate Alaska Native hospital available to the Aleut residents of \nKing Cove in Anchorage, but it might as well be on the dark side of the \nMoon if you can't get there.\n  As I have indicated, we have had 11 air crash fatalities flying \nresidents out of King Cove, trying to get some of them to lifesaving \nmedical attention.\n  We talk a lot about telemedicine, and I am an avid supporter of \ntelemedicine. But the realities of telemedicine are that it depends on \nwhether you have adequate personnel where you need it to communicate \nthe symptoms and take action, and then if it is too bad you need more \nthan telemedicine. If it is bad, you need access.\n  How are you going to cross a bay that is uncrossable by boat in the \nwintertime because it is frozen or the storms are so great you can't \ncross it because of the high winds?\n  Well, let's talk about helicopters. I have nothing but the highest \nadmiration for our Coast Guard, National Guard and those courageous \npeople who are out there providing rescues, but there is some \nuniqueness associated with the Cold Bay area, and that is something \nthat the helicopters have a problem with, and that is extreme \nturbulence. The helicopters do very well in heavy winds, but it is the \nturbulence that creates problems. And it is important to note that \nthreatening conditions in King Cove arise at unknown times. Pregnant \nwomen in King Cove often leave the village 6 weeks before they are due \nin order to make sure they are able to be near medical facilities in \ncase complications arise.\n  A woman by the name of Carol Kenezuroff went into premature labor. \nShe was unable to fly out of King Cove due to weather conditions. She \ndecided to make the treacherous trip by boat. It took 2\\1/2\\ hours in \nan 80-foot crab boat. One hour into the trip Carol gave birth to a 2-\npound-3-ounce girl on the galley table of that crab boat in a 10-foot \nsea. The baby's name was Sirena. She lived only because someone on the \ncrab boat had presence of mind to make a makeshift incubator out of \naluminum foil and put it near the oil stove.\n  The story isn't over yet, Mr. President, because the mother had to be \noffloaded twice from the boat in a sling because her IV tubes had got \ncaught in the dock pilings of the unprotected harbor of Cold Bay. Do \nyou know of anybody who had that kind of situation?\n  Well, it happened in the State of Alaska. By the time the baby made \nit to Anchorage, it had already lost half its body weight and barely \nsurvived the ordeal.\n  This is the harsh reality of life in King Cove, but it does not have \nto be that harsh. There is a solution to assure safe travel and a \nsolution that is opposed by some of the special interest groups. I \nreally question their justification because you cannot say that this is \na road through the heart of the wilderness. This isn't a road through \nthe wilderness. We are doing a land exchange. It is a road through a \nrefuge, isn't it? It is a plus for the wilderness, isn't it, because we \nare adding 580 acres. This is a win-win-win, but the special interest \ngroups on the other side can't see it that way because they have gone \noff, in my opinion, the deep end and simply said, no, we are not going \nto allow this exchange--not because it is not good for the environment \nby adding 580 acres to the wilderness. I can only assume for one \nselfish reason, they have a cause that generates money and membership. \nBut I am not going to spend a lot of time on that.\n  The point is 30 miles as the crow flies from King Cove is the all-\nweather runway at Cold Bay, and all these people want is access to that \n10,400-foot runway where a Reeve Aleutian Island Jet 727-100 comes in \nevery day, except once last year when it could not get in because of \nweather conditions. And I might add, in deference, the only day they \ndon't fly is Sunday. But medevac aircraft from Anchorage can get in \nthere.\n  This road would total only about 29 miles. Now, remember, where would \nthe road be? Whose land would it be on? Well, here it is, the green \narea. It is on land owned by the King Cove Native Village Corporation. \nJust roughly 7 to 8 miles of the road would be in the massive 300,000 \nacre--there it is, 300,000 acres. Only if this bill passes, it is not \n300,000. It is 300,580 because we are adding to the wilderness. That is \nwhat makes this thing a win-win-win for the wilderness--only 7 miles--\nthis portion here--would not be in wilderness, but the refuge.\n  Again, I want to make it clear because those who don't want to \nunderstand it refuse to acknowledge we are not putting a road in a \nwilderness. We are doing what we have done hundreds of times before, a \nland exchange--allowing a road in the refuge where we have numerous \nroads in this country.\n  Now, because the 7 or 8 miles of the proposed right-of-way are \ncurrently located in the wilderness, I think it is pretty clear that is \nwhy some of the groups have opposed it. But what they fail to tell you \nagain--and I would emphasize, and I hate to be repetitive--this area \nalready has 42 miles of existing road.\n  Of that 42 miles of existing road--and I want to bring that chart \nback up again, because I want to make this point--of the 42 miles of \nexisting roads, we already have 12 or 14 that are already in the \nwilderness. You can drive on them. Take a 4x4--that is a 4-wheel-drive \nvehicle, all-terrain--and wander out in them anytime you want. Mr. \nPresident, 13.7 miles, to be exact, of road, are already in the \nwilderness. You can go out and drive on it, and I am going to be \ndriving on it over Columbus Day.\n  What they fail to tell you is that this is a 60-foot, if that--a \ngravel road, not a highway. Let us show the picture again of what we \nare talking about. The Senator from Montana showed a highway the other \nday when he brought this matter up. ``This is what we are going to \nbuild. We are going to build a highway.'' Come on, let's quit kidding \neach other and the American public. And I might add, we are not asking \na red cent from the taxpayer.\n  This is the kind of road it is. That is what it is. That is all it \nis. There is no\n\n[[Page S11245]]\n\nMcDonald's on it, no supermarkets. A plain old road. We still have \nthose in Alaska--plain old roads, nothing fancy. A grader might go over \nit once a year. To suggest that somehow the snow is going to stop a 4-\nwheel drive from going on a bad day? Let me tell you, when it is \nturbulent, the airplanes don't fly but the cars creep along the little \nold road very nicely.\n  You say there are going to be avalanches. Does it look like avalanche \ncountry to you? There are a few areas on the other side where there are \nsome hills, but there is not going to be an avalanche. ``You will have \nsnowdrifts.'' You do not have a lot of snow out there. You have blowing \nsnow and winds, but the roads that are there now, the 47 miles of road, \nare open virtually all winter. You do not have a situation where you \nhave, like Valdez, AK, where you have 25 or 30 feet of snow. That does \nnot occur. This is a maritime climate but it is tough on wind. So to \nsuggest a road will not work is unrealistic, because the roads that are \nthere do work. Mr. President, 130 people in Cold Bay traverse on them, \nas they keep the airport open year around in Cold Bay.\n  I was using 580 acres, and I was wrong. This exchange adds 664 acres \nto the wilderness. The Native people are giving up their private land \nin return for access through a refuge. It is a win-win-win for the \nwilderness and the environmentalists, if they can just figure it out. \nAgain, this substitute that I offer would adjust the boundary to \ninclude 664 acres of the private King Cove Native lands, and it would \nremove 85 acres from the wilderness in the exchange for the 7 miles of \nroad.\n  One other thing here, lest we forget--the ``great white father.'' The \n``great white father'' of public lands, in our State, is the Secretary \nof the Interior. He controls utilization. And we propose that for this \nsection, this section specifically, if it is authorized and someday \nbuilt, that the Secretary would have the ability to regulate the use of \nthe road during migratory periods. How much more authority? If the \nconcern is migration, OK, there is a concern. If you have concern about \nmigration, don't allow hunting in the area. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService allows hunting. We obey the rules and they allow it out there.\n  One of the most significant areas in Alaska is Cordova. You have the \nflats of Cordova; you have a road that runs out to the Cordova River, \nright through the flats. It is a huge nesting area with many endangered \nspecies and an airport in the middle of it, and there is no problem at \nall. Do you ever see any geese on the golf courses around here? They \neven allow hunting on the golf course, they have so many geese. To \nsuggest this is going to be detrimental to the migratory bird pattern \nis absolutely ridiculous. There is no justification for that at all, \nbecause the roads are already there. There is so little traffic on \nthem. There is not likely to be a mass movement from Washington, DC, to \nKing Cove or Cold Bay. Believe me.\n  This is a Native area, and the Native population have had the ability \nto generate a little activity with their little cannery and their \nlittle cold storage plant. But what they have not been able to do is to \ngenerate any interest in the Congress of the United States supporting a \nlittle land exchange so they can enjoy access to a road. They are \nprepared to take care of themselves, if they can simply have access to \ntheir airport.\n  Let's talk about precedent one more time, because I am sure the \nopponents will say, ``Oh, you are setting a precedent. You are setting \na precedent.''\n  First of all, I thank those Members who were willing to see the \npeople of King Cove during their visits here in Washington, DC, the \nAleut people themselves, because they can express their desires and \npositions much better than I can.\n  I would like to recognize here an old friend who just snuck into the \nChamber, who shall remain nameless; is that fair enough? Thanks, Bob.\n  Speaking of precedents, rather than Presidents--which we almost had \nhere, but I am getting off the subject so I better get back to the \nbusiness at hand--I think many of my colleagues have been wrongfully \nled to believe this provision which we propose would set a precedent in \nsetting or allowing roads to be built through wilderness areas.\n  As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I can \nassure you, this is absolutely false. There is no precedent to be set \nby this provision. First, plainly and simply, this provision does not \nauthorize construction of a road or authorize construction of a road in \na wilderness. One more time: It simply adjusts the wilderness boundary, \nand that adds 664 acres of private land, private Native land, in \nexchange for withdrawing 85 acres that will be used for a road corridor \nand a refuge. None of the corridor will be in a refuge portion. It will \nbe in the wilderness portion of the refuge.\n  I want to get to the point. Wilderness boundary adjustments are \ncommonplace. They are done for numerous reasons. Last year I was \ninstrumental in passing the Presidio legislation, which included, among \nother things, wilderness boundary adjustments. In one wilderness area \nwe withdrew 73,000 acres of wilderness and added back 56,000 acres, for \na net loss to the wilderness of 17,000 acres. That was in the Anaktuvuk \nPass.\n  Prior to that, Congress--and I think my colleague from Montana will \nnote--deleted 28 acres from the U.L. Bend Wilderness Area in the State \nof Montana to allow for access, to allow for access through a wildlife \nrefuge wilderness area. What for? To a fishing area near Fort Peck \nReservoir. In other words, to a fishing hole.\n  I am not complaining. I figure the folks in Montana know what is best \nfor them and the Senators from Montana know what is best for their \ncitizens. That is why I am kind of amused that this body has denigrated \nitself, if you will, to a situation where--you know, it used to be the \nSenators from the State knew what was good for their State and they \nwere going to be judged by their constituents and held accountable. But \nwe have moved away from that now because of the special interest \ngroups, and we have Members who have never been to my State dictating \nthe terms and conditions under which my people have to live. They \nresent that, and so do I, because they do not know what the people who \nare living there are really experiencing because they have not \nexperienced it. The constituents in Arkansas and Montana have not \nexperienced it, but I have. I can tell you, it is real.\n  We have had examples where Congress has created roads in wilderness \nareas. In fact, when the Izembek Refuge Wilderness Area was created in \n1980, it was created with existing roads in the wilderness.\n  I don't raise these examples to advocate that wilderness boundaries \nshould be subjected to change at whim. I am not doing that. What we are \nproposing is a net increase of nearly 600 acres of wilderness. If we \nhave changed wilderness boundaries for such things as access to a \nrecreation area or, in the case of Montana, to a fishing hole, then I \ncan't understand why in the world it is not appropriate to change a \nwilderness boundary into a refuge to save lives. It is pretty basic, \nMr. President. There is no truth to the claim that this is precedent \nsetting.\n  Some people question why this right-of-way needs to be granted now \nwhen the State is currently undergoing a process to determine a \npreferred alternative between improved air safety, ground \ntransportation, whatever. Why is the right-of-way needed if it is not \nyet known that this will be the State's preferred alternative? These \nare valid questions. They deserve a valid response.\n  First, one has to understand this issue is not new. A road connecting \nKing Cove and Cold Bay was recommended in the preferred alternative of \nthe 1985 Bristol Bay management plan done cooperatively with the State \nand Federal Government.\n  Second, in 1995, ground transportation between these two communities \nwas listed as the State's third highest priority project for rural \nAlaska by the current Governor.\n  If you look at the map that shows the health care areas in the \nState--I want you to look at that a little bit more because it shows \nthe road system in the State. We don't have roads in the State. We are \nthe new kid on the block. We have been a State since 1959--39 years \nago. That is what we have. Look at Arkansas and look at Montana. We are \nnot asking for an awful lot here. In fact, it is a bit embarrassing for \nme to have to come and plead for the lives of the people in this \nvillage.\n\n[[Page S11246]]\n\n  That is our road system, Mr. President, an area one-fifth the size of \nthe United States, an area that, if superimposed on a map of the United \nStates, superimposed in a comparative dimension, goes from Mexico, to \nCanada, to Florida, to California, with the extension of these Aleutian \nIslands. It is a big piece of real estate. I find it difficult to have \nto beg, if you will, for consideration here, but I guess that is what I \nam doing. For a people who have occupied this area for 5,000 years and \nhave looked at every option, it makes sense to have a ground link. \nThese people have lived, have survived a lot longer than you and I. \nThey fish the waters and hunt the land. Sometimes they fly the skies, \nand sometimes they die.\n  It is interesting to note, too--I will point out on one of the maps \nof the Cold Bay area--that they have traversed this area through this \nso-called wilderness on foot trapping in the wintertime and hunting. \nThis is nothing new, and they are still doing it. But these are the \npeople who have the most at stake in protecting the region's resources. \nThink about that. These are the residents--they are subsistence people, \nto a degree. They know how to protect the fish, the game, the geese, \nthe endangered species.\n  The problem with the bureaucracy is this thing can crawl on --do more \nstudies. But the people want some assurance at the end of this process. \nWithout the legislation before us, there is no end in sight, because \nwhat this legislation does is it simply authorizes a land exchange. \nThat is all it does.\n  In testimony before Congress, the Fish and Wildlife Service was asked \nthe question: If through this comprehensive study that is underway the \npreferred alternative is, indeed, a road link, would they support it? \nThey simply said no. They didn't give a reason; they just said no. They \ndidn't acknowledge there were roads already in the wilderness.\n  By granting the right-of-way now, a road link will remain a viable \nalternative. It will give the State the option. Why shouldn't the State \nhave the option for Heaven's sake? It is our State. By granting this \nright-of-way now, a road to safety, what we are doing is appropriate \nand timely, and I guess tardy in some respects, and providing an \nopportunity for the people of King Cove to have access.\n  I promised to comment, since we are not limited to time currently, on \na couple of other options because I know these are going to come up in \nthe debate. I know that others will insist there be other ways to \nresolve the problems of King Cove without granting ground access. We \nhave already talked about telemedicine. I know that the people of King \nCove welcome the technology and the advancements telemedicine is going \nto add, but it is not the solution. Telemedicine is a diagnostic tool. \nWe may be in a better position to diagnose a heart attack or a partial \namputation, but we will be no better off to treat it without the \nability to safely transport people to modern medical facilities.\n  Our largest hospital, Providence Hospital, in Anchorage stated it \nbest recently when referring to telemedicine:\n\n       It will be especially helpful in providing better \n     consultations to enhance a provider's knowledge and help her \n     or him make a better decision about transport. However, it \n     will never, ever eliminate the need for emergency transport \n     to an acute care facility, and that is what the road between \n     King Cove and Cold Bay is all about.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Providence Hospital be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Providence Hospital,\n\n\n                                                Anchorage, AK,\n\n                                                   August 3, 1998.\n     The value of telemedicine in the Aleutians and its \n           limitations.\n\n     Robert Juettner,\n     Aleutians East Borough, Anchorage, AK.\n       The Aleutian Chain is without a doubt one of the most \n     difficult places on earth to provide quality healthcare for \n     several reasons.\n       Weather is a primary factor. Transportation in emergencies \n     can be terrifying and deadly. Many lives have been lost in \n     the attempt, both patient and providers working on evacuation \n     teams. Patients lose critical time awaiting transport to \n     acute care facilities while waiting for the weather to \n     change. And providers can't get out for respite or continuing \n     education, both of which are critical for maintaining quality \n     of care and quality of life. Within the next five years, \n     trauma consults will improve in Alaska and in this region in \n     particular, but it will never completely replace transport to \n     acute care facilities when needed.\n       Distance between communities dwarfs many states in the \n     lower 48 and telecommunications are often sketchy. A wise \n     person once said, ``If a successful fax transmission is a \n     blessing, then successful telemedicine transmissions could be \n     a miracle!'' We are working on this through expanded \n     bandwidth and improved technology.\n       The Aleutians represent a unique opportunity to develop \n     telemedicine and telehealth applications that would truly \n     enhance service in these under-served communities. It will be \n     especially helpful in providing better consultations to \n     enhance a provider's knowledge and help her make a better \n     decision about transport. However, it will never eliminate \n     the need for emergency transport to an acute care facility \n     and that is what the road between King Cove and Cold Bay is \n     all about.\n       Providence Health System in Alaska currently provides \n     teleradiology services to Dutch Harbor. Plans include \n     education, telehealth services such as conferencing through \n     email, alliance support and peer-to-peer communications \n     within the region. The system will carry data, voice and \n     images. This is called store-and-forward communications. \n     Communications may include real-time chats. Services will \n     provide some intercession; some better judgement calls and \n     decisions; improve isolation issues and enhance education.\n       The system will not carry a human body that needs advanced \n     medical care. It may help cut the numbers of evacuations \n     through better diagnosis and consultation. It will enhance \n     medical care to this region. It will not remove the need for \n     treacherous evacuations that so often take place from King \n     Cove.\n       The Providence Telemedicine Network is designed to be an \n     integral part of a regional healtcare plan. It will help \n     improve the emergency medical network over time with \n     relatively little investment by those involved. Use of \n     consistent emergency protocols means only patients requiring \n     tertiary care will be transported. Outcomes will be improved \n     care and reductions in transports. It will not eliminate \n     transport.\n       For these reasons, we support the road between King Cove \n     and Cold Bay and we support the use of telemedicine \n     throughout the region.\n     Kathe Boucha-Roberts,\n       Director of Alliances and Telemedicine.\n     Destyne E. Taft,\n       Telehealth Network Coordinator.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, some others argue that the building of \na health clinic is the answer. Incidentally, I understand my good \nfriend, Dr. Frist, will advise us later on the aspects of telemedicine, \nwhat you can and can't do. I am most appreciative of that. Still, \nothers argue building a health care center is the answer. The answer, \nagain, is it helps; we have a little bit of it there, but without a \nproper cardiac unit or prenatal unit, the people will still need \ntransportation to other locations outside of King Cove in times of \nemergency.\n  We are going to hear a lot of talk about helicopters. You are going \nto hear a lot of talk about helicopters from people who have never been \nin a helicopter when the wind is blowing 60 miles an hour, or have \nnever been in a helicopter in severe turbulence. But I have, but not as \nmuch as the people I am going to talk about.\n  The Secretary of the Interior says, ``Well, just use a helicopter.'' \nLet me show the map of Alaska, again, because the nearest helicopter is \nin Kodiak. There is nothing wrong with the aspects of that, other than \nKodiak is 300 miles away. Here is Kodiak Island right here. We are 300 \nmiles away in King Cove. This would be like telling the residents of \nWashington, DC, that their trip to safety will be provided by a \nhelicopter that comes from Waterbury, CT. How is that? Or any other \narea that you care to pick.\n  Even if a Coast Guard helicopter was stationed nearer to King Cove, \nwhere are you going to put it? There is not much out there in the \nAleutian Islands. It is kind of tough to place the lives of Coast Guard \npersonnel in danger when there are other alternatives.\n  Let's flip this around. They say that there are alternatives and the \nhelicopter is another alternative. The helicopter folks say, a \nhelicopter is fine, but there are other alternatives and one is a road.\n  Helicopters do not always work, for several reasons. First and \nforemost, they are not designed to handle severe turbulence. That is \npart of the daily life in King Cove. And any good helicopter pilot will \ntell you that the wind is not the issue, the turbulence is. The wind \ndid not cause 11 deaths. It was the turbulence that caused the deaths.\n\n[[Page S11247]]\n\nThat is what brought the aircraft down.\n  Second, we have done a little investigation working with the Coast \nGuard, who have been very responsive. The Coast Guard pilots are \ntrained for maritime missions flying over water, not flying over \nmountainous terrain--not that they cannot do it, that is just not part \nof their training.\n  Third, do we really want to change the mission of the Coast Guard to \nhandle land-side medevacs when other alternatives such as one simple \ngravel road exists? I can assure you, Mr. President, the Coast Guard \ndoes not support such a change. Recently the admiral told me so. And I \nwill quote his letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     Department of Transportation,\n\n\n                                             U.S. Coast Guard,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1998.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your letter of \n     July 21, 1998, in which you requested answers to the \n     following questions regarding the capabilities of the H-60 \n     helicopters stationed at Kodiak.\n       ``What are the operational minimums of the H-60 helicopters \n     stationed in Kodiak in terms of weather, visibility, and \n     such?'' Although Coast Guard aircraft routinely fly missions \n     in extremely challenging weather conditions, they are subject \n     to certain operational limitations. The pertinent operational \n     limitations of the H-60 helicopter include the following: \n     minimum take-off visibility of one-quarter statute miles for \n     search and rescue missions and 60 knots of wind for aircraft \n     startup.\n       ``Is the H-60 an efficient helicopter in mountainous \n     terrain with extreme turbulence?'' The Coast Guard's H-60 \n     helicopters are optimized for low level flight in the \n     maritime environment. As such, they are required to avoid \n     areas of moderate turbulence or greater.\n       ``Do Coast Guard pilots receive flight training for land-\n     based missions in mountainous terrain?'' Coast Guard pilots \n     do not receive any formal mountainous terrain flight \n     instruction, although some units operating in higher \n     elevations have developed in-house briefings to remind their \n     pilots of the inherent dangers of flying in mountainous \n     areas.\n       ``Are shore-side civilian medical evacuations part of the \n     statutory authority and/or primary mission of the Coast \n     Guard?'' Shore-side civilian medical evacuations are the \n     statutory responsibility of the National Highway Traffic and \n     Safety Administration. Although not a primary mission of the \n     Coast Guard, we sometimes become involved in these types of \n     missions when assets are available and our assistance is \n     requested by an appropriate organization.\n       ``If a Coast Guard helicopter was on a maritime mission and \n     a medical evacuation at King Cove was required, would it \n     abort the maritime mission?'' The decision to divert from a \n     maritime mission to a shore-side medical evacuations must be \n     made on a case-by-case basis, considering both the severity \n     of the shore-side medical condition and the nature of the \n     maritime mission.\n       ``To what types of medivacs would the Coast Guard respond? \n     Would a compound fracture of a arm warrant a Coast Guard \n     response?'' When the Coast Guard receives a request for a \n     medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), flight surgeon is consulted to \n     determine if a MEDIEVAC is necessary based on the patient's \n     condition.\n       Typically, conditions threatening loss of life or limb \n     would warrant a MEDEVAC. Although a compound fracture to the \n     arm would not normally justify a MEDEVAC, there may be \n     situations where a MEDEVAC is authorized based on the \n     severity of the injury, or the potential for additional \n     injury.\n       You also asked whether the Coast Guard would support a \n     legislative change to require us to do shore-side medical \n     evacuations. The Coast Guard could not support such a \n     legislative change. The Coast Guard is a sea going service. \n     Our personnel are trained and equipped to operate in the \n     maritime environment, which poses very different challenges \n     from those faced by shore-side responders. For the Coast \n     Guard to take on the additional responsibility of responding \n     to shore-side medical evacuation would require a fundamental \n     change in the way we do business, a substantial increase in \n     funding, and complete reevaluation of our asset siting.\n       In summation, although the Coast Guard is more than happy \n     to respond to shore-side medical emergencies as time and \n     resources permit, we cannot and should not be seen as the \n     primary responder to these types of incidents.\n       We hope the above information is helpful. We appreciate \n     your continued interest and support of the Coast Guard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James M. Loy,\n                            Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, Commandant.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This is a quote:\n\n       The Coast Guard is a sea going service. Our personnel are \n     trained and equipped to operate in the maritime environment, \n     which poses very different challenges from those faced by \n     shore-side responders.

I served in the U.S. Coast \nGuard. I am very proud of that body and proud of the time that I served \nour country.\n  Men like Kevin M. McKracken from Springfield, OR, 25 years old; \nWilliam Gregory Kemp, 27, of Docena, AL; David Rockmore, 52, of \nCambridge, PA; Ralph King, 24, of Arden, NC; Michael C. Dollahite, 38, \nof El Paso, TX; and Robert L. Carson, Jr., 38, of Bostic, NC, all of \nwhom perished, they all died, Mr. President, in a Coast Guard \nhelicopter crash during an attempted medevac rescue on Ugak Island in \nAlaska. They crashed, Mr. President.\n  That is the harsh reality of the danger of those who are prepared to \ngive so much for the benefit of others. You are not just talking about \nsending a helicopter willy-nilly 300 miles, you are talking about a \ntough set of facts here, Mr. President.\n  I have had discussions with the Secretary of the Interior. He may be \nwilling to generalize on the issue of danger and the fact that the \nhelicopter is an answer. But, you know, where do you get the \nappropriations for a helicopter--you have to have two crews, you have \nto have hangars; you have a population of 700 people here--when you \nhave an alternative, a simple gravel road? That is all we are asking \nfor. And you can debate whether we are wrong or right; we will take our \nchances.\n  Let's talk about a sea link. That is interesting. You still have a \npopulation of 700 people. It would require a tremendous infrastructure. \nFor example, you would need a 150-foot-long vessel to operate in the \nrough seas, probably have to have some kind of an ice-breaking \ncapability, have to have dock facilities constructed at both King Cove \nand Cold Bay, breakwaters requiring more than--well, it is estimated it \nwould take more than 67,000 feet of fill that would have to be \nconstructed in King Cove and Cold Bay. Roads would have to be \nconstructed to access boat docks.\n  And even if all this were done, sick and injured people would have a \nminimum of a 2-and-a-half-hour, maybe 3-hour, trip in the treacherous \nseas. Let me show you a few pictures of what these seas look like. And \nit would still not be as reliable or as fast as a simple alternative of \na one-lane gravel road. How many cars do you think you are going to \nhave out of a population of 700 people in an isolated area going over \nthat road a day? Three? Four? I do not know. Hardly enough. That is \nwhat you are looking at.\n  How would you like to take a ride on that? I can tell you, 90 percent \nof the people in this body would be hanging over the side, deathly \nseasick. They would hope the boat would roll over and sink. But that is \nthe access that we have. And this is what is proposed to be some kind \nof a sea link at a cost--who knows what it costs.\n  We have had long debates in this body over the years about access to \nhealth care, haven't we? Nowhere does this take on a more dramatic \nmeaning than King Cove. And when I say ``access,'' this means the \nactual physical ability to get to a hospital in a hurry, whether it be \nAnchorage or Seattle, WA, to get specialized health care needed in the \nevent of a serious emergency or sickness. Right now, the residents of \nKing Cove simply do not have that access.\n  We have had other debates about access across public lands. And I \nalways go back to a conversation I had with the Secretary of the \nInterior, Secretary Babbitt. He said, ``If you folks have a need, show \nme an area where you need access across Federal lands, and I'll work \nwith you.'' I cannot think of a greater need or an area that is more \neasily identifiable where we need access across Federal lands. And I \nwould encourage him to reconsider.\n  I believe that we have shown in this case we have a need. For some \nreason or other, those in the administration do not seem to support our \nplea that this is a matter of life and death to our constituents as \nwell as American citizens. I find it terribly disturbing that\n\n[[Page S11248]]\n\nwhere human life and safety issues are at stake, we see such an \norchestrated effort to distort the facts by well-meaning people \nfronting for special interest groups, most of which do not give a darn \nabout the people in King Cove or their plight, that through some \nidealistic interpretation they have taken this on as a cause. They fail \nto recognize what a gravel road is, fail to recognize we are not \nsetting a precedent, fail to recognize we are not putting a road \nthrough a wilderness.\n  It is amazing, when you think about it. Here is the health and safety \nof my constituents. And I am not going to stand by, and let some of \nthese special interest groups control the agenda, and ignore the \nviability of what we are proposing--no Federal funding, simply a land \nexchange. I do not believe any Member of this body would stand by and \nlet their constituents face such conditions.\n  When we think about it, what does wilderness connote? Safety. \nWilderness connotes refuge. So in making every effort to protect the \nenvironment and the surrounding ecosystem in King Cove, Congress \nunintentionally endangered the lives of those living in King Cove when \nit created the wilderness area.\n  So, what we are doing in Senate bill 1092, with my amendment, is \nrighting a wrong by authorizing the one thing that we all take for \ngranted when we are injured or when we want access, and that is a road. \nWe do not want a paved highway, we want a little gravel road--that is \nit--a road to safety, Mr. President, a road to life.\n  Fourteen people have died. You know why they have died? Because there \nhas not been a road. Fourteen people in the community of 700, 710 \npeople. These are Aleuts. They have been there for 5,000 years. How \nmany more lives are we going to be sacrificing for the bureaucracy to \nstudy alternatives until they can be provided with the access they so \nrightly deserve?\n  They have paid for this access, Mr. President, in blood. And this is \nan access that you and I take for granted daily. The designation of \n``wilderness'' was never meant to prevent people from safe access to \nmedical care, and I think we would all agree it would be absurd to \nargue otherwise.\n  My constituents, your friends, some of the people that you have all \nmet with, the Aleut people who visited in Washington, DC, I think \ndeserve an opportunity to save their lives in times of emergencies. \nThey should not be held hostage to fear for life and limb by an \nadministration or a Congress that somehow is carrying the water for \nsome of the righteous self-interest groups. This is the situation we \nhave.\n  In the end, those who vote with the people of King Cove may or may \nnot be on the winning side of this issue but they will certainly be on \nthe right side of the issue.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used about an hour.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding that there are 6 hours equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 hours remaining, yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I want to make one more point, and then I will yield \nto my colleagues who are in opposition.\n  I noted an article in The Hill, one of Capitol Hill's weekly papers, \non September 30. It amazes me because this is part of the problem we \nhave, the failure of those who are in opposition--in this case, a \nletter from a senior vice president of public policy of the National \nAudubon Society.\n  It is entitled ``Murkowski's Bond Proposal is a $30 Million \nBoondoggle.'' It is to the editor. He says that the proposed solution \nof ``a road to life,'' as this Senator suggests:\n\n       There is not a shred of evidence [in the writer's opinion] \n     that a road will provide reliable, safe, medical evacuation \n     in areas prone to avalanches, blizzards, white outs, dense \n     fog, and extreme air turbulence.\n\n  I answer, very simply, that the roads are there now. The roads are \npassable. You might have to slow down. This is not tremendous areas of \nconcentrated snowfall. The problem is extreme turbulence associated \nwith moving an aircraft through the skies during those terrible storms. \nSo the roads are there now.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       In fact, this single lane, 30-mile, $30 million gravel road \n     is a taxpayer and environmental boondoggle.\n\n  That is an outright lie. That is an outright lie. We are not asking \nfor $30 million. We are not asking for a red cent. This is how this \nissue is portrayed to the American public--``30-mile, $30 million \ngravel road is a taxpayer and environmental boondoggle.'' A cool $1 \nmillion per mile.\n  That road isn't costing $1 million per mile, and we are not asking \nfor Federal funds. They mischaracterize it. Why, Mr. President, can't \nwe have a debate on the merits without misleading the people?\n  Talk about the bird habitat--I appreciate and am sensitive to it. \nThis road is not going to interfere with that anymore than we have seen \nroads in Cordovo or roads in Juneau interfere. The fact is that we are \nonly talking about a population of 700, and the roads already exist in \nthe wilderness.\n  He suggests an all-weather boat ambulance could effectively back up \nthis facility. I think you have seen the picture. You have seen, also, \nthe people who have perished. He talks about a ``life-saving boat'' \nplan as a solution. He doesn't mention the bay freezes.\n  Again, it is a case of somebody who has never been there, never \nexperienced the isolation, what it means to be without access. Clearly, \nthere is an alternative. We suggested it in this legislation.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to reflect on the appeal of the \npeople from King Cove who have come to their offices, to recognize, \nindeed, how they would respond if it were their constituents, and \nrecognize that there is a viable alternative here, and that is a simple \nroad which is a win-win-win--the environmental communities and the \nwilderness--because we are adding 580 acres to the wilderness and we \nare not putting a road through the wilderness. We are doing a land \nexchange and putting that road through a refuge.\n  It will be my intent to talk a bit more a little later, because I am \nsure some of my friends may have some questions or I may have a \nrebuttal. With that, I thank the Chair for the attention. In deference \nto my colleague, I recognize we had conversations relative to the \nmerits of this and I know, obviously, there is pressure by the \nadministration on this particular issue. I take that in the spirit \nunder which it is going to be communicated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the Senator from Montana such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I begin by first thanking my good friend \nfrom Alaska for bringing this up as a freestanding bill. One of the \nobjections I had earlier with some of the riders in the Interior \nappropriations bill first on the merits of those provisions of the bill \nwhich I think in many cases were ill-advised.\n  A second objection I had to the riders were just that, they were \nriders on an appropriations bill; that is, measures which have very \nsignificant public policy implications and very significantly affect \nour country, many of which had no hearings. It is true one or two may \nhave had hearings, but, by and large, the riders did not have hearings. \nHere we are, taking them up and passing them without an adequate \nopportunity for debate.\n  The American people, rightfully, get a little upset when Congress \ndoes not in the full light of day debate the pros and cons of issues, \nand fully air these issues. They don't like it when riders are slipped \ninto an appropriations bill. I might add, there will be a lot more \nslipped in before this Congress adjourns in the next 10 days.\n  I very much thank my good friend from Alaska for bringing this up as \na freestanding bill. That is what we are supposed to be doing here, \ndebating issues, what the pros might be, what the cons might be, and \nhave a debate and see what makes sense and then vote. That is the \nlegislative process, the way it is supposed to work, and certainly the \nway the American people would like it to work in our democratic form of \ngovernment.\n  Senator, I thank you very much. I want you to know that I very much \nappreciate your bringing this bill up as a freestanding bill. That is \ngood. I wish, frankly, that the other riders in the appropriations bill \nwould be brought up in the same manner.\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\n  I might say at this point those who are opposed to the riders have \nnot had an opportunity to move to delete them. That is because the \nappropriations bill has been withdrawn. It is no longer under \nconsideration before the Senate. So at least we have an opportunity to \ndebate one of those provisions, and that is the Izembek Wilderness \nissue of the King Cove--Cold Bay matter. I thank the Senator for doing \nthat.\n  Turning to the merits, on the surface, the argument of the good \nSenator from Alaska makes some sense. It has some merit. After all, we \nare talking about two very remote rural communities, Cold Bay and King \nCove. They are not very far apart in miles, but they are quite far \napart in terms of weather. There is a big bay between the two. They are \ndifferent also because of the weather. When people are injured in King \nCove, sometimes they may need to get to a hospital up in Cold Bay. It \nis very understandable. I appreciate that.\n  In my State of Montana, we face the same problem. Very often in rural \nparts of my State people want access to medical care. They don't have \ngood access. I might remind my good friend from Alaska he and I \ncosponsored a bill to grant telemedicine capability to rural States. In \nfact, we have both stated that Montana and Alaska desperately need \nbetter rural health care access. We have the same problem Alaska does.\n\n  We also have crashes of medevac helicopters in Montana, just like the \nSenator from Alaska referred to in his State. We have mountains. Health \ncare access is very important. I deeply sympathize with people in King \nCove, as well as those in Cold Bay--particularly those in King Cove, \nwho need access to health care. As I understand it, 11 people have died \nin plane crashes in the general area. In one case, four people were \nkilled in one emergency medical evacuation. The other people lost their \nlives due to reasons other than medical evacuation.\n  We have the same problems in my State. Many times, in Montana--and I \nam sure this would be true with respect to the proposed road, and it is \ntrue in Alaska where there are roads--the snow drifts. In the State of \nMontana, we don't get a lot of snow, believe it or not, Mr. President. \nThere is a general myth in the country that, in Montana, it is cold and \nwe get all kinds of snow. Our average precipitation, including rainfall \nand snow, is about 14, 15, 16 inches a year. We don't get a lot of \nsnow.\n  We are not like Buffalo, or like the snowbelt up in northern New \nYork. We don't get a lot of snow. But when it does snow, it very often \nblows and drifts, as I am sure is the case in the State of Alaska. It \nis those drifts that stop the traffic, that cause people in smaller \ncommunities great difficulty in getting to a hospital. For that reason, \nwe have a lot of medical assistance facilities around the State. They \nare small facilities to help people get better health care when they \ncannot immediately get to a hospital because they are so far away, \nbecause of bad weather, or whatever the cause.\n  Sometimes we try helicopters and the medevac, but often in bad \nweather that is dangerous; it is not always a sure thing. We are also \nadding a lot of telemedicine, as many States are, for rural areas. \nTelemedicine has a very significant role in helping to provide better \nhealth care to our rural communities. Is it the sole answer? No, by no \nstretch of the imagination. But more and better telemedicine will \nprovide better health care to a lot of areas.\n  So I want to say to the Senator that I do sympathize with the need \nfor health care in rural areas. It is a problem. But we have to ask \nourselves, as almost always is the case, what is the best way to get \nhealth care to rural areas?\n  In the first place, it is not clear that the road is the only option \nfor providing better health care to the residents in King Cove, or even \nthe best option for providing medical emergency services.\n  A few years ago, the State of Alaska began a comprehensive study of \ntransportation between King Cove and Cold Bay. It was a major study. \nThat study is now examining three major alternatives to tie the two \nareas together. One is improved air transport. Another is better marine \nfacilities. The third is a road. I have a copy of it here. It is the \nKing Cove/Cold Bay Transportation Improvement Assessment, prepared by \nan Alaskan company in Anchorage in cooperation with Northern Economics, \nAnchorage, AK, dated November 1997. This is a draft assessment of \ntransportation needs conducted by the State of Alaska, to determine \nbetter access to rural areas in Alaska.\n  When it comes to emergency medical transportation, I must say that \neven this preliminary study shows that there is no single silver \nbullet. There is no panacea that is going to solve the problem the \nSenator addresses. After all, bad weather is bad weather--whether it is \nhigh winds blowing to make air transportation difficult, or whether it \nis wind blowing snowdrifts over a road. And I must say, many days of \nthe year on this proposed stretch that we are talking about here, it \nmay be impassable; there are snowdrifts. Sure, we have to get more \nhighway equipment out there to open up the roads in the winter. \nSometimes that can be done quickly, but sometimes not. An emergency is \nan emergency.\n  Many times, in my State, roads have been impassable for long \nstretches of time--close to a day--because of snowdrifts. I would guess \nthat the same could probably happen along the road we are talking about \nhere. Indeed, if you talk to residents who live in the area and who \nhave written letters opposing this proposed road, that is just what \nthey say. It is very hard during certain times of the year to get a \nroad open because of drifting snow. I have a letter here.\n  (Mr. ROBERTS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my friend will yield for a question on the \nsnow.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. When I finish this letter. This is a letter from a \nresident of Cold Bay. She says: ``As a lifelong resident of this area, \nI have some great concerns with the proposed legislation . . .'' She \ntalks about the 25 mile proposed road. ``When we are having inclement \nweather, are we to believe a vehicle could drive 27 miles in whiteout \nconditions, drifting snow, and winds?'' She says that she lived 3\\1/2\\ \nmiles out of the town of Cold Bay for 4 years with so-called ``road \naccess'' to Cold Bay. During the winter, she says she spent many months \nstranded at home, or in town, depending upon where she was when the \nstorm came. She says that the drifting snow would be so bad that it \nwould take days--that is probably a slight exaggeration--to get the 3.2 \nmiles plowed enough to be passable.\n  That is not the only letter we have received. Here are some more \nletters from citizens from Cold Bay, AK. They say that in poor weather \nconditions, such as blowing snow and freezing rain, road travel becomes \nequally treacherous. On the Alaska peninsula they could only make the \nroad passable seasonably. That is their view, and they live there. They \ntalk about an alternative, which is mentioned in the Alaska report--a \nsmall ferry system--and improving the dock facility at Cold Bay. They \ngo on to say that this has been studied for a while, and with state-of-\nthe-art navigational aids, marine transport is probably more reliable. \nI might say, that is probably true in one respect. That is because, \nactually, the weather in the bay is not as locked up with ice or as \ncold as we might be led to believe. I will get to that in just a \nsecond.\n  I have now a letter from a doctor. He comments on the road \nalternative. He is commenting from the point of view of medical \nservices in King Cove. Basically, he says that while flying is \nobviously potentially hazardous, the proposed road in an Aleutian storm \nor blizzard could be equally hazardous when one considers nearly zero \nvisibility, the absence of other traffic, the long distance through \nvery isolated country and, of course, the ever-present winter danger of \navalanches.\n  He went on to say that he is strongly recommending several measures \nwhich would result in a marked decrease in the number of medevacs. What \nhe thinks would be more reliable in the event of emergencies \nnecessitating medevac would be, foremost, the implementation of state-\nof-the-art telemedicine. He goes on to say that another option that \nwould circumvent the hazard of avalanches and of isolated highway \ntransportation would be a state-of-the-art ferry system.\n  That is just one view of one doctor who lives in Alaska. I am not \nsaying it\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\nis conclusive or determinative, but it is a view of a doctor in Alaska.\n  I think we all agree telemedicine helps. I think we all agree that \ntelemedicine is not the total solution. In fact, just in June of last \nyear, I was very proud to have had the Senator from Alaska join me when \nwe introduced the Rural Telemedicine Demonstration Act. We want HCFA to \nspend up to $2 million, if we can find the funds, for computer-assisted \nmedical information for Alaska and Montana, two rural States that \ncontain most of the remote and frontier health care locations. Senator \nMurkowski says that telemedicine has already proven to be cost \neffective and a practical answer to the Alaska dilemma of how to \nprovide modern health care in a vast geographical area, an area \ncompletely unconnected by roads and with access only by airplane, \nsnowmobile, or dogsled.\n  Telemedicine is helpful. It is not the total solution, by any stretch \nof the imagination, but it is very helpful. There is no single bullet. \nThere are problems with all forms of health care assistance in very \nremote rural areas.\n  The State of Alaska, I might say, is studying different options right \nnow. They have not reached a conclusion as to what the best option \nwould be between King Cove and Cold Bay. One option is Coast Guard air \nevacuation helicopter. Helicopters work sometimes; they don't work \nsometimes; it depends upon the weather.\n  Another option is improved port facilities and special marine \nambulances. This doesn't always work, but it works very well sometimes. \nAnd another is telemedicine. We all know that advanced telemedicine is \ngoing to be quite helpful in more rural areas.\n  I want to underline that this study by the State of Alaska on what \nthe best transportation option would be between King Cove and Cold Bay \nis not complete. It is underway right now. The State of Alaska is \ntrying to determine, itself, what the best way would be to provide the \nbest access between those two communities. They are looking, obviously, \nat effectiveness. They are looking at cost. They are looking at the \nenvironmental impact.\n  You don't need to pass this bill before us to complete the evaluation \nprocess. You only need to pass the bill if you have already decided to \nbuild the road. But we should wait to see what the study says before we \ngo ahead and build this road.\n  In addition, there is another study going on to address this same \nproblem. In the transportation appropriations bill passed by this body, \nthe senior Senator from Alaska included a provision for another study \nof transportation access. This is a study that would be done by the \nArmy Corps of Engineers. The Senator from Alaska provided about \n$700,000 for a study by the Army Corps of Engineers to determine \ntransportation access needs and solutions in Alaska.\n  That means we have two studies going on. One is the State of Alaska \nstudy, and the other is the Army Corps of Engineers study. At the very \nleast, I think it is premature at this point to authorize a road. \nRather, we should wait and see what the studies come up with. \nOtherwise, I just think we are wasting taxpayers' money, particularly \nthe Army Corps of Engineers money, if we are going to decide what the \nsolution is in advance.\n  It reminds me of ``It's Your Money'' on TV. We spend $700,000, and \nthe State of Alaska spends State money, to study a solution. But, \nbefore the studies are done, the money is down the drain because \nCongress steps in and decides what the solution is going to be.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Sure.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to point out again, relative to the snow, \nthat the question was brought up by the Senator from Montana, \nsuggesting that because of his opinion on the amount of snowfall that \noccurs in Montana, we must have that same condition. But isn't it \nrather unusual, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in their notice of \nextreme weather, notes ``wind, rain, and fog, drizzle, overcast \nskies.'' Isn't it unusual that it would omit ``snow''? And in fact the \nreality is, there is very little snowfall in that area. I can't tell \nyou how many times--I am sure you have gone to the airport by car and \nfound out that the airport is closed and you had to drive someplace \nelse.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That has happened to me many times.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. You can't do that if you live in King Cove and Cold \nBay.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might answer the Senator's question, I am not saying \nthat, just because the roads in Montana are often impassable because of \nsnow, the same must be true around King Cove. I am saying that is the \nopinion of a good number of residents. That is what they say, that very \noften snow conditions make the roads impassable.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The U.S. Weather Bureau notes that Cold Bay is the \nthird most windy city in the United States; the third most rainy, with \n226 inches; and it is the cloudiest; and for 305 days a year it is \ncloudy in King Cove-Cold Bay.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to point out what the State \nof Alaska study is really all about.\n  I have here on this chart the basic purpose of the State of Alaska \nstudy--determining what the best solution would be in terms of access \nbetween King Cove and Cold Bay. Let me just show you what they are.\n  The first purpose of this study is to reduce the infrastructure \nmaintenance and operation burden. It doesn't say anything about medical \nneeds or medical safety.\n  The point here is that these are two separate communities, and some \nfolks in both those communities think that maybe they should combine \nschools and have one school instead of two. After all, there are about \n700 or 800 people in one community; that is, King Cove. There are about \n100 folks, as I understand it, up around Cold Bay. Why not? It makes \nsense to maybe have one school, and maybe the same health care \nfacility, and maybe share power generation or the public works \nfacility. The Alaska report says that this will reduce the cost of \nliving in these communities.\n  The first purpose of the study is to reduce the cost of living in \nKing Cove and Cold Bay. The second purpose is to improve safety and \nconvenience of travel between King Cove and Cold Bay. That is No. 2.\n  We talked a little bit about safety. You might note that point No. 2 \nsays convenience--not just medical safety, but also convenience.\n  The third purpose, I might add, Mr. President, is really the most \ninteresting. The third purpose is to strengthen regional economic \ndevelopment.\n  King Cove--that is on the lower part of the map--is a major hub of \nthe fishing industry. It has extensive fish processing facilities. But \nit doesn't have an airport capable of handling large cargo planes. Cold \nBay does. That is the big difference between the two. Cold Bay has no \ndeep-water ports. King Cove is just the opposite: deep water, no \nairport. Therefore, the construction of a road between King Cove and \nCold Bay would provide a significant economic benefit to the fishing \nindustry and to the local economy.\n  Let me read from the State of Alaska initial study:\n\n       A stronger, more reliable transportation link between the \n     two communities would facilitate the movement of fresh fish \n     between King Cove docks and the marketplace, allowing fresh \n     fish from the processing plants in King Cove to be on a plane \n     bound for anywhere in the world within hours.\n       The cost of shipping would decrease as would delays, \n     inconvenience and uncertainty caused by transportation modes \n     that are expensive, inconvenient and dangerous. This would \n     open up new markets and increase the competitiveness of the \n     Alaska fishing industry.\n\n  And later the study notes that commercial fishermen support building \nthe road because the road ``will provide the most economic, reliable, \nflexible and convenient means of moving their product to an airport''--\nthat is up in Cold Bay--``capable of supporting 747 operations.'' That \nis, airplanes, 747s.\n  I can understand why the people down in King Cove would think a road \nis a good idea, to promote economic development. Again, the study says \nthat improved transportation has three purposes--one is improving the \ninfrastructure, the second is convenience and safety, but the third is \neconomic development. Safety is only a very, very small part of the \nstudy here. We were led to believe it is about the only reason, but the \nfact is, the real driving force here is not safety. The real driving \nforce here is to get fish that are\n\n[[Page S11251]]\n\nprocessed down in King Cove up to the airport so they can improve \nmarket access around the world.\n  Now, there is a huge processing plant down in King Cove. It is one of \nthe largest in Alaska. That processing plant processes, I think it is \nabout 38 to 40 million pounds of fish a year.\n  The company is Peter Pan, which has the big processing plant down at \nKing Cove. I am reading now from the study, the Alaska study:\n\n       With improved access, major freight movements from King \n     Cove to Cold Bay would likely consist of fresh fish and \n     seafood from the Peter Pan plant. Discussion with Peter Pan's \n     staff suggests that up to 5 percent of their product may move \n     into the fresh market if good access is available to the Cold \n     Bay airport. Although Peter Pan's total production volume is \n     proprietary information, it is estimated their total product \n     volume is in the 30- to 40-million pound range. Employing the \n     5-percent estimate provided by Peter Pan suggests that \n     ultimately approximately 1.5 to 2 million pounds of fresh \n     fish could move to Cold Bay annually. Packaging and jell ice \n     would add an additional 15 percent, for a total gross weight \n     of about 2 million pounds.\n\n  I don't know how much you can put in a truck. Some say about 10,000 \npounds. That means that if this road is built, there are going to be \nhundreds of trucks full of fish on this road to get out to the Cold Bay \nairport.\n  This report also goes on to say that:\n\n       Forthcoming individual fishing quotas for halibut and black \n     cod, additional market efforts by Peter Pan could increase \n     the amount by 25 to 50 percent within 3 to 4 years.\n\n  So that is what is happening here --and I understand it; if I were in \nKing Cove, I would want the same--a large fish processing plant wants \nto road-haul their product, about 2 million pounds of fish a year, to \nthe airport. My calculation comes out to at least 200 trucks, maybe \nmore, a year, and add to that all the other folks who are going to be \ntraveling on this road.\n  This is no small matter. This is not just emergency medical access to \na hospital. That is not the issue at all. In fact, I have other data \nthat show, again from the Alaska study, there have been no fatalities \nin air evacuation in the period of time studied; 95 percent got to the \nhospital from King Cove within 24 or 48 hours, 75 percent of the \nmedevac transports from King Cove to Cold Bay had no delay.\n  And I only use these dates, these periods, because that is the data \nin the Alaska study. I don't have any more current data or different \ndata. Again, the data shows that with respect to medical evacuation to \nKing Cove, January, mid-January, 1996 to near the end of June 1997, \ntotal medevacs were 20: No delay, 15; 3- to 4-hour delay, 4; 24-hour \ndelay, 1.\n  Not perfect but not too bad. And most of the air accidents that occur \nnear King Cove have really little to do with medevac. There are other \naccidents that have occurred.\n  And I might say, too, that Pen Air--an airline, probably a commuter \nairline, in Alaska--has about 1,800 flights a year between King Cove \nand Cold Bay--1,800 a year. So planes do fly in and out from the area; \nthat is, King Cove to Cold Bay.\n  The study also points out that there is no greater need for air \nemergency transportation here than in other places in Alaska--no \ngreater need. That is in the Alaska study. Essentially, as I said, Pen \nAir now makes more than 1,800 one-way flights between these two \ncommunities each year, and they have had three accidents over 20 years. \nThe State has concluded that the accident rate is still low and that--\nthis is the State's conclusion--``that the residents of King Cove are \nin no greater danger than other Alaskans who rely on air transport.''\n  So again to review, No. 1, the State is doing the study. There are \nmany alternatives under review, and air evacuation is relatively safe. \nBut there are other driving forces here that are pushing for the road, \nwhich brings me to my final point--the environmental impact of building \na road through the Izembek Refuge and Wilderness.\n  As has been noted, Congress has often adjusted wilderness boundaries. \nWe have done it to correct mistakes. That is usually when we do it. We \nhave adjusted wilderness boundaries because we have passed a wilderness \nbill and we made a mistake. We go back and adjust a boundary to correct \nthe mistake. We have done it to accommodate preexisting uses that have \nbeen overlooked. That has happened a couple of times. We have also \nadjusted wilderness boundaries to provide access to inholders as \nrequired by law. But as far as I know, Congress has never authorized \nthe construction of a road through a wilderness area to connect two \npoints outside the wilderness area--never.\n  So the passage of this bill would set a very important precedent. You \nwould say it is OK to construct a road through a wilderness area \nconnecting two points. The argument we are hearing is that this bill \nwill not lead to the construction of a road through a wilderness area, \nbecause we'd be taking an area out of the wilderness, transferring it \nover to the refuge, then building the road through where the wilderness \nwas and saying, gee, we are not building a road through a wilderness.\n  Well, that is absurd on its face, Mr. President. Of course we are \nbuilding a road through wilderness. On the map, as presented by my good \nfriends on the other side, there is wilderness. There is a road through \nthe wilderness. So we are building a road through wilderness. It is \npretty simple. It is not rocket science. This is about a road through a \nwilderness.\n\n  It is also through a very, very important wildlife refuge. Again, \nhere is King Cove down here, and Cold Bay is up here. The road would go \nthrough this area. The wilderness section is right here. The proposal \nis to make this no longer wilderness and then build a road through it. \nOf course it is a road through wilderness. They say, just take these \nlands out of the wilderness. That is what the bill says. In exchange \nyou get some other area.\n  The use of the land in exchange, the net 580 acres, is land that is \nalready restricted under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. So \nthere is no gain here. The net effect of all this is still a road \nthrough a wilderness refuge system. That is the net effect here, that \nis what we are doing.\n  Let me just address, briefly, why this is so important. We are now \ntalking about a wilderness and refuge system that is extremely \nimportant. In fact, it is critical. It is critical resting and critical \nfeeding ground for migratory waterfowl. It is absolutely critical.\n  This is Alaska, Canada, United States and Russia. These are the \nArctic breeding grounds.\n  Let me back up. This little red dot here is the area we are talking \nabout, the Izembek Wilderness area, the refuge wilderness area now in \nquestion. It is the major stopping ground for many, many birds. Why? It \nis very simple.\n  Birds come up from the south. Let me mention what some of them are. \nOne is the Black Brant, 150,000 land here in the spring and fall; the \nEmperor Goose, 100,000 in the spring and fall. Let me say, all of the \nworld's Emperor Geese land here; all of them. All the world's Emperor \nGeese stop here at the Izembek Refuge and Wilderness. All the Pacific \nBlack Brant stop there; all of them. Then there are Canadian Geese; \n85,000 stop in the fall; Stellers Eider stop in the fall and winter. \nShorebirds, 31 species, 300,000.\n  ``Why do they stop there?'' you ask. What is so special about this \nlocation, this place? I will tell you what is so special. It is a \nwetlands. It provides food. These birds, amazingly, have flown, some of \nthem, all the way to Australasia, a long way. And some of these birds \ngo to Mexico. That is the Black Brant. The Canadian Geese go to the \nPacific Northwest. Shorebirds fly as far away as Patagonia. Can you \nbelieve it? Birds that nest and stop off to feed and fatten up so they \ncan fly, fly as far away as Patagonia and come back to Izembek Refuge. \nIt is amazing.\n  Basically, the birds come up, say, in the spring. They stop here to \nfatten up, to restore their energy after the long flight from the \nsouth. Then they go up further north. This is the breeding grounds up \nin the Arctic area where there is not as much food. It is good breeding \ngrounds area, but there is not as much food. After the birds have bred, \nthey fly south. They have to stop again here in the fall of the year \nwhen the summer is over to stock up again, get some food for that long \nflight to Patagonia, Australasia; these long, long flights. So this \nrefuge is very, very important.\n  Essentially, I would like to remind all of us really what is at stake \nhere and what is happening; namely, No. 1,\n\n[[Page S11252]]\n\nthis bill is not needed. Why? Because there is a study going on, a \nstudy to try to find the best alternatives, what is right.\n  No. 2, the driving force here is really commercial. That is the \ndriving force. There is a very large fish processing plant down at King \nCove. They want to get their fish to Cold Bay. I understand that, but \nit is not emergency medical evacuation. That is not the reason.\n  And, No. 3, this road is going to very seriously disrupt these birds' \nnesting grounds. Why? If there is a processing plant down here and, as \nI mentioned--you do the calculations. According to the study from \nAlaska, there may be a couple of hundred trucks, at least added on, \ntraffic back and forth, and then you could have more 747s. The Alaska \nstudy says the purpose of this is to fill 747s. That is what the Alaska \nstudy says, the 747s in Cold Bay. I might be wrong, I say to the \nquizzical look of my friend from Alaska, but that is what the study \nsays: 747s. They may be wrong, but that is what the Alaska study says.\n  So it is really to connect these two towns commercially, for \nconvenience and so forth. That might be a good thing to do. It might \nnot. Let's wait until we get the study and see what the study says.\n  Remember, this is very serious business here. It is potentially \nsetting the precedent, building the road connecting two areas outside \nof a wilderness area; that has never been done before. In addition to \nthat, disrupting a very sensitive population of birds with 747s and \nother airplanes of that size flying in and out much more frequently, \nbecause of all the trucks going back and forth and often in very \nimpassable conditions, because of snow conditions, it is going to cause \na very significant effect on the wildlife there.\n  I will just sum up and say I thank my friend from Alaska for bringing \nthis up as a freestanding bill. These riders are a bit of a problem \nbecause they are riders, but as a freestanding bill we can talk about \nit and debate it. I appreciate the Senators taking good care of their \nState. This is something that some people in Alaska want. I understand \nthat. But this is a national refuge. We are talking about a wilderness \narea. We are talking about a refuge area which belongs to all of us in \nthe United States.\n  I know the sensitivity that Alaskan Senators have. ``Here comes Uncle \nSam all the time, here comes Secretary Babbitt, here comes the Fish and \nWildlife Service. We in Alaska are told what to do by these \noutsiders.'' I understand a good bit of that because in my State of \nMontana, 30 percent of our lands are public lands and most of it is \nFederal. I understand that. So we have to find the right balance here, \nthe right balance between the wishes of the residents of the State of \nAlaska as well as the national interest.\n  My conclusion is the best balance between the two is let's wait for \nthe studies. They will probably come up with some better ideas than we \nhave already come up with so far today. We do not have to wait that \nlong. The medevacs are working. There are all kinds of ways to address \nthis. Let's let discretion be the better part of valor here and not \nadopt an amendment at this time. Wait a while and then get the best \nresult there. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to encourage Members to read this \narticle, a story about the hardships endured by the people of King \nCove, and I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Road Warriors: Community Environmentalists Battle Over Road Through \n                                 Refuge\n\n                           (By Maureen Clark)\n\n       King Cove, Alaska (AP).--On this blustery spit of sand, \n     surrounded by treeless mountains that rise out of the Pacific \n     Ocean and disappear into the clouds, a medical emergency can \n     take on formidable complications.\n       Mariene Newman still gets a knot in her stomach when she \n     talks about the three-day wait to get to a hospital after her \n     daughter, Arlene, then 5, broke her arm while doing \n     cartwheels six years ago.\n       Fierce winds were funneling through the mountain pass where \n     the community's small air strip sits. Planes were grounded.\n       Newman watched and waited for a break in the weather, \n     treating her daughter with painkillers and ice packs. Arlene \n     couldn't keep food down and grew weaker by the day.\n       Finally, Mariene and her husband, A.J., a fisherman who \n     grew up in this isolated community at the tip of the Alaska \n     Peninsula, decided to risk the rough seas for the three-hour \n     boat trip to Cold Bay and its all-weather airport.\n       By the time they reached Cold Bay, the little girl lay limp \n     in her father's arms as she was carried from the lurching \n     vessel, up a 30-foot ladder to the dock and taken to a plane \n     bound for Anchorage, 625 miles away.\n       ``My heart was just twisting,'' Mariene Newman said.\n       Arlene recovered and remembers little of her ordeal.\n       Mariene can't forget. ``No one should have to go through \n     what she and I did.''\n       In this place where 80-mph winds are common in winter and \n     fog can cut off the community for days at a time in summer, \n     many of King Cove's 770 residents have similar stories.\n       They tell of stroke, heart attack and burn victims who had \n     to wait days to get to a hospital; of premature babies born \n     on fishing vessels and cradled in makeshift incubators.\n       The community learned the hard way not to take chances with \n     the violent winds. Four people were killed when a medevac \n     flight carrying an injured fisherman crashed during a winter \n     storm in 1980.\n       A one-lane, 27-mile gravel road to the airport at Cold Bay \n     would end their isolation and provide safe transportation in \n     times of emergency, King Cove residents say.\n       The Cold Bay airport, built during World War II, is the \n     third largest in the state with its 10,000-foot runway. It \n     has even been designated as an alternate landing site for the \n     space shuttle.\n       A rider in an Interior Department spending bill that \n     Congress takes up this month would allow a land exchange to \n     make way for construction of the road.\n       But the road would pass through part of the Izembek \n     National Wildlife Refuge, a critical staging area for \n     hundreds of thousands of waterfowl and birds and home to \n     caribou and bears.\n       Conservation groups oppose the proposal, saying it would \n     irreparably harm wildlife habitat and set a precedent for \n     building roads through other wild places.\n       ``This is the most important wetlands area in Alaska,'' \n     said Deborah Williams, the Interior Secretary's special \n     assistant for Alaska.\n       The issue is shaping up as the biggest environmental fight \n     in Congress this year.\n       The White House has already issued a stern veto threat \n     and the proposal could stall the Interior Department's \n     entire $7 billion budget.\n       Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who chairs the powerful Senate \n     Appropriations Committee, said he is ready for a fight.\n       ``If anyone in this Senate votes against me, this is one I \n     will not forget,'' Stevens warned at a subcommittee hearing \n     in late June.\n       Thousands of miles from the looming showdown in Washington, \n     caribou graze in the hilly tundra, dotted with lakes. In the \n     foothills of the mountains, bears feast on berries and \n     salmon, fattening up for the approaching winter.\n       A quarter of a million Pacific brant, Steller's eiders and \n     emperor geese are arriving in the refuge in waves on their \n     fall journey south.\n       More than 186 species of birds use the lagoons that lie \n     just offshore. Many depend on the abundant eelgrass and \n     berries for critical nourishment during their long \n     migrations.\n       ``Nothing compares to this right here,'' refuge manager \n     Greg Siekaniec said as he waved his arm toward the eelgrass \n     beds of Izembek Lagoon and the Bering Sea beyond.\n       About 3,000 people from around the world visit the refuge \n     each year to hunt caribou and waterfowl, watch birds, fish \n     its salmon streams and hike its rolling hills.\n       The measure before Congress would exchange 85 acres of \n     refuge lands for 664 acres adjoining the refuge owned by \n     local Natives, resulting in a net gain of 579 acres to the \n     refuge. The proposal would not provide funding for the road, \n     which could cost anywhere from $10 million to $29 million.\n       Critics say the exchange would remove land from the heart \n     of the refuge, which has been designated as a wilderness \n     area.\n       ``It's a tough sell from our standpoint, to trade a \n     corridor for lands elsewhere that are less important \n     biologically,'' said Allen Smith, Alaska regional director \n     for the Wilderness Society.\n       Opponents of the road say a modern telemedicine system, \n     linking the village clinic with physicians in Anchorage, \n     coupled with a marine ambulance and improvements to the dock \n     at Cold Bay, would provide a safe, cost-effective alternative \n     to a road.\n       But telemedicine won't help stroke patients, heart attack \n     victims or those suffering from head injuries who need to get \n     to a hospital, said Leslie Kerr, one of two nurse \n     practitioners who staff the village clinic. And King Cove \n     residents say the stormy conditions that make air travel \n     impossible would make travel in a marine ambulance \n     treacherous.\n       ``In any other place in America, you'd just call 911,'' \n     Kerr said. ``We're just trying to get closer to what other \n     people expect to receive.''\n       Even by Alaska standards, King Cove is isolated. Many \n     residents have their groceries shipped in by barge twice a \n     year. There is one restaurant and no movie theater. People \n     like their way of life and don't expect the amenities that \n     might be found elsewhere, said city manager Gary Hennigh.\n\n[[Page S11253]]\n\n       ``We'll never be in the same realm as mainstream America \n     but it can still be as good as circumstances allow,'' Hennigh \n     said. ``There's this big runway just 27 miles way. If there's \n     an opportunity to make something better, we ought to find a \n     way to make it happen.''\n       The rhetoric in the debate has grown hot, with a haze of \n     charges and counter charges on both sides.\n       Supporters of the road accuse their opponents of valuing \n     wildlife over human life. The refuge is already criss-crossed \n     with trails left by 40,000 troops stationed at Cold Bay \n     during World War II, they say.\n       Environmentalists counter that the real reason King Cove \n     residents want the road is for the economic development it \n     could bring.\n       King Cove is a company town. Local fishermen sell their \n     catch to the Peter Pan Seafoods plant, the only cannery in \n     town. With a road to the Cold Bay airport, they could fly \n     their fish to other markets.\n       But Mayor Henry Mack, a fisherman, shakes his head when \n     asked about economic development. With Alaska's wild salmon \n     losing market share to farmed salmon from Chile, Norway and \n     elsewhere, local fishermen would have a difficult time \n     competing on the world market for fresh salmon, he said.\n       ``Our first priority is a safe means of travel. If that's \n     all this turns out to be, we'd be happy,'' Mack said.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am saddened to come to the floor and \nfind the Senator from Montana quoting from the State of Alaska study. I \nam equally sad to hear what he gleaned from it. I wonder if the Senator \nfrom Montana knows that the State study shows the average flight delay \nfrom King Cove to Cold Bay is 8.8 hours. Does he know the State study \nalso said the best option to solve this problem is, in fact, the road \nthat I want to discuss? But I am really sad that my State has not \nbacked the people from King Cove the way it should have. As a matter of \nfact, the Associated Press did have an article that appeared throughout \nthe country. I want to encourage Members to read this article, the \nstory about the hardships endured by the people of King Cove, that I \nasked be printed in the Record at the beginning of my remarks.\n  I know the graphics cannot appear in the Record, but I hope the \nSenate will understand we are talking about King Cove, which is out at \nthe end of the Alaska peninsula. The land on that peninsula is almost \nentirely withdrawn. There are some native lands on it, but it would not \nbe possible to have a road go out of King Cove to Anchorage by land. We \nare talking about an area that is isolated by land, an area that is \nlocated just a few miles from Cold Bay, which is an alternate landing \nsite for the space shuttle.\n  If you want to talk about 747s landing there, the space shuttle \nitself can land there, just 30 miles from King Cove. If anybody is \nworried about the turbulence and planes landing at King Cove, as far as \nthe migratory birds coming in the Izembek, I think they ought to check \nagain.\n  I argued against this land in its entirety becoming a part of the \nIzembek Refuge. Part of it is nesting and resting grounds for migratory \nbirds. Part of it is a former airbase from World War II that I will \ndescribe. After it was made part of the wilderness area--it is strange, \nyou make an airbase that has old Quonset huts and roads on it, and you \nsay, by the stroke of a pen, ``This is a wilderness area now, this is a \nwilderness area; be careful, you cannot do anything more in this \narea.'' There are 42 miles of road advertised by the Fish and Wildlife \nService as a good place to come hunt, but you cannot move the boundary \n60 feet--60 feet--so we can build a road outside of that wilderness \narea and allow these people to come to Cold Bay to be transported \nanother 600 miles from there to get to a hospital.\n  Mr. President, I welcome to Washington several of the civic leaders \nfrom King Cove. I am sure they are saddened to hear Members of the U.S. \nSenate telling them that their lives and their children's lives are \nless important than 60 feet along 7 miles of the southern boundary of \nthis area that has been set aside and called a wilderness area.\n  When we first started wilderness, it was intended to include only \nroadless areas. It had to be roadless. When they made this into a \nwilderness area, I argued, ``How can you do this? How can you make that \narea that is part of the airbase into wilderness?'' They said, ``We \nneed to round it out.'' They have rounded it out all right. They have \nrounded it out in a way that denies King Cove access to Cold Bay.\n  My people up in the gallery are a long way from home, Mr. President, \nand I do welcome them. I am sure that they are here to make certain \nthat we do our job. I do this one very willingly--very willingly--\nbecause I represent a State that has two-thirds of its total land \nwithdrawn. I have imposed the State of Alaska on a map of what we call \nthe contiguous 48 States. It is going from Florida in the East to \nsouthwest of Arizona, almost to the Baja coastline, and from Duluth \ndown to the Texas Panhandle. It is an area that is one-fifth the total \nlandmass of the United States.\n  Two-thirds of all of our State is withdrawn Federal land. It is there \nfor us to look at, but we can't use it without permission from some \nbureaucrat who is compelled by a law passed by the extreme \nenvironmentalists who come to this floor and say we need to withdraw \nmore, we need to protect this more, we need to come up with some way to \nprevent Alaskans from living.\n  More than a third of all Federal land is in Alaska--more than a third \nof all the land owned by the Federal Government is in Alaska! The land \nowned by the Federal Government in my State is larger than Texas. The \nFederally-owned land in Alaska would be the largest State in the Union \noutside of Alaska. It is twice the size of California; 358 Rhode \nIslands would fit in the Federally-owned land in Alaska. Beyond that, \nhalf of the wilderness in all 50 States is in our State. A full 16 \npercent of this vast State of ours is called wilderness. The whole \nState is de facto wilderness, but because of an act of Congress, this \narea is deemed to be a kind of super-duper wilderness, impregnable by \npeople who are seeking medical care.\n  We have 57 million acres of wilderness in Alaska, and we are talking \nabout 60 feet along 6 miles of the smallest wilderness area in Alaska.\n  We see a lot of people come into our State from States that don't \nhave any wilderness at all. They come and say, ``Oh, isn't it \nwonderful, all this wilderness.'' And they go back and have another \ngroup of D-8 cats clear and develop more of their land, and then they \nput the money they make from that into some organization to be sure \nthey protect Alaska from any development. They are so extreme that they \nsay this 303,000-acre Izembek Refuge, the smallest one of the 16 \nrefuges in Alaska, is so sacrosanct that it cannot move its border 60 \nfeet.\n  Mr. President, as I said, this whole area of the Aleutian Islands and \nAlaska Peninsula, almost all of it, is refuge land. This wilderness \narea is just a very small part of the 16 refuges in Alaska. We are \ndealing with just superlatives. The Izembek Wilderness alone is larger \nthan the entire wilderness areas in most States. That is how small \nwilderness is in the South 48, but when it comes up our way, we get \nmillions of acres at a time.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about King Cove. Everyone knows the \nAlaska Natives there have survived the climatic conditions of Alaska \nfor thousands and thousands of years on the Alaska peninsula. They were \na nomadic people originally. They followed the caribou and fish and \nlived entirely off the land. Early in this century, they settled into \npermanent communities, including King Cove--a fishing community. Some \ncommunities built local canneries.\n  The Japanese invaded the United States in World War II in only one \narea, as we all know, in the Aleutian Chain. When they invaded the \nAleutian Islands, the U.S. Army built a giant base, Thornbrough Air \nBase, which was across the water from King Cove. Battle accounts will \nverify the inclement weather and how it played havoc on military \noperations in that area.\n  After the war, the airbase was converted to a regional airport. It is \nnow Cold Bay, a small town of mostly Federal employees.\n  This is a picture of Cold Bay. As I said, the airbase is now an \nalternate landing site for the space shuttle. It has an enormous number \nof roads, apparent on the photograph I am showing the Senate, for a \nsmall community of Federal employees. This is the third largest runway \nin my State. It remains open throughout the year, rarely closing \ndespite having the worst flying weather in the United States. Cold Bay \nitself is documented with the worst flying weather in the United \nStates.\n  As the cannery and the fishing fleet grew, the Native people became \nmore\n\n[[Page S11254]]\n\nacclimated to normal American life, and they sought better medical \nservices. We created, soon after I came to the Senate, community health \naides for Native villages. This village has a small clinic staffed by a \ncouple of community health aides. Any serious injury or illness \nrequires medical evacuation to Anchorage or, in some instances, as far \nas Seattle.\n  Like most Alaskan communities, the connection between the village and \nthe regional airport is by air. Obviously, there are no roads through \nthe peninsula. Nor is there now a road from King Cove to Cold Bay. The \ncircumstances there, even though King Cove lies only 30 miles from Cold \nBay, is that the airport at Cold Bay is far, far, far away. Thirty \nmiles is a long way when you have to go from by water. That is one of \nthe worst stretches of water known to man--the North Pacific Ocean--\nbetween Cold Bay and the King Cove.\n\n  Right there--King Cove is here and Cold Bay is across this body of \nwater also known as Cold Bay. The purpose of this road is to allow the \npeople who live in King Cove access to Cold Bay when the weather is so \nbad that it is not possible to travel by air or by sea. When it is \ncalm, it is like any place else. They can take a boat across or fly the \nshort distance. But the weather is rarely calm in King Cove.\n  The Native people decided that they needed a road for emergencies, \nwhen the weather precludes air and sea transportation. That is what \nthis is, an emergency road. I cannot believe that anyone would talk \nabout trucks and truckloads of stuff going to Cold Bay on this road. \nOnly a small unpaved dirt road is planned. And the community asked the \nFederal Government for permission to build that 6 miles. They own the \nbalance of the land here except for the 6 miles. The Government said \nno.\n  Then they offered a land exchange, acre for acre, for the 60 foot \nright-of-way; and the Federal Government said no. They then said, \n``Well, we'll give you 664 acres in exchange for 85 acres if you move \nthe boundary.'' They said, ``If we can get through here, we will give \nyou all of this here and here'' to add to the Izembek Refuge. It is \nalmost an 8-to-1 acre trade.\n  They specified they would use this road only for emergency use; and \nthey further offered to help the Fish and Wildlife Service limit \noverall impacts of access on the whole refuge. And the Federal \nGovernment still said no.\n  Let me tell you why my friends are in the gallery, Mr. President. \nEleven people have died flying into or out of the community since 1980. \nMany more sick or injured have died waiting for the weather to clear \nbecause they did not even try to make the trip.\n  Let me tell you about the people who died because they could not even \nstart the trip: Ernest Mack and Walter Samuelson suffered heart attacks \nin King Cove, and waited days for weather to clear so they could fly to \nAnchorage. Both Ernest and Walter died because they could not get \nemergency medical care in a timely fashion.\n  Christine Dushkin suffered a heart attack, and then died after \ncrossing the bay in very bad weather in a fishing boat. She collapsed \nas she climbed the long ladder up to the top of the dock at Cold Bay. \nShe suffered a heart attack in King Cove and died before she got to the \nCold Bay airport.\n  Cathy Hoff, Darien Gorsinger and John Dattoli lost their lives when \ntheir plane was blown into the side of a mountain by a gust of wind. \nThey were people from King Cove who were trying to save the life of Tom \nPhillips, a Seattle fisherman, who had lost his leg in a boating \naccident in King Cove.\n  I have heard colleagues talk on the floor about the morality of an \nHMO denying a child desperately needed health care. At the time I \nthought about King Cove. Is it moral for environmentalists to come to \nthe floor and do the same thing? Is it moral for environmentalists to \noppose giving this isolated village a chance to get the kind of medical \nattention that is available to the rest of the United States?\n  A simple broken arm became a life-threatening situation after a 5-\nyear-old girl went into shock while waiting for weather to clear. The \nshock was from the broken arm. She just had to wait and wait and wait \nfor the airplane to be able to get in, and she finally went over on a \nfishing boat once the sea calmed down sufficiently.\n  One King Cove girl was born 2 months premature on a crab boat that \nwas taking her mother across Cold Bay in very inclement weather. It was \na very long trip, even though it is only 30 miles, because of the wind \nand sea conditions. This little girl was kept alive in a foil-lined \nshoebox stuffed in a toaster oven while the winter storm tossed that \nboat around before they finally got to the dock. She lived. She was \nfortunate.\n  The road to Cold Bay would have allowed these children to reach an \nAnchorage hospital in hours instead of days, Mr. President--hours \ninstead of days. As I said, my State study shows, in one of the few \nthings they did report to us favorably for our people in King Cove, is \nthe average flight delay is 8.8 hours. That is average.\n  Once the people from King Cove get to Cold Bay, they have to fly 600 \nmiles. You know what that is. That is a flight from Helena to Colorado \nSprings; from Little Rock to Milwaukee; from Providence to Columbus. \nThat is just to get to the hospital. Just to land and then be taken by \nambulance to the hospital. After flying more than 600 miles from Cold \nBay.\n  I cannot believe that a heart attack victim in Helena would not be \nknocking on the door of the Senator from Montana if that person had to \nfly to Colorado to get treatment and was made to take a three hour boat \nride in a raging sea just to make his flight. I cannot believe that a \nperson suffering a spinal injury in Rhode Island would not complain \nabout having to fly to Ohio for surgery. They would complain in the \nfirst instance just in terms of the distance between Cold Bay and \nAnchorage. The people in King Cove can accept the 600 mile flight, but \nthey don't understand why the rest of their trip can't be made easier.\n  We are talking about the distance between King Cove and Cold Bay. The \nadministration and their advisers in the environmental community insist \nthat a 600-mile medical evacuation necessity is not enough, that we \nshould throw in a 3-hour boat ride in a Pacific storm--maybe more than \nthat, because some of them do take longer when the wind and sea run \nagainst the boat, tossing it like a cork in the ocean.\n  The Senator from Montana suggests we could use a helicopter. I wonder \nif he knows what the limits on flying a helicopter are in gale-force \nwinds. We are talking about the normal conditions most of the year \ngoing across to Cold Bay--when the weather turns bad, as it often does, \nthey get hurricane-force winds.\n  I really think that people who suggest that ought to come out and \nfind a volunteer to fly them in a helicopter across Cold Bay. I would \nnot get in a helicopter with an 85-mile-an-hour wind blowing. I was in \nCold Bay once when we had to tie the nose of our four-engine airplane \nto a D-8 Caterpillar in order to keep that plane from being blown away \nin an 80-mile-an-hour wind.\n  This is a very serious thing to us. And as I have told the committee \nwhen we started this issue, this is the kind of issue that a Senator \nnever forgets. I have heard other people say that here on the floor, \nand I have said it only once before in my life, but we cannot forget \nthis one. This one means so much to so few people that unless we \nweren't a State and neither Senator Murkowski nor myself was here, they \nwould have no hope at all. This is why we fought for statehood, to have \nthe opportunity to come and explain to the Senate and the rest of the \nUnited States what it means to live in Alaska.\n  In 1983, we moved wilderness in Montana--in Montana--so the people \nthere could drive to a fishing hole. We moved that wilderness farther \nthan we want to move this one.\n  Last Congress, we moved wilderness in Alaska so Natives living in a \nnational park could use snow machines in winter. We were grateful for \nthat.\n  Earlier this summer, 88 Senators voted to allow motorized \ntransportation in the Boundary Waters Wilderness in Minnesota. We \nwaived the Wilderness Act in Minnesota this year.\n  Since when have we placed recreation above the lives of children and \npeople who need medical care?\n  When is the Senate going to start listening to those who come from an \narea that is closer to Tokyo than it is to Washington, DC? You don't \nknow our land. You won't listen to us about our land and you raise our \ntempers because you won't listen.\n\n[[Page S11255]]\n\n  The only roads in this wilderness were there when the wilderness was \ncreated, and it shouldn't have become wilderness. I told them at the \ntime, as I said previously, wilderness by definition is a roadless \narea. Now, the 42 miles of road in Izembek today are used by my friends \nwho have the money to go out there and hunt every year. Yet, we are \ntold we should tell these people to use boats when no rational person, \nexcept in a life-and-death emergency, would leave the dock in such high \nseas. We are told to risk more air crashes, knowing that pilots who \nvolunteered, knowing the risk, have lost their lives.\n  My friend will talk about telemedicine. No one believes in \ntelemedicine more than I do. But telemedicine cannot deliver premature \nbabies. Telemedicine cannot perform open-heart surgery yet. I hope the \nday will come when it can. We can't use marine ambulances. There is no \nvessel that I know of that can cross Cold Bay in a storm safely, let \nalone carrying an injured person. Helicopters will not take off and \nland in an 85-mile-an-hour wind.\n  It is time we stop talking about alternatives. By the way, I heard \nthe Senator from Montana talk about the alternative that I suggested. I \nsuggested building the road south of the Kinzarof lagoon. This land is \nall owned by the Native people. They could cross all the way on their \nown land, but it would close off entrance to the lagoon. When we asked \nthe Corps of Engineers and the Fish and Wildlife people to look into \nit, I got the report that such a decision would, in fact, create a \nproblem for the few migratory birds who use this lagoon--not the land, \nbut the lagoon. We have abandoned that option because it would likely \nhave a greater environmental impact than the road we are suggesting.\n  We don't believe our road will have any environmental impact with the \nconditions we have agreed to as far as its use.\n  Now, I think anyone that wants to put a helicopter there and tell the \nCoast Guard they should fly in such inclement weather, should talk to \nthe Coast Guard. I have, and they declined the honor.\n  We are here as representatives of a State that have seen their lands \nwithdrawn, withdrawn, withdrawn. The land I used to take my sons to \nevery year to go hunting was withdrawn and is now a wilderness area. \nAccess to most of my State is cut off on any north-south or east-west \naxis on the ground by withdrawals and wilderness areas.\n  There is now the spectacle of a former Member of the Senate, now Vice \nPresident, accusing me of burying this special interest rider deep in a \nspending bill so that it couldn't be found. I wish he were here so I \nmight debate him on that. It is absolutely untrue. We opened this up in \nthe committee. We had a vote in the committee. There was nothing hidden \nat all. It was public knowledge from the very beginning. Now we have \npeople saying we are beginning to kill the Wilderness Act by moving the \nboundary of this area enough so we can build a 6-mile road, 60 feet \nwide, when the area itself already has 42 miles of road in it--the part \nof the refuge that will be affected by this road.\n  I do get excited at times here on the floor when I find there are so \nmany half-truths and untruths told about what is going on in my State. \nI think we need to know and someone should come here and be bold enough \nto tell us why this gravel road, 60 feet wide, deserves to be \nclassified as wilderness, and remain so, despite the loss of life of \npeople in this area. Why is this little strip of road more important \nthan the lives of Alaskans who have not yet died, coming out of that \ncommunity, seeking medical attention?\n  We have a growing tension in our State--I speak of it often--\nconcerning the way we are treated as residents of a State, compared to \nhow we were treated when we were residents of a territory. We did not \nhave extreme environmental organizations controlling the administration \nwhen we were a territory. We do now. The strongest extreme group in the \nUnited States is the extreme environmental organization. It is a direct \nresult of positions taken by that group that the administration has \nopposed this road and opposed helping these people.\n  We believe we know how to protect our State and its resources better \nthan anyone from Washington who flies in, spends 2 hours on the ground \nthen flies home to tell us what to do--particularly our Native people. \nThey have lived with this land for hundreds of thousands of years. They \nhonor it.\n  Did you know, Mr. President, that we have developed less than \\1/2\\ \nof 1 percent of 365 million acres? Roughly 18 to 19 million acres are \noccupied by Alaskans, Native, nonnative, military, nonmilitary, cities, \ntowns--\\1/2\\ of 1 percent. Much of our lands are wetlands, as a matter \nof fact.\n  Here we are in a situation where during World War II there was more \nactivity in this area than ever there will be in the history of the \nworld--an enormous base, planes flying in and out, troops quartered 30 \nmiles from the center of that base. They had more people there then \nthan we will ever have on this road. In spite of the war, those birds \nsurvived. Isn't that strange that during the war, we flew planes, we \nmaneuvered troops, we had real and mock assaults on the beaches, and \nthe birds survived. I ask the Senate, can't we believe that the birds \nwill not be harmed by people who live with them, but are merely seeking \nto cross the land in emergencies only?\n  I urge all of my friends to vote for this proposition. By the way, \nthe largest group of volunteers to our military services in the country \nper capita are the Alaskan Native people. They believe in this country. \nThey believe in this government. They fight for the government. And \nthey wonder, then, why does the government abandon them because of \npressure groups like this? There is no excuse, no excuse, for anyone \nopposing this proposition, in my opinion.\n  I urge the Senator to approve Senator Murkowski's bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments of the \nsenior Senator from Alaska on the bill. His State and the people in \nKing Cove and Cold Bay mean a lot to him, and they mean a lot to us. \nThe junior Senator from Alaska mentioned, and perhaps even some of the \nresidents of King Cove wonder, if we are concerned. I say to these King \nCove residents, who are either in the gallery watching or listening \nelsewhere, all of us are as concerned about your safety--your medical \nsafety and medical health--as the two Alaska Senators are. Obviously, \nwe are; we are all Americans.\n  It is my feeling that maybe the best way to achieve better medical \nevacuation and better safety for the residents of King Cove is to \ncomplete the study--the two studies, actually. One is by your State, \nthe State of Alaska, which is vigorously trying to figure out the best \nway to address better access between King Cove and Cold Bay. They are \nlooking at various options--air options, marine options, road options. \nThey are looking at telemedicine. They are looking at all the various \nlogical ways to try to solve the problem.\n  We all know there is no silver bullet, no one alternative that is \ngoing to be the total solution to make sure that if anybody is ill or \nin an emergency situation in King Cove that he or she can immediately \nget the best possible care at a hospital in Anchorage, or even as far \naway as Seattle. There is none. So we have to find the right thing.\n  The other study that will be conducted is a $700,000 study of Alaska \naccess issues by the Army Corps of Engineers. The study is at least now \nin the transportation appropriations bill.\n  So we have a lot of alternatives here. I think really it behooves all \nof us, including the residents of King Cove, to find the best option. \nWe don't know yet what the best one is because it is a very difficult \nproblem. It is difficult because of the residents' inaccessibility to \nCold Bay and other parts of Alaska. The Senator from Alaska mentioned \nthat I suggested helicopters. I did suggest that as one option, but not \nall the time. Many times, helicopters make no sense; for instance, when\n\n[[Page S11256]]\n\nwinds are blowing 85 miles an hour. I would not get in one then either. \nThat is not a silver bullet. It is probably a combination of a lot of \ndifferent things.\n  No. 1, let's get the best solution and not rush to judgment and waste \ntaxpayers' money by throwing two studies down the drain.\n  Another point I want to make is that the effect of this bill would \nsay we are going to build this road. Some say it is a dirt road, some \nsay a gravel road. Well, it is a dirt road, a gravel road. But they are \ntrying to convey the impression that it is pretty small, no big deal. \nActually, it is a pretty big deal. According to the Alaska Assessment \nStudy of Needs the road is intended to be used year-round, with an \naverage of fewer than 400 vehicles per day, including tractor-trailers \ncarrying freight.\n  The Senator from Alaska questioned my assertion that freight could be \nhauled on this road. Well, I don't know. All I am saying is there is \nthe contention, according to the State of Alaska study, that tractor-\ntrailers would be hauled. The reason that is mentioned, frankly, is \nbecause of the fish processing plant--a very large one--in King Cove. \nIt is one of the largest in the State of Alaska, where 30 million to 40 \nmillion pounds of fish are processed. Obviously, they would like to \nhave this road to send the tractor-trailers on. This road would be \ndesigned for two-way traffic; it is not just a cow path. Again, at \nleast the fish processing company would like to have this road.\n  Some have suggested this is not the only time we have adjusted a \nwilderness boundary. Several references have been made to the State of \nMontana, where there was a road--well, there wasn't much of a road, I \nsay to my good friend who is now on the floor. It was for 4X4s to go \ndown to the lake to go fishing. And then Congress enacted a wilderness \nbill, and it included the road in the wilderness area. It was a \nmistake.\n  Why did that mistake occur? I say to my good friend, probably because \nit wasn't much of a road. But it was a mistake. There was a preexisting \nkind of a road. Wilderness was created in the area, so the net result \nwas that the road was in the wilderness area, that is true. But after \nwe in the Congress recognized our mistake, we changed the designation \nso that the road could still be there. That is far different from this \ncase we are talking about on the floor today.\n  We are talking about the creation and building of a new road through \nwilderness--building a road through wilderness. That is a totally \ndifferent situation. Now, I call it sleight of hand to say, oh, no, \nthis is not a new road to the wilderness because we are taking this \narea out of wilderness and building this road through it. Obviously, if \nyou look at the maps, there it is. The map says ``wilderness.'' You can \nsee where the road would be, and it would be through a wilderness.\n  I don't want to get too bogged down in all this, Mr. President. The \nfact of the matter is that our minds are pretty well made up. I think \nit is important to make it clear for the record what is happening here, \nwhat some of the other reasons are for what we are doing here.\n  Here is a photo. For example, this is a road--if you can see it. It \nis the kind of road that would be constructed in this area. It is a \ntypical, good-condition road in Cold Bay, AK. As you can see, two \nvehicles can get by each other. As you can see, trucks could travel \nthis road; tractor-trailer trucks could certainly travel this road.\n  On the other hand, this is the kind of road, if you will, that now \nexists in the wilderness. It has been mentioned that there are already \nroads in the wilderness. There really isn't much of a road. It is the \nkind in this photo here that exists in the wilderness. As you can tell, \nit is not much of a road. You could not travel on that year-round. Very \nfew cars could travel on it.\n  We are talking about the construction of a pretty good road, up to \ncertain specifications, which is not a highway, it is not paved, but as \nyou can tell by the map here, it is a pretty good, decent road. In my \nhome State of Montana, that is a highway. It is not an interstate, but \nthat is a pretty good road.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may ask this: Does the Senator know where that \nroad actually is that he showed there? I have never seen anything like \nit. I don't know where it is.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is a photograph of the so-called road here on the \nmap. Cold Bay is down here, and there is a road that goes up here. It \nis sort of a road trail that would connect with the proposed \nconstruction road. This is a map of this road provided by the Fish and \nWildlife Service. That is all I can tell the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The maps we have are the same thing and show the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service sign.\n  There is a notable difference in the road.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There may be a difference in the road. I don't know. One \nmore point, in case folks haven't been listening to the entire debate: \nMy view is there is a medical need. That is clear.\n  According to the State of Alaska, it is no greater, or no worse, than \nthe needs of other similar communities in Alaska. There are several \nstudies. Two are going on to try to address the best solution. The \nstudies are looking at not only determining the best of three routes--\nair, water, road--but also trying to figure out how to increase the \ncommercial viability of these communities. The real purpose here is to \neconomic development. That is the driving force behind this road.\n  To sum up, let's wait until the studies are completed. When they are \ncompleted, my guess is that we will find a better way to help the \npeople in King Cove, and in a way that does not disrupt a very \nsensitive national wildlife refuge wilderness area where hundreds of \nthousands of birds stop over in the spring and in the fall to feed and \nstore up food for the breeding grounds in the northern part of Alaska, \nor to fly south.\n  The present occupant of the Chair wasn't here when I mentioned this \nearlier. These birds fly great distances. Some fly as far as Patagonia, \nif you can believe it, to the Izembek Refuge; to Patagonia and back \nagain and up north to the Arctic regions in the summer to feed.\n  I urge Senators, the better option is to wait for the study. This is \na very serious matter--building a new road in a wilderness area. It \nmight not be the best option for the area. But we should wait for the \nstudies.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I see my good friend is on the floor, \nthe Senator from Tennessee. I note that he is the only physician in the \nSenate and is certainly eminently qualified with his wealth of \nknowledge on health issues. We have discussed issues today relative to \nhealth care. He has expressed opinions on everything from tobacco to \nchildren's health care. But I think it is important to recognize that \nhe is an experienced and qualified trauma surgeon.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Tennessee would care to discuss the \ncertain medical issues that are relevant to this debate and relevant to \nthe timing of the debate and those who experience severe accidents to \nget to a trained trauma center with adequate personnel.\n  Mr. FRIST. Indeed, I would be happy to discuss some of these issues.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, one of the reasons the people from King \nCove are, of course, pushing for access is that when a serious injury \noccurs, they understand that treatment has to be obtained in a \nrelatively short period of time, in some cases immediately. Many of the \nhealth care providers in the area refer to the first hour after an \ninjury as the crucial ``golden hour,'' so to speak, meaning that this \nis the most critical time after an injury.\n  I wonder if the Senator could shed some light on what that time is. \nWhat does that ``golden hour'' really mean?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the ``golden hour'' is a basic fundamental \nprinciple of emergency care, of emergency responsiveness in trauma \ncare. The Senator from Alaska is entirely correct. When a serious \ntrauma occurs, it is that first hour, that ``golden hour'' that is \nabsolutely critical.\n  The principle is very simple; that is, the quicker one can respond \nand get to appropriate treatment, the better the outcome. The ``golden \nhour''--put that in quotation marks. But it is a fundamental principle \nthat every emergency room and every trauma surgeon understands. It \nrefers to the principle that the severely injured patients are\n\n[[Page S11257]]\n\nmore likely to survive with rapid, responsive, appropriate \nresuscitation, and treatment.\n  Patients with otherwise potentially survivable injuries can die \nunless there is intervention--frequently, surgical intervention--with \nappropriate resources accessed by that surgeon, or by that trauma \npersonnel that is available. Delaying or failing to perform that needed \nemergency action or emergency surgery is the most common cause of those \notherwise preventable deaths.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I understand there is a distinction, Mr. President, \nbetween medevac trauma death and early trauma death. I wonder if the \nSenator could elaborate.\n  Mr. FRIST. There is. I think it is important. Again, the terms \n``medevac'' and ``early'' are very appropriate. It is appropriate for \npeople of the lay public to understand what those differences are.\n  In the case where you have a medevac trauma death, whereby the \npatient dies instantly, or within a very few minutes of whatever injury \nwas incurred, there is little that can be done unless medevac treatment \nfor that trauma takes place. So-called ``early'' death occurs within 2 \nto 3 hours of injury. In either case, the ability to get care \nimmediately is the most single important factor in determining \nsurvivability and outcome.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. According to the draft study by our State of Alaska, \nMr. President, the average flight delay from King Cove--I think it was \ncited by the senior Senator, Senator Stevens--is approximately 8 hours. \nIf a patient has a heart attack, stroke, or perhaps some other trauma, \nwhat are the chances for survival after such a delay?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this is very well accepted in the emergency \ncare peer review. The literature carefully documents it, and it is just \nas we discussed. With each passing hour the chances of survival \ndiminish. If you draw a curve, the chance of survival in that first \nhour is very high, the second hour a little bit less, but still high, \nand every hour it diminishes over time. And that is the underlying \nprinciple of the so-called ``golden hour.''\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the thoughts of the \nSenator from Tennessee on this.\n  Another subject that we discussed at some length in this debate is \nconcerning safe access to the residents of King Cove. The argument is \nthat telemedicine is the solution to the dilemma of the people of King \nCove and the access. I ask the Senator from Tennessee if he would agree \nwith the following quote from one of the largest health providers in \nour State, and that is:\n\n       The Aleutian Chain is without a doubt one of the most \n     difficult places on Earth to provide quality health care for \n     several reasons. Weather is a primary factor. Transportation \n     in an emergency can be terrifying. It can also be deadly, and \n     it can also be delayed. Many lives have been lost in the \n     attempt of both patient and provider in working on evacuation \n     teams. The Aleutians represent a unique opportunity to \n     develop telemedicine. However, it will never eliminate the \n     need for emergency transport to an acute care facility. That \n     is, of course, what the access road is all about between King \n     Cove and Cold Bay. The system will not carry a human body \n     that needs advanced medical care. It will not remove the need \n     for treacherous evacuations that so often take place from \n     King Cove.\n\n  Talking specifically now about the technology of the advancement in \nthis area of telemedicine, I wonder if the Senator could comment on the \ntelemedicine technology benefits limitations. What kind of people do \nyou have to have at the rural end to communicate this advanced \ntechnology that we are seeing in medical care today?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, telemedicine is, indeed, one of the most \nexciting new technologies to come along in medicine and in the \napplication of carrying out what we know in terms of new knowledge, \ncurrent knowledge, and the application. But it is very important for \npeople to understand that its real limitation is that it is used \nprincipally for diagnostic purposes today. Over time that will change a \nbit. And it is advancing every day. But the quotation you just read is \nexactly correct. Telemedicine will never eliminate the need for \nemergency transportation, emergency transport, to an acute care \nfacility.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think, Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee \nwould also be interested in knowing that there is no such thing \ncurrently as ground link communications in King Cove and that \ncommunications are by satellite.\n  As one person recently put it, ``If a successful fax transmission is \na blessing, then successful telemedicine transmissions could be, well, \nperhaps a miracle.''\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I was not aware actually of that and the \nparticular situation there in King Cove with regard to the satellite \ntechnology, but it really aims at a very important point, and that is, \nthe premise of any telemedicine must start with reliable communications \nand it must end with reliable access to further care, for that care to \nbe carried out--a very important point.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. May I thank my colleague from Tennessee for coming \nover and sharing his knowledge and experience in the area of not only \ntelemedicine but as a trauma surgeon, and we have seen the Senator's \nperformance when called upon here in this body in an emergency. We all \ncommend the Senator for his extraordinary expertise and express our \nappreciation to the Senator for his many good works.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I know the hour is late and the Senator may wish to \ncontinue to speak. I am personally just about to wind up here. I would \nlike to make a couple of points relative again to the allegation that \nsomehow a road--and again I would point to one of the charts--faces \nsignificant closures because of snow. As we have indicated on numerous \noccasions, even the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in their warning do \nnot address snow as a difficulty in transit on these roads. This is the \ntype of road you see.\n  Again, I would remind my colleagues that we are not looking for any \nfunding here, we are looking for an authorization for a land exchange. \nWe are not putting a road through a wilderness, we are putting it \nthrough a refuge. It is a net-net gain for the environmental community \nbecause it adds approximately 580 acres to the wilderness.\n  I also would like to point out that while my friend from Montana \nsuggests we study it some more, we have been studying this thing since \n1984. That is 14 years, Mr. President. We have had the Aleutians East \nTransportation Improvement Plan, we have had the Alaska Intermodel \nTransportation Plan, we have had the King Cove Bay Road Feasibility \nStudy in 1995; the King Cove Briefing Report; the King Cove Bay \nTransportation Improvement Assessment draft report, 1997; the King \nCove-Cold Bay Transportation Study of 1998.\n  My point is that this issue has been pretty well studied, and for the \npeople who have lived there for 5,000 years in King Cove, there is only \none possible option that makes any sense. And they are pretty savvy \npeople, because they have to be, they live in a harsh environment.\n  We don't need another study. It is not going to save one more life. \nIt will just delay the ultimate confirmation of what we already know--\nthat the road is the most practical, it is the least expensive, it is \nthe most reliable alternative. That is why everybody else has them. And \nwhy shouldn't the people of King Cove? That is the real issue.\n  Now, my friend brought up a point that I feel a little uncomfortable \nwith because it questions our motivation. He suggested that the real \nreason behind this road was the commercial use.\n  Well, first of all, I want to tell him and I want to tell the rest of \nmy colleagues that I have never, never been approached by the fish \nprocessing firms that are over there that this, indeed, would be a \nsignificant benefit, nor have they lobbied me.\n  If you understand the commerce of the North Pacific and the fisheries \nmarkets, you will know that most of the products that are produced in \nthe small facility at King Cove are frozen fish products. Now, frozen \nfish products primarily are halibut and bottom fish, and they just \ndon't demand, if you will, the market price to afford to fly them out \nto the markets. So as a consequence, what is produced here is carried \nby small freezer vessels and is marketed primarily in Japan and, to an \nextent, Korea.\n  If you look at the map of Alaska, you can see the unique location of \nKing Cove and the great circle route, and that is the route of \ntransportation. Most of these ships sail out of Vancouver, BC, or \nSeattle, WA. These are\n\n[[Page S11258]]\n\nfreighters; they are American President Lines and various others. They \ngo from the Seattle area and they stop by some of these areas on the \nPacific Ocean side and pick up the frozen product in freezer vans and \ntake them on to the Orient, whether it be the area of King Cove or \nwhether it is Unalaska.\n  To suggest that we have enough value in our fish products to warrant \nmoving them out by truck or van is totally unrealistic because the \nprice simply won't support that. You can't get that much for the \nproduct. You can talk about all the studies you want. There may be a \nhalf dozen individuals who will suggest that this is a potential \nmarket, but if the reality of the price isn't there--and it isn't \nthere--you are not going to ship this out.\n  I would ask my friend from Montana one other thing. Since we are \ngiving the Secretary of the Interior the authority to control all the \ntraffic on the road, would he vote for this--if, indeed, the Secretary \nsaid there will be no commercial activity? We assure him of that. Would \nthat satisfy the Senator from Montana? I would certainly think it \nshould, because this is the point. He questions our motive.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. May I answer the question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I can tell you right now, there is no way that the \nvalue of this product would allow it to be shipped out by aircraft. The \nonly thing that we have that would closely approximate that value is \nthe king crab fresh, but it is very, very difficult. It is a very short \nseason, and this isn't the predominant area necessarily for that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Can I answer the Senator's question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am not ready to yield yet.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator asked me a question. I wonder if I could \nrespond to it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am not going to----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That was a rhetorical question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yield at this time, but I will certainly take a \nquestion at the end.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, no; the Senator asked----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Alaska has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The point is, Mr. President, to question the \nmotivation of the Senators from Alaska on the question of \ncommercialization is without any foundation and without any feasibility \nregardless of what some study or report suggests as a potential \nalternative. It is simply not real.\n  Now, the other issue relative to the points that have been made by my \nfriend from Montana, who clearly doesn't speak from experience or \nhaving visited the area, is the issue of the road and connecting, if \nyou will, the roads that are in the area with this proposed extension.\n  I would call attention to the fact that we have in this area almost \n15 miles of road in the wilderness now. And if my friend, when he has \nan opportunity, would care to visit the area, I would be happy to take \nhim and drive over these roads that exist in the wilderness today.\n  What we are proposing is, not to address those roads, we are \nproposing simply to put another road extension, if you will, outside \nthe wilderness in a refuge, and I think we have made that point again \nand again and again. To suggest there would be 400 people a day who \nwould travel this road is ludicrous. There are 700 people in King Cove. \nThere are 110 or 120 in Cold Bay. Now, I don't know where you get 400 \npeople, or hundreds of trucks. This is make-believe simply to address \nan issue that--well, there is little local knowledge certainly in this \nbody relative to the factual account.\n  Believe me, if we could ship our products out by 747 and get the \nprice that we would have to get for them, why, it would be a different \nmatter. You talk about the issue of the sanctity of the wildlife \nsanctuaries, and that is a very real issue. But be assured that we \nhave, as Senator Stevens indicated, in the Cold Bay airport a world-\nclass airport. Prior to the advent of the long-range 747, many of the \naircraft that traversed the North Pacific route had to land there for \nfuel. It was a big fueling base. Flying Tigers went in there for years \nand years and years. And to suggest that had a detrimental effect on \nthe wildlife patterns is clearly without any merit.\n  Furthermore, I would refer one more time to the fact that we have \nattempted to meet more than halfway every objection brought by the \nenvironmental community, even to the point of giving the Secretary of \nthe Interior the authority to direct the type of traffic on this road. \nMr. President, I think we have pretty well covered all the concerns, \nexcept some of the irrelevant and impractical considerations that have \nno bearing on reality.\n  So, I ask my colleagues, and the floor manager on the other side, how \nmuch time? Can we get an agreement on a vote? I could go on all day, \nbut I defer to the floor manager on the other side to see if we can get \nsome idea and certainty about how much more time they would like on \ntheir side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 55 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Arkansas has just under 126 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is a very difficult, a very \ndifficult undertaking for me for a number of reasons. No. 1, my \nprofound and unrestrained respect for the two Senators from Alaska who \nobviously feel very strongly about the issue. It gives me no pleasure \nto be on the other side.\n  I sit as ranking member on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nwhere Senator Murkowski is chairman. I have been on Appropriations for \n22 years where Senator Stevens is chairman. They are no different from \nany other Senators of the U.S. Senate who, when they have a problem, \nhave no hesitancy about doing everything they can to solve it for their \npeople. That is what we are all here for, to serve our people. So it is \nwith considerable regret that I find myself feeling compelled, however, \nto oppose the amendment and the bill.\n  Let me say, also, that lack of health care is not just peculiar to \nAlaska. I grew up in a community of 851 souls where we sometimes had \none doctor but most of the time we had none. My mother and father moved \nfrom a mountaintop farm into this little community of 851 people \nbecause my brother, who died before I was born--and who obviously, \nbeing firstborn, was the apple of my mother's eye--but we moved because \nhe died for lack of any medical care. That was a long time ago. But my \nmother told me many times that she told my father, ``We are moving off \nthis mountaintop. I am not going to live here and watch my babies die, \none at a time, for lack of medical care.''\n  I grew up with that story, so I grew up always trying to improve \nmedical care in my little hometown. Finally, after I went back there to \npractice law, we were able to obtain one doctor. We built him a clinic. \nWe fed him, we did everything in the world he asked us to do, and then \nhe was killed in a car wreck, and there we were, left without a doctor \nagain. It was only 30 minutes from a hospital, but if you are having a \nheart attack, that is too long. If you are having a massive heart \nattack, 30 minutes is too long.\n  So, as I say, I grew up knowing what it was like not to have any \nmedical care. We seldom had a doctor in our hometown. I can remember--\nand I have said this on the floor before--that growing up during the \nDepression was a tough enough time. You know, that is one of the \nreasons I have always been an unabashed social liberal, and the reason \nI must say I resent so many people who use the term ``liberal'' as a \ndenigrating term.\n  I often want to say, what is it about liberalism that you hate? Which \none of these programs that are considered liberal--for example, \nMedicare--would you repeal today? Or REA? Student loans? Or Pell \ngrants? Or the ability to know that you are drinking pure and clean \nwater? Or the ability to know that you are eating food that has been \nprepared under the most sanitary conditions? The list goes on and on \nand on and on of those things that were all considered liberal at the \ntime.\n  But you couldn't get anybody to go back to the poll tax system in the \nSouth. And I remember people in my State thought that was the end of \nthe world as we knew it, when people were\n\n[[Page S11259]]\n\nallowed to vote free, didn't have to pay a dollar for a poll tax.\n  Five black women came into my office 2 years ago, each one having \nbeen a victim of cancer of the breast. And I sat literally weeping with \nthose five women, some of whom were going to make it and some of whom \nwere not--but who said that they did not go to the doctor when they \nfirst felt the lump because they knew the doctor would either turn them \ndown or tell them that they had no medical insurance. What if they did \nhave cancer, they knew they were not going to be cared for. That was in \n1996. This is not when I was a child during the Depression. This was 2 \nyears ago. They were there to lobby me on behalf of a program they \ndidn't need to lobby me on. I was already for it.\n  But here these people were, 50 to 100 miles from Memphis and the \nfinest hospitals in America--and I will not give you the name of the \ntown they came from or where they had been denied health care. All I am \nsaying is a lot of people are denied health care because of race. \nOthers are denied health care because they don't have any insurance--45 \nmillion of them. They are not necessarily denied health care simply \nbecause they don't have insurance, but oftentimes that is the case.\n  Just as an aside, not particularly applicable to this debate, I \nremember every summer when people died of typhoid fever in my hometown \nbecause the outhouse was just about 20 steps away from the water well \nand we did not make the connection. But, you know, another one of those \nold liberal programs was free vaccinations. When I was in school we got \nsmallpox, typhoid and I forget the other shot. We always got those at \nthe school--free. The county health nurse administered the shots. That \nis what some people called the good old days. They weren't good old \ndays to me.\n  Will Rogers once said, ``The good old days ain't what they used to \nbe, and they never was.''\n  Well, one of the most difficult things I faced as Governor of my \nState was a highly charged issue of whether or not Lee County, AR, the \nthird poorest county in America, would get an OEO grant. Some of you \nare old enough to remember the Office of Economic Opportunity, another \none of those liberal programs that I remember President Nixon put a man \nin charge, specifically, to dismantle it. But there was a $1 million \ngrant for a clinic in Lee County, AR, as I said, one of the poorest \ncounties in America. It was designed to provide health care for African \nAmericans who had no place to go, and it became a black/white issue. \nThey got the money if I, as Governor, signed off on it, and they didn't \nget the money if I didn't sign off on it.\n  The first thing you know, a little violence broke out and I had to \nsend about 15 to 20 State Troopers into that town for about 4 or 5 days \nto restore and maintain the peace.\n  Those were very trying times. That sounds anachronistic today, but \nthat has been a short 27 years ago.\n  I did something that I knew was right that was very troublesome. I \nsigned the grant and, if you pardon the expression, all hell broke \nloose in that town. It was the county seat.\n  To shorten the story, today it is the primary health care center for \neverybody in that county.\n  An organization in New York about 2 weeks ago gave that clinic a \n$50,000 mobile van in order to keep people from coming in all the time. \nThe clinic will take the van around a three-county area. They will let \npeople know when it is coming. They will immunize children and so on. \nBetty, who is not only ``secretary of peace,'' but also has been very \nactive, she and Mrs. Carter, in immunizing all the children in this \ncountry, went down for the presentation of this van to that same clinic \nthat got the $1 million grant 27 years ago. Now, as I say, it is the \nprimary health care center for the entire county, black and white.\n  I say those things to preface my remarks about this issue. There \nisn't any question, nor does anybody I know of who opposes the \namendment and the bill--there isn't any question about the problem. \nCertainly the two Senators from Alaska understand these things in \nAlaska, so far as they are concerned, much better than I do. I \nunderstand, being a southerner from a relatively poor State, that a lot \nof people are deprived of health care for totally different reasons, \nand that is the reason I prefaced my remarks.\n  Here we are talking about a 30-mile road which, incidentally, as I \nunderstand it, will cost in the vicinity of $25 million to $30 million, \nand 8 of the 11 miles that go through the national wildlife refuge is \nthrough a wilderness area. As the senior Senator from Alaska said, the \nState of Alaska has some 40 million acres of wilderness areas, so what \non Earth are you talking about? Eight miles through a wilderness area? \nIt just sounds like such an infinitesimal problem, who can possibly \nobject? Who especially could object after hearing the two Senators from \nAlaska describe some of the people who died for lack of medical care.\n  The problem I have with it is the bill assumes that the road is the \nonly solution. If I believed it was the only solution, I would be a \ncosponsor of the amendment. But there is another imperative involved in \nit, and the Senator from Montana, who has performed yeoman service on \nthis amendment today, has already pointed it out. And that is, building \na road through wilderness in Alaska, no matter how short or how long, \nwill be the first time in this Nation that we have deliberately \nauthorized building a road through a wilderness area. Once you start \ndown that road, nobody knows where it is going to end.\n  I can tell you that probably 9 out of 10 people in my State, if you \njust present it to them as health care for people, they say, ``I don't \nunderstand the Government and the wilderness; that wilderness stuff \nnever made much sense to me anyway.''\n  It makes a lot of sense to me for a simple reason, and I had to come \nto the U.S. Senate before I really honed my conscience and my awareness \nof the fact that God just gave us one planet. He didn't say go ahead \nand throw all the greenhouse gases you can into the atmosphere or \nchlorofluorocarbons to destroy the ozone layer and I will give you \nanother one after you destroy the ozone layer and after you bring on \nglobal warming, with all the disastrous consequences. When you get \nthrough mining all the land and leaving all those wonderful \nenvironmental disasters, God didn't say, ``I'll give you another one \nand give you a second chance to see if you can do better next time.''\n  No, we only get one, and when you do irreversible damage to this \nplanet, you are destroying your children's and your grandchildren's \nheritage and their future, and you do it mindlessly while standing on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate talking about education and health care \nand everything else to indicate how much you love your children. When \nit gets to something as arcane as building a road through a wilderness, \nwho cares? But when you combine thousands of those little ``who \ncares?'' projects, the first thing you know, you have done a tremendous \namount of damage.\n  My staff gave me a thick briefing book, and I went through a good \nportion of it, but I guess I finally have to say the precedent worries \nme a lot. Once you start this, where do you stop? We have never done it \nbefore, and we ought not to start now.\n  No. 2, there are a lot of alternatives that even the State of Alaska \nis now studying. The Transportation Department of Alaska is studying \nwhat some of the options are to solving this problem, which ones would \nbe the best, most affordable, et cetera. The State of Alaska has taken \nno position on this, at least that is my understanding.\n  Why are we not talking about establishing some medical facilities in \nKing Cove? Why are we not talking about the use of Hovercraft? Senator \nStevens got a provision put in the transportation bill for $142 million \nfor new ferries in Alaska, and he got a provision put in the \ntransportation bill to build a causeway to solve the very problem we \nare talking about here today. I don't know what happened with that. I \nunderstand there was some dissension in the ranks over there about the \nadvisability of a causeway. I don't know. That even might be one of the \nsolutions to this.\n  There is an Indian Health Service in King Cove. We appropriate money \nevery year in the Interior appropriations bill, in 1996 to the tune of \n$380,000 to that facility. Before we spend $30 million to build a road, \nwhy not just put $1 million into the health service\n\n[[Page S11260]]\n\nfacility? Why not take the $30 million and put it in a trust fund and \nbuild a hospital, and then invite doctors up there and pay them \n$200,000, $300,000 a year to live there? That would be infinitely \nbetter than spending $27 million to $30 million on this road, 87 to 94 \npercent of which Uncle Sugar will pick up the tab.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my friend from Arkansas will yield.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if there is any reference in any material, as \nhe suggests, that we are going to spend $20 million or $30 million for \na road? I am sure he is aware there is no appropriation requested for \nany amount.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Of course. I understand the road will be built by the \nState of Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. But I also understand the Federal share of that will be \nsomewhere between 87 and 94 percent.\n  You think with that kind of money and what you can do--if you just \ntake the Federal share, cut Alaska out, take the 87 percent of whatever \nit is going to cost to build the road and establish a trust fund. I \npromise you, you will have doctors, you will have doctors and anybody \nyou want, with the income from such a trust fund.\n  But getting back to where I was a moment ago, you can improve the \nmedical facilities there. You can consider Hovercraft. Hovercraft is \nnot dependent on fog. You do not have to worry about fog conditions. A \nHovercraft is one of the alternatives that the state is studying. \nSometimes the waves may be too volatile to use Hovercraft. That is why \na combination of various alternatives may be necessary.\n  There is a man in Alaska named Dr. Peter Mjos who has written a \nletter. Dr. Mjos apparently is head of the Alaska Native Medical Center \nin Anchorage. It is a family practice center. He says:\n\n       I've been asked, as the Eastern Aleutian Tribes Medical \n     Director, to comment on the proposed King Cove to Cold Bay \n     road. The primary concern which has been raised is that of \n     safely evacuating individuals with medical emergencies.\n       Several concerns come to mind. On the surface, so to speak, \n     a road would appear to be the safest and easiest option, \n     however, the safety issue surrounding medi-vacs arises \n     primarily because of the extremely hazardous meteorologic \n     conditions which occur during an emergency. While flying is \n     obviously potentially hazardous--\n\n  And listen to this--\n\n       The proposed road in an Aleutian storm or blizzard could be \n     [just] as equally as hazardous when one considers nearly zero \n     visibility, nonexistence of other traffic over a [long] \n     distance of very isolated country, and, of course, the ever-\n     present winter dangers of avalanches.\n\n  What Dr. Mjos is saying is that a road is not a 100-percent solution \neither. There will be times when you will not be able to use the road--\na lot of ice, a lot of snow, avalanches in Alaska. He goes on to say:\n\n       Of much greater expediency, then, I would strongly \n     recommend several measures which would first, markedly \n     decrease the number of medi-vacs and second, would probably \n     be more reliable in the event of emergencies necessitating \n     medi-vacs.\n       Foremost would be the implementation of a state of the art \n     telemedicine system.\n\n  My chief of staff here in Washington told me one time about her \nfather when he was a young man suffered a head injury. And they took \nhim to Fort Smith, AR, which was about 50 or 60 miles away. There were \nno neurosurgeons in Fort Smith, AR, so a family doctor there--or maybe \nhe was a general surgeon; I do not know--they got a doctor in Oklahoma \nCity on the phone, and this surgeon in Fort Smith held the phone up to \nhis ear, and they operated on her father according to the way this \nneurosurgeon in Oklahoma City was telling him to do it.\n  Telemedicine is a lot more advanced than that today, but I use that \njust as an illustration to say sometimes telemedicine works.\n\n       Another option which would circumvent the hazards of \n     avalanches and isolated highway transportation would be that \n     of a state of the art ferry system which could operate in \n     virtually any climatic weather conditions. This would of \n     course obviate a drive on, drive off ferry with adequate \n     protection from unruly seas.\n\n  This is from a doctor who is the Eastern Aleutian Tribes Medical \nDirector.\n  Here is a letter from Myron P. Naneng, Sr., who is President of the \nAssociation of Village Council Presidents. He is writing to Chairman \nDon Young over in the House.\n\n       Dear Chairman Young: After careful examination of H.R. \n     2259--\n\n  Essentially the same bill we are debating here--\n\n     the King Cove Health and Safety Act of 1997, the Association \n     of Village Council Presidents, Inc. Waterfowl Conservation \n     Committee would like to request to be put on the record of \n     opposing such legislation. The bill provides for a transfer \n     of land interests in order to facilitate surface \n     transportation between the cities of Cold Bay and King Cove.\n       Although we empathize with the community of King Cove's \n     difficulty with safe air transportation to Anchorage, we find \n     that the proposed road would seriously interfere in our \n     endeavors to resuscitate our migratory bird populations. . .\n\n  And he goes on.\n  Mr. President, I offer these things simply because the Senator from \nAlaska is correct. I have never been to Cold Bay or King Cove, either \none. But apparently people who live there and who know the situation \nhave been, and they oppose it.\n  One of the most interesting things I have run across is this. No. 1--\nthe Senator from Montana has already covered this, and at the expense \nof being repetitious--Penn Air, the primary aircarrier between King \nCove and Cold Bay, makes 1,800 one-way flights between King Cove and \nCold Bay each year. That is 900 round trips. You divide that by 365, \nand that is about 2 1/3 round trips a day that Pen Air makes between \nKing Cove and Cold Bay.\n  Listen to this. Incidentally, three Pen Air flights have resulted in \naccidents in 20 years. Little Rock, AK, does not have a safety record \nthat compares with that. There were 20 medevacs from King Cove between \nJanuary 1996 and June 1997. That is roughly a year and a half--20 \nmedevacs. There was a delay for 5 of the 20; and of the 5 that were \ndelayed, 4 of them were delayed by no more than 4 hours; and the 5th \nwas successfully completed the next day.\n  You hear a lot about 11 fatalities between 1981 and 1997; 11 \nfatalities in that 16-year period. Six of the fatalities were the \nresult of a plane that was en route from Kodiak that crashed into the \nmountain.\n  I am going to tell you, flying around Alaska is no fun, under the \nbest of conditions. When I was in Alaska they kept me scared to death--\nthe bush pilots. We are talking about a 16-year period; 11 fatalities, \nand 6 of those from a plane that crashed coming from Kodiak, coming \nfrom an island the opposite side of King Cove from Cold Bay. A road \nbetween King Cove and Cold Bay would not have prevented that.\n  Another incident where one person was killed--this takes care of 7 of \nthe 11 over a 16-year period--was by a pilot who flew within a complete \nwhiteout condition after being warned not to do it.\n  Mr. President, I am not sure of the statistics involving who died and \nhow trying to get from King Cove to Cold Bay.\n  I want to say to my friend from Alaska that after all the studies are \ndone and it is determined that there is nothing else that is even \nfeasible except building this road, then I will rethink my position. I \ndon't blame the two Senators from Alaska for trying to honor the \nrequest of the people in their State on this.\n  One thing that has not been talked about is helicopters. You can buy \na regular ambulance helicopter for $4.7 million brand new; you can buy \none used for $1.5 million. They can always operate safer, and more \noften, than fixed-wing aircraft in bad weather. They are used \nconsistently by North Slope Borough Search and Rescue.\n  I won't belabor this any further except to say we have studies \nongoing by the Department of Transportation in Alaska. We ought to at \nleast show them the courtesy of letting them report, and then make up \nour mind after we have seen a detailed study. We should not \nprecipitously, here on the floor of the Senate, build the first road in \na wilderness in the history of the country without at least giving it \nmore than a passing thought.\n  I would be willing to accept the amendment of the Senator from Alaska \nand we can just vote up or down on the bill if that is agreeable with \nhim, if it is agreeable with some of my colleagues. I don't know how \nstrongly my\n\n[[Page S11261]]\n\ngood friend from Massachusetts feels, and I will be happy to yield to \nhim in a moment.\n  Finally, in my opinion--I have been wrong before in my opinions, but \nthis one is, I think, fairly safe--in my opinion, this bill will be \nvetoed. I don't know of anything, other than the Republican tax bill, \nthat the President feels more strongly about than this bill. The most \ncurrent information is that if it were presented to the President, his \nsenior advisers would recommend he veto the bill. This is one of those \nbills, if you present it, it looks like you are being terribly cruel, \nuntil you examine it very carefully and see all of the information. I \nurge the President to veto the bill. It will be a very tough bill to \nveto. I don't know whether we can uphold the veto or not. I don't know \nhow many votes we will get here this afternoon. He is absolutely \ndetermined to veto this bill.\n  It is a legitimate thing to talk about, and I hope that the studies \nwill show some alternate method of alleviating the problem other than \nbuilding a road through the wilderness for the first time.\n  I yield the Senator from Massachusetts such time as he may consume \nwithin the limits I have left. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ninety-two and a half minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President. I think the arguments have been \nextraordinarily well covered in the course of the afternoon by the \nSenator from Montana, the Senator from Arkansas, and also the Senators \nfrom Alaska.\n  I begin my comments by saying that I think this is one of those \ndifficult issues we are called on to come to the floor and debate, \nargue about, and to decide. I regret that because, in a sense, all of \nwhat the Senator from Alaska said is extraordinarily compelling with \nrespect to the plight of the citizens of King Cove. There is nobody \nhere who is not sensitive to the need to provide access to health care \nand who isn't going to be concerned that guaranteed emergency medical \nservices are available to people who need them. These are not just \ncitizens of Alaska, these are our citizens, too.\n  I think when we come to the floor of the Senate and make arguments on \nbehalf of all of our citizens in rural areas, which is what we are \ntalking about here. So I hope no one will construe in any way \nwhatever--and I am confident my colleagues have both said this and feel \nit--the notion that anything we are saying suggests an insensitivity to \nthe plight of the citizens of King Cove. But questions remain: What is \nthe best response to that plight? What is the best way to deal with the \neffort to provide emergency medical services for people who clearly \ndeserve them? There are, I think, simply rational, practical \ndifferences of opinion about how you balance the equities here.\n  We have a $700,000 appropriation in the Senate Transportation \nAppropriations bill to the Corps of Engineers to study what options may \nbe available in terms of alternate transportation for rural Alaska. So \nit is not as if this is an issue being looked at in a vacuum. It is \nalready on the radar screen of the U.S. Congress. We are already trying \nto find out what different alternatives may be available. But all \nalternatives have to be weighed against what this bill would represent.\n  We are talking about the first ever permanent new road construction \nin a federally-designated wilderness area--the first ever permanent new \nroad construction which will be maintained.\n  Now, it is true there are other miles of road within this wilderness \narea, but those were trails that were there before the area got its \nwilderness designation, and they are not being maintained. They will \nultimately some day grow over, except to the degree that hunters and \ntrekkers who may go up there use them, which is not sufficient, \nprobably, to maintain them.\n  The point we make is that a wilderness area is a wilderness area by \ndefinition. When you build a new road, you have taken away the notion \nof wilderness. The construction process alone is disruptive.\n  I have heard reference on the floor in this debate to the minimal \namount of traffic that may take place. But a road has to be maintained. \nThere is also something illogical in the notion that a road that is \nbeing built as an alternative to inclement weather and problems of \ntransportation--isn't Alaska going to present you with inclement \nproblems in terms of road travel? A whiteout is a whiteout. Road and \nvehicular travel is as much affected by an effort to go through a \nwhiteout and a blizzard as a flight. That raises many questions about \nother possibilities for this road.\n  When I look at the sum, the Senator from Alaska suggests this is not \ngoing to be a Federal expenditure, but in point of fact, 90 percent of \nhighway expenditures tend to come from the Federal Government even \nthough they go through the State treasury. The fact is, the cost of a \nroad is somewhere in the vicinity of $25 to $30 million. Just put $25 \nmillion or $30 million in an interest-free account and take your 10 \npercent or whatever, and you have $3 million of earnings a year. You \ncould build a mighty fine clinic for 100 people for a tenth of that \nsum. In fact, you might even pay a young doctor $250,000 a year to sit \nthere for a year if you really wanted to talk about cheaper \nalternatives, together with telemedicine giving you the capacity to do \nmany things, not to mention the possibility of the Federal Government \nand other kinds of emergency transportation that could be made \navailable.\n  I think when you weigh the various options here that are being looked \nat now, you may in the end, as the Senator from Arkansas has suggested, \ncome to the conclusion that this is the best alternative.\n  But it seems to me that my colleagues would be well advised and well \nserved to at least wait until the analysis is done in order to measure \nthat against the enormous environmental precedent that is set by \nauthorizing the first-ever permanent, maintained road in a wilderness \narea.\n  Let me just speak for a moment about the environmental concerns of \nrunning a 30-mile road from King Cove to Cold Bay through the Izembek \nrefuge and wilderness. Created in 1960, it is the Izembek National \nWildlife Refuge is an internationally recognized wildlife refuge \nbecause it is a major stopover on the Pacific flyway for hundreds of \nthousands of migrating waterfowl and other migratory birds. For \nexample, the entire North American population of Pacific black brant \nand most of the world's emperor geese use this isthmus as a crucial \nresting and feeding ground on their annual flights. These geese stop to \nfeed on this isthmus and once airborne continue 60 hours of consecutive \nflight until they reach parts of southern California and Mexico, losing \none-third of their body weight on the journey. Clearly, the protection \nof the feeding ground is critical to the health of these amazing birds.\n  Additionally, wildlife abound throughout the refuge which serves as a \nkey migration route for caribou herds as well as a denning ground for \nAlaskan brown bear. The proposed road would bisect the refuge's isthmus \nwhich narrows to less than three miles at some points. A road through \nthis pristine habitat would be more than harmful to its wildlife.\n  These are critical concerns. But we don't need to decide this issue \ntoday. Not doing that today does not deny any service whatsoever to the \ncitizens of Alaska. I think everybody who stands here asking the Senate \nto weigh the impact as to precedent of the first-ever maintained new \nroad in a wilderness area against the options that are being studied \nwould have to agree that there is no rationale for rushing to judgment \nagainst those options.\n  So I urge my colleagues, as difficult as I know it is--I certainly \nagree with the Senator from Arkansas. If the alternative proves that \nthis is the way to go, then the Congress, I am sure, will join in a \n100-0 vote to make that happen. I would certainly be one of those to do \nthat. But that is not where we find ourselves yet.\n  So I urge colleagues to exercise restraint, wait for the results of \nthe analysis, look at the alternatives, and measure that against the \nprecedent of what would happen in terms of wilderness construction in \nthis case.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of time for my side.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 54 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, let \nme\n\n[[Page S11262]]\n\npoint out a few things that are germane to the debate.\n  The Committee on Natural Resources held hearings on October 15 on the \nissue of Cold Bay and reported the bill out of the committee. So to \nsuggest that somehow this particular issue has not seen the light of \nday or committee action is inappropriate.\n  We have heard in the discussion comments relative to the \nenvironmental impact of the road. If my assistant will help me, again I \nwill show you pictures of the roads that are there. These aren't ghost \nroads, they are real roads. We have shown them to you before. That is \nthe reality. These are the roads that are there. OK. Some of these \nroads are there and they are in the wilderness.\n  Here is the map that shows where the roads break off and go into the \nwilderness, as opposed to those that are not in the wilderness. Few of \nthe Members who have commented really want to reflect on this harsh \nreality. I will point out the roads in the wilderness that are there \ntoday. They are in the dark area here, as you can see with the pointer. \nThis distinguishes the marking line that establishes the wilderness, so \nit is everything on the top of the picture that is wilderness.\n  So the point is, there are roads in the wilderness. As we look at the \nenvironmental impact of those roads, they are what they are. They are \ndependent on about 100 people who live in Cold Bay and have access to \nthose roads. Again, there are about 700 people in King Cove. So the \nimpact is pretty small.\n  Now, there was a mention by my friend from Montana that the reason \nthe migratory waterfowl stopped in this area, you can recognize that it \nis a flat, tundra-like expanse with no trees. But the Senator from \nMontana knows the real reason that the black brants stopped there is \nfor the eel grass; that is where the eel grass is, and they come and \nfeed. He is quite correct.\n  It is a unique day when, sometime in October, mid-October, and the \nwind currents are right, the brants take off, and their next point of \nlanding is Cabo San Lucas in the Baja peninsula of Mexico. They \nactually go from this particular point, Izembek Bay, and they lose \nnearly a third of their body weight. The flight of these geese is \nreally one of the wonders of the world. Hunting season is open by the \nU.S. Wildlife Service, and people hunt. I hunt, if I am able, with my \nfriends, and we hunt geese. The lives of these geese are dependent on a \nnumber of factors. One is a recognition that hunting is allowed. This \njust isn't a plain wetlands, it is a unique wetlands. But the question \nis, Is it threatened by this activity? There is no evidence to suggest \nthat it is threatened.\n  Again, I emphasize this, and I think my friend from Massachusetts, in \nhis comments a few minutes ago, missed the point. We are not talking \nabout a road in the wilderness. He made the point that this would be \nthe first road in the wilderness. This isn't a road in the wilderness, \nas I have said time and time again on the floor today. This is a land \nexchange. We are proposing to take the area in exchange by providing \nabout 580 acres of additional wilderness in exchange for about 78 or 87 \nacres, if you will.\n  What we are going to do is do a refuge with the exchange. We are \ngoing to put this area into a refuge, and then we are going to add to \nthe wilderness the yellow areas, which is a substantial increase of 580 \nacres. It is a net, net, net gain.\n  How can anybody who is interested in acquiring more wilderness be \nagainst this when there are 580 acres of additional wilderness being \noffered? We are doing a land exchange and putting the proposed road \nthrough the refuge. It is a big difference. We are not setting a \nprecedent. I wish the staffs listening to this would recognize that \nthere is no road going through a wilderness. There is a wilderness \nexchange. We are putting it in a refuge and it is a net, net increase.\n  Hovercraft is an interesting mode of transportation. I wish it were a \nviable alternative. We have had lots of experience with Hovercraft in \nAlaska. They require a tremendous amount of maintenance. They are very \nexpensive to operate. Mind you, we are talking about, again, 700 people \nin King Cove--a very small population. Who is going to underwrite the \ncost of the Hovercraft? You have to have it available year-round, and \nmaintenance, and you have to have operating personnel.\n  If you have ever been in a Hovercraft--and I have--they are a unique \nmode of transportation. They skid, because you have a lift from a fan \nthat lifts the vehicle up over whatever it is, whether it is water, \nice, or tundra. Then you have another fan that gives you movement \nahead. But as you turn, you have no rudders. The Hovercraft has a \ntendency to skid because there is no rudder, in a sense, that basically \ndigs in and gives immediate direction. You have to be careful when you \nare moving a Hovercraft and you come up on any cut banks. They will \nmake a corner, but they skid as they go around the corner and you can \nbang into a cut bank where the edge of the river is and you could find \nyourself in trouble. It takes a good deal of experience to operate \nthese, and the cost of operation is extremely high.\n  We have roads all over the United States, and, sure, they cost money. \nPeople use them and they facilitate the lifestyle of the people. \nSomebody said $30 million could build the road. Well, you are pulling \nthat out of some kind of a study, or whatever. These roads that are in \nthese pictures certainly don't cost $30 million a mile. We have \nestimates that the type of road we are talking about is substantially \nless--somewhere less than $5 million or $6 million. You are not talking \nabout anything substantial here, as the occupant of the Chair knows. \nThere is no drainage on either side, and they are not ditched.\n  There is another thing I am confounded about in this debate. They \ntalk about avalanches. I defy anybody looking at this picture to tell \nme where the avalanche is going to come from. This is tundra. This is \nwhere you are talking about putting a road in the refuge. They are not \ntalking about any avalanches in the refuge.\n  Whether it is refuge, or, as my friend from Massachusetts indicates, \nwilderness, there are no cliffs. Where is the snow going to hang from \nto avalanche? There is near King Cove some hilly area, but that is in a \ndifferent area than we are proposing a land exchange. That is really \nnot part of the argument over whether you are going to have an \navalanche potential. And, obviously, you have the potential of \navalanches in areas where you have deep snow.\n  King Cove isn't one of them, I might add. You have them in areas \nwhere you have heavy concentrations of snow, like Valdez, and other \nareas. That is not a legitimate concern. But to lump this in the \narguments that we have a wilderness, a bird sanctuary, that we have \navalanches and mountains, and we can duck hunt. You don't duck hunt \nfrom the mountains. It is a composite of the areas that we are talking \nabout. But the land exchange is just what it is. It is in this tundra \narea, and you are not subjected, as indicated by the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service, to any extreme elements such as snow that would be \nput in their advisory, which they make available to all visitors.\n  The state-of-the-art ferry we have discussed. Who is going to pay for \nit? A ferry suggests a crew, and several millions of dollars. We just \nbuilt a new ferry. What was it, a couple hundred million dollars? \nObviously, we are talking about a different type of ferry. It costs a \nlot of money.\n  They talk about Penn Air. They do a fine job. We are talking about \ntwo trips a day. Do you know how many passengers that airplane carries \nin two trips a day? It is not a 747. It is not even a DC-3. It is a \nPiper Navajo. It carries six people. That is what you are looking at. \nThey say, ``Wow. Two trips a day, 1100 in a year.'' That is a six-\npassenger airplane.\n  Another thing that I think is important to note as we debate this--\nand the other side throws figures around--is the Congressional Budget \nOffice has determined that this bill is revenue neutral. The point was \nmade, ``Well, you know. If the State decides to build this road \nsomeday, it can use its share of Federal funds that the State \nreceives.'' Who are any of you to criticize what our State determines \nare its priorities with its share of the Federal funds? The suggestion \nwas made here on the floor a few minutes ago that you shouldn't. If you \ndo, that is on this road in the refuge. That is nobody's business but \nAlaska's, thank you very much.\n  We talk about, ``Well, let's put this off a little longer.'' We have \nbeen doing\n\n[[Page S11263]]\n\nit for 14 years. We have 10 studies. We have a book of them. I don't \nknow.\n  Mr. President, these aren't very well dusted off. But here are just \nabout eight of the studies over the last 14 years. And some of you \nrecommend that we continue to do what? Do nothing; do studies. I am \nsure that the people who do these studies are glad to hear that.\n  There has been some talk about a causeway. What is a causeway, Mr. \nPresident? I know the occupant of the Chair knows what it is. It is \nkind of a road, isn't it? It is an access over an area called a \ncauseway. It carries a road. This was the proposed study by the Corps \nof Engineers. Somebody suggested that $700,000 is in the bank. Well, I \nwould be willing to make a small wager to any Member that we don't see \nthat money. That $700,000, if it exists at all, in my opinion is pie in \nthe sky at this time.\n  The point is that while we look at alternatives, we have been looking \nat them for 14 years. We can look at them again. But the constituents \nthat I have are saying enough is enough. We can study options until the \ncows come home.\n  I noted that the Senator from Arkansas indicated that he had a letter \nfrom one Myron Naneng who is associated with the Association of Village \nCouncil Presidents. What my friend does not know about the AVCP is that \ntheir major concern is the spring bird hunt. The Senator from Montana \nknows. People, for their subsistence, are allowed to take migratory \nbirds in the spring.\n  What we have here is a little bitterness, if you will, which occurs \nsometimes between he, I, and others, differences of opinion. This \nparticular AVCP individual has taken it upon himself to express his \nopinion, which he certainly has every right to do, but his interest is \nto protect the rights of the village council president to proceed with \ntheir spring bird hunts. I have supported that position as a \nsubsistence use.\n  There is also a criticism. They have a little infighting between the \ngroups. There is a lack of support for a curtailment of the \ninterception of the fisheries issue as far as fall trapping. There is a \nlittle dispute between the residents of King Cove and the village \ncouncil presidents.\n  So do not take this with a grain of salt, Mr. President, because the \nmore appropriate reference is the attitude of the collective voice of \nthe Native people of Alaska. That is expressed by the Alaska Federation \nof Natives.\n  I have a letter here dated April 29 addressed to me.\n\n       Dear Chairman Murkowski:\n       Attached, please find a copy of the 1997 AFN Convention \n     resolution.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter from the Alaska Native Brotherhood. In that \nparticular letter, it says:\n\n       The Juneau Camp of the Alaska Native Brotherhood supports \n     the Alaska Congressional Delegation effort to connect King \n     Salmon and Cold Bay.\n       Please accept our appreciation for your efforts.

We do \n     have occasion to meet with Alaska Native organizations on \n     subsistence issues and subsistence management. There are \n     discussions of local interest matters, such as fish and \n     wildlife habitat and access to interest areas. Persons of \n     these areas have contacted us on this matter.\n       The Juneau ANB supports funding for the Izembek Road that \n     would provide safe access from Cold Bay to the King Salmon \n     areas. It is our understanding that wildlife habitat areas \n     would not be adversely affected, and that the Local Natives \n     do attend to habitat areas anyway.\n       Please accept our appreciation for your efforts. This may \n     save a life, while responding to sensitive issues.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 Jeffrey Anderson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that a \nlisting from the King Cove Clinic from April 1998 to present day \ncovering medevacs be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        King Cove Clinic Medivacs From April 1998 to Present Day\n\n       April 3: Chest Pain, Airplane, 2 hr. delay;\n       April 14: Chest Pain, Airplane, \\1/2\\ hr. delay;\n       May 5: Abdominal Pain, Airplane, 1 hr. delay;\n       May 11: Chest Pain, Airplane, No delay;\n       May 31: Chest Pain, Airplane, No delay;\n       June 19: Abdominal Pain, Airplane, No delay;\n       June 24: Abdominal Pain, Airplane, No delay;\n       June 26: Chest Pain, Airplane, No delay;\n       June 27: Baby Fever of Unknown Origin, Airplane, No delay;\n       July 5: Possible Tendon Laceration, Airplane, 1 day delay;\n\n[[Page S11264]]\n\n       July 6: Chest Pain, Airplane, 3 hr. delay;\n       July 28: Abdominal Pain, Helicopter, 1 day delay;\n       July 28: Abdominal Pain, Helicopter, 1 day delay;\n       August 9: Miscarriage, Airplane, No delay; and\n       August 28: Pneumonia, Airplane, 1 hr. delay.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I might add that from April 3rd to August 28th, there were 16 \nspecific medevacs. The first one on April 3rd, there was a 2-hour \ndelay; 14th, 1-hour delay; May 5, an hour delay; no delays in the two \nin May; there were no delays in June; on July 5, there was a 1-day \ndelay. Not an hour, Mr. President, a 1-day delay; July 8, 3-hour delay; \nJuly 28, 1-day delay; July 28, 1-day delay; August 9, a miscarriage, no \ndelay; August 20, pneumonia, 1-day delay.\n  These are the official records that indicate what is really \nhappening. The only difference is this is summertime. This is the good \nweather.\n  Try it on October, November, December, or January.\n  To give you some idea, this is from the National Weather Service, \nMarine Desk, lower south side Alaska peninsula, including waters near \nCold Bay and King Cove. On the following days in March, small craft \nadvisory warnings; winds between 25 and 34 knots were issued, not only \non the 7th, 8th, 11th, 13th, 17th, 19th, 20th, and 21st, but on the \nfollowing days in March of the same year, gale warnings of 35 to 50 \nknots were issued on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 12th, 15th, 16th, \n22nd, 25th, 26th, 31st.\n  There is more air around there than there certainly is around here.\n  And the following days in March wind advisories greater than 50 knots \nwere issued, on the 23d, 24th, 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th. Only 5 days \nduring the month were there no marine advisories in this area. That is \nwhat we are talking about in Cold Bay and King Cove. It is not just \nonce in a while.\n  Now, what is hypocrisy? Well, let's try this on for consideration. It \nmight be the Clinton administration and the Washington green lobby \nopposing a small, one-lane gravel road in an Alaska wildlife refuge to \nallow a few Aleut Native people to reach emergency medical care while \nat the same time allowing an international airport to expand a runway--\na runway, Mr. President--into a wildlife refuge which is the home to \nendangered species and provides essential habitat for waterfowl and \nmigratory birds. Where is the Senator from Arkansas? Where is the \nSenator from Montana? Where is the Senator from Massachusetts? Where is \nthe righteousness as to what is happening?\n  Well, I see a look of concern. On September 21, 1998, the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service announced that they had reached an agreement with \nthe Metropolitan Airport Commission to allow a new runway at the \nMinneapolis-St. Paul International Airport which would severely impact \nthe Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Bloomington, MN. The \nMinnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge currently consists of 9,429 \nacres of land. This agreement will require the replacement of 4,000 \nacres of refuge land which will be impacted by what? Well, let's try \naircraft noise. I quote. Here it comes, gentlemen.\n\n       ``We would have preferred to keep our refuge and our \n     programs intact,'' says Rich Schultz, refuge manager. ``But \n     we certainly recognize the need for safe, reliable air \n     transportation so I am glad we were able to come to an \n     agreement at least in principle. It will take a lot of effort \n     to relocate our facility's programs, but this should be done \n     to allow us to provide additional opportunities for our \n     growing Metro population.''\n\n  Well, what is hypocrisy, Mr. President? Perhaps there is no \ncomparison between the minimal potential impact on wildlife from a \nsmall gravel road with an occasional--an occasional--car passing in a \n300,000 acre wildlife refuge in an area that is excluded from the \nwilderness and the hundreds of jets--hundreds? Come on, let's talk \nabout thousands of jets--taking off each week from an international \nairport over a smaller, 9,000 acre refuge in Minnesota.\n  Well, we have heard the Senator from Arkansas say the President is \ngoing to veto this. We have heard that before. Well, charity starts at \nhome, Mr. President. The Clinton administration has made a purely \npolitical decision, and I think it is a cruel one at that. It takes \ninto consideration not the people of King Cove or their dreams of \naccess. It would deny medical care for Alaska Natives while giving the \npopulation of Minneapolis a jetway with enormous impacts on the \nenvironment with regard to noise and air pollution.\n  Well, I guess that is the way it goes around here. But nevertheless, \nI think everyone would recognize there is certainly an injustice. \nImagine that. The excuse is the refuge manager recognizes the need for \nsafe, reliable transportation. But here again we are proceeding to \nallow a new runway that would impact on the Minnesota Valley National \nWildlife Refuge in Bloomington, MN, consisting of 9,429 acres of land \nand the agreement will require the replacement of 4,000 acres of refuge \nland.\n  So there we have it, Mr. President. What is good for the goose is \ngood for the gander, somebody once said. Now, I don't know if there is \na value, commercial value in expanding that runway, but I would let the \nexample speak for itself.\n  There are a couple more things I want to say in conclusion. Staff did \na good job of preparing to respond to some of the statements that have \nbeen made in the debate, and I would be remiss not to address them at \nthis time. We have done a little research here, and I hope that our \ncomments are an accurate reflection because they are taken from the \nRecord.\n  Back on Tuesday, September 29, the statement by the Senator from \nMontana states:\n\n       Mr. President, the rider establishes a very troubling \n     precedent. Congress has never authorized the construction of \n     a road through a wilderness area.\n\n  The fact is the proposal does not authorize construction of a road \nthrough a wilderness. I think I made that point time and time again. \nThe language authorizes a boundary adjustment which Congress routinely \nhas used to provide access through wilderness areas, most notably, the \nLee Metcalf Act of 1983, which withdrew several acres in Montana for a \nroad to a fishing hole. I know my colleague already addressed that.\n  Later the Senator from Montana said:\n\n       The bill would cut the refuge in half.\n\n  Well, the refuge is 300,000 acres. The proposed road corridor skirts \nthe very edge of the refuge impacting only less than 0.3 percent of the \nrefuge land. The proposed road corridor is 3 miles south, south mind \nyou, of the Izembek lagoon complex and is separated by 3 miles of \nterrain. The reason you move it back is an obvious one. You want to get \naway from the immediate tidal wetlands area and put it in a little \nhigher area of elevation.\n  Further, the Senator from Montana indicated:\n\n       Mr. President, this is a road that now exists in part of \n     the wilderness area. This is what is there now. This is what \n     would be contemplated. As you can tell, it is a pretty good \n     size road. It is no small, little cow path.\n\n  And that was the picture the Senator had. The facts are the road \nwould be, well, not more than 60 feet wide taking up only 85 acres \nthrough 7 miles of the refuge. In return, the Natives would return 664 \nacres--664 acres of privately owned lands to the refuge. The road would \nbe constructed of gravel, like many of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife roads \nthat are already present in the refuge. So I think that is a factual \nrebuttal.\n  And if I may continue. Furthermore, on September 29, the Senator from \nMontana indicated:\n\n       There are many ways to address the legitimate \n     transportation problems at King Cove without violating the \n     Izembek refuge: Coast Guard air evacuation is one; better \n     port facilities and special marine ambulances are another; as \n     well as telemedicine and other medical advances.\n\n  We have been studying it for 14 years. The fact is the Coast Guard \ndoes not, will not, and cannot handle the dangerous conditions \nassociated with the numerous land-based evacuations. It is a policy \nmatter. To do so would put lives at risk and would fundamentally alter \nthe Coast Guard's mission, which is a sea mission. You have 20-foot \nseas, and 50-knot winds are not uncommon in the area. Portions of Cold \nBay can freeze in the winter. Telemedicine, of course, as we have heard \nfrom Senator Frist, while of benefit, will not reattach limbs and \ncertainly cannot alter the care of premature births.\n  There was a reference further by the Senator from Montana:\n\n       The fact of the matter is when you look a lot deeper into \n     this, the real impetus behind\n\n[[Page S11265]]\n\n     the road may not be emergency medical evacuation. That is not \n     the real driving force here. Really, it is that the folks \n     there have an economic interest in having a road.\n  Mr. President, this road is about saving lives. The economics is not \npart of the equation. Marine transportation is the manner in which the \nproducts in cold storage, in the canning operation, in fish processing, \nmove. They move traditionally that way because the value of the product \nsimply does not support moving it by air, and anybody in the business \nwill tell you so, including the residents there.\n  But last, no one on the other side has addressed this: We provide the \nauthority for the Secretary of the Interior to close the road for \nnonemergency use. What more could we do? If he sees this road is being \ninappropriately used, he can close it, he can limit it--whatever. This \nis about lives.\n  What has happened here is extremely unfortunate. The leaders in the \nenvironmental community, some of whom may be listening--I hope they \nare--somehow have decided to dig in on this. ``Break your pick on this \none. This is the issue.''\n  It is the issue at whose expense? The Aleut people in King Cove. They \nare too far away to be heard from. It is too expensive to go out and \nsee them. So we will just stand on this one. Let me tell you what our \nhealth care providers say when they speak up, and these are people who \nare treating people in rural Alaska. It is an issue of access. It is an \nissue of life. There it is. I quote:\n\n       The greatest limiting factor to air ambulance is weather \n     and the condition of the airport [at King Cove]. Being able \n     to use the Cold Bay facility will enhance our ability to get \n     in and continue care of patients . . . if the road saves one \n     life, it's worth it.\n\n  This is from Dean C. Dow, MICP, Lifeflight Emergency Evacuation \nService, Alaska Regional Hospital, Anchorage.\n  They are out there, taking care of the people who use the medivac.\n  The next one:\n\n       Distance between communities in Alaska dwarfs many states \n     in the Lower 48 and telecommunications are often sketchy. A \n     wise person once said, ``If a successful fax transmission is \n     a blessing, then successful telemedicine transmissions could \n     be a miracle . . . the telehealth system will not carry a \n     human body that needs advanced medical care . . . it will \n     only enhance medical care. It will not remove the need for \n     treacherous evacuations that so often take place from King \n     Cove.''\n\n  Kathy Boucha-Roberts, director of alliances and telemedicine, \nProvidence Health System, Anchorage.\n  Next one:\n\n       All we want is safe access for our people. We see the road \n     as our only hope.\n\n  Della Trumble, King Cove Native Corporation:\n\n       The King Cove Medical Clinic (a small, four-room building) \n     [that is all they have] is forced to take drastic measures \n     and lose critical time in attempting to complete a medivac--\n     travel by boat in dangerous sea conditions . . . a road \n     between King Cove and Cold Bay would bring us to our Medivac \n     flight and into the 20th Century in emergency response.\n\n  Let's see the picture. This is the facility at King Cove. It has the \nRed Cross on it. That is it. If you get your leg broken, have a baby--\nwhatever--that is all you have. It is a lot better than nothing. But \nwhen you are in need of something--look at cloud cover here. You might \nsee that in the picture. This is a good day in King Cove, believe me.\n  The last one:\n\n       Inclement weather severely impacts prompt medical air \n     evacuations. Medivac by fishing vessel is directly affected \n     by wind, ice and poor visibility, making offloading the \n     patient on a dock extremely stressful and hazardous . . . the \n     King Cove Rescue Squad believes that the road to Cold Bay is \n     a necessary alternative to existing air and boat medivac.\n\n  Marilyn Mack, emergency medical technician, King Cove.\n  Mind you, this is an effort by 700 people, a very small village, to \nbe heard in the Congress of the United States. Let us see what our \nMembers have said about access to health care. Some have said access to \nhealth care is a right. I agree.\n\n       It is absolutely essential that Montanans have access to \n     quality health care without having to cover massive \n     distances. Sometimes getting to a hospital can be the \n     difference between life and death.\n\n  That is my good friend, the Senator from Montana.\n\n       We have the best health care in the world in many respects, \n     but it is available to people only if they are able to access \n     the kind of doctors they need . . . people ought to be able \n     to seek emergency room care if they need emergency room care.\n\n  That is my friend, Senator Dorgan. I agree.\n\n       Denying our citizens an opportunity to participate in the \n     greatest advances that are taking place in the medical \n     profession is effectively a death sentence . . . it is really \n     an issue of lifesaving protections.\n\n  Senator Ted Kennedy, Massachusetts.\n\n       We must ensure that quality health care is there for people \n     when they need it . . . we must protect patients from \n     decisions made by accountants and bureaucrats in insurance \n     companies and have their health care decisions made by \n     physicians.\n\n  Senator Barbara Boxer.\n\n       Patients should have access to health care professionals \n     who are qualified to treat their conditions and not forced to \n     accept people without the proper professional credentials . . \n     . if a doctor believes a certain treatment is necessary, as a \n     matter of right, that doctor's judgment should prevail.\n\n  Senator Robert Torricelli, New Jersey.\n  That is what some of our colleagues are saying about the right to \nhave access to health care. That is what I am saying, what our senior \nSenator is saying--the right to have access, the best access, the most \npractical access. It is the access that would be brought about by this \nexchange which we are proposing, an exchange in the wilderness for an \nadditional area of wilderness of about 580 acres.\n  Mr. President, I inquire of the time remaining on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 19 minutes 18 \nseconds; 85 minutes 11 seconds for the other side.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I retain the remainder of my time. I am not sure what \nthe leadership has in mind. It is my understanding there might be an \nopportunity for a vote around 5 o'clock. If that is likely to occur, it \nis almost 5 o'clock.\n  I think there is a special briefing going on at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this has been a good debate. A lot of \nfacts have come out. I might just note parenthetically, I chuckled a \nlittle bit. Here we are at the late stages of this debate. I concede to \nthe Senator he has won the chart war. I have never seen so many charts \nin a debate in all my life. I acknowledge to the Senator he has a lot \nmore charts than I have, and they are pretty good charts.\n  Also, he has all that staff there. I see the army--there are about 10 \nback there on his side. He has won the staff war. We have only a couple \nor three on our side. He has won the chart war. He has won the staff \nwar. And he has also won the time war. He has used a lot more time than \nwe have. I will be very brief.\n  Basically, there are a couple of points I want to make for the \nRecord, for the Senator. He asked, very interestingly: Nobody has \nanswered the point that the Secretary of the Interior, the refuge \nmanager, basically controls this road.\n  The fact is, in the bill itself there are provisions that the refuge \nmanager--that is, the Secretary of the Interior--works with--I think it \nis the Aleutian Boroughs--to try to come up with a Joint Plan for the \noperation of the road. But the bill further provides, if no agreement \nis reached, that the borough controls. The borough can just decide \nwithin 24 months that that is what it wants to do.\n  So it is not quite accurate to say this road is under the control of \nthe Department of the Interior. The fact is, as a practical matter, \nmaybe earlier, but certainly within 24 months, this road is under the \ncontrol--if there is a road--of the State.\n  The second point: The State of Alaska is not for this road. The State \nof Alaska takes no position on this road. We do not have any \ncorrespondence from the State of Alaska, particularly from the \nTransportation Department of the State of Alaska, saying we want this \nroad, we support this bill. There is nothing that says, ``We support \nthis bill.'' Rather, the State department takes no position.\n  Let me just read what the Transportation Department of Alaska says: \n``You have inquired about the status of our study efforts, etc.'' I \nwill not read the whole letter.\n  Basically, the letter concludes on page 2:\n\n\n[[Page S11266]]\n\n\n       Until the Transportation Needs Assessment and the \n     Facilities Concept Report have been completed, we will not be \n     in a position to propose the preferred alternative nor will \n     we know how the King Cove-Cold Bay project is rated against \n     other transportation projects. Therefore we have no position \n     on the legislation currently pending in Congress.\n  I think that is because that is a sound conclusion. That is why the \nState of Alaska, at least the department of transportation, takes that \nposition because it makes sense. There is the basic study that is going \non. It is an Alaska study. My good friend from Alaska says, ``Gee, we \nhave enough studies here.'' My answer is, light a fire under the State; \nget them to conclude the study.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the Senator----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. When I finish I will. Let them conclude the study so the \nState can recommend what alternative makes the most sense.\n  He also said, ``I don't know where the $700,000 is.'' It is in the \ntransportation appropriations bill right now. It passed the Senate. The \nlanguage is there.\n  I don't want to get in tit-for-tat business. It is not productive. He \nmade the statement implying maybe this Senator has no idea about bottom \nfishing in Alaska and what the economics are.\n  I am actually getting my view--it is not my view, but I am reporting \nwhat the Alaska Intermodal Transportation Plan says. It has a statement \non page 13 of its plan. This is dated October of 1994. I grant it is a \nfew years old.\n  Essentially, it says King Cove's economy is almost exclusively \ndependent upon fishing and fish processing. It has been a major fishing \ncenter in southwest Alaska for over 75 years. The salmon cannery has \noperated since 1911; crab processing since 1958; fish roe processing \nsince 1960. In the seventies and eighties, the bottom fishing industry \nexpanded. Peter Pan Seafoods is the largest employer, employing 250 to \n300 persons in its cannery operation in King Cove. Commercial fishing \naccounts for approximately 100 jobs.\n  It goes on to say that because of limited access, today the seafood \nmarket in King Cove is restricted. I am reporting from the Alaska \nreport. It further provides that most product is sold directly to Peter \nPan. Peter Pan now moves some fresh fish--fresh fish--into niche \nmarkets they have identified with low volumes. Without alternatives, \ncommercial fishermen must settle for the going rate of about 35 cents \nto 40 cents a pound.\n  It goes on to say it is estimated that with better access--that is \nmost probably the road to Cold Bay--to fresh fish markets, the same \nfish could be sold at a price of upwards of 70 to 80 cents a pound, \nnearly double what fishermen now receive.\n  It goes on to say essentially that this access would provide for a \nlot more fresh fish access in addition to the frozen. Basically, 5 \npercent of their processing production, which would be close to 2 \nmillion pounds a year, will be moved by road to an airport to fly \ndirectly to fresh fish markets.\n  I am just answering the Senator by saying this is what the State of \nAlaska says. I take the Alaska Intermodal Transportation Plan at its \nword, but if they are incorrect, then I stand to be corrected.\n  The point about whether this cuts into a wilderness area or not, it \nis pretty clear that this road we are talking about does. By the way, \nwhen the Senator showed a picture of the tundra, he said, ``Oh, there \nare no avalanches here.'' What he was not showing is sections of the \nroad down here which bisects streams and mountain areas, that is where \nthe avalanches would occur. They would not occur up closer to Cold Bay. \nBut this road does cut this wilderness in half.\n  This is the whole area, basically, we are talking about, where the \nwaterfowl feed. This is the road that would go up here and down back \naround to Cold Bay. With truck traffic from the processing plant and \nthe other traffic on the road, it is pretty clear it would bisect the \narea.\n  It is constructing a new road in a wilderness. The Senator says that \nis not true. I think it is true, and I will let people decide for \nthemselves whether it is true or not. I say it is true because here is \nthe wilderness right now and there is the road. It looks like to me \nthere is a road in the wilderness area.\n  The response is, ``We will just take that out of wilderness and put \nthe road there, and because we take the wilderness away, it is not a \nroad in wilderness.'' That is too clever by half, Mr. President. We \nknow what is going on here. It is a road in the wilderness. We have \nnever done that. We have not constructed a road through wilderness from \none point outside wilderness to another point outside wilderness. We \nhave never done that; never.\n  I recognize that we may have to do that. If the only option to \nprovide medical care and emergency services is a road, but we don't \nknow that yet. There are a lot of options being studied. I say let's \nlet the State of Alaska complete its study, or the $700,000 the senior \nSenator from Alaska put in the appropriations bill to study rural \naccess, then we will see. If it turns out we have to have this road, I \nwill be one of the first Senators to stand on this floor and reconsider \nmy position, but we are not there yet. I don't think we should take \nprecipitous action today and prejudge by saying we have to build this \nroad.\n  Finally, on another point, the President will veto this bill if it \npasses. I hope it doesn't pass, but if it does pass, he will veto it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement of administration policy be \nprinted in the Record.\n  I will read the first sentence:\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 1092, and, if \n     presented to the President, his senior advisers would \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n       (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the \n     concerned agencies.)\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 1092, as amended, if \n     presented to the President, his senior advisers would \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n       S. 1092 would create an objectionable and unprecedented \n     perpetual right-of-way through portions of the Izembek \n     National Wildlife Refuge and Izembek Wilderness for building \n     a public road and maintaining utility-related fixtures \n     between the communities of King Cove and Cold Bay in Alaska. \n     Specifically, S. 1092 would set a precedent by removing lands \n     from wilderness in a land exchange to build a new road. S. \n     1092 is not compatible with the purposes for which the Refuge \n     was established and would waive important environmental laws. \n     As a result, S. 1092 would disrupt the habitat of many \n     important species, including internationally-unique waterfowl \n     populations and cause irreparable damage to the ecological \n     integrity of this pristine wilderness area. Finally, the bill \n     would undermine the intent of the recently enacted bipartisan \n     ``National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997.''\n       The Administration recognizes the need to ensure adequate \n     emergency medical care for the remote community of King Cove. \n     The Administration will continue working with the State of \n     Alaska and other interested parties to explore different \n     transportation alternatives.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In summation, I thank the Senator for the debate. It has \nbeen a good debate. We have been here, what, almost 5 hours. The \nSenator from Arkansas, the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from \nTennessee, both Senators from Alaska have argued this issue. I thank \nthe Senator, again, for taking this issue up on the floor and not as a \nrider on the appropriations bill. That is the better way to make public \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, I don't think there are any more speakers on our side. \nWe are ready to accept the amendment and at the appropriate time vote \non the bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are still waiting on this side for \nan indication from the leadership about disposition of this. My \nunderstanding is we can anticipate a vote very shortly, but I have to \ndefer, pending clarification.\n  In the meantime, I want to clarify the Record. The Senator from \nMontana suggested that the State of Alaska does not support this road. \nLet me read a statement from the Anchorage Daily News, Wednesday, June \n7, 1995. It reads as follows:\n\n       Knowles--\n\n  Who is our Governor--\n\n       Says he favors a road to Whittier, a 16-mile link between \n     Nondalton and Itulilik, and a 20-mile road between King Cove \n     and Cold Bay on the Alaskan Peninsula.\n\n  That was the Anchorage Daily News, Wednesday, June 7, 1995.\n  Relative to another matter that was brought up by my friend on the \nassessment of transportation needs by the\n\n[[Page S11267]]\n\nAlaska Department of Transportation, let me read a synopsis, and that \nis:\n\n       Based on a comparison with other alternatives, the road \n     alternative provides a positive benefit stream throughout the \n     life of the project with total benefits exceeding total costs \n     by more than $242 million through the year 2018.\n\n  I am not going to dwell on that because some of these projections are \nreally little more than a hypothetical wish list, whether it be on the \nissue of whatever the economic value of the fish products are or \nwhatever. But I think it is fair to say the people who put intermodal \ntransportation analysis together do so based on a lot of longitude and \nlatitude relative to realities associated with the market ability \nassociated with what the economics basically have to support.\n  I would again defer to something that I brought up time and time \nagain, and that is the fact--this is what I find rather amusing about \nthe attitude of the administration and its veto threat. They are not \neven giving credence to the Secretary of the Interior and the \nflexibility that we have given him to address this road should it have \nany detrimental impact on any of the migratory wildlife or initiating \nany other activity that would be detrimental.\n  This has not been addressed by the opponents. It is not being \naddressed by the administration. They have come up with a flat veto. I \nwould like to think that my colleagues would not be moved or motivated \nby a disinterested administration that does not address the concern \nassociated with what this road means, and it really means a road to \nlife for a very, very small exchange--an exchange not in the wilderness \nbut, indeed, a land exchange in refuge and a net benefit to the \nwilderness of some 580 acres.\n  What you have here, Mr. President, is you have gotten a battened down \nenvironmental group that is dug in--the Audubon Society, and various \nothers, pulling out all stops to overcome the 730 residents of King \nCove on an issue that means perhaps that they will lose face if they \nlose this vote.\n  I would like to think that the 100 individuals here are individuals, \nthey think for themselves, they are not motivated by a rush associated \nwith a herd mentality and will address this issue on its merits.\n  The merits are very simple, Mr. President. This is a road to life for \nthe residents of King Cove. I would appreciate all my colleagues to \nrecognize the issue on its merits and not be threatened by any veto \nthreats from the administration, none of which have to put up with the \nrigors of living in a wilderness area, such as those residents who live \nin King Cove.\n  Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Montana, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, the Senator from Massachusetts for the debate, my senior \nSenator, Senator Stevens, and the Senator from Tennessee who shared \nwith us his expertise on telemedicine, Senator Frist.\n  Again, as we look at the alternatives, recognize we have been looking \nat alternatives for 14 years. This is time for action. The action that \nwe contemplate is a simple land exchange giving the Secretary of the \nInterior the oversight authority. I cannot imagine anything that is \nmore fair and provides a balance than what we have proposed. I ask my \ncolleagues to support the amendment that I have as well as to vote in \nfavor of the bill.\n  I have been asked by the leadership to suggest the absence of a \nquorum. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, may I just ask the Senator to withhold \nfor a moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alaska object?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I object, if I may, for just a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am told there are other Senators \nstill wishing to speak on the bill, so I ask, how much time is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 12 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 74 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Seventy-four minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventy-four minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent to reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the Senator from Massachusetts 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas. And I ask unanimous consent that my comments be placed \nin the Record not to interfere with the debate that has been taking \nplace and will take place further this evening on this important issue. \nAnd I will address the Senate on a different issue in question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is time now, as we reach the midpart \nof this week, and as we are looking forward to going into next week for \nthe probably 6 days that remain in this session--maybe 7 days, maybe \neven a few more days, if necessary--we are running into the final days \nof this particular session. It does seem to me to suggest that we ought \nto spend our time addressing those matters which are of central \nimportance and consequence and seriousness to the American people.\n  I know on the issue that is before the Senate at the present time \nthat this will be disposed of either later this evening--and I will not \ninterfere should the managers themselves want to have the final \ndisposition of that this evening--but I have understood that the final \ndisposition on this particular proposal would probably carry over to \ntomorrow.\n  So I wanted to address the Senate on another issue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, did the Senator indicate he thought this \nissue would carry over until tomorrow--this issue?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am not either the manager nor the proponent of that, \nbut I understand I do have the 30 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What I was saying is that I indicated that if both those \nfor it or against it wanted to move ahead with the vote, that I would \nnot interfere with that. But I am told at this time that that is not \nthe case, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to my colleague from Alaska. We do want to go \nahead with this vote on the matter tonight, if possible.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator, but I----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may offer a clarification. When \nthe unanimous consent was agreed upon, I was under the impression the \nSenator from Massachusetts was going to speak on the bill. I have no \nobjection to the time being granted, but we had hoped to have a vote \naround 5 o'clock.\n  As far as we are concerned, we are ready for the vote. So it is the \nfloor manager on the other side who controls the time. I tell Senator \nKennedy, if he would like to go ahead and allow us to vote, then he \ncould have time after the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was yielded this time. I understand you \nare ready and the others are not.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I don't want to confound this any \nfurther, but I think I was of the impression and I think the Senator \nfrom Montana was of the impression that the Senator from Massachusetts \nwas going to rise to speak on the King Cove matter. Am I correct that \nis the Senator's understanding?\n\n[[Page S11268]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I might.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield briefly, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might respond to the Senator from Alaska, we do have \nmore time required on our side in the sense that we are not ready for a \nvote for about a half hour or later. If that is the case, it probably \nmakes sense for the Senator from Massachusetts to proceed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I tried to have an opportunity to \naddress the Senate through the course of the afternoon and appreciated \nthe courtesies of our colleagues for that time.\n  How much time do I have remaining on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator has 26 minutes \nremaining.\n  (By unanimous consent, the remarks of Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Durbin are \nprinted later in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I am prepared to yield back the \nremainder of my time if the Senator from Alaska is also.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time, and \nI ask on behalf of the leader unanimous consent that all time be \nconsidered as yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And the Senate proceed to vote on the passage of S. \n1092, the King Cove/Cold Bay legislation.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, if the Senator from Alaska is prepared, \nwe are prepared to accept his amendment which is the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, amendment No. 3676 \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3676) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  It appears to be sufficiently seconded.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``King Cove Health and Safety \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) King Cove, Alaska is a community in the westernmost \n     region of the Alaska Peninsula with a population of roughly \n     800 full-time residents and an additional 400 to 600 workers \n     who are transported in and out of the community a number of \n     times a year to work in the local fish processing plant and \n     on fishing vessels;\n       (2) the majority of the full-time residents are indigenous \n     Native peoples of Aleut ancestry that have resided in the \n     region for over 5,000 years;\n       (3) the only mode of access to or from King Cove is via \n     small aircraft or fishing boat, and the weather patterns are \n     so severe and unpredictable that King Cove is one of the \n     worst places in all of the United States to access by either \n     of these modes of transportation;\n       (4) the State of Alaska has initiated the King Cove to Cold \n     Bay Transportation Improvement Assessment to confirm the need \n     for transportation improvements for King Cove and to identify \n     alternative methods of improving transportation access with \n     comprehensive environmental and economic review of each \n     alternative;\n       (5) the State of Alaska has identified a road between King \n     Cove and Cold Bay as one of the alternatives to be evaluated \n     in the transportation planning process but for a road to be a \n     viable option for the State of Alaska, the Congress must \n     grant a legislative easement within the Izembek National \n     Wildlife Refuge (``Refuge'') across approximately seven miles \n     of wilderness land owned by the Federal Government;\n       (6) there are fourteen miles of roads within the wilderness \n     boundary of the Refuge which are currently traveled by \n     vehicles;\n       (7) any road constructed in accordance with such easement \n     would be an unpaved, one-lane road sufficient in width to \n     satisfy State law; and\n       (8) the combined communities of King Cove and Cold Bay have \n     approximately 250 vehicles.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish a surface \n     transportation easement across Federal lands within the \n     Refuge and to transfer 664 acres of high value habitat lands \n     adjacent to the Refuge in fee simple from the King Cove \n     Corporation to the Federal Government as new wilderness lands \n     within the Refuge in exchange for redesignating a narrow \n     corridor of land within the Refuge as nonwilderness lands.\n\n     SEC. 4. LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n       If the King Cove Corporation offers to transfer to the \n     United States all right, title, and interest of the \n     Corporation in and to all land owned by the Corporation in \n     Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of T 57 S, R 88 W, Seward \n     Meridian, Alaska, and any improvements thereon, the Secretary \n     of the Interior (``Secretary'') shall, not later than 30 days \n     after such offer, grant the Aleutians East Borough a \n     perpetual right-of-way of 60 feet in width through the lands \n     described in sections 6 and 7 of this Act for the \n     construction, operation and maintenance of certain utility-\n     related fixtures and of a public road between the city of \n     Cold Bay, Alaska, and the city of King Cove, Alaska and \n     accept the transfer of the offered lands. Upon transfer to \n     the United States, such lands shall be managed in accordance \n     with section 1302(i) of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act, shall be included within the Refuge, and \n     shall be managed as wilderness.\n\n     SEC. 5. RIGHT-OF-WAY.\n\n       Unless otherwise agreed to by the Secretary and the \n     Aleutians East Borough, the right-of-way granted under \n     section 4 shall--\n       (1) include sufficient lands for logistical staging areas \n     and construction material sites used for the construction and \n     maintenance of an unpaved, one-lane public road sufficient in \n     width to meet the minimum requirements necessary to satisfy \n     State law;\n       (2) meet all requirements for a public highway right-of-way \n     under the laws of the State of Alaska; and\n       (3) include the right for the Aleutians East Borough, or \n     its assignees, to construct, operate, and maintain \n     electrical, telephone, or other utility facilities and \n     structures within the right-of-way.\n\n     SEC. 6. CONFORMING CHANGE.\n\n       Upon the offer of Corporation lands under section 4, the \n     boundaries of the wilderness area within the Refuge are \n     modified to exclude from wilderness designation a 100 foot \n     wide corridor to accommodate the right-of-way within the \n     following land sections:\n       (1) Sections 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, \n     30, 35, and 36 of T 56 S, R 87 W, Seward Meridian, Alaska.\n       (2) Sections 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 34, 35, and 36 of T 56 S, \n     R 88 W, Seward Meridian, Alaska.\n       (3) Sections 1, 2, 11, and 12 of T 57 S, R 89 W, Seward \n     Meridian, Alaska.\n\n     SEC. 7.

TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS.\n\n       The following provisions of law shall not be applicable to \n     any right-of-way granted under section 4 of this Act or to \n     any road constructed on such right-of-way--\n       (1) section 22(g) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \n     Act (43 U.S.C. 1621(g));\n       (2) title XI of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3161 et seq.), except as \n     specified in this section; and\n       (3) section 303(c) of title 49, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 9. JOINT PLAN.\n\n       The Secretary and the Aleutians East Borough shall jointly \n     prepare a plan setting forth--\n       (1) the times of the year a road may reasonably be \n     constructed when there are not high concentrations of \n     migratory birds in Kinzarof Lagoon; and\n       (2) limitations on nonemergency road traffic during periods \n     of the year when there are high concentrations of migratory \n     birds in Kinzarof Lagoon.\n\n     SEC. 10.

I wish you all \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11240-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11269-S11272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, under the provisions of the consent \nagreement of September 30, 1998, I now ask the Chair to lay before the \nSenate S. 442, the Internet tax freedom bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 442) to establish national policy against State \n     and local government interference with interstate commerce on \n     the Internet or interactive computer services, and to \n     exercise Congressional jurisdiction over the interstate \n     commerce by establishing a moratorium on the imposition of \n     exaction that would interfere with the free flow of commerce \n     via the Internet, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported \nfrom the Committee on Finance, with amendments, as follows:\n\n       (The parts of the bill intended to be stricken are shown in \n     boldface brackets and the parts of the bill intended to be \n     inserted are shown in italic.)\n\n                                 S. 442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     [SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Tax Freedom Act''.\n\n     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       [The Congress finds the following:\n       [(1) As a massive global network spanning not only State \n     but international borders, the Internet and the related \n     provision of online services and Internet access service are \n     inherently a matter of interstate and foreign commerce within \n     the jurisdiction of the United States Congress under Article \n     I, section 8, clause 3 of the United States Constitution.\n       [(2) Even within the United States, the Internet does not \n     respect State lines and operates independently of State \n     boundaries. Addresses on the Internet are designed to be \n     geographically indifferent. Internet transmissions are \n     insensitive to physical distance and can have multiple \n     geographical addresses.\n       [(3) Because transmissions over the Internet are made using \n     computer protocols, in particular the Transmission Control \n     Protocol / Internet Protocol, that utilize packet-switching \n     technology it is impossible to determine in advance the \n     precise geographic route individual Internet transmissions \n     will travel over, and it is therefore infeasible to separate \n     domestic intrastate Internet transmissions from interstate \n     and foreign Internet transmissions.\n       [(4) Consumers, businesses, and others engaging in \n     interstate and foreign commerce through online services and \n     Internet access service could become subject to more than \n     30,000 separate taxing jurisdictions in the United States \n     alone.\n       [(5) Inconsistent and inadministerable taxes imposed on \n     online services and Internet access service by State and \n     local governments threaten to--\n       [(A) subject consumers, businesses, and other users engaged \n     in interstate and foreign commerce to multiple, confusing, \n     and burdensome taxation,\n       [(B) restrict the growth and continued technological \n     maturation of the Internet itself, and\n       [(C) call into question the continued viability of this \n     dynamic medium.\n       [(6) Because the tax laws and regulations of so many \n     jurisdictions were established long before the advent of the \n     Internet, online services, and Internet access service, their \n     application to this new medium and services in unintended and \n     unpredictable ways could prove to be an unacceptable burden \n     on the interstate and foreign commerce of the Nation.\n       [(7) The electronic marketplace of services, products, and \n     ideas available through the Internet can be especially \n     beneficial to senior citizens, the physically challenged, \n     citizens in rural areas, and small businesses.

Mr. President, the matter that I want to address, again, \nis the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is time for our \nRepublican leadership to stop the blocking of the Patients' Bill of \nRights. It is time for them to stop protecting the insurance company \nprofits and start protecting the parties. It is time for them to stop \nmanipulating the rules of the Senate to deny the American people the \nprotections they deserve.\n  It is clear what is going on here. It is clear to every Member of the \nSenate. It should be clear to the American people. The American people \nwant Congress to pass strong, effective legislation to end the abuse by \nHMOs, the managed care plans, and the health insurance companies.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights, sponsored by Senator Daschle and Senate \nDemocrats, provides the needed and long overdue antidote to the \nfestering and growing abuses. Our goal is to protect patients and see \nthat insurance plans provide the quality care they promise but too \noften fail to deliver.\n  Two hundred groups of patients, doctors, nurses, and families have \nannounced support for our bill and are begging the Republican \nleadership to listen to their voices. I have the list of the various \ngroups supporting our legislation. They represent virtually all of the \nmajor doctor and nurse organizations and consumer groups, starting with \nthe American Medical Association, the various cancer societies, the \nNational Breast Cancer Coalition, and all of the American nursing \nassociations. The supporters also include those groups that are most \ninterested in the health care of children including the Children's \nDefense Fund and the American Academy of Pediatrics. These groups also \nrepresent our senior citizens including the National Council of Senior \nCitizens. The bill is also supported by groups that are most interested \nin mental health, the Mental Health Association, and those groups most \nconcerned about disability policies including the Multiple Sclerosis \nSociety, United Cerebral Palsy, the American Academy of Neurology, and \nthe Center on Disability and Health.\n  This, Mr. President, is only one page of a series of pages of \ndifferent groups where it can be said, without contradiction, that \nevery major medical association in our country supports the Daschle \nproposal which is sponsored by the Democrats. Virtually every single \ndoctors organization, every single nurses organization, every single \nconsumer organization, every organization that has represented children \nin our society, every association that represents cancer victims, every \nassociation that represents the disability community--every one of \nthose organizations, plus many others, support our particular proposal. \nThere is not one organization, not a single organization, that supports \nthe alternative Republican proposal. We have asked day in and day out \nfor them just to find one organization representing any of the doctors \nor nurses, children's groups, women's groups, cancer victims groups, \ndisability groups, any of those groups in our society, and all we have \nis silence.\n  This isn't a matter that we are advocating because of our particular \ninterest. We are advocating on behalf of all of these organizations and \nall of the various patients and all of the various families that are \npart of this central concern about how we best can protect the families \nin this country. The best way those families can be protected is, at \nleast, through debate on a Patients' Bill of Rights and, I believe, by \nthe enactment of this legislation.\n  As we have said on many different occasions, these are commonsense \nsolutions to the kind of problems that are real problems out there and \nthat are being faced by families every single day. If a child is sick \nand the parents of that child belong to one HMO, that ambulance has to \ndrive by the nearest emergency room and go to an emergency room across \ntown because it is on the list of that HMO. When that child is in an \nemergency situation, they ought to be able to go to the nearest \nhospital--that is one of our bills' protections. It is listed right \nhere. We believe that child ought to have the opportunity to go to the \nnearest emergency room and have the kind of immediate attention, but \nalso the follow-up attention that they need.\n  That right would be guaranteed under our Patients' Bill of Rights. We \nwant to debate that issue. That is a commonsense proposal. It is a \ncommonsense proposal that any family can understand. If there is going \nto be an emergency affecting a child, it makes no sense to drive them \nby the nearest emergency room and take them clear across town to a more \ndistant emergency room if that child needs immediate medical attention.\n  That is common sense. That protection is here. We ought to be able to \ndebate that particular issue, but we are denied that opportunity. We \nought to be able to get to it. I believe it wouldn't take a great deal \nof time.\n  The list goes on. Our bill was introduced in March. But, the Senate \nhas taken no action because the Republican leadership has been using \nevery trick in the procedural playbook to prevent a meaningful debate. \nThe Republican leadership is abusing the rules of the Senate so that \nthe health insurance companies can continue to abuse patients. That \nhappens to be the fact.\n  We have too many instances of reports from patients that say, every \nsingle day we fail to provide these guarantees, members of their family \nare put at risk. Every day we continue to deny women who have breast \ncancer the opportunity to be involved in clinical trials at places like \nthe Lombardi Center, we are putting those particular women at risk.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, out at the Lombardi Center they have eight \nprofessional individuals whose only job is to argue with the HMOs to \npermit the parties involved, access to the clinical trials their \ndoctors say are necessary but that the HMO will not permit them access \nto.\n  Our bill provides these kinds of protections. It is common sense. \nWithout these kinds of protections, we are endangering the lives of \nthose individuals who ought to be a part of the clinical trials. That \nis a very important protection.\n  Every day, we are denied that kind of debate and resolution, but we \nstill find that patients are abused by too many of the HMOs. The \nRepublican leadership wants to gag the Senate so that HMOs can continue \nto gag the doctors who tell patients about needed treatments that are \ntoo expensive for the HMO balance sheet.\n  I use those words ``gag the Senate'' because all we have had on the \nother side is the proposal that you can have one, two, or three \namendments but no other. You can't have any others. We are not going to \ntake the time of the U.S. Senate to do it, although we did find time to \nhave a debate on the issue of salting; we had time to debate that \nissue. We had time to debate the issues on the Vacancies Act. We have \nhad time to debate issues like bankruptcy which affects 1.2 million \npeople. But our patient protections bill, which affects tens of \nmillions of our fellow citizens, we evidently, haven't got the time to \ndebate that.\n\n  The Republican leadership wants to deny a fair debate on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights so HMOs can continue to deny the needed \npatient care. The Republican leadership wants to avoid accountability \nin the U.S. Senate so that managed care plans can avoid accountability \nwith their unfair decisions, when their unfair decisions kill or injure \npatients. The Republican leadership has found time to call up the \nVacancy Act, the salting bill, the Child Custody Act, the Bankruptcy \nAct, and the Internet tax bill. So it is clear that\n\n[[Page S11273]]\n\nprotecting patients from abuse by HMOs and health insurance companies \nis a priority for American families, but not for the Republican \nleadership.\n  How else can that be explained? How else can you explain the fact \nthat the Republican leadership has called up these different pieces of \nlegislation, but denies us the opportunity to debate this issue, which \nis of essential importance?\n  Listen to this, Mr. President. The Republican leadership, just \nyesterday, agreed to a unanimous consent agreement on the Internet tax \nbill that would have allowed all relevant amendments--no limitation on \nthe number of amendments, no limitation on the time to debate each \namendment, and no limitation on the time for the overall debate. We \nshould have the opportunity to do that on the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nbut, oh, no, we can't do that with the Patients' Bill of Rights--even \nthough the failure to provide these protections puts at risk so many \nfellow citizens every single day.\n  But no, the Republican leadership said instead we will have a consent \nagreement on the Internet tax bill. I wonder how many people here in \nthe Senate, let alone those who are watching, would feel that \nparticular issue is of more importance than the Patients' Bill of \nRights. We have moved ahead now on the questions of that particular \nlegislation, and I intend to support it. It is important legislation, \nparticularly for a State like mine, Massachusetts, with a lot of high \ntech and similar kinds of issues. But, Mr. President, to put this bill \non the same level as what we are talking about with the Patients' Bill \nof Rights, it just shouldn't be.\n  Senator Daschle asked Senator Lott for a similar agreement on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights on June 25. He asked him for an agreement on \nJuly 29. He asked him on September 1, and he asked him on September 9. \nEach time, Senator Lott, the Senate Republican leader, said no. Do we \nunderstand that, Mr. President? On June 25, on this legislation--the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, Senator Daschle asked for the same kind of \nagreement made yesterday by the Republican leadership on the Internet \ntax bill. He asked for it on July 29. He asked for it September 1. He \nasked for it on September 9. Each time, Senator Lott and the Senate \nRepublicans said no.\n  Senator Daschle also offered to agree on May 12 and on July 16, to a \nfar more restrictive agreement, limiting the number of amendments, but \nSenator Lott and the Republicans said no. Senator Lott and the Senate \nRepublicans are perfectly willing to agree to essentially unlimited \ndebate on the Internet tax bill, but they are not willing to allow any \nreasonable opportunity to debate, amend, and vote on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. This record of abuse should be unacceptable to the Senate, \nand it certainly is unacceptable to the American public.\n  What does our legislation do, and why is the Republican leadership so \nanxious to prevent its consideration? Our bipartisan Patients' Bill of \nRights takes insurance company accountants out of the practice of \nmedicine and returns decisionmaking to patients' doctors, where it \nbelongs. That is it. When you come right down to it, there it is. When \nyou are going to the emergency room, an accountant can say, ``No, you \ncan't go there, you have to go across town.'' Our bill says if you have \nan emergency, go to the nearest one. If you need access to a specialist \nand the primary care physician says go to a specialist, you can go to a \nspecialist. Or if you need a pediatric specialist, where a child has \ncancer--you can go to an oncology specialist for children. These are \ncommon sense protections. It is the doctors, the patients, the medical \nprofessions making the decision, not the accountants. That's the bottom \nline.\n  Mr. President, when we say these are commonsense solutions, I daresay \nthat 99 percent of the American people would agree that doctors and \nnurses ought to make the decisions with regard to health care issues \nfor your family and for your children, not accountants. That is what we \nare trying to do and that is at the heart of this debate. But we are \ndenied the opportunity to have that debate because once you go and say \nyou are going to have the medical decisions affecting your family \ndecided by doctors and trained medical professionals, it somehow may \nthreaten the profits of the health delivery system, the HMOs. Those \nHMOs have layers of different individuals that say ``no.''\n  I am reminded of when President Clinton said just a week ago, ``You \nnever find an accountant in an HMO that loses his job for saying `no.' \nThey don't get fired. The ones that get fired are the ones that say \n`yes.' '' Yes, they need to go to a specialist; yes, they need \nadditional kinds of important types of prescription drugs; yes, they \nneed to have the kind of care that may be more costly, but, more \nimportantly, may save the life of that individual; and, yes, it may \nvery well be if those people get better, it would be less costly to the \nHMO over a long period of time. That is the issue, Mr. President. That \nis the bottom line.\n  Our program simply guarantees people the rights that every honorable \ninsurance company already provides, and provides an effective and \ntimely means to enforce these rights. The good, honorable insurance \ncompanies do that, Mr. President, and so do some of the HMOs. But, many \nof them do not. And what happens is they obviously have the competitive \nadvantage over the good ones. That is wrong. They have the competitive \nadvantage because they shortchange the protection of their consumers, \nand that is what is at the heart of this whole debate. The protections \nwe provide, as I mentioned, are commonsense components of good health \ncare that every family believes they were promised when they purchased \ntheir health insurance and paid the premiums. Virtually all of the \nprotections in this legislation are already available under medical \ncare.\n  As I mentioned, of these 15 protections which are at the heart of our \nlegislation, over half of them are already in the law under Medicare. \nOver half of them have been unanimously recommended by the President's \nbipartisan commission--not in legislation, but recommended as being \nessential in terms of good health care. And we know that many of them \nhave been recommended by various health care plans, and many have even \nbeen recommended by the insurance commissioners that have \nresponsibility--made up of Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  You cannot find on this list a single one of these commonsense \nprotections that haven't been recommended by at least one of those four \ngroups. And most of them have been recommended by two, or even three, \nof those groups. These aren't off-the-wall kinds of protections. These \nare commonsense protections. They are recommended by those who \nunderstand what the opportunity and the problems are in terms of health \ncare delivery by HMOs. That is it. Why don't we have the opposition \nsaying, ``Where did you find 5, or 6, or 7, or 10 of those various \nrecommendations? Where in the world did they come from? Who thought \nthose up?'' That isn't an argument that is made. All 15--are either \nrecommended by the bipartisan President's commission, the health plan \nagencies themselves, Medicare, or the insurance industry themselves. \nThat is why, when we say these are common sense, they are, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n  If you are not going to find the various health plans responding to \nthese recommendations and enforcing them, at some time you are going to \nhave to go ahead with this. I daresay that the very good HMOs are \ncomplying with this now. They have nothing to fear. That is why many of \nthe HMOs endorse this, because they are already doing it. The good ones \nare already doing it. The good ones have absolutely no fear about it. \nIt is just the other ones. Those are the ones that result in the kinds \nof tragedies that have been listed by so many of our colleagues over \nthe preceding weeks and months. These are commonsense rights that \nprovide access to the appropriate specialists when the patient's \ncondition requires specialty care. They allow people with chronic \nillnesses and disabilities to have referrals to the specialists that \nthey need on a regular basis. They provide for a continuity of care so \nthe people will not have to interrupt their course of treatment and \nfind another doctor because their health plan drops their physician or \nbecause their employer changes health plans in the middle of a \ntreatment, for example.\n  When a member of the family is being treated with chemotherapy and \nhas to have a combination of treatment over 6 or 12 months, or 18 \nmonths,\n\n[[Page S11274]]\n\nto find out in the middle of that, after 5 months, with all the kinds \nof anxieties that people are affected by, that the particular company \nhas changed HMOs and suddenly that doctor and the nurse and the \ntreatment are pulled out from underneath you, we think that family \nought to be protected. That individual who is going through that \nparticular chemotherapy, or specialized care, ought to be able to \ncomplete that particular treatment.\n  Is that such a radical idea, when you have an individual who has had \nall of these kinds of concerns--not just financial concerns, but the \nemotional, the pain, and the suffering--and finally to have what is so \nimportant, the doctor-patient relationship, the trust and confidence in \nthat doctor, and then, because some bureaucratic decision is made to \npull that doctor away from that particular patient--we think there \nought to be a guarantee that there can at least be the continuation of \ncare for that particular incidence of care.\n  Is that so dramatic? Is that so unreasonable? Is that so outrageous? \nIt seems to me that is common sense.\n  No patient with symptoms of a stroke should be forced to delay \ntreatment to the point where paralysis and disability are permanent \nbecause a managed care accountant does not respond promptly and \nappropriately.\n  Patients with serious illnesses, like cancer, Alzheimer's, \nosteoporosis, or rheumatoid arthritis, who cannot be helped by standard \ntreatment, should have the right to participate in the quality clinical \ntrials that can help find a cure or offer the hope of improvement. \nTraditionally, insurance has allowed patients this opportunity. But, \nno; managed care is saying no to both the patients and medical \npersonnel. Now, too many of the managed care companies are saying no to \nboth. Patients and medical research are suffering.\n  It was unthinkable 5 years ago that when a doctor recommended that a \nchild participate in a clinical trial, the insurance wouldn't cover \nthem. They all did. It has only been in the most recent times where it \nis becoming a pattern and practice of too many HMOs that say no, we are \nnot going to permit you to participate, even though a doctor believes \nthat it is in the health interests of the individual to participate in \nthose particular clinical trials.\n  Mr. President, the thing that is really so shocking is that we are \nnow seeing extraordinary breakthroughs--every single week there are new \nmedical breakthroughs. Particularly in the areas of cancer, there are \nnew medical breakthroughs, and specifically in the area of breast \ncancer.\n  Look at all of the work that has been done in terms of the mapping of \nthe human gene and isolating the various DNA through research. Look at \nthe extraordinary work that is being done out at NIH and a few of the \nother great research centers, and the new kinds of opportunities that \nare available through research that are targeting these kinds of \nillnesses and diseases. I personally believe that the next century is \ngoing to be the century of the life sciences. Just at a time when we \nhave the greatest opportunity for cures of the most dreaded disease, we \nare closing down the opportunities for participating in these clinical \ntrials. It is just extraordinary.\n  In the testimony that we have seen, it is clear that there isn't \nreally any additional cost to the various HMOs, because all they are \nasking for is continuity of care for the patient, and just to continue \nto pay the outlay--not for the particular analysis of the various \nclinical trials, not for the new kinds of medications that might be \nrare and expensive, not to do summations, or pay, or participate in \nterms of these other kinds of studies. Absolutely not. All the HMO has \nto do is the continuity of care--just provide the kind of care that \nthey would otherwise be providing.\n  That is the amazement of some of the top researchers who appeared \nbefore our forums, who were in charge of some of the most important \nclinical trials in this country, because they say it really doesn't \ncost the HMO any more. The fact is, if the patients participate, they \nmay very well and so often do get much better, and it saves the HMO a \ngreat deal of resources and funding. That is why there is an absolute \ndisbelief on the part of so many of the top researchers.\n  They pointed out that not only were we disadvantaging so many \nindividuals, particularly in the area of cancers, and specifically in \nthe area of breast cancer and clinical trials, but also that the \nresearch progress was being hurt here in the United States because of \nthe failure of participation of many of these patients.\n  As I mentioned just a moment ago, in all of the various forums that \nwe had, there were many different facts that stood out. But when you \nhave the top clinicians say that at the Lombardi Clinical Research \nCenter, here within the shadow of the Nation's Capitol, they have eight \nhighly professional people who are spending all of their time all day \nlong wrestling with HMOs based on the fact that doctors have \nrecommended that their patients participate in these clinical trials, \nbut yet still have to spend all of their time arguing with the HMO to \npermit those individuals to actually participate in these clinical \ntrials. It is absolutely beyond belief to me, absolutely beyond belief.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I understand, the statement is that before we go home \nwe need to address the Patients' Bill of Rights. It appears that there \nis a wide public sentiment in support of this. It isn't a partisan \nissue, by a long shot. All the polls suggest that the voters, almost \nuniformly--Democrats, Republicans, independents--believe that this is a \ncritical and important issue.\n  When I brought this issue to the State of Illinois and visited a \nhospital with a doctor, he told me a story of a woman bringing her son \nin complaining of headaches on the left side of his head. The doctor \nthought that a CAT scan was indicated to see if a tumor was present. \nBefore he told the mother, he called the insurance company. They said \nthey would not pay for it. The doctor had to go back into his office \nand tell the mother that he thought they didn't need to do anything. He \nwas prohibited by the terms of his contract with the insurance company \nfrom even telling the mother that he had been overruled by the \ninsurance company. Think of that--if you are bringing your son or \ndaughter into a doctor, that you could be treated that way.\n  What Senator Kennedy is suggesting, and many of us believe is \nimportant before we go home, before we address other issues on the \nfloor: We should take up the Patients' Bill of Rights for that mother \nand the millions of others like her across America who are counting on \nus to do something substantive before we leave.\n  I fully support the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could just add to what the Senator has pointed out, \nwould you believe that in the Republican proposal, for example, any \nmedical procedure that wasn't over $1,000 could not be appealed? And so \nfor the kind of situation that the Senator is talking about, under the \nRepublican proposal, they say, oh, look, we have taken care of that, \nexcept if that medical procedure is less than $1,000. Then there is no \nopportunity for appeal. So, effectively, you are saying there are no \nMRIs for any child who falls off a bicycle, gets hit playing football, \nfalls down or has an accident playing hockey. And the Senator from \nIllinois knows families as I do that deny their children the \nopportunity to play sports because they haven't got health insurance or \nbecause they are not going to be able to get any kind of coverage for \nsickness or illness.\n  As bad as it is, as the Senator has pointed out, we ought to have an \nopportunity--would the Senator not agree, to debate this sort of phony \nprotection advanced by the Republicans, saying we will guarantee some \nopportunity for appeal but not if it was under $1,000.\n  Patients should have the right to appeal decisions of their plans to \nindependent third parties. Today, if a health plan breaks its promise, \nthere is no remedy that can provide relief in time to save a life or \nprevent a disability.\n  Independent review was recommended unanimously by the President's \nCommission. It has worked successfully in Medicare for over thirty \nyears. Families deserve the basic fairness that only an impartial \nappeal can provide. Without such a remedy, any ``rights'' of patients \nexist on paper\n\n[[Page S11275]]\n\nonly--and they are often worth no more than the paper on which they are \nprinted. When the issues are sickness and health--and often as serious \nas life and death--no health insurance company should be allowed to be \nboth judge and jury.\n  In addition, when the misconduct of managed care plans actually \nresults in serious injury or death, patients and their families should \nbe able to hold the plans liable in court. Every other industry in \nAmerica can be held responsible for its actions. Why should health \nplans, whose decisions truly can mean life or death, enjoy this unique \nand unfair immunity?\n  Under current law--the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act--\npatients whose lives have been devastated or destroyed by the reckless \nbehavior of their health plan have no right to go to court to obtain an \nappropriate remedy under state law. ERISA ``preempts'' all state \nremedies. Patients are limited to the narrow federal remedy under \nERISA, which covers only the cost of the procedure that the plan failed \nto pay for. You can be crippled for life by cancer because your plan \nrefused to authorize a test costing a few hundred dollars to detect the \ncancer in its early stages--and all you can get back to help support \nyour family is the cost of the test you failed to get.\n  During the debate on the tobacco legislation, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike voted overwhelmingly to support the principle that no \nindustry in America should be exempt from accountability for its \nactions. Because of ERISA preemption, one industry alone--the health \ninsurance industry--enjoys this protection today. That is wrong--and \nthe Senate should say it's wrong.\n  During the debate on welfare reform, many on the other side of the \naisle spoke strongly in favor of the need for individuals to take \nresponsibility for their actions. It is ironic that some of those who \nspoke most strongly for responsibility for poor single mothers are \nopposed to responsibility for a powerful industry that earns tens of \nbillions of dollars in profits every year.\n  What most Americans do not know--and what the opponents of change \nignore--is that ERISA pre-emption does not apply to state and local \nemployee health plans. Employees of the city government or state \ngovernment, whose health benefits are provided by taxpayers, can hold \ntheir health plan accountable in court if it kills or injures them. But \nequally hardworking families down the street are defenseless--because \nthey happen to work for private industry.\n  Our legislation is truly a Patients' Bill of Rights that will provide \nthese protections and more. It is a moderate, responsible, and \neffective response to the widespread problems patients and their \nfamilies face every day. That is why it is supported by a broad and \ndiverse coalition of doctors, nurses, patients, and advocates for \nchildren, women, and working families. That is why it enjoys bi-\npartisan support from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, \nincluding a courageous physician, Dr. Greg Ganske, a Republican \nCongressman from Iowa, who has seen the abuses of managed care first-\nhand.\n  The Republican leadership plan, by contrast, is not supported by any \ngroup of doctors or nurses or patients. It has no bi-partisan support. \nIt is an industry profit protection program, not a patient protection \nprogram. It is not a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a Patients' Bill \nof Wrongs. That is why we need a full debate--so that it can be amended \nand improved until it provides the protections patients need.\n  If the Majority Leader will stop abusing the rules of the Senate and \nallow this debate to proceed, I believe that the Senate will pass \nstrong reforms that will be signed into law by the President. The \nAmerican people deserve real reform, and I believe that when the Senate \nvotes in the clear light of day, it will give the American people the \nreforms they deserve. This issue is a test of the Senate's willingness \nto put a higher priority on the needs of families than on the profits \nof special interests. And it is time for the Senate to act.\n  The choice is clear. The Senate should stand with patients, families, \nand physicians, not with the well-heeled special interests that put \nprofits ahead of patients.\n  The American people know what's going on. Movie audiences across the \ncountry erupt in cheers when actress Helen Hunt attacks the abuses of \nmanaged care in the film ``As Good As It Gets.'' Helen Hunt won an \nOscar for that performance, but managed care isn't winning any Oscars \nfrom the American people. Everyone knows that managed care today is not \n``as good as it gets.''\n  Too often, managed care is mismanaged care. No amount of distortions \nor smokescreens by insurance companies can change the facts. The \nPatients' Bill of Rights can stop these abuses. Let's pass it now, \nbefore more patients have to suffer.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11272-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING SEPTEMBER 25\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports, \nfor the week ending September 25, that the U.S. imported 9,953,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 1,691,000 barrels a day more than the \n8,262,000 imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.6 percent of their needs last \nweek. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the \nPersian Gulf War, the United States imported about 45 percent of its \noil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the \n1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil \nsupply.\n  All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in \nthe U.S. if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.: now \n9,953,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $132,175,840 a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11275-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

MOORE, USAF\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wanted to take the opportunity to bring \nto the attention of the Senate the outstanding and continuing service \nof a fine Air Force officer, General William F. Moore, USAF.\n  For almost three years, General Moore has served as Director of \nSpecial Programs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In this \ncapacity, he was responsible for coordinating planning, budgeting, and \nmanagement of very sensitive Department of Defense special access \nclassified programs.\n  In fulfilling these duties, General Moore has had frequent contact \nwith the leadership and members of the defense oversight committees in \nCongress. I believe that General Moore has executed these duties in an \nexemplary manner. General Moore always operated in a very forthcoming \nmanner, was sensitive to the needs of Congressional oversight committee \nmembers, and made great strides in improving the Congressional \nunderstanding and coordination of special access programs. I would \npoint out that our former colleague, Secretary of Defense\n\n[[Page S11276]]\n\nBill Cohen, also recognized this track record by awarding General Moore \nthe Defense Distinguished Service Medal.\n  General Moore also had a distinguished career in the Air Force before \ncoming to that position. Among his many assignments, he has served as \nthe Program Executive Officer for Bombers, Missiles, and Trainers \nwithin the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for \nAcquisition; as the System Program Director for the Small ICBM; and in \nvarious positions with the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-air Missile \n(AMRRAM), Peacekeeper Missile, and Drone and Remotely Piloted Vehicles \nprograms.\n  General Moore is a graduate of the Air Force Academy, the Air War \nCollege, and the Defense Systems Management College. He also took an \nM.B.A. degree from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania.\n  General Moore has been recently named as Deputy Director of the \nDefense Threat Reduction Agency, a very important position. There is no \ndoubt in my mind that General Moore will be as diligent a steward in \nhis new position as he has been as Director of Special Programs. We are \nall fortunate to have a man of his professionalism and ability in these \npositions, and I want to thank him both for his many years of service \nand wish him every continued future success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11275-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN MALAYSIA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to express my deep \nconcern over the recent alarming political developments in Malaysia.\n  On September 2, Prime Minister Mahathir fired Deputy Prime Minister \nDato Seri Anwar Ibrahim, his hand-picked heir apparent. In the past few \nmonths, as the value of the ringgit has dropped more than 60 percent \nagainst the US dollar and as the economy has shown increasing signs of \ngoing the way of its surrounding Asian neighbors', Dato Seri Anwar has \nbeen arguing with increasing frequency that the country needs to adopt \nmeaningful economic structural reforms. This has run counter to \nMahathir's insistence that the root of the country's economic ills lies \nsolely at the feet of George Soros, and that by fixing the ringgit's \nconvertibility and taking other similarly isolationist measures.\n  This difference of economic opinion began to grow into a larger rift \nbetween the two politicians as Dato Seri Anwar began touring the \ncountry and speaking publicly. Apparently, Mahathir felt threatened \nboth by Dato Seri Anwar's views and his popularity as a focus for \ngrowing anti-Mahathir dissent, and dismissed him from his post. That \ndidn't stop Dato Seri Anwar from continuing to express himself. As a \nresult, Dato Seri Anwar was arrested on September 20 and held under the \nprovisions of the Internal Security Act (ISA).\n  The ISA removes arrested individuals from the protections afforded \ncriminal defendants under Malaysia's constitution and statutes, and \nconsequently Dato Seri Anwar was held in an undisclosed location \nwithout any formal charges being lodged against him. On September 29, \nhowever, he was hauled into court and charged with nine counts of \ncorruption and sexual misconduct, including four sodomy counts. The \nnature of the charges, as well as the vagueness of them and the fact \nthat several of the ``witnesses'' have already recanted, clearly \nindicates to me that they were concocted by the government for maximum \nshock value to discredit Dato Seri Anwar in a conservative Muslim \ncountry.\n  More shocking to me, however, is the condition in which Dato Seri \nAnwar appeared at his arraignment. He had clearly been beaten while in \ncustody. He told the judge that on his first night of detention, while \nhandcuffed and blindfolded, that he was ``boxed very hard on my head \nand lower jaw and left eye . . . I was then slapped very hard, left and \nright, until blood came out from my nose and my lips cracked. Because \nof this I could not walk or see properly.'' To substantiate his claims, \nDato Seri Anwar then showed the court a large bruise on his arm; his \nblack eye was already evident to everyone in the courtroom. He has not \nbeen allowed any medical treatment for his injuries. Dr. Mahathir's \ncontention yesterday that Dato Seri Anwar inflicted the injuries to \nhimself in order to gain a public relations coup is so absurd, so \nludicrous, that it simply confirms in my mind the veracity of Dato Seri \nAnwar's contentions.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Mahathir prides himself on having transformed \nMalaysia from a divided multi-racial developing nation into a model of \na modern, cosmopolitan, economically sophisticated country, and not \nwithout some justification. He also prides himself on being the self-\nappointed forward-thinking spokesman for Asian values and upholder of \nAsian independence from Western ``interference.'' But in my opinion by \nhis actions in the case of Dato Seri Anwar, he negates much of the \nprogress Malaysia has made in the eyes of the rest of the world. And on \na personal level, he has sadly shown himself to be just another third-\nworld despot intent on stifling any dissent, challenge to his \nauthority, or deviation from the party line.\n  Mr. President, I call on the Malaysian government to take every step \nto safeguard the rights of Dato Seri Anwar, ensure that any charges \nbrought against him are not spurious, afford him a fair and open trial, \nand fully investigate and prosecute those responsible for his \nmistreatment while in detention. I hope that all Malaysians will be \npermitted to express their political views in a peaceful and orderly \nfashion without fear of arrest or intimidation, and that the government \nwill avoid the perception that Malaysia is looking more and more like \nBurma and less and less like a democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11276-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11276-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11276-S11277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:45 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2187.

A bill to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from \nissuing regulations dealing with hybrid transactions; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                   Subpart F of Internal Revenue Code\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today Mr. Mack and I are \nintroducing legislation to place a permanent moratorium on the \nDepartment of the Treasury's authority to finalize any proposed \nregulations issued pursuant to Notice 98-35, dealing with the treatment \nof hybrid branch transactions under subpart F of the Internal Revenue \nCode. It also prohibits Treasury from issuing new regulations relating \nto the tax treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F and \nrequires the Secretary to conduct a study of the tax treatment of \nhybrid transactions and to provide a written report to the Senate \nCommittee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means.\n  By way of background, the United States generally subjects U.S. \ncitizens and corporations to current taxation on their worldwide \nincome. Two important devices mitigate or eliminate double taxation of \nincome earned from foreign sources. First, bilateral income tax \ntreaties with many countries exempt American taxpayers from paying \nforeign taxes on certain types of income (e.g. interest) and impose \nreduced rates of tax on other types (e.g. dividends and royalties). \nSecond, U.S. taxpayers receive a credit against U.S. taxes for foreign \ntaxes paid on foreign source income. To reiterate, these devices have \nbeen part of our international tax rules for decades and are aimed at \npreventing U.S. businesses from being taxed twice on the same income. \nThe policy of currently taxing U.S. citizens on their worldwide income \nis in direct contrast with the regimes employed by most of our foreign \ntrading competitors. Generally they tax their citizens and domestic \ncorporations only on the income earned within their borders (the so-\ncalled ``water's edge'' approach).\n  Foreign corporations generally are also not subject to U.S. tax on \nincome earned outside the United States, even if the foreign \ncorporation is controlled by a U.S. parent. Thus, U.S. tax on income \nearned by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies--that is, from foreign \noperations conducted through a controlled foreign corporation (CFC)--is \ngenerally deferred until dividends paid by the CFC are received by its \nU.S. parent. This policy is referred to as ``tax deferral.''\n  In 1961, President John F. Kennedy proposed eliminating tax deferral \nwith respect to the earnings of U.S.-controlled foreign subsidiaries. \nThe proposal provided that U.S. corporations would be currently taxable \non their share of the earnings of CFCs, except in the case of \ninvestments in certain ``less developed countries.'' The business \ncommunity strongly opposed the proposal, arguing that in order for U.S. \nmultinational companies to be able to compete effectively in global \nmarkets, their CFCs should be subject only to the same taxes to which \ntheir foreign competitors were subject.\n  In the Revenue Act of 1962, Congress rejected the President's \nproposal to completely eliminate tax deferral, recognizing that to do \nso would place U.S. companies operating in overseas markets at a \nsignificant disadvantage vis-a-vis their foreign competitors. Instead, \nCongress opted to adopt a policy regime designed to end deferral only \nwith respect to income earned from so-called ``tax haven'' operations. \nThis regime, known as ``subpart F,'' generally is aimed at currently \ntaxing foreign source income that is easily moveable from one taxing \njurisdiction to another and that is subject to low rates of foreign \ntax.\n  Thus, the subpart F provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (found in \nsections 951-964) have always reflected a balancing of two competing \npolicy objectives: capital export neutrality (i.e. neutrality of \ntaxation as between domestic and foreign operations) and capital import \nneutrality (i.e. neutrality of taxation as between CFCs and their \nforeign competitors). While these competing principles continue to form \nthe foundation of subpart F today, recent actions by the Department of \nthe Treasury threaten to upset this long-standing balance.\n  On January 16, 1998, the Department of the Treasury announced in \nNotice\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\n98-1l its intention to issue regulations to prevent the use of hybrid \nbranches ``to circumvent the purposes of subpart F.'' The hybrid branch \narrangements identified in Notice 98-11 involved entities characterized \nfor U.S. tax purposes as part of a controlled foreign corporation, but \ncharacterized for purposes of the tax law of the country in which the \nCFC was incorporated as a separate entity. The Notice indicated that \nthe creation of such hybrid branches was facilitated by the entity \nclassification rules contained in section 301.7701-I through -3 of the \nincome Tax Regulations (the ``check the box'' regulations).\n  Notice 98-11 acknowledged that U.S. international tax policy seeks to \nbalance the objectives of capital export neutrality with the objective \nof allowing U.S. businesses to compete on a level playing field with \nforeign competitors. In the view of the Treasury and IRS, however, the \nhybrid transactions attacked in the Notice ``upset that balance.'' \nTreasury indicated that the regulations to be issued generally would \napply to hybrid branch arrangements entered into or substantially \nmodified after January 16, 1998, and would provide that certain \npayments to and from foreign hybrid branches of CFCs would be treated \nas generating subpart F income to U.S. shareholders in situations in \nwhich subpart F would not otherwise apply to a hybrid branch as a \nseparate entity. This represented a significant expansion of subpart F, \nby regulation rather than through legislation.\n  Shortly after Notice 98-11 was issued, the Administration released \nits Fiscal Year 1999 budget proposals which, among other things, \nincluded a provision requesting Congress to statutorily grant broad \nregulatory authority to the Treasury Secretary to prescribe regulations \nclarifying the tax consequences of hybrid transactions in cases in \nwhich the intended results are inconsistent with the purposes of U.S. \ntax law. . . .'' While the explanation accompanying the budget proposal \nargued that this grant of authority as applied to many cases ``merely \nmakes the Secretary's current general regulatory authority more \nspecific, and directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations pursuant \nto such authority,'' the explanation conceded that in other cases, \n``the Secretary's authority may be questioned and should be \nclarified.''\n  Notice 98-11 and the accompanying budget proposal generated \nwidespread concerns in the Congress and the business community that the \nTreasury was undertaking a major new initiative in the international \ntax arena that would undermine the ability of U.S. multinationals to \ncompete in international markets. For example, House Ways and Means \nCommittee Chairman Bill Archer wrote to Treasury Secretary Rubin on \nMarch 20, 1998 requesting that ``Notice 98-11 be withdrawn and that no \nregulations in this area be issued or allowed to take effect until \nCongress has an appropriate opportunity, to consider these matters in \nthe normal legislative process.'' The Ranking Democrat on the \nCommittee, Charles Rangel, wrote to Secretary Rubin expressing strong \nconcerns about the Treasury's increasing propensity to ``legislate \nthrough the regulatory process as evidenced by Notice 98-11.\n  Despite these concerns, on March 23, 1998, the Treasury department \nissued two sets of proposed and temporary regulations, the first \nrelating to the treatment of hybrid branch arrangements under subpart \nF, and the second relating to the treatment of a CFC's distributive \nshare of partnership income. As Notice 98-1l had promised, the \nregulations provided that certain payments between a controlled foreign \ncorporation and a hybrid branch would be recharacterized as subpart F \nincome if the payments reduce the payer's foreign taxes.\n  The week after the temporary and proposed regulations were issued, \nthe Senate Finance Committee considered H.R. 2676, the Internal Revenue \nService Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. A provision was included \nin the bill prohibiting the Treasury and IRS from implementing \ntemporary or final regulations with respect to Notice 98-11 prior to \nsix months after the date of enactment of H.R. 2676. The Senate bill \nalso included language expressing the ``sense of the Senate'' that \n``the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service \nshould withdraw Notice 98-11 and the regulations issued thereunder, and \nthat the Congress, and not the Department of the treasury or the \nInternal Revenue Service, should determine the international tax policy \nissues relating to the treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F \nprovisions of the Code.''\n  Opposition to Notice 98-11 and the temporary and proposed regulations \ncontinued to mount. On April 23, 1998, 33 Members of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee wrote to Secretary Rubin expressing concern about the \nTreasury's decision to move forward and issue regulations pursuant to \nNotice 98-11 without an appropriate opportunity for Congress to \nconsider this issue in the normal legislative process, urging Treasury \nto withdraw the regulations.\n  In the face of these and other pressures from the Congress and the \nbusiness community, on June 19, 1998, the Treasury Department announced \nin Notice 98-35 that it was withdrawing Notice 98-1l and the related \ntemporary, and proposed regulations. According to Notice 98-35, \nTreasury intends to issue a new set of proposed regulations to be \neffective in general for payments made under hybrid branch arrangements \non or after June 19, 1998. These regulations, however, will not be \nfinalized before January 1, 2000, in order to permit both the Congress \nand Treasury Department the opportunity to further study the issues \nthat were raised following the publication of Notice 98-1l earlier this \nyear.\n  While we applaud the Treasury's decision to withdraw Notice 98-1l and \nthe temporary regulations, we believe that additional legislative \naction is needed to prevent the Treasury from finalizing the \nforthcoming regulations until Congress considers the issues involved. \nWe believe that only the Congress has the authority to achieve a \npermanent resolution of this issue. Notice 98-35, like its predecessor, \nNotice 98-1l continues to suffer from a fatal flaw; it is the \nprerogative of Congress, and not the Executive Branch, to pass laws \nestablishing the nation's fundamental tax policies. Simply put, Notice \n98-35 adds restrictions to the subpart F regime that are not supported \nby the Code's clear statutory language, and there has been no express \ndelegation of regulatory authority to the Treasury that relates \nspecifically to the issues presented in the Notice.\n  More importantly, we question the policy objectives to be achieved by \nNotice 98-35 and the accompanying proposed regulations. We do not \nunderstand the rationale for penalizing U.S. multinational companies \nfor employing normal tax planning strategies that reduce foreign (as \nopposed to U.S.) income taxes. Moreover, Notice 98-35 is contrary to \nrecent Congressional efforts to simplify the international tax \nprovisions of the Code. For example, the Congress reduced complexity \nand ridded the code of a perverse incentive for U.S. companies to \ninvest overseas by repealing the Section 956A tax on excess passive \nearnings in 1996. Again in 1997, the Congress repealed the application \nof the Passive Foreign Investment Company regime to U.S. shareholders \nof controlled foreign corporations because of the complexity involved \nin applying both regimes, in addition to enacting a host of other \nforeign tax simplifications. Therefore, in order for Congress to gain a \nbetter understanding of the Treasury Department's position on this \nmatter, our bill would require the Treasury to conduct a thorough study \nof the tax treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F and to \nprovide a report to the Senate Committee on Finance and House Committee \non Ways and Means on this issue.\n  If the forthcoming regulations are permitted to be finalized by the \nTreasury, U S multinational businesses will be placed at a competitive \ndisadvantage vis-a-vis foreign companies who remain free to employ \nstrategies to reduce the foreign taxes they pay. Clearly, such a result \nshould be permitted to take effect only if Congress, after having an \nopportunity to fully consider all of the tax and economic issues \ninvolved, agrees that the arguments advanced by the Treasury are \ncompelling and determines that additional statutory changes to subpart \nF are necessary and appropriate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2535\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. HYBRID TRANSACTIONS UNDER SUBPART F.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Regulations.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury (or his delegate)--\n       (1) shall not issue temporary or final regulations relating \n     to the treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F of \n     part III of subchapter N of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 pursuant to Internal Revenue Service Notice 98-\n     35 or any other regulations reaching the same or similar \n     result as such notice,\n       (2) shall retroactively withdraw any regulations described \n     in paragraph (1) which were issued after the date of such \n     notice and before the date of the enactment of this Act, and\n       (3) shall not modify or withdraw sections 301.7701-1 \n     through 301.7701-3 of the Treasury Regulations (relating to \n     the classification of certain business entities) in a manner \n     which alters the treatment of hybrid transactions under such \n     subpart F.\n       (b) Study and Report.--The Secretary of the Treasury (or \n     his delegate) shall study the tax treatment of hybrid \n     transactions under such subpart F and submit a report to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Finance of the Senate. The Secretary \n     shall hold at least one public hearing to receive comments \n     from any interested party prior to submitting such \n     report.\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator Breaux and I introduce \na bill reaffirming that the lawmaking power is the province of the \nCongress, not the executive branch. Our bill prohibits the Treasury \nDepartment from issuing regulations that would impose taxes on U.S. \ncompanies merely because one of their subsidiaries pays money to \nitself.\n  As a general rule, U.S. corporations pay U.S. corporate income tax on \nthe earnings of their foreign subsidiaries only when those earnings are \nactually distributed to the U.S. parent companies. An exception to this \ngeneral rule is contained in subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, \nwhich accelerates the income tax liability of U.S. parent companies \nunder certain circumstances. The Treasury Department has announced, in \nNotice 98-35, an intention to issue regulations that will accelerate \nincome tax liability for U.S. companies--not based on the specific \ncircumstances enumerated in subpart F, but instead on a new \n``interpretation'' of the ``policies'' that Treasury infers from that \n36-year-old provision. This action crosses the line between \nadministering the laws and making the laws, and cannot be allowed by \nCongress.\n  Notice 98-35 concerns so-called ``hybrid arrangements.'' These \ninvolve business entities that are considered separate corporations for \nforeign tax purposes, but are viewed as one company with a branch \noffice for U.S. purposes. U.S. companies organize their subsidiaries in \nthis manner to reduce the amount of foreign taxes they owe. \nTransactions between a subsidiary and its branch have no impact on U.S. \ntaxable income of the parent, as its subsidiary is merely paying money \nto itself. But the Treasury Department intends to impose a tax on the \nU.S. parent to penalize it for reducing the foreign taxes it owes.\n  This effort is wrong for several reasons. First, the Treasury \nDepartment possesses only the power to issue regulations to administer \nthe laws passed by Congress. New rules based on congressional purpose \nare known as laws, and under the Constitution laws are made by \nCongress.\n  Second, the Treasury Department is elevating one policy underlying \nsubpart F--taxing domestic and foreign operations in the same manner--\nover the other policy of maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. \ncompanies in foreign markets. This proposed tax would put U.S.-owned \nsubsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage.\n  Finally, the Treasury Department should not impose a tax on U.S. \ncompanies to force these companies to reorganize in a way that \nincreases the taxes they owe to foreign countries. The Treasury \nDepartment is not the tax collector for other nations. And by raising \nthe foreign tax bills of U.S. companies, the Treasury Department is \nalso increasing the size of foreign tax credits and thereby reducing \nU.S. tax revenues.\n  The Treasury Department is not only making policy that it has no \nright to make, it is also making bad policy. Our bill places a \nmoratorium on this lawmaking. It also directs the Treasury Secretary to \nstudy these issues and submit a report to the tax-writing committees of \nCongress. Many people and organizations, including the Treasury \nDepartment, desire changes in the tax laws. But only Congress has the \npower to make these changes, and this is a power we intend to \nkeep.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 2536. An original bill to protect the safety of United States \nnationals and the interests of the United States at home and abroad, to \nimprove global cooperation and responsiveness to international crime \nand terrorism, and to more effectively deter international crime and \nacts of violence; from the Committee on the Judiciary; placed on the \ncalendar.\n\n\n The Improvements to International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments \n                                of 1998\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased with the Chairman in offering \nthis important legislation, the Improvements to International Crime and \nAnti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998, to combat international crime.\n  Crime and terrorism increasingly have an international face. The \nbombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania are just the most \nrecent reminders of how vulnerable we are to terrorist attacks. In a \nshockingly brutal attack, more than 250 men, women and children, were \nmurdered in cold blood. Among those 250 victims were 12 of our fellow \ncitizens. And none of us can forget that it was only a short time ago \nthat there was another assault right here at home, in the Capitol \nitself.\n  With improvements in technology, criminals now can move about the \nworld with ease. They can transfer funds with a push of a button, or \nuse computers and credit card numbers to steal from American citizens \nfrom any spot on the globe. They can strike at Americans here and \nabroad. The playing field keeps changing, and we need to change with \nit.\n  This bill does exactly that, not with sweeping changes but with \nthoughtful provisions carefully targeted at specific problems faced by \nlaw enforcement. The bill offers tools and protection to investigators \nand prosecutors, while narrowing the room for maneuver that \ninternational criminals and terrorists now enjoy.\n  I initially introduced some of the provisions of this bill as early \nas April 30, 1998, in the Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating \nDrugs Act in Prisons of 1998 with Senators Daschle, Kohl, Feinstein, \nand Cleland. Again, on July 14, 1998, I introduced with Senator Biden \nmany of these provisions set forth in the bill on behalf of the \nAdministration in S. 2303, the International Crime Control Act of 1998. \nI again included almost all of the provisions in another major anti-\ncrime bill, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of \n1998, on September 16, 1998, along with Senators Daschle, Biden, \nMoseley-Braun, Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Bingaman, Reid, \nMurray, Dorgan, and Torricelli.\n  It is a particular pleasure now to be able to draw from these more \ncomprehensive bills a set of discrete, very important improvements that \ncan enjoy bipartisan support, and which I hope and trust can be enacted \ninto law, even in the short time remaining in this session. All of \nthese provisions enjoy the full support of the Administration, and each \nof them is a law enforcement priority.\n  The bill would criminalize murder and other serious crimes committed \nby organized crime against U.S. nationals abroad, and against state and \nlocal officials who are working abroad with federal authorities on \njoint projects or operations.\n  The bill also protects our maritime borders by providing realistic \nsanctions for vessels that fail to ``heave to'' or otherwise obstruct \nthe Coast Guard. No longer will drug-runners be able to stall or resist \nCoast Guard commands with impunity.\n  The bill also increases our authority to exclude from entry into our \ncountry international criminals and terrorists, including those engaged \nin flight to avoid prosecution, alien smuggling, or arms or drug \ntrafficking under specific circumstances. At the same time, we ensure \nthat the Attorney General has\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\nfull authority to make exceptions for humanitarian and similar reasons.\n  The bill includes important money laundering provisions. At a recent \nJudiciary Committee hearing on anti-terrorism, FBI Director Louis Freeh \nnoted the importance of money laundering laws as a tool in stopping not \nonly international drug kingpins, but also international terrorists, \nsuch as Usama bin Laden, the multi-millionaire terrorist who has been \nlinked to the recent embassy bombings.\n  The bill has two important provisions aimed at computer crimes: it \nprovides expanded wiretap authority, subject to court order, to cover \ncomputer crimes, and also gives us extraterritorial jurisdiction over \naccess device fraud, such as stealing telephone credit card numbers, \nwhere the victim of the fraud is within the U.S.\n  We cannot do it all alone, however. This bill facilitates \ninternational cooperation by allowing our country to share the proceeds \nof joint forfeiture operations, to encourage participation by those \ncountries. It streamlines procedures for executing MLAT requests that \napply to multiple judicial districts. Furthermore, the bill addresses \nthe essential but often overlooked role of state and local law \nenforcement in combating international crime, and authorizes \nreimbursement of state and local authorities for their cooperation in \ninternational crime cases. The bill helps our prosecutors in \ninternational crime cases by facilitating the admission of foreign \nrecords in U.S. courts. Finally, the bill would speed the wheels of \njustice by prohibiting international criminals from being credited with \nany time they serve abroad while they fight extradition to face charges \nin our country.\n  These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. \nThey are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. I must close with a \nspecial thanks to my friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, for \nhis help in making this bill a reality. It has been pleasure to work \nclosely with him to craft a bipartisan bill that will accomplish what \nall of us want, to make America a safer and more secure place.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2537. A bill to amend the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to assure \nthat the United States is consistent with other G-7 countries in \nevaluating environmental concerns relating to projects to be financed, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                   export-import bank act amendments\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation \nregarding the Export-Import Bank. This legislation is both pro-trade \nand pro-environment.\n  Let me start by saying that I support U.S. international finance \ninstitutions like Ex-Im Bank, OPIC and TDA because they are necessary \nto level the playing field for American companies seeking to compete \nabroad. In a perfect world, such government assistance would be \nunnecessary, but we know that the other industrialized countries are \nusing government financing to sweeten the pot for their companies' \nparticipation in international projects.\n  My legislation addresses the well-meaning environmental policies of \nthe Bank that are actually harming the environment while undermining \nAmerican competitiveness. Specifically, my legislation does two things: \nFirst, it directs the Ex-Im Bank to negotiate a mulitlateral agreement \nwith the export financing agencies of all G-7 countries to address \nenvironmentally sensitive development overseas. Second, until such \nagreement is reached, my legislation would allow U.S. companies to \ncompete on equal footing with other international companies bidding on \ninternational projects. In other words, my legislation would ensure \nthat American companies have access to Ex-Im Bank financing for \noverseas projects where other G-7 countries are providing or have \nindicated an intent to provide financing to the project in question \nwithout conditioning such assistance on environmental policies or \nprocedures.\n  Mr. President, under current law, the Ex-Im Bank can deny financing \nto U.S. companies seeking to participate in international projects when \nthe Bank's environmental concerns have not been adequately addressed by \nforeign countries. But there is no mechanism in place to ensure that \nall G-7 countries abide by the same set of rules or environmental \nstandards in competing for such projects. The net effect of this law is \nto impose unilateral sanctions on U.S. companies in the name of the \nenvironment.\n  The lack of American participation in the largest hydroelectric \nproject in the World, the $24.5 billion Three Gorges Dam Project in \nChina, illustrates why this change in law is necessary. The mission of \nthe Ex-Im Bank is to promote U.S. exports and U.S. jobs. Yet, the Bank \nrefused to provide financial guarantees for this project because the \nBank's environmental concerns had not been satisfactorily addressed by \nthe Chinese government.\n  There were two perverse outcomes from the Bank's decision. First, the \nproject is going ahead anyway without the environmental technologies \nand practices our companies' participation would bring. And second, the \nonly American participation is by companies that are large enough to \nuse their foreign subsidiaries with another government's financing, and \nconsequently the jobs are going to the Japanese, the Canadians and the \nEuropeans.\n  A letter that I received from the President of Rotec Industries, \nlocated in Elmhurst, Illinois, explains the detrimental effects of the \nEx-Im Banks decision. Rotec submitted a bid to the Chinese government \nfor $130 million of U.S.-made concrete placing and transporting \nequipment. Following the Ex-Im Bank's negative decision they received \nan order for only a fraction of their proposal. A Japanese-French \nconsortium received an order for ``Rotec-equivalent'' equipment. But it \ngets worse. As Rotec's president explained:\n\n       No Ex-Im financing meant no made-in-the-USA requirements \n     and no made-in-the-USA price premium . . . For the first time \n     in our 32-year history, Rotec subcontracted manufacturing to \n     companies in South Korea. The effect on U.S. jobs is easy to \n     quantify . . . Rotec will have spent over $13,000,000 in \n     South Korea. With Ex-Im's support, this work--and probably \n     more--would have stayed in the United States.\n\n  But this was not the only bad news for Rotec. Before Ex-Im's \ndecision, Rotec was the world's only manufacturer of this specialized \nequipment. But the Japanese-French consortium selected by the Chinese \nhave now copied Rotec's product. As Rotec's president described it, Ex-\nIm's decision helped open the door and they [the consortium] walked \nright in. Rotec will likely face foreign competition wherever this \nproduct is needed.''\n  Other U.S. companies who sought to participate in the Three Gorges \nDam project tell a similar story. Caterpillar estimates that it lost \n$200 million in sales. GE routed its bid through its Canadian \nsubsidiary. Voight Hydro of Pennsylvania had to withdraw its bid in \nfavor of its German parent, which won $85 million of contracts.\n  Although my legislation cannot retroactively change the effect of the \nEx-Im Bank's decision on U.S. participation in the Three Gorges Dam \nproject, we will face this issue again. A recent New York Times story \nquoted Chinese officials who pledge to spend $1.2 trillion on a vast \nprogram of new infrastructure projects over the next three years. \nIncluded in those projects are plans to build five large hydroelectric \npower stations over the next 12 years, at a cost exceeding $7 billion. \nAlthough this is small compared to Three Gorges, it presents excellent \nopportunities for U.S. companies. In addition, the Chinese have plans \nto order a new nuclear plant each year for the next 20 years. This \nemerging Chinese market is estimated to be worth $1.65 billion per year \nin U.S. nuclear exports, supporting an equivalent of 25,400 full time \nAmerican jobs.\n  I am told that the environmental lobbyists are out in full force \nagainst this legislation. Environmental groups have circulated a letter \nstating that my legislation would mean that ``[t]he United States \nGovernment will likely support dangerous nuclear power plants, \nunsustainable logging of primary forests, and huge hydroelectric dams \nresettling millions of people in developing countries with no \nenvironmental safeguards allowed.''\n  Mr. President, let me just respond to their claim that nuclear power \nplants and hydroelectric dams should not be funded on environmental \ngrounds. China is a case in point. By 2015 China will surpass the \nUnited States as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\n According to the World Health Organization, 6 of the 10 most polluted \ncities in the world are in China. Coal supplies three-quarters of \nChina's energy and is choking its cities. Already, hundreds of \nthousands of Chinese die premature deaths each year from chronic \nrespiratory illness. Thousands more died this year from flooding of the \nYangtze River and millions more were displaced.\n  Mr. President, how can the environmentalists ignore the benefits to \nChina's environment, indeed to the World's environment, of helping \nChina turn to cleaner forms of energy such as hydro and nuclear? The \n18,200 megawatt Three Gorges Dam will replace the equivalent of thirty-\nsix 500 megawatt coal fossil plants. In a country suffocating on dirty \nair, how can any rational environmental policy promote coal and \npenalize clean burning hydro and nuclear power? Of course, hydro and \nnuclear plants have environmental consequences. Every form of energy \nproduction does. Even windmills become cuisinarts for birds. But \ncountries such as China have the right to determine which consequences \nshe can accept.\n  Let's make sure that Ex-Im does not unilaterally rule out American \nparticipation in future projects. Support my legislation and vote to \nhelp American companies compete.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Rotec \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             Rotec Industries,\n\n                                 Elmhurst, IL, September 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: As president of a company which has \n     been involved in the construction of China's Three Gorges \n     Dam, I read your September 16th Washington Post op-ed \n     article, ``Too Green'', with great interest.\n       Rotec Industries, along with Caterpillar and Voith Hydro, \n     aggressively pursued Ex-Im Bank financing for Three Gorges \n     Dam. Of course, we were disappointed when Ex-Im denied \n     financing. It seemed like the wrong decision for economic, \n     environmental and common-sense reasons.\n       Your legislation, which would prohibit Ex-Im from \n     withholding financing on environmental grounds where any \n     other G-7 country is providing financing, offers some hope \n     that U.S. businesses and workers will have the support of Ex-\n     Im Bank in future, similar situations.\n       During the two years since Ex-Im's decision, Rotec has \n     continued to pursue its business at Three Gorges with some \n     successes and with some disappointments. A brief history our \n     Three Gorges events:\n       January 1996--Rotec submitted a proposal (before Ex-Im's \n     decision) to supply more than $130,000,000 of U.S.-made \n     equipment.\n       November 1996--Following Ex-Im's negative decision, we \n     received an order for only $31,000,000 of equipment.\n       December 1996--Japanese-French consortium received an order \n     for ``Rotec-equivalent'' equipment.\n       May 1998--Rotec received an additional $22,000,000 order.\n       We do not expect any additional major orders from Three \n     Gorges. Our total is approximately $53,000,000; about 40% of \n     what we had hoped to receive.\n       It gets worse: Losses for American workers were even \n     greater. During negotiations following Ex-Im's decision, our \n     Chinese customer demanded a price discount because ``Rotec \n     can subcontract manufacturing in China or a third country.'' \n     No Ex-Im financing meant no made-in-the-USA requirements and \n     no made-in-the-USA price premiums. Rotec was literally \n     fighting for its existence; we were facing serious \n     competition from foreign suppliers and Ex-Im would not help. \n     For the first time in our 32-year history, Rotec \n     subcontracted manufacturing to companies in South Korea. The \n     effect on U.S. jobs is easy to quantify: when the last \n     shipment is made at the end of this year, Rotec will have \n     spent over $13,000,000 in South Korea. With Ex-Im's support, \n     this work--and probably more--would have stayed in the United \n     States.\n       More bad news: Before Ex-Im's decision, Rotec was the \n     world's only manufacturer of this specialized equipment. The \n     Japanese-French consortium had copied our concepts on paper, \n     but had never designed, manufactured or sold any similar \n     product. Now they have and Rotec has a new competitor. Ex-\n     Im's decision has helped open the door and they walked right \n     in. Rotec will likely face foreign competition wherever this \n     product is needed.\n       My environmental ``feelings'': (I have made twelve trips to \n     China during the past three years so this comes mostly from \n     personal observation.) China is a huge country with a very \n     low standard of living--especially in the rural areas. Many \n     people live on mountainsides in hand-dug ``caves''. China's \n     people need energy, improved transportation and the ability \n     to control flooding in order to improve their standard of \n     living.\n       It seems unfair for the United States or anyone else to \n     tell China they can not develop their rivers, especially when \n     so much can be gained. Building Three Gorges Dam means \n     producing clean electricity with hydro-power, mitigating the \n     effects of flooding and adding navigable stretches to a river \n     in an area with very poor roads. Not building the dam means \n     burning more fossil fuel, further polluting the already-\n     terrible air; continuing floods which kill thousands, \n     violently displacing hundreds-of-thousands or even millions \n     and cause untold property damage for people who have so \n     little; and slowing economic development for people who \n     desperately need it. In this case, building a dam is ``the \n     green decision.''\n       Your initiation of this measure is supported and \n     appreciated by Rotec.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe active business definition relating to distributions of stock and \nsecurities of controlled corporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          amendment to Internal Revenue Code Section 355(b)(2)\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that would \nmake a technical change in the Internal Revenue Code. We often talk \nabout the need to simplify the Tax Code. The change I propose today \nwould do that.\n  This change is small but very important. It would not alter the \nsubstance of current law in any way. It would, however, greatly \nsimplify a common corporate transaction. This small technical change \nwill alone save corporations millions of dollars in unnecessary \nexpenses and economic costs that are incurred when they divide their \nbusinesses.\n  The Treasury Department agrees that there is a technical problem with \nthe drafting of the Tax Code. It also agrees that a legislative change \nlike the bill I introduce today is the best way to correct it.\n  Corporations, and affiliated groups of corporations, often find it \nadvantageous, or even necessary, to separate two or more businesses. \nThe division of AT from its local telephone companies is an example \nof such a transaction. The reasons for these corporate divisions are \nmany, but probably chief among them is the ability of management to \nfocus on one core business.\n  At the end of the day, when a corporation divides, the stockholders \nsimply have the stock of two corporations, instead of one. The Tax Code \nrecognizes this is not an event that should trigger tax, as it includes \ncorporate divisions among the tax-free reorganization provisions.\n  One requirement the Tax Code imposes on corporate divisions is very \nawkwardly drafted, however. As a result, an affiliated group of \ncorporations that wishes to divide must often engage in complex and \nburdensome preliminary reorganizations in order to accomplish what, for \na single corporate entity, would be a rather simple and straightforward \nspinoff of a business to its shareholders. The small technical change I \npropose today would eliminate the need for these unnecessary \ntransactions, while keeping the statute true to Congress' original \npurpose.\n  More specifically, section 355 (and related provisions of the Code) \npermits a corporation or an affiliated group of corporations to divide \non a tax-free basis into two or more separate entities with separate \nbusinesses. There are numerous requirements for tax-free treatment of a \ncorporate division, or ``spinoff,'' including continuity of historical \nshareholder interest, continuity of the business enterprises, business \npurpose, and absence of any device to distribute earnings and profits. \nIn addition, section 355 requires that each of the divided corporate \nentities be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. The \nproposed change would alter none of these substantive requirements of \nthe Code.\n  Section 355(b)(2)(A) currently provides an attribution or \n``lookthrough'' rule for groups of corporations that operate active \nbusinesses under a holding company, which is necessary because a \nholding company, by definition, is not itself engaged in an active \nbusiness. This lookthrough rule inexplicably requires, however, that \n``substantially\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\nall'' of the assets of the holding company consist of stock of active \ncontrolled subsidiaries. The practical effect of this language is to \nprevent holding companies from engaging in spinoffs if they own almost \nany other assets. This is in sharp contrast to corporations that \noperate businesses directly, which can own substantial assets unrelated \nto the business and still engage in tax-free spinoff transactions.\n  In the real world, of course, holding companies may, for many sound \nbusiness reasons, hold other assets, such as noncontrolling (less than \n80 percent) interests in subsidiaries, controlled subsidiaries that \nhave been owned for less than five years (which are not considered \n``active businesses'' under section 355), or a host of nonbusiness \nassets. Such holding companies routinely undertake spinoff \ntransactions, but because of the awkward language used in section \n355(b)(2)A), they must first undertake one or more (often a series of) \npreliminary reorganizations solely for the purpose of complying with \nthis inexplicable language of the Code.\n  Such preliminary reorganizations are at best costly, burdensome, and \nwithout any business purpose, and at worst, they seriously interfere \nwith business operations. In a few cases, they may be so costly as to \nbe prohibitive, and cause the company to abandon an otherwise sound \nbusiness transaction that is clearly in the best interest of the \ncorporation and the businesses it operates.\n  There is no tax policy reason, tax advisors agree, to require the \nreorganization of a consolidated group that is clearly engaged in the \nactive conduct of a trade or business, as a condition to a spinoff. Nor \nis there any reason to treat affiliated groups differently than single \noperating companies. Indeed, no one has ever suggested one. The \nlegislative history indicates Congress was concerned about \nnoncontrolled subsidiaries, which is elsewhere adequately addressed, \nnot consolidated groups.\n  For many purposes, the Tax Code treats affiliated groups as a single \ncorporation. Therefore, the simple remedy I am proposing today for the \nproblem created by the awkward language of section 355(b)(2)(A) is to \napply the active business test to an affiliated group as if it were a \nsingle entity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2538\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF ACTIVE BUSINESS DEFINITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 355(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (defining active conduct of a trade or business) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following: ``For purposes \n     of subparagraph (A), all corporations that are members of the \n     same affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)) shall \n     be treated as a single corporation.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to distributions or transfers after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM:\n  S.J. Res. 59. A joint resolution to provide for a Balanced Budget \nConstitutional Amendment that prohibits the use of Social Security \nsurpluses to achieve compliance; read the first time.\n\n\n                BALANCED BUDGET CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a Balanced Budget \nConstitutional Amendment which is designed to protect Social Security. \nSince we last considered a balanced budget amendment in the Senate, we \nhave achieved balance in the unified federal budget for the first time \nin 30 years, and have made substantial progress toward achieving \nbalance without relying on the surpluses currently accumulating in \nSocial Security. For 1998, the most recent projections by the \nCongressional Budget Office show a unified budget surplus of $63 \nbillion, and an on-budget deficit of just $41 billion when the $104 \nbillion surplus in Social Security is not counted. This on-budget \ndeficit is projected to disappear by 2002 under current budget \npolicies.\n  The Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment I am introducing today \nis identical to S.J. Res. 1, which received 66 votes in the Senate on \nMarch 4, 1997, except that surplus revenues in Social Security are not \ncounted in determining compliance. It is also identical to the Dorgan \nsubstitute and Reid perfecting amendments to S.J. Res. 1, which \nreceived 41 and 44 votes respectively, except that while Social \nSecurity surpluses are not counted, any deficit in Social Security must \nbe offset by an equivalent on-budget surplus. This distinction is \nimportant because Social Security is projected to begin running cash-\nflow deficits in the year 2013.\n  The President and a majority of Congress have expressed support for \nbalancing the budget without counting Social Security surpluses, and \nnow that goal is within our reach. We should take this opportunity to \napprove this Constitutional amendment and send it to the States for \nratification. This Constitutional amendment would provide the structure \nand enforcement mechanism to allow us to achieve this bipartisan goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the victims of the government of the former Soviet \n     Union-engineered Ukrainian Famine of 1932-1933 be solemnly \n     remembered on its 65th anniversary;\n       (2) the Congress condemns the systematic disregard for \n     human life, human rights, human liberty, and self-\n     determination that characterized the repressive policies of \n     the government of the former Soviet Union during the \n     Ukrainian Famine of 1932-1933;\n       (3) on the 65th anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine of \n     1932-1933, in contrast to the policies of the government of \n     the former Soviet Union, Ukraine is moving toward democracy, \n     a free-market economy, and full respect for human rights, and \n     it is essential that the United States continue to assist \n     Ukraine as it proceeds down this path; and\n       (4) any supplemental material that will assist in the \n     dissemination of information about the Ukrainian Famine of \n     1932-1933, and thereby help to prevent similar future \n     tragedies, be compiled and made available worldwide for the \n     study of the devastation of the famine.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSMITTAL OF THE RESOLUTION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall--\n       (1) transmit a copy of this resolution to--\n       (A) the President;\n       (B) the Secretary of State; and\n       (C) the co-chairs of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus; \n     and\n       (2) request that the Secretary of State transmit a copy of \n     this resolution to the Government of Ukraine.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution \ncommemorating the 65th anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine of 1932-\n1933. During the period 1932-1993, the repressive policies of the \ngovernment of the former Soviet Union, directed by Joseph Stalin, led \nto the deaths of at least seven million Ukrainians. Stalin's war on the \nUkraine sought to eradicate its unique religious, cultural and \npolitical characteristics for the purpose of achieving complete Soviet \ndomination.\n  For the most part, the famine and its victims can be traced to the \nforced collectivization of agricultural production. Collectivization \nwas central to Stalin's efforts to break the will of the Ukrainian \nland-owning peasants and a conscious part of his plan to bring about an \nend to Ukrainian nationalism, ultimately leading to total Communist \ncontrol. Stalin's forced collectivization of agriculture changed the \nface of Ukraine. Stalin repeatedly raised the quota productions for \nagriculture, so much so that the vast majority of Ukrainian \nagricultural production was being transferred from the region. These \nincreased production quotas for exports depleted the amount of food for \nthe people of Ukraine. The quota increases began a vicious cycle of \nless food which led to the exhaustion of farm workers, which in turn \nled to even smaller harvests and ultimately famine. Harvest yields were \nfurther diminished when the peasants were forced to abandon their \naccustomed ways of farming and use collectivized farming techniques.\n  During this period, food became so scarce that people were left to \nscavenge for what little they could find. There are horrible accounts \nof people being sentenced to death for stealing sheaves of corn. The \nfields once owned and worked by the peasants were now supervised by \narmed guards, while an environment of suspicion and fear consumed the \nUkrainian people. Individuals who did not quickly show the signs of \nstarvation were often accused of hoarding food. At the same time that \nthe Ukrainian people were risking their lives for the smallest amount \nof food to sustain themselves and their families, the Soviet Union was \ndenying that there was a crisis and refusing to allow assistance from \ninternational relief organizations to be delivered in the region. \nThroughout this turbulent period, Stalin further exacerbated the \nsituation by working to turn Ukrainians against one another. The famine \nfollowed an assault on the Kulaks, or petty bourgeoisie, and a purge of \nthe Ukrainian intelligentsia.\n  While this tragic period of Ukrainian history is often difficult to \nrevisit, we must do so in order to ensure that the world will not to \nendure a tragedy such as this again. When children in the United States \nstudy the dark periods of human history, it is important that the \nUkrainian famine of 1932-1933 be included. It is also important to note \nthat despite the tragedy the people of Ukraine endured at the hands of \nStalin's government and many years of Soviet domination, Ukraine has \nre-emerged with its vibrant cultural and religious traditions intact \nand strong.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor this resolution commemorating \nthe 65th anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine and I urge all Senators to \nshow their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11286-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11286-S11287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 123--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \nREGARDING THE POLICY OF THE FOREST SERVICE TOWARD RECREATIONAL SHOOTING \n                   AND ARCHERY RANGES ON FEDERAL LAND\n\n  Mr. McCain (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Lott) submitted \nthe following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                              S. Con. 123\n\n       Whereas the Forest Service is developing a national policy \n     to guide its management of existing and proposed shooting and \n     archery ranges on national forest land;\n       Whereas when managed appropriately, firearm and archery \n     sports are a legitimate use of national forest land;\n       Whereas the Forest Service has proceeded with closure \n     actions of recreational shooting ranges on Forest Service \n     land without prior notification to Congress or the general \n     public;\n       Whereas on March 10, 1997, the Forest Service suspended the \n     special-use permit of the Tucson Rod and Gun Club located in \n     the Coronado National Forest near Tucson, Arizona; and\n       Whereas the Forest Service is evaluating alternative sites \n     in the Coronado National Forest that could be used by the \n     Tucson Rod and Gun Club for firearm and archery sports, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture has directed the expeditious \n     completion of the environmental assessment, and the Forest \n     Service has committed to notify Congress of its decision by \n     November 20, 1998: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PUBLIC RECREATIONAL \n                   AND MULTI-PURPOSE USE OF UNITED STATES FOREST \n                   SERVICE LAND.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Forest Service should not close shooting or archery \n     facilities without prior notification to Congress and the \n     general public unless there is an immediate threat to public \n     safety;\n       (2) notification to Congress of any plan for closure of a \n     shooting or archery facility should include the reasons for \n     the closure, including any potential for imminent public \n     safety endangerment;\n       (3) the Forest Service should avoid unreasonable \n     restrictions in the issuance of special-use permits for \n     firearm and archery sports facilities;\n       (4) the Forest Service should fully evaluate alternative \n     sites in the Coronado National Forest and provide, to the \n     extent consistent with the environmental assessment, a \n     reasonable alternative that would allow the Tucson Rod and \n     Gun Club to quickly open a safe facility for firearm and \n     archery sports; and\n       (5) the Forest Service should adhere to its deadline of \n     November 20, 1998, for a decision on a site for the Tucson \n     Rod and Gun Club.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution that is of \ntremendous importance to me and many of my constituents back in \nArizona. This resolution expresses the Sense of the Congress that \nfirearm and archery sports are a recognized recreational opportunity \nfor the general public and a legitimate use of public land. The \navailability of public land for such activities is especially important \nin western states, such as Arizona, where a very large percentage of \nthe land is public land.\n  Mr. President, given that there is little private land in Arizona \nthat is available for such activities, I believe it is crucial that the \nForest Service support the continuation of firearm and archery sports \non national forest lands.\n  Mr. President, the Tucson Rod and Gun Club operated a shooting and \narchery range in the Coronado National Forest for almost 45 years and \nhad an exemplary safety record during that time. When opened, it was \nmiles from the nearest developed area, but the City of Tucson has \nspread to the very edge of the forest, and houses and schools are now \nwithin a short distance from the existing shooting range. The Club's \nspecial use permit was temporarily suspended on March 10, 1997 after a \nForest Service report concluded that the range may pose a hazard to the \nhomeowners in the vicinity and to visitors to the Sabino Canyon area. \nThe Club as well as the Congressional delegation has asked the Forest \nService to assist in searching for an alternate site for their \nfacility.\n  Mr. President, despite assurances by the Secretary of Agriculture and \nby the Forest Service that the Club's request would be dealt with in an \nexpeditious manner, it is now more than eighteen months since the range \nwas closed, and shooters in Tucson still do not have a reasonably \nclose, organized, and safe place for recreational firearm sports. At \nthe delegation's urging, the Secretary of Agriculture directed the \nForest Service to look at the proposed alternative sites and issue a \ndecision on a selected site for these activities by November 1998. The \nlocal Forest Supervisor has pledged to issue a final decision in this \nmatter by November 20, 1998, and has further agreed that once this \ndecision is rendered, no further public comments will be solicited, nor \nwill additional environmental analysis be required by the Department of \nAgriculture or the Forest Service. I expect the Forest Supervisor to \nabide by this understanding.\n  Mr. President, let me make clear that it is not my intent in offering \nthis resolution, to override the Forest Service's normal planning \nprocess or existing laws. I know there are others in this body with \nsimilar concerns about retaining multiple use policies of the Forest \nService. The intent in the resolution is that the Forest Service should \nsupport shooting and archery ranges on public land as one of the many \npublic uses of public lands and should strive to find a suitable \nalternative location for the Tucson Rod and Gun Club.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I concur with everything the senior Senator \nfrom my state has just said. I would like to add that I find it \ninconceivable that the Forest Service could determine that it cannot \nidentify approximately 20 acres of land on the entire Santa Catalina \nranger district of the Coranado National Forest that is both suitable \nfor a shooting range and readily accessible to the members of the Club. \nI expect that a suitable location will be found and that the Forest \nService will work with the club in good faith to agree on a plan to \nopen a facility.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to thank Representative Kolbe for \nhis leadership and hard work on this issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join with my Arizona colleague in \napplauding the efforts of our colleague in the House, Representative \nKolbe, to resolve this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11286-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11287-S11288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                KING COVE HEALTH AND SAFETY ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      MURKOWSKI AMENDMENT NO. 3676\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1092) to provide \nfor a transfer of land interests in order to facilitate surface \ntransportation between the cities of Cold Bay, Alaska, and King Cove, \nAlaska, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``King Cove Health and Safety \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (a) King Cove, Alaska is a community in the westernmost \n     region of the Alaska Peninsula with a population of roughly \n     800 full-time residents and an additional 400 to 600 workers \n     who are transported in and out of the community a number of \n     times a year to work in the local fish processing plant and \n     on fishing vessels;\n       (b) the majority of the full-time residents are indigenous \n     Native peoples of Aleut ancestry that have resided in the \n     region for over 5,000 years;\n       (c) the only mode of access to or from King Cove is via \n     small aircraft or fishing boat, and the weather patterns are \n     so severe and unpredictable that King Cove is one of the \n     worst places in all of the United States to access by either \n     of these modes of transportation;\n       (d) the State of Alaska has initiated the King Cove to Cold \n     Bay Transportation Improvement Assessment to confirm the need \n     for transportation improvements for King Cove and to identify \n     alternative methods of improving transportation access with \n     comprehensive environmental and economic review of each \n     alternative;\n       (e) the State of Alaska has identified a road between King \n     Cove and Cold Bay as one of the alternatives to be evaluated \n     in the transportation planning process but for a road to be a \n     viable option for the State of Alaska, the Congress must \n     grant a legislative easement within the Izembek National \n     Wildlife Refuge (``Refuge'') across approximately seven miles \n     of wilderness land owned by the Federal Government;\n       (f) there are fourteen miles of roads within the wilderness \n     boundary of the Refuge which are currently traveled by \n     vehicles;\n       (g) any road constructed in accordance with such easement \n     would be an unpaved, one-lane road sufficient in width to \n     satisfy State law; and\n       (h) the combined communities of King Cove and Cold Bay have \n     approximately 250 vehicles.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish a surface \n     transportation easement across Federal lands within the \n     Refuge and to transfer 664 acres of high value habitat lands \n     adjacent to the Refuge in fee simple from the King Cove \n     Corporation to the Federal Government as new wilderness lands \n     within the Refuge in exchange for redesignating a narrow \n     corridor of land within the Refuge as nonwilderness lands.\n\n     SEC. 4. LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n       If the King Cove Corporation offers to transfer to the \n     United States all right, title, and interest of the \n     Corporation in and to all land owned by the Corporation in \n     Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of T 57 S, R 88 W, Seward \n     Meridian, Alaska; and any improvements thereon, the Secretary \n     of the Interior (``Secretary'') shall, not later than 30 days \n     after such offer, grant the Aleutians East Borough a \n     perpetual right-of-way of 60 feet in width through the lands \n     described in sections 6 and 7 of this Act for the \n     construction, operation and maintenance of certain utility-\n     related fixtures and of a public road between the city of \n     Cold Bay, Alaska, and the city of King Cove, Alaska and \n     accept the transfer of the offered lands. Upon transfer to \n     the United States, such lands shall be managed in accordance \n     with Section 1302(i) of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act, shall be included within the Refuge, and \n     shall be managed as wilderness.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, today I would like to take a few \nminutes to talk about a subject of great importance to my home state of \nIllinois--falling farm prices and the impending economic crisis in \nRural America.\n  Illinois is one of our country's most important agricultural \ncontributors. Illinois farm land, which accounts for about 27 million \nacres, is considered some of the most productive in the world. More \nthan 76,000 farm families in the state produce corn, soybeans, wheat, \nbeef, pork, dairy products, and specialty crops. Illinois exports more \nthan $3.4 billion worth of agricultural products. The state's \nagribusiness activity is vibrant. From the Chicago area to Decatur and \nthroughout Illinois, agricultural processing employs thousands of \npeople. And, our researchers, at the University of Illinois as well as \nat other institutions, continue to help provide answers to some of the \nmost common as well as the most complex agricultural questions we face.\n  With that said, the current downturn of agricultural prices is very \ntroubling. Not just for Illinois' economy, but for the farm families \nwho work to ensure that the state of Illinois, the country, and the \nworld enjoy the safest and most abundant food supply.\n  Recently, I had visits in my Washington office from almost every \nagriculture group in the state. I heard, firsthand, how farm income \nwill fall to $42.5 billion in 1998, 20% lower than 1996 and 43% below \nthe five year average. Meanwhile, total farm debt in 1998 has been \nestimated at $172 billion, the highest level since 1985. This decline \nin farm income could lead to massive job loss in the agriculture sector \nand in agribusiness, not to mention what it will do to our family \nfarms.\n  Last week, I hosted a roundtable discussion with 15 farmers in \nSpringfield, Illinois to talk about the crisis in rural Illinois and \nAmerica. It is clear that falling prices, the uncertainty with foreign \nmarkets--particularly in Asia and Russia, and poor weather conditions \nhave contributed significantly to a severe economic crisis for our \nnation's farmers.\n  I heard stories about low prices. In central Illinois, the price of \ncorn went from $2.22/bu to $1.66/bu between July 17 and August 31, a 21 \npercent decline over a six week period. During this same period, the \nprice of soybeans went from $6.50/bu to $5.15/bu, also a 21% drop.\n  To further illustrate the seriousness of this crisis, it is important \nto look at this drop in commodity prices from a historical perspective. \nAt the Shipman Elevator in Shipman, Illinois, the price of corn on \nSeptember 18, 1998, was $1.64/bu. On this same date in 1993, the price \nwas $2.17/bu. The price of soybeans at the Shipman Elevator on \nSeptember 18, 1993 was $6.14/bu compared to the September 18, 1998 \nprice of $5.00.\n  Livestock prices have also dropped dramatically. The price of hogs at \nFarmland in Monmouth, Illinois, went from $54/cwt in September 1997 to \n$39/cwt in March 1998 to $29/cwt on September 18, 1998.\n  At these prices, I worry that a number of our nation's farmers will \nnot be able to survive. Whether this means leaving farming altogether \nor simply not being able to make their basic payments, I fear we are \nfacing a serious economic crisis in rural America. And, farmers won't \nbe the only ones impacted by this crisis. In the past several weeks, \ntwo of the world's largest agricultural equipment manufactures, Deere \nand Company, based in Moline, IL, and CASE Corporation, based in \nRacine, Wisconsin, have announced plans to reduce production and cut \njobs. Both companies claim declining farm prices have reduced demand \nfor their equipment. When American agriculture suffers, the effects are \nwidespread, from equipment manufacturers to processors to commodity \ntransporters.\n  Mr. President, Congress needs to demonstrate strong leadership in the \nface of this economic crisis. There are some short-term solutions which \nhave already been considered by this chamber--removing the cap on \nmarketing loans and extending their terms, authorizing the Secretary of \nAgriculture to make emergency storage payments to farmers to encourage \nthe use of marketing assistance loans, and replenishing the disaster \nreserve. Unfortunately, partisanship has gotten in the way of offering \nrural America a helping hand. This debate is not about the sanctity of \nthe 1996 Farm Bill, it is about giving American agriculture some of the \ntools needed to improve economic conditions and regain stability.\n  The Administration, led by Secretary Glickman, has also offered some \nsuggestions on how to address this crisis. They have put forward a $7.1 \nbillion package to aid farmers including $2 billion in emergency \ndisaster assistance. I welcome their proposal and leadership.\n  In my Springfield meeting I was also told that many farmers won't \nfeel the effects of the current crisis until well after the harvest \nwhen the grain bins are full and prices are at all-time lows. And, many \nof the farm leaders who have appealed to Congress and the \nAdministration for help are concerned that this crisis could stretch \ninto years rather than months. In short, they don't see an end in \nsight.\n  Mr. President, Congress is scheduled to adjourn in less than two \nweeks. We\n\n[[Page S11290]]\n\nwon't be able to single-handedly solve this serious economic crisis in \nrural America before we go home for the year. But, we shouldn't wait to \naddress this important issue and offer some assistance. We should act \nsoon and in a bipartisan fashion. We should explore short-term fixes, \nlike lifting the cap on marketing loans, as well as long-term \nsolutions, like tax fairness and expanded trade opportunities. We \nshould stand up for the men and women in rural America and let them \nknow that Congress and the Administration will work with them to help \nalleviate some of the economic pain and uncertainty they face.\n  To do anything less would be a disservice to our farmers and American \nagriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11289-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SOMERSET COUNTY RED RIBBON CAMPAIGN\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, Communities across our nation are \nbeing plagued by the numerous problems associated with drug and alcohol \nabuse, and this disease is playing an increasing role in the lives of \nour children.

Businesses, \nschools, churches and community organizations across the state will \nplay an active role by participating in drug education and prevention \nactivities throughout the week.\n  Our children are the future of our country. By joining together to \nfight the war on drugs we are investing in that future. I commend \nSomerset County for their efforts in confronting this difficult \nchallenge. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join Pennsylvania in \nrecognizing Red Ribbon Week so that all of our children's futures may \nbe promising, healthy and drug-free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11290-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11290-S11291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONFERENCE REPORT ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1998\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong \nsupport for the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998.\n  The Higher Education Act has been of enormous benefit to millions of \nstudents over the past three decades in providing more affordable \naccess to institutions of post-secondary education. Many of these \nstudents simply would not have gone to college or vocational school \nwithout the assistance provided through such programs as Pell Grants, \nstudent loans, and work study.\n  With the increased competition faced by workers in the global \neconomy, the importance of these programs is even greater today, not \nonly for students, but also for our nation's economy. The Higher \nEducation Act programs account for 68 percent of all financial aid \navailable to students. In FY 1999, the student aid programs authorized \nunder the Higher Education Reauthorization Act will provide $50 billion \nof aid to over 8.8 million students.\n  The cost of a college education continues to grow far faster than \ninflation, leaving more and more students with a large debt once they \nfinish. Last fall, the College Board released a nationwide survey of \ntuition costs, finding that tuition and fees would rise about 5 percent \nfor the fifth year in a row.\n  In contrast, inflation in the overall economy has been held under \ncontrol during these years, hovering at, or below 2 percent.\n  As costs have increased, student borrowing has expanded to make up \nthe difference. Student loans now comprise about 60 percent of all \nfinancial aid, whereas in the 1980-81 school year, loans were just over \n40 percent of the total.\n  Given the increased reliance on borrowing, it is notable that this \nreauthorization legislation provides for a reduction in interest rates \non new student loans from 8.25 percent to 7.46 percent, saving $11 \nbillion for students over the life of their loans. The typical borrower \nat a 4-year college, who graduates with $13,000 in debt, will save \nabout $700 over a ten-year repayment period. This is a major \neducational milestone, allowing student borrowers the lowest interest \nrate in 17 years.\n  Nearly 84 percent of South Dakota students receive financial aid in \nsome form, with an average annual award of $5,400 to students who \nreceive aid at the six public universities. Approximately 16,000 \nstudents in South Dakota receive Pell Grants, accounting for $28 \nmillion in federal assistance.\n  I am pleased that this bill gradually increases the size of the \nmaximum Pell Grant to $5,800 in academic years 2003-4. In the 1970s, \nPell Grants covered three-quarters of the costs of attending a four-\nyear public school. Today, these grants cover only one-third of the \ncost. I realize that finding the budget resources to fund this maximum \ngrant fully will be a struggle, however Pell Grants are the most \neffective program we have for helping low-income students afford post-\nsecondary education.\n  This legislation also continues the essential Federal Family \nEducation Loan (FFEL) program. This program alone has enabled forty \nmillion Americans to attend college over the past thirty years. \nAlthough direct lending by the federal government has consumed a \nportion of the overall student loan volume, all of the colleges and \nuniversities in my state of South Dakota continue to use the FFEL \nprogram and remain satisfied with the services they receive. \nAccordingly, I have been skeptical of efforts that might destroy the \nbalance that has existed between direct lending and the FFEL program. \nFederal policy should not be changed in ways to either favor direct \nlending or undermine the financial viability of lending by the private \nsector.\n  There are some lesser-noticed provisions of this bill of which I am \nparticularly proud. Promoting the availability and affordability of \nchild care has been one of my highest priorities in the Senate. That is \nwhy I am so pleased that legislation I cosponsored earlier this year, \nthe CAMPUS Act, has been incorporated into this bill. CAMPUS stands for \nChild Care Access Means Parents in School. This provision will \nestablish a grant program to assist colleges with the costs of \nestablishing child care centers to provide campus-based child care for \nlow-income parents attending college.\n  The obvious benefit of easy access to child care is that students \nwith young children will have a much greater probability of staying in \nschool and completing their degree. More and more students today are \nnon-traditional students, and the need for campus-based child care is \ngreater than ever before.\n  Additionally, this bill establishes an innovative new program to \noffer student loan forgiveness for those who earn a degree in early \nchildhood education and become full-time child care workers in a child \ncare facility. Child care, unfortunately, is one of the lowest-paying \nprofessions that one can find, and this low level of pay is completely \nincommensurate with the value of those who are caring for young \nchildren. Not surprisingly, turnover in this field is very high, as \nworkers find better paying jobs elsewhere.\n  It is especially tragic when highly-trained graduates, those who have \nearned a degree in early childhood education, are forced to leave the \nchild care profession because they cannot pay their student loans. We \nstill need to do all we can to raise wages for child care workers, but \nhelping with student loan repayment is a remarkable step forward. This \nconcept was included in child care legislation I cosponsored last year, \nand I am very pleased that it has been included in this bill.\n  I am pleased this bill develops new distance education partnership \nmodels through the Learning Anytime Anywhere Partnership (LAAP) \nprogram. This creative initiative provides partnerships grants between \nschools and other entities to assist in the expansion of student \nachievement in distance education. LAAP, combined with the expansion of \nstudent aid for distance learners, will allow more nontraditional \nstudents to obtain higher education, including full-time workers, \nparents, people in rural areas, or individuals with disabilities.\n  In addition to meeting the needs of rural America through distance \nlearning, the Higher Education Act speaks to an equally important \npopulation of\n\n[[Page S11291]]\n\nstudents: Indian Country. This bill includes a new initiative to \nprovide grants and related assistance to Indian Tribal Colleges and \nUniversities to improve and expand their capacity to serve Indian \nstudents. The bill authorizes $10 million for FY 1999 and such sums as \nmay be necessary in the years beyond FY 1999. This new initiative for \nTribal Colleges will provide much-needed funding to strengthen academic \nprograms, develop faculty, and improve student services.\n  Finally, I support the extension of the Special Leveraging \nEducational Assistance Partnership Program (LEAP), formerly known as \nthe State Student Incentive Grant (SSIG) program. SSIG provides funding \non a dollar-for-dollar match to help states provide need-based \nfinancial aid to students through grants and community service work \nstudy awards. Without this federal incentive, many states would not \nhave established state financial aid programs. As a cosponsor of the \nLEAP Act, I am pleased that states will now gain new flexibility to use \nthese funds for activities such as increasing grant amounts, carrying \nout academic or merit scholarships programs, community service \nprograms, and early interventions programs. This program is yet another \nexample of a federal-state partnership developed to create maximum \nopportunities for students seeking higher education.\n  While I am pleased with the inclusion of numerous programs that will \nbenefit students pursing higher education, I am deeply disappointed the \nconference report failed to include an important amendment to count \nhigher education as a work requirement for purposes of the Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families program. I was a proud cosponsor of this \namendment which enjoyed a bipartisan majority in the Senate-passed \nbill.\n  Throughout this Congress, the leadership has echoed the importance of \ntaking personal responsibility and achieving independence. As a \nsupporter of welfare reform, I support imposing work requirements on \nindividuals who receive cash assistance. However, to not allow students \nto earn a degree, a certifiable ticket to self-sufficiency, is \nirresponsible and thoughtless.\n  I have heard from a number of my constituents that the current system \nhas had the unfortunate effect of forcing TANF recipients out of \ncollege or vocational school and into dead-end, entry-level jobs. It \nseems obvious that enabling these individuals, which are usually single \nmothers, to complete a degree would be far more effective in achieving \nlong-term benefits. Education leads to higher income levels, helping \nmove these families out of poverty for good and making them productive \ntaxpayers. Federal requirements should not be so rigid and inflexible \nthat states are prevented from exercising this option. Unfortunately, \nwe were unsuccessful in addressing this need in the Higher Education \nAct of 1998, however, I am committed to working with Senator Wellstone \nand other advocates to revisit this issue in the future.\n  Passage of the Higher Education Reauthorization Act of 1998 was \nabsolutely essential for the continuation and improvement of a system \nthat helps keep post-secondary education within the reach of typical \nAmerican families. I was pleased with the expeditious manner by which \nCongress responded to the conference report and President Clinton's \nprompt signing of the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11290-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENSURING SAFE SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has \napproved legislation which I cosponsored to help ensure the safety of \nour nation's schools. Senators Campbell, Jeffords, and Faircloth \nintroduced S.2235, ``The School Resource Officers Partnership Grant Act \nof 1998,'' in June. It was approved unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee and approved by the Senate yesterday.\n  The goal of this legislation is to help put a stop to crime and \nviolence in our nation's schools. Through this legislation, \npartnerships will be developed between state and local law enforcement \nagencies and the school districts in which they serve. While national \nstatistics on violence in schools indicate an overall downward trend, \nthe types of violence that have occurred recently, particularly in the \nlast school year, are nothing short of traumatic.\n  The sight and sound of schoolyard shootings have become all too \nfamiliar. Americans were shocked, time and time again, by the \ndevastating sight on the evening news of youngsters being carried to \nambulances from school grounds following shooting sprees by other \nyoungsters. Looking back at the 1997-1998 school year, several \nparticularly alarming incidents occurred:\n  In October, a 16-year-old at Pearl High School in Mississippi went to \nschool with a hunting rifle. He shot and killed a student and a \nteacher, leaving a second teacher with a bullet wound in the head.\n  In December, a student at Heath High School in West Paducah, Kentucky \nused a pistol to kill 3 other students. The shooter was 14-years-old.\n  In March, 2 boys in Jonesboro, Arkansas, an eleven year-old and a \nthirteen year-old, pulled the fire alarm in their school. As students \nand teachers left the building, the two boys began shooting. They \nkilled five people: four young girls and a teacher.\n  In April, a 14-year-old boy in Edinboro, Pennsylvania went to a \nschool dance with a gun he apparently removed from his father's bureau \ndrawer. He killed a science teacher and injured two students and \nanother teacher.\n  At Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon a 15-year-old who was \nsuspended for carrying a gun to school, returned to school the next day \nand opened fire in a crowded cafeteria. He killed two students and \nwounded 19 others. Police suspect he shot and killed his parents, as \nwell.\n  It is no secret that I support tougher restrictions on gun ownership. \nEarlier this year, Senator Durbin and I offered an amendment to the \nspending bill for the Departments of Commerce, State and Justice. Our \namendment would have held adult gun owners responsible if their \nweapon--which had not been stored properly--was used by a child to \ninjure himself or someone else. I felt that this was the least we could \ndo to help protect children from needless gun violence. Unfortunately, \nthe majority of my Senate colleagues didn't agree, and our amendment \nwas defeated.\n  Despite that setback, I believe that it is Congress' responsibility \nto take steps to assist local communities in their battle against \nschool violence. Children bringing weapons to school and drug use among \nyoungsters aren't problems of big city schools alone. In my own State \nof Rhode Island during the last school year, there were more than 400 \nweapons-related suspensions. To put that number in the proper \nperspective, we have fewer than 450 elementary and secondary schools in \nRhode Island, including private and religious schools. We should not \nfool ourselves into thinking that the kind of atrocities that all of \nAmerica witnessed in schools last year can't happen in our children's \nschools.\n  It is my sincere belief that The School Resource Officers Partnership \nGrant Act is a step in the right direction. This legislation will make \nfederal funds available to local law enforcement agencies, working in \npartnership with local school districts, for ``school resource \nofficers.'' These SROs, who must be professional law enforcement \nofficers, would address gang-related crime and violence, including drug \nuse, in and around schools. They would work with students, teachers, \nand administrators on crime prevention and personal safety. And perhaps \nmost importantly, they would work directly with students on conflict \nresolution to help avert violent oubursts that can leave innocent \nchildren dead or injured.\n  There are communities throughout our nation whose police officers \nhave undertaken these very tasks. In Rhode Island, police officers in \nNewport, Providence, and West Warwick, to name a few, already are \nworking within schools on crime prevention, mentoring, and conflict \nresolution. Our bill would allow local law enforcement agencies to use \na portion of their federal Community Policing funds for these officers.\n  I applaud our teachers and administrators for their efforts to \nconfront and address violence in schools, but we cannot expect them to \nundertake this battle alone. This bill will make the knowledge and \nresources of professional law enforcement agencies available to our \nschools. I know it will help keep our children safe.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11291-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11292]]\n                         MAURICE RIVER TOWNSHIP\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nMaurice River Township as it celebrates its 200th anniversary on \nSaturday October 3rd. It is a pleasure for me to be able to recognize \nthis important milestone.\n  Maurice River Township has a rich and varied history that will be \ncelebrated and honored this Saturday. Maurice River Township was first \nchartered as one of six precincts of the County of Cumberland, created \nby the Colonial Legislature, in the Colony of West Jersey on January \n19th, 1747. Together, Greenwich, Hopewell, and Stow Creek, on the North \nside of Cohansey Creek, as well as Fairfield, Deerfield, and Maurice \nRiver on the South side of Cohansey Creek, formed Cumberland County. \nThe Maurice River Precinct contained all of the land on the East side \nof Prince Maurice's River. In 1798, Maurice River was finally \nincorporated as a Township by the New Jersey State Legislature.\n  Over the past 200 years the Township of Maurice River has developed \ninto a thriving community, incorporating the eight villages of Delmont, \nBricksboro, Dorchester, Leesburg, Heislerville, Port Elizabeth, \nCumberland, and Milmay. Today, Maurice River stands as one of the most \nvibrant communities in the State of New Jersey, and I am confident it \nwill continue to grow in a positive direction.\n  The determination and the spirit of the Maurice River community make \nit a privilege for me to recognize its bicentennial anniversary. The \nTownship has become one of New Jersey's brightest stars, and I look \nforward to another two hundred years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11292-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE BLUE RIDGE RIFLES\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe Blue Ridge Rifles Precision Drill Team of North Georgia College and \nState University. The Blue Ridge Rifles finished first overall at the \nTulane University Mardi Gras Drill Meet, their tenth such win since \n1979.\n  The Blue Ridge Rifles competed against outstanding competition, \nhailing from such esteemed institutions as West Point, the United \nStates Air Force Academy, and the Georgia Military College. \nFurthermore, this competition was scored using Navy-Marine Corps \nstandards of drill, so the Rifles, with their Army-based ROTC training, \nwere competing under unfamiliar rules. The ability of the Rifles to \nadjust to these changes and compete, let alone win, is nothing short of \nexceptional.\n  I also extend congratulations to Cadet Staff Sergeant Justin Shelton \nand Cadet Second Lieutenant Edward Boyd, who finished first and third \nin the individual exhibition respectively.\n  The Blue Ridge Rifles are a proud component of North Georgia College \nand State University, an dedicated educational institution renowned for \nits excellent ROTC program. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in honoring this fine organization of young Americans as they \ncelebrate their latest triumph.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11292-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF PITTSBURGH\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I speak today to recognize Andy \nWilliams, an individual who along with only seven others in the nation, \nhas received the National Crime Prevention Council's Ameritech, Award \nof Excellence in Crime Prevention.\n  Andy, while employed as a cab driver, made a decision in 1989 that \ninner-city youth needed both good role models and more chances to \nlearn. He has since devoted his time, energy, and limited resources to \nthe city of St. Paul's young people. Youth in St. Paul have benefited \nby the creation of his first program, Worker's Organization to Regain \nConfidence (WORC). After working a 7 or 8 hour day in his cab, he used \nit to collect kids from school and take them to miscellaneous jobs he \nhad set up for them, providing an alternative to after-school \ndelinquency and crime. Kids took on various jobs such as cleaning \nwindows for a local business, running a lawn service, delivering \ndinners, learning how to repair small engines, and shovel snow. These \nprograms usually involved 12 to 14 participants.\n  A successful year later, he expanded WORC into a non-profit \norganization, guiding at-risk youth in the St. Paul communities of \nFrogtown and Summit-University. WORC and his newly created subsidiary, \nSOCK (Save Our City Kids), cooperate with other non-profits to provide \nwork skills, peer counseling, and apprenticeship opportunities. These \nhelp the students develop self-confidence, self-respect, and more of \nthe skills crucial to becoming self-sufficent.\n  Andy has since created several other fruitful programs which continue \nto benefit the community. His innovations have enabled him and several \nhundred students to achieve a vision which reflects the nature of the \nAmeritech Award. His efforts and commitment are a great example for \nthose who wish to make a difference in their own communities. The other \nprograms include: WORC on Bikes, the Drop-In-Center, the Let's Talk \nprogram, and Whiz Kids. WORC on Bikes is a program in which youth learn \nto repair bicycles and eventually earn their own bikes. The Drop-In-\nCenter is a place where any adult or child can stop and discuss \npersonal concerns, such as family problems, alcohol and drug abuse, and \nviolence. The Let's Talk program empowers youth, teenagers, adults, and \nparents by providing the tools with which solutions to social problems \ncan begin to be addressed. Whiz Kids is a community-based computer \neducation program which makes technology more accessible to youth, \nwhile assisting them in developing related skills to prepare them for \nfuture endeavors. It is funded entirely through private donations.\n  Clearly, Andy was selected for this award for his ability to truly \nmake a difference, to persevere, to work for positive results in the \nlives of youth in the realm of crime prevention and far beyond. On \nbehalf of the children and families who have profited from his \nexemplary efforts to better various communities in St. Paul, my thanks \nfor his devoted and lasting contribution to the future of our children, \nand my congratulations on his well-deserved award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11292-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11292-S11293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER LILIA L. RAMIRZ, U.S. NAVY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay \ntribute to Commander Lilia L. Ramirez, U.S. Navy, who is retiring after \neighteen years of distinguished service to this nation. She stands out \nas a pioneer, a leader and an outstanding role model for young people \nin uniform.\n  Lilia's United States Navy career is testament to a true American \nsuccess story. She was born in Bogota, Columbia and emigrated to the \nU.S. when she was just five years old. Her parents, Alvaro and Ana \nRamirez fled the violence in the Columbian countryside in the early \n1960's in search if a new life of security and promise for their \nchildren in America. With little more than an optimistic spirit. Al and \nAna settled in Bayshore, New York where they went on to raise five \nextraordinary citizens. Through hard work, determination and a deep \ncommitment to each other the Ramirez family actualized their dreams of \nAmerica.\n  The eldest of five children, Lilia spoke only Spanish when he arrived \nin New York as a five year old. Yet Lilia excelled throughout her \npublic education career, graduating with distinction from Brentwood \nhigh School and\n\n[[Page S11293]]\n\naccepting an appointment to the U.S. Navel Academy as a member of the \nclass of 1981. She was a member of Annapolis' second coeduation class.\n  As a new Ensign, Lilia sailed for the Navel Communications Area \nMaster Station Western Pacific in Guam, the first of three overseas \nassignments. While in Guam, Lilia was deployed to the Indian Ocean \nabroad the submarine U.S.S. Proteus, with only a handful of women. \nAfter crossing the Equator, she was proudly initiated as a Trusty Shell \nback in a time-honored sea faring ceremony.\n  European assignments followed and, while stationed in England as a \nNavy-Air Force Liasion Officer at RAF Mildenhall, Lilia and two other \nAnnapolis classmates saved the life of an elderly Briton. During their \nevening of liberty, they discovered the Briton who had collapsed from a \nheart attack. Next, Lilia served at the U.S. European Command in \nStuttgart, Germany as the Officer-in Charge of the Navy-Marine Corps \nElements at the headquarters' manpower and personnel directorate. While \nin Stuttgart, she provided crucial after-action reporting and personnel \nsupport in the wake of a terrorist murder of our Navel Attache in \nGreece and the U.S. Marine Barracks bombing in Beirut.\n  After five years, Lilia returned to the Washington D.C. area to serve \nin several assignments, including: the Navy Telecommunications Center \nat Crystal City, which was the Navy's largest message center; the \nNavy's Bureau of Personnel, where she was personally involved in \nassigning a record number of women officers to pursue advanced \ntechnical degrees at the Naval Postgraduate School; the Joint Chief of \nStaff's Command, Control and Communications Systems Directorate. While \non the Joint Staff, Lilia coordinated the installation of command and \ncontrol systems in the field offices of Customs, DEA and the North \nAmerican Air Defense Command as part of our national anti-drug policy.\n  In 1990, Lilia was assigned as Officer-in-Charge of the Personnel \nSupport Detachment at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, in the State of \nWashington. In this tour, she was responsible for the pay, travel and \ncareer advancements matters of 8,000 service members and their \nfamilies. Lilia returned to the Washington, D.C. area again in 1992, \nwhere she served as the base-commander of the Navel Communications Unit \nChetenham, a 230-acre facility in rural Maryland. At Cheltenham, 300 \npersonnel and 19 tenant commands where under her jurisdiction. She also \nenvironmentally protected the wetlands at her base and hosted the local \nBoy Scout Troop.\n  In 1994, Lilia began a tour in the Secretary of the Navy's Office of \nLegislative Affairs. Lilia was responsible for representing the \ncommand, control, communications and tactical intelligence programs to \nthe defense and intelligence committees of both the House and Senate. \nIn addition to numerous informational visits to the Naval \ncommunications and intelligence facilities throughout the United \nStates, Europe and Japan, Lilia escorted Congressional delegations to \nthe refugee camps in Guantanomo Bay, Cuba and later to the national \nelections in Nicaragua. In 1997, as a member of the team from the U.S. \nNaval Academy, she visited Peru to advise the Peruvian Navy on \nintegrating women into their naval academy.\n  As the first U.S. Naval woman to attend the Inter-American Defense \nCollege, Lilia again helped blaze a trail for all women. Named as the \nambassador of the U.S. Navy, she combined her native Spanish fluency \nand experience in nation security affairs to impress her Latin American \ncounterparts. She forged lasting relationships with key civilian and \nmilitary leaders of Latin America and left them with enduring, positive \nmemories of women as military professionals.\n  Lilia's personal decorations include the Defense Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Joint Service Commendation \nMedal and the Navy Commendation Medal (three awards).\n  The United States, as a nation, owes a great debt of gratitude to \nLilia Ramirez whose example will inspire women, Hispanics and all \nAmericans seeking public service and whose work will have a lasting \nimpact on our armed forces for years to come. While we will miss her \ndistinguished career in uniform, we will no doubt continue to enjoy her \ncommitment to her community and Nation. I wish to recognize her entire \nfamily, including her father Alvaro, her mother Ana (whom we lost this \nyear to cancer), her brothers Michael and Henry and her sisters Angela \nand Ana Tulita who are all great American success stories of their own \nright. Best wishes to Lilia, her husband Randall Lovdahl (Commander, \nU.S. Navy) and her children Bianca and Beau as they mark this special \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11292-5", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DELAYING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION 110 OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION \n            REFORM AND IMMIGRANT RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am opposed to implementing \nsection 110 of the Immigration Reform Act of 1996. Its implementation \nwould create widespread chaos and lead to untold congestion at our \nNorthern borders' checkpoints, potentially creating havoc with our \nlargest trading partner, Canada.\n  Each year, more than eight million trucks cross the eastern United \nStates-Canada border carrying a variety of goods to market. In \naddition, the Eastern Border Transportation Coalition estimates that \nover 57 million cars cross that border each year. Sixty percent of \nthese are day trips--people crossing the border to go to work or \nschool, attend cultural events or to shop. The remaining forty percent \nof auto border crossings were by vacationers.\n  If implemented, an automated entry-exit system along the northern \nborder would hamper both trade and tourism. This is not \ninconsequential. The United States-Canadian trade relationship is the \nlargest in the world, totalling $272 billion in 1995. Compare this to \n$256 billion in trade for the entire European Union during that same \nperiod and one gets an idea of how important this relationship is and \nwhy it must remain unfettered by chaotic checkpoints.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11293-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11293-S11294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WETLANDS AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION ACT\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today having learned of last \nnight's unanimous consent request on S. 1677--The Wetlands and Wildlife \nConservation Act of 1998.\n  As you know, S. 1677 reauthorizes the North American Wetlands \nConservation Act (NAWCA) for the next five years. Mr. President, over \nits eight year history NAWCA has been a lynchpin in our nations efforts \nto preserve habitat and protect wildlife.\n  NAWCA has been a very good program for wildlife, for conservation, \nand for American taxpayers. For every one dollar of federal money, the \nprogram obtains on average a match of another two dollars from private \npartners. According to Ducks Unlimited, over 550 projects nationwide \nhave been initiated with NAWCA funding. In 1996, 76.9 million \nindividuals took part in wildlife-associated activities, creating over \n$100 billion in expenditures for our economy. Additionally, in 1996, \nover 40 million sportsmen and women spent over $70 billion in \nrecreational expenditures and millions more Americans spent billions in \nnon-sport activities associated with wildlife.\n  My home state of Minnesota, in particular, has benefited from NAWCA. \nOver its eight-year life, NAWCA funding of $18.4 million has stimulated \nprivate partners to contribute over $25 million more to habitat \nprojects. In 1996, 1.6 million Minnesotans participated in wildlife-\nassociated activities, creating $3.6 billion in expenditures throughout \nthe state.\n  But beyond the economic benefits NAWCA provides are the important \nenvironmental aspects to the program. The decline in duck, geese, and \nother waterfowl populations in the early 1980s created the catalyst for \nthe program. By protecting nearly 3.7 million acres of habitat since \nits creation, NAWCA has helped restore waterfowl populations to their \nhighest level in half a century. In fact, state and federal surveys \nthis past year counted 42 million breeding ducks, the highest level \nsince surveys began in 1955, according to the U.S. Department of the \nInterior.\n  I was proud to join my colleagues this past April in cosponsoring S. \n1677. I am even more proud to come to the\n\n[[Page S11294]]\n\nfloor today knowing the bill has passed the United States Senate and \nwill continue to protect habitat and wildlife well into the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11293-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING BETTE WAHL\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a woman who \nhas been honored as one of only seven Americans to receive the National \nCrime Prevention Council's Ameritech Award of excellence in Crime \nPrevention.\n  Bette Wahl is an enthusiastic youth advocate and a strong voice in \nthe Eau Claire community for crime prevention. While her words are \npowerful and persuasive, her actions prove her dedication to the youth \nof Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Mrs. Wahl is the Project Coordinator for the \nEau Claire Coalition for Youth. The Coalition is a collaboration of 28 \nagencies which address the recreational, educational, and social needs \nof youth and family. Under Mrs. Wahl's guidance, creativity, and \nenergy, the Coalition has grown and become a true asset to the \ncommunity.\n  Bette Wahl has created innovative youth crime prevention programs, \nenlisting the support of senior citizens in her community. In 1994, \nSeniors Partnering with Youth brought young and old together to work on \nservice projects that benefit the community. This program provides an \nalternative activity to crime and delinquency, helps youth serve the \ncommunity, and develops the values of compassion, respect, and \nresponsibility. Bette also created two pilot youth employment programs \nwhich serve as gang and delinquency diversion programs. Through one of \nthe programs, Youth Works, young people build self-esteem, pride, and \nresponsibility.\n  Bette has displayed her extraordinary passion and skill while \ndeveloping effective crime prevention programs in the Eau Claire \ncommunity. Eau Claire's chief of police, David Malone, called Bette \n``phenomenal'' saying that ``she seems to have a unique talent for \nbringing out the best in people and getting them to reach a solution.'' \nShe succeeds where others fail by influencing and inspiring others with \nher energy and creativity, thereby achieving a positive and permanent \nchange in the crime prevention field.\n  Bette recognizes that greater communication and integration of \nservices enables a community to achieve tangible benefits in crime \nprevention. Sixty percent of juveniles in her truancy reduction program \nexperienced an increase in school attendance; she has provided \ncommunity service opportunities for 369 youth in another program, and \nshe organizes two youth job fairs each year to match youth with area \nbusinesses for entry level jobs.\n  Mrs. Wahl's hard work in crime prevention encourages youth, adults, \nbusinesses, government agencies, community organizations, and schools \nto participate in a community-wide partnership to help Eau Claire's \nyouth realize their full potential. On behalf of all those affected by \nher work and in honor of her recent award, congratulations, Bette \nWahl.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11294-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING MR. MORRIS AMITAY, DISTINGUISHED PRO-ISRAEL ACTIVIST\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I was happy to read a recent \narticle in the Washington Jewish Week, Guide to Jewish Life in \nWashington, 1998-1999, about Morrie Amitay and his tireless work toward \nimproving the bonds between the United States and Israel.\n  I have known Morrie since my earliest days on Capitol Hill and have \nhad the opportunity to witness many of his accomplishments. Morrie's \ncareer is indeed impressive. During his years at Harvard Law School, \nMorrie developed a strong interest in United States foreign policy. \nThis led to a career with the U.S. Foreign Service, where he served the \nU.S. embassies in both Italy and South Africa. Morrie's talents were \nquickly noted and he was promoted rapidly. In 1969, Morrie turned his \nattention to Capitol Hill where he took a position as a legislative \nassistant in the House of Representatives.\n  In 1974, while working as an aide for Senator Abraham Ribicoff, \nMorrie was instrumental in crafting the Jackson-Vanik Amendment--part \nof the Trade Act of 1974--which provided for an increase of Jewish \nimmigrants from the then-religiously oppressive Soviet Union, into the \nUnited States.\n  Another significant achievement of Morrie's was to become executive \ndirector of AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. During \nMorrie's tenure at AIPAC, the political action committee grew to be one \nof the most successful interest groups in Washington, D.C. His current \nwork involves educating the American Jewish community on defense \nissues, and also strengthening the strategic ties between the defense \nestablishments of the United States and Israel. This important work is \naccomplished through his position as vice chairman at the Jewish \nInstitute for National Security Affairs.\n  Mr. President, I am privileged to be a friend of Morrie Amitay and I \nam proud to stand before you today and recognize his successful career. \nI offer congratulations to Morrie and best wishes for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11294-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PATRICIA HYLTON\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to commend a former \nmember of my staff, Patricia Hylton, who has recently been named \nmanager of the Refuse To Be A Victim program. Trish was an invaluable \nmember of my office, and I'm certain that she will be successful in \nmaking Refuse To Be A Victim a beneficial program for women across the \ncountry.\n  While working in my office, Trish became interested in developing \ncrime awareness and prevention programs for women. Regrettably, such \nefforts are needed. The statistics are frightening. Seventy-three \npercent of women will be victimized at some point in their lives. \nSeventy-three percent. One million women are stalked each year in the \nUnited States. Figures such as these call for decisive action.\n  I am proud to recognize a program that empowers women with a strategy \nto ensure their own personal safety. Refuse To Be A Victim is a \nsuperior safety tool and thousands of women are safer because of their \nparticipation. Refuse To Be A Victim is sponsored by the National Rifle \nAssociation. The program is not, however, about firearms. Instead, \nRefuse To Be A Victim offers women the knowledge necessary to avoid \nbeing victimized.\n  This program is taught throughout the United States an in my home \nstate nine men and women instruct hundreds of North Carolinians each \nyear. I'm pleased that Trish has committed herself to such a worthwhile \nprogram. And I hope that many more American women will take advantage \nof this exceptional learning experience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11294-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11294-S11297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO COST ANALYSIS--S. 2361\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

Chafee,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 2361, the Disaster \n     Mitigation Act of 1998.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Kristen \n     Layman (for federal costs) and Lisa Cash Driskill (for the \n     state and local impact).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\n     CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE, SEPTEMBER 29, 1998\n\n                S. 2361: Disaster Mitigation Act of 1998\n\n(As ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \n                        Works on July 29, 1998)\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       S. 2361 would amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief \n     and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize a predisaster \n     mitigation\n\n[[Page S11295]]\n\n     program and make changes to the existing disaster relief \n     program.\n       S. 2361 would emphasize predisaster mitigation in order to \n     reduce the long-run costs of disasters. If the authorized \n     funding for mitigation efforts is provided and used \n     judiciously, enactment of this bill could lead to substantial \n     savings to the federal government by reducing the need for \n     future disaster relief funds. CBO cannot estimate the \n     magnitude of such savings because we cannot predict either \n     the frequency or incidence of major natural disasters.\n       The bill would authorize the appropriation of $175 million \n     ($35 million a year) over fiscal years 1998 through 2002 for \n     a predisaster mitigation program. In addition to these \n     specified authorizations, other provisions in S. 2361 would \n     result in changes in discretionary spending, assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts. In total, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 2361 would require net new \n     appropriations of $585 million over the 1999-2003 period: \n     $140 million from the amounts specified in the bill ($175 \n     million minus the 1998 authorization of $35 million) and $445 \n     million from other provisions. That spending may be offset by \n     savings in regular and emergency appropriations for disaster \n     relief, but CBO cannot estimate the timing or precise amounts \n     of the potential savings. Over the next 10 years, such \n     savings could exceed the $140 million that the bill would \n     authorize for predisaster mitigation efforts over fiscal \n     years 1999 through 2002.\n       S. 2361 also would affect direct spending by speeding up \n     the disbursement of some existing disaster relief funds; \n     therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. CBO \n     estimates that outlays from such funds would be $230 million \n     higher in 1999 than they would be under current law, but that \n     there would be no net change in direct spending from this \n     provision over the 1999-2003 period. S. 2361 would affect \n     direct spending in two other ways that would have no \n     significant budgetary impact. It would expand the \n     definition of public safety officer to include certain \n     federal and state emergency management personnel, thereby \n     increasing payments for death benefits from the public \n     safety officers program administered by the Department of \n     Justice. The bill also would raise offsetting receipts by \n     an estimated $3 million each year, but that increase would \n     be matched by higher spending because the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would be allowed to \n     spend those receipts without appropriation action.\n       S. 2361 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would significantly benefit the budgets of state, \n     local, and tribal governments.\n\n\n               description of the bill's major provisions\n\n       Title I would establish a program to provide financial \n     assistance to state and local governments for predisaster \n     mitigation activities. The predisaster mitigation program \n     would expire on October 1, 2003. S. 2361 would require the \n     President to transmit a report to the Congress that would \n     evaluate efforts to implement the predisaster hazard \n     mitigation programs and recommend a process for transferring \n     greater authority over the program to states.\n       Title I also would remove a yearly cap of $50,000 per state \n     on the grants that the President makes for improving and \n     maintaining disaster assistance plans and would increase the \n     maximum federal contribution for mitigation costs from 15 \n     percent to 20 percent.\n       Title II would combine any expenses not chargeable to a \n     specific project into a single category called management \n     costs. It would direct the President to establish standard \n     rates for reimbursing states for such costs.\n       In addition, title II would reduce the federal government's \n     share of costs for repairing damaged facilities from 90 \n     percent to 75 percent, but would allow the President the \n     flexibility to make the contribution as much as 90 percent if \n     the President determines that funds will be used for \n     mitigation activities. Title II would also allow the \n     President to use the estimated cost of repairing or replacing \n     a facility, rather than the actual cost, to determine the \n     level of assistance to provide. S. 2361 would establish an \n     expert panel to develop procedures for estimating the cost of \n     repairing a facility.\n       Title II would combine the Temporary Housing Assistance \n     (THA) and Individual and Family Grant (IFG) programs into one \n     program, and would eliminate the community disaster loan \n     program, a program that assists any local government that has \n     suffered a substantial loss of tax revenues as a result of a \n     major disaster.\n       Finally, title II would authorize the President to provide \n     assistance to any local government that helps to suppress a \n     fire that threatens the destruction of public or private \n     forests and grasslands.\n       Title III would expand the definition of public safety \n     officer to include permanent employees of FEMA and employees \n     of state or local emergency management agencies whose duties \n     are determined to be hazardous and related to a major \n     disaster. As a result, more employees would be eligible for \n     death, disability, and education benefits.\n\n\n                estimated cost to the federal government\n\n       CBO estimates that implementing S. 2361 would result in \n     additional discretionary outlays of $582 million over the \n     1999-2003 period ($137 million from authorizations specified \n     in the bill and $445 million from other provisions). These \n     costs are likely to be at least partially offset by future \n     savings resulting from predisaster mitigation efforts, but \n     CBO cannot estimate the magnitude or timing of such savings. \n     S. 2361 would speed up spending of certain existing funds and \n     would thus affect direct spending. However, we estimate no \n     net change over the 1999-2003 period from that timing shift. \n     S. 2361 would also increase offsetting receipts and direct \n     spending of such receipts by approximately $3 million each \n     year from 1999 through 2003.\n       The estimated budgetary impact of certain provisions in S. \n     2361 is shown in the following table. The table does not \n     reflect some potential savings and costs from provisions that \n     may affect discretionary spending but for which CBO cannot \n     estimate the likely effects. In particular, we cannot \n     estimate the potential savings in the costs of future \n     disaster relief from the increased spending on predisaster \n     mitigation activities that would be authorized by S. 2361. \n     The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 450 \n     (community and regional development).\n\n                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   1998       1999       2000       2001       2002       2003\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\nSpending for Disaster Relief Under Current\n Law:\n    Budget Authority/Authorization Level \\1\\..      1,920        327        335        344        352        361\n    Estimated Outlays.........................       2,00      2,580      2,060      1,741      1,211        844\nProposed Changes:\n    Specified Authorization for Predisaster\n     Mitigation:\n        Authorization Level...................          0         35         35         35         35          0\n        Estimated Outlays.....................          0         18         32         35         35         17\n    Estimated Authorizations:\n        Authorization Level...................          0        197         62         62         62         62\n        Estimated Outlays.....................          0        197         62         62         62         62\nSpending for Disaster Relief Under S. 2361:\n    Estimated Authorization Level.............      1,920        559        432        441        449        423\n    Estimated Outlays.........................      2,000      2,795      2,154      1,838      1,308        923\n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\nEstimated Budget Authority....................          0          0          0          0          0          0\nEstimated Outlays.............................          0        230      (\\2\\)       -138        -92     (\\2\\)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 1998 level is the amount appropriated for that year, including $1.6 billion for an emergency\n  supplemental appropriation provided in Public Law 105-74. The remainder of the 1998 level is the regular\n  appropriation of $320 million. The levels shown for 1999 through 2003 are CBO baseline projections assuming\n  increases for anticipated inflation. Alternatively, if the comparison were made to a baseline without\n  discretionary inflation, the current law authorization level would be $320 million each year, but the\n  incremental cost of the bill would be the same.\n\\2\\ Less than $500,000.\n\n                           basis of estimate\n\n       For the purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that S. 2361 \n     will be enacted near the beginning of fiscal year 1999, and \n     that the amounts authorized and estimated to be necessary \n     will be appropriated near the start of each fiscal year.\n     Spending Subject to Appropriation\n       S. 2361 contains provisions that would result in both costs \n     and savings to the federal government. CBO estimates costs \n     associated with provisions that would: Authorize \n     appropriations for predisaster mitigation, increase the \n     federal contribution for mitigation costs, combine the \n     Individual Family Grant program and the Temporary Housing \n     Assistance program, remove a cap on grants for disaster \n     assistance plans, and increase certain disability and \n     education benefits by expanding the definition of public \n     safety officers.\n       CBO estimates savings associated with provisions that \n     would: Allow the President to use the estimated cost of \n     repairs rather than the actual cost, and eliminate the \n     community disaster loan program.\n       CBO cannot estimate the discretionary effects of provisions \n     that would: Achieve long-run savings associated with the \n     predisaster mitigation efforts, encourage provision of \n     financial assistance rather than provision of housing units, \n     establish standardized rates for reimbursement of management \n     costs, provide grants for the testing and application of \n     hazard identification technologies, establish a pilot program \n     to determine the desirability of state administration of \n     parts of the disaster relief program, and authorize\n\n[[Page S11296]]\n\n     the President to provide fire suppression assistance to local \n     governments.\n       Provisions with Estimated Costs. Under current law, 15 \n     percent of the estimated amount of grants made with respect \n     to a major disaster would be provided to the state for post-\n     disaster mitigation activities. S. 2361 would increase this \n     percentage to 20 percent for all major disasters declared \n     after March 1, 1997. FEMA spent $332 million for post-\n     disaster mitigation from March 1, 1997, to August 31, 1998. \n     If the contribution were raised by one-third, the federal \n     government would make an additional $111 million in grants \n     for its share of mitigation activities during this period. To \n     assess future costs, CBO based its projection on the average \n     annual amount of such expenses over the last five calendar \n     years--$313 million. Using that five-year average, the rate \n     increase from 15 percent to 20 percent would require \n     increased funding for the federal contribution of $104 \n     million a year over the next several years. In total, CBO \n     estimates that implementing this provision would require the \n     appropriation of $655 million over the 1999-2003 period: $135 \n     million for the 1997-1998 period and $520 million for the \n     1999-2003 period. This estimate assumes that the funds to \n     pay for the provision would come from future \n     appropriations.\n       CBO estimates that combining the Individual Family Grant \n     program and the Temporary Housing Assistance program would \n     result in additional costs of approximately $40 million per \n     year from 1999 through 2003. Under current law, the federal \n     share for the IFG program is 75 percent of the actual cost \n     incurred. Combining the IFG and THA programs would change the \n     federal match to 100 percent.\n       CBO estimates that the costs associated with removing the \n     yearly cap of $50,000 per state on the grants that are made \n     to states for improvement of disaster assistance plans would \n     be about $1 million per year. FEMA currently provides the \n     maximum $50,000 grant to each state for disaster assistance \n     planning. Under S. 2361, FEMA would no longer be bound by the \n     cap and might increase spending on state disaster assistance \n     programs, although such spending is subject to appropriation. \n     Additional spending on state disaster assistance plans could \n     result in future savings if improving these disaster plans \n     reduces FEMA's long-run costs.\n       S. 2361 would make certain federal and state emergency \n     management employees eligible for disability and education \n     benefits. Enacting the legislation could increase payments of \n     these benefits, assuming appropriation of any necessary \n     amounts. CBO estimates that the effect on discretionary \n     spending would be less than $500,000 a year because the \n     number of additional people qualifying for these benefits \n     would likely be very small.\n       Provisions with Estimated Savings. CBO estimates that \n     allowing the President to use the estimated cost of repairing \n     a facility, rather than the actual cost, to determine the \n     level of assistance to provide would result in savings of \n     approximately $56 million per year. According to FEMA, \n     reliance on the estimated cost rather than the actual cost of \n     repair would reduce the administrative burden on the agency. \n     S. 2361 would also establish an expert panel, including \n     representatives from the construction industry, to develop \n     procedures for estimating the cost of repairing a facility. \n     If the actual costs of repair are greater than 120 percent or \n     less than 80 percent of the estimated costs, CBO assumes that \n     FEMA could receive compensation for overpayments or provide \n     compensation for underpayments. Savings from this provision \n     may be partially offset by the additional costs of \n     establishing an expert panel, estimating the cost of repairs \n     with more precision, and evaluating the accuracy of \n     estimates. CBO estimates that this provision would result in \n     an overall 25 percent reduction in administrative costs after \n     accounting for additional costs described above.\n       Based on data provided by FEMA, CBO estimates that \n     eliminating the community disaster loan program would result \n     in savings of approximately $23 million each year from 1999 \n     through 2003.\n       Provisions with Effects CBO Cannot Estimate. The potential \n     budgetary effects of various provisions of S. 2361 are \n     uncertain because they depend upon the extent and nature of \n     future disasters, the manner in which the Administration \n     would implement certain provisions, and the extent to which \n     states would participate in certain programs.\n       CBO cannot estimate the potential savings associated with \n     the predisaster mitigation efforts proposed in this bill. \n     Mitigation efforts could achieve substantial savings if \n     damages from future disasters are lessened as a result of the \n     predisaster mitigation measures provided for in the bill. In \n     addition, S. 2361 would encourage the provision of financial \n     assistance to disaster victims for rental of alternative \n     housing accommodations rather than directly providing housing \n     units. CBO expects that this provision would result in \n     savings, but we cannot estimate the amount of the savings. \n     Finally, S. 2361 also would establish standardized \n     reimbursement rates that would reduce the administrative \n     burden of compensating states for indirect costs not \n     chargeable to a specific project. This provision is also \n     likely to result in some savings in FEMA's administrative \n     costs, but CBO has no basis for estimating the likely amount \n     of such savings.\n       In addition, S. 2361 would authorize grants for 50 percent \n     of the cost of testing new hazard identification technologies \n     (such as improved floodplain mapping technologies) and would \n     establish a pilot program for the devolution of certain \n     responsibilities to the states. At this time, CBO cannot \n     estimate the costs associated with these provisions, or any \n     potential savings that might later accrue from implementing \n     them.\n       Finally, based on information from FEMA, CBO estimates that \n     the provision authorizing the President to provide additional \n     assistance to local governments for fire suppression would \n     probably have no significant net budgetary impact. Additional \n     costs for providing this assistance are likely to be at least \n     partially offset by administrative savings; but CBO cannot \n     estimate the precise net effect of this provision.\n     Direct Spending\n       Enacting S. 2361 would affect direct spending by speeding \n     up the disbursement of funds that have already been \n     appropriated for post-disaster mitigation under section 404 \n     of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act. The bill would allow the President to use \n     such funds for the predisaster mitigation program if the \n     funds are not obligated within 30 months after the \n     declaration of the disaster for which they were provided. \n     Based on information from FEMA, CBO estimates that \n     currently approximately $460 million would be eligible for \n     use by the predisaster mitigation program under this \n     provision. Under S. 2361, CBO expects that those funds \n     would be spent between 1999 and 2001, instead of between \n     2000 and 2002, as under current law. Outlays would \n     increase by $230 million in 1999 and drop by an equal \n     amount over fiscal years 2001 and 2002. The net direct \n     spending effect of this provision would be zero over the \n     1999-2003 period. More funds, in addition to the estimated \n     $460 million, could become available in the future for \n     shifts to predisaster mitigation activity, but we cannot \n     estimate the likely amount. Finally, this provision could \n     lead to an increase in future appropriations to replenish \n     the disaster relief fund's resources for post-disaster \n     mitigation, but the magnitude and timing of any such \n     effect is uncertain.\n       In addition, the bill would change the definition of public \n     safety officer to include permanent employees of FEMA and \n     employees of a state or local emergency management agency \n     whose duties are determined to be hazardous and related to a \n     major disaster or emergency. CBO estimates that any change in \n     direct spending would be less than $500,000 a year because \n     the number of additional beneficiaries is likely to be very \n     small.\n       The bill would expand FEMA's authority to sell temporary \n     housing. Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, proceeds from \n     nonroutine asset sales may be counted as a reduction in \n     direct spending for pay-as-you-go purposes only if such sales \n     would entail no net financial cost to the government. CBO \n     estimates that the sale of temporary housing under S. 2361 \n     would not result in a net cost to the government. Based on \n     data provided by FEMA detailing the sale of manufactured \n     homes and trailers, CBO estimates that this provision would \n     result in increased offsetting receipts of approximately $3 \n     million each year. Because the agency could then spend the \n     new receipts, without appropriation action, this provision \n     would have no net effect on direct spending.\n       The provision relating to sales of temporary housing would \n     direct the President to deposit all receipts from such sales \n     into the disaster relief fund, where they could be spent \n     without further appropriation. Under current law, any \n     receipts obtained are deposited into the general fund of the \n     Treasury (and thus are not available for spending). This \n     change would result in increased direct spending related to \n     sales that would occur under current law. But based on \n     information from FEMA, CBO estimates that any such effect \n     would be insignificant because receipts from sales under \n     existing authority are expected to be negligible.\n\n\n                      pay-as-you-go considerations\n\n       The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act sets \n     up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts. The net changes in outlays that \n     are subject to pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in the \n     following table. The use of existing unexpended balances \n     for predisaster mitigation will increase outlays in 1999, \n     but have no net impact over the next five years.

The bill would authorize $175 \n     million over the next five years to assist in predisaster \n     mitigation projects, and the percentage of funds available \n     for post-disaster mitigation activities would be increased. \n     The 25 percent state matching requirements for individual and \n     family grants and certain housing assistance would no longer \n     be required, reducing the burden on states by an estimated \n     $40 million per year.\n       The bill would also amend the definition of public \n     facilities to exclude public golf courses, making them no \n     longer eligible for funding under the Stafford Act. In \n     addition, states or local governments which take longer than \n     three years after declaration of a major disaster to file a \n     claim for assistance would be subject to a potential \n     reduction in the federal government's share of their claim.\n\n\n                 estimated impact on the private sector\n\n       The bill would impose no new private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA.\n\n\n                         previous cbo estimate\n\n       On August 5, 1998, CBO prepared a cost estimate for H.R. \n     3869, the Disaster Mitigation Act of 1998, as ordered \n     reported by the House Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure on June 25, 1998. H.R. 3869 differs from S. \n     2361 in that it would provide higher authorization levels for \n     the predisaster mitigation program and would add new \n     restrictions to the funds that a private nonprofit facility \n     could receive for repair and replacement of damaged \n     facilities. H.R. 3869 does not contain provisions that would \n     affect fire suppression assistance and public safety officer \n     benefits as S. 2361 does.

Mr. President, S. 414 is my bill that was passed by \nthe Senate. It was passed by the House. It is now back in the \nconference, and there will be an amendment.\n  American ports and carriers are disadvantaged by current laws that \nrequire all contracts to be public. To avoid this, shippers who \nconveniently can, will ship out of foreign ports in nearby Canada and \nMexico to avoid this. U.S. ports are bypassed and the U.S. carriers \nlose business because only U.S. companies have to reveal their ocean \ntransportation costs. This permits their foreign competition to \nundercut our shippers.\n  Recent economic problems in Asia will increase pressure in those \ncountries to increase their exports. Therefore, S. 414 will be even \nmore important as our shippers meet the heightened competitive \nchallenge.\n  S. 414 attempts to level the playing field between U.S. companies \nwhich export and their foreign competitors.\n  This bill will encourage greater competition among carriers. It will \nprovide American exporters and importers with greater choice in \nobtaining ocean transportation services, and promote more ocean \nshipping activity for our carriers and our ports.\n  In providing our shippers with this important reform, we have still \nattempted to preserve anti-discrimination provisions in current law and \nthe elements of our current ``transparent'' system that protect our \nports, smaller shippers and U.S. workers. This bill balances the need \nto have enough transparency to assure fair pricing with contract \nprivacy.\n  Our shippers say they want more flexibility in dealing with their \nocean carriers, and the ability to go outside the traditional tariff \nsystem and conference structure. We've provided this needed \nconfidentiality, but balanced it with protections for ports and U.S. \ndock workers who seek information on the movement of commodities to \nprotect their competitive position.\n  Ninety-five percent of U.S. foreign commerce is transported via ocean \nshipping. Half of this trade, which is carried by container liner \nvessels with scheduled service and is regulated under the Shipping Act \nof 1984, is affected by these reforms. This bill represents the first \nmajor reform of this critical industry in a decade, and the most \nsignificant change to the underlying statute since 1984.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have worked with the distinguished \nMajority Leader and colleagues from both sides of the aisle to pass \nthis important legislation.\n  I would like to commend, in addition to the Majority Leader, the \nranking member of the full Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, the \nranking member of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine \nSubcommittee, Senator Inouye, and my colleague from Louisiana, Senator \nBreaux, for their hard work in putting together meaningful legislation \nthat we're passing today.\n  I am very pleased we have now worked this important bill out. I think \nit will certainly help our economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate concur in the amendment of the \nHouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge today's passage of the \nOcean Shipping Reform Act. This action sets America's maritime industry \non the right course. It increases competition for U.S. exporters by \nallowing America's exporters to compete on a level playing field with \nforeign entities. It has been fourteen years since Congress tackled \ncomprehensive ocean shipping reform for the commercial sector. Since \nmost of the world's commerce travels by sea, and the industry has \nchanged so much during that period, additional reform is long since \noverdue. This legislation will update, revise, and improve upon the \nShipping Act of 1984. It ensures fairness for U.S. carriers and \nshippers by modernizing America's ocean shipping regulatory system.\n  The Ocean Shipping Reform Act represents true compromise. This \nlegislative effort brought together many divergent interests--parties \nwho often do not agree with one another. As my colleagues can attest \nto, achieving mutually beneficial reform was not an easy task. The \nprocess was difficult and sometimes arduous. It was, however, a \nnecessary and important legislative journey for our nation's ocean \nshipping industry. In the end, all affected parties rolled-up their \nsleeves and worked hard to develop an equitable solution. The result is \na consensus bill that received the solid backing of all industry \nsegments including U.S. shippers, American and foreign ocean carriers, \nports nation-wide, and U.S. labor. The 105th Congress' passage of this \ncompromise measure represents a milestone in maritime policy. Everyone \ninvolved can be proud of this significant accomplishment.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the \nmany individuals from industry and labor who participated in this \nendeavor. I also want to congratulate the many Senators and staff who \nworked on this bill.\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\n I particularly want to express my gratitude to Senator McCain, Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison and Senator Gorton who worked diligently to \ndeliver to the U.S. shipping industry and to all Americans real \nmaritime reform. I also want to recognize the efforts of Chairman \nShuster of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure who \nspearheaded this reform effort in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 focuses on the \nneeds of America's small, medium, and large shippers, carriers, U.S. \nports, and on our nation's dock workers. It will ensure that the \ncollective power of some industry elements will not be allowed to abuse \nother industry segments. The bill provides protection for small ports \nand small shippers through increased competition among shipping lines \nfor export and import cargoes. It allows shipping lines and their \ncustomers to negotiate volume discount arrangements through the signing \nof confidential service contracts for transportation services without \nfirst obtaining the blessing of the shipping line conferences. This \nlegislation gives shippers greater ability to shop around for the best \nrates and service from the carriers of their choice. Additionally, the \nbill continues current filing requirements for service contracts to \nprovide continued FMC oversight of common carrier activities.\n  This legislation will retain common carrier tariff publication and \nenforcement while eliminating the requirement to file tariffs with the \ngovernment. Common carriers would be able to take advantage of \navailable modern technology by using a World Wide Web home page or an \nelectronic bulletin board to satisfy the tariff publication \nrequirement. This just makes common sense. It reduces the cost of doing \nbusiness while maintaining protections for small shippers. The wide \navailability of competitive price and service information will make for \na better informed shipping consumer.\n  The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 does much to ensure that \nAmerica's presence in the shipping industry is not subjected to unfair \nforeign rules or discriminatory practices. The FMC's enforcement \nactions taken against unfair port practices in Japan illustrates the \nessential and unique mission that this agency performs. Even more \nrecently, issues concerning Brazil and China have come on their radar \nscreen. This is a function that will continue, a mission that I \nwholeheartedly support.\n  This legislation will significantly change the regulatory framework \ngoverning ocean transportation. It increases shipper and carrier \nflexibility and competitive options, ensures tariff accuracy and \nfairness, produces government efficiencies and provides genuine reform \nto protect American interests. These changes will strengthen the \nability of common carriers to market their services and makes America's \nshippers more competitive. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 makes \nsense for American businesses and consumers alike. It will help sustain \na strong and vibrant American maritime industry--fostering economic \ngrowth and enhancing our national security for years to come.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I rise to praise the Senate for the \nfinal passage of S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, and to \nclarify the legislative history of the bill with the Senator from \nTexas, who authorized the bill.\n  On April 21, 1998, the Senate first adopted S. 414. In her statement \nproviding legislative history for the bill, the Senator from Texas \nidentified a need to resolve the requirement for Federal agencies, \nincluding those in the Department of Defense, to ensure U.S.-flag ocean \ncommon carrier compliance with cargo preference law requirements \nconcerning shipping rates with the new confidential service contracting \nregime authorized by S. 414., At that time, my colleague encouraged the \nFederal Maritime Commission to work with other Federal agencies to \naddress this concern.\n  I'd like to ask the Senator from Texas to clarify the ability of the \nFMC to share confidential service contract rate and service information \nwith other Federal agencies to ensure that U.S.-flag shipping rates for \npreference cargo shipments meet statutory requirements.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \nChairman of the Commerce Committee for raising this issue. The General \nCounsel of the FMC, in a recent written response to an inquiry on this \nissue with respect to the Department of Defense, stated:\n\n       I have no doubt that we will be able to develop an \n     intragovernmental system for providing the DOD with the \n     pricing and service information it needs to effectively \n     execute its mission, within the framework of S. 414. If we \n     determine that technical legislative corrections would aid \n     this process, we will no doubt make such recommendations \n     jointly. At this time, however, I do not believe that any \n     additional amendments to the bill are necessary to meet your \n     concerns for the Department.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that the FMC is authorized to \nshare with another Federal agency service contract information that \nparties of the service contract have legally decided to protect from \npublic disclosure in order to enable that Federal agency to ensure the \ncompliance of U.S.-flag ocean common carriers with cargo preference law \nshipping rate requirements. Of course, that confidential service \ncontract information would remain protected from disclosure to the \npublic consistent with the Shipping Act of 1984, as amended by the \nOcean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, and other applicable Federal laws.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I'd like to thank my colleague from Texas \nfor clarifying this issue. Also, I'd like to complement her on her \nefforts to protect the interests of the Department of Defense, other \nFederal agencies, and American taxpayers while reforming the ocean \nliner transportation system in a manner that encourages greater \ncompetition. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 is a thoroughly \ncrafted piece of legislation that required hard work by her and many \nothers for more than 3 years. It is a worthy accomplishment for the \n106th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11297-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11302-S11303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF INSPECTORS GENERAL\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Joint \nResolution 58, introduced earlier today by Senators Glenn, Thompson, \nCollins, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 58) recognizing the \n     accomplishments of Inspectors General since their creation in \n     1978 in preventing and detecting waste, fraud, abuse and \n     mismanagement, and in promoting economy, efficiency and \n     effectiveness in the Federal Government.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint \nresolution commemorating the Inspector General Act in the year of its \n20th anniversary. The Governmental Affairs Committee, on which I serve \nas Ranking Minority Member, has a long and bipartisan history with the \nIG community. In fact, I am very proud that I was an original sponsor \nof the IG Act and author of the 1988 amendments, both of which have \nplayed a major role in making our government function more efficiently, \neffectively, and with greater trust and confidence on the part of the \nAmerican people. So, it is fitting that the Senate and House note this \nanniversary.\n  Throughout government, IGs have had tremendous success. I note just \nsome of these accomplishments as follows, from the latest (1996) PCIE \nreport:\n\n       Inspector General (IG) investigations led to $1.5 billion \n     in ``recoveries'' in 1995. (This is money which has been \n     recovered by the Government from people who have attempted to \n     defraud it). In addition, based on IG recommendations, agency \n     managers agreed to cancel, or seek reimbursements of, $2.3 \n     billion from contractors or grantees in 1995. Also based on \n     IG recommendations, managers changed how they planned to \n     spend $10.4 billion to maximize return on the Federal dollar. \n     Overall, between 1981-1994, IG's reported $340 billion in \n     recoveries & funds put to better use from their efforts.\n       In addition to IG work on program improvements, and the \n     figures cited above, the report compiles other important IG \n     accomplishments from FY 1995: $26.8 billion in \n     recommendations that funds be put to better\n\n[[Page S11303]]\n\n     use; $7.2 billion in questioned costs; 14,122 successful \n     prosecutions; 2,405 personnel actions; and 4,234 suspensions \n     and debarments of persons or firms doing business with the \n     Government.\n\n  These facts suggest that IGs are doing the job we intended them to \ndo, in spite of the fact that they are operating in a very difficult \nand more complex environment. The data also support the fact that the \nIG's first responsibility continues to be program and fiscal integrity; \nthey are not ``tools'' of management. Even though, in this day and age, \nIGs need to make themselves ``relevant'' to both Congress and the \nagency, they first must help to make good programs work better, target \nthose most vulnerable to waste and fraud, and help achieve savings \nwherever they can find them. The record proves this is clearly what the \nIG's have been about.\n  The progress I have mentioned is particularly important since, if \nanything, the IG's role has only become more difficult in a new \npolitical culture dedicated to improving management. With the passage \nof the CFO Act, the Government Management Reform Act (GMRA), and the \nGovernment Performance and Results Act (GPRA), IGs have inherited some \nnew authority and some new duties. They now have some responsibility to \nensure that we have accurate, reliable, and complete financial \ninformation on which to base our policy decisions and, down the road, \nwhich measure how well each program achieves its goal and at what \nactual cost. In that context, IGs have a unique role in helping to \nsolve management problems throughout the federal government. The test \nof their success in this new mission is much like the one applied to \ntheir old one and--as I have indicated--the measure of their success is \nalready evident.\n  As I approach my last months as a United States Senator, I look back \nwith great pride on the accomplishments we have made so far among the \nmore than 60 statutory IGs. I am the first one to admit that the IGs do \nnot function perfectly. In fact, any government operation can always \nstand improvement. But I strongly believe that we now have in place a \nfair, effective, and useful--if partial--solution to some very serious \nmanagement problems in government. To me, this represents a singularly \nimportant success for the Congress and the American people, and one \nupon which I am hopeful we will continue to build into the 21st century \nand beyond.\n  I hope all Senators will join me in supporting this important \nresolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I would also like to offer remarks that \nI have prepared as we celebrate today the first balanced budget in 30 \nyears. I had occasion to be elected to the Senate on a number of \nissues, but none more important than a commitment to work for that goal \njust 2 years ago.\n  I remember when I first got here, Secretary of Treasury Rubin was \ntestifying before the Judiciary Committee on the question of whether we \nneeded a balanced budget constitutional amendment that would mandate \nthat we balance the budget. He said we did not. He said they had a plan \nthat would balance the budget by 2002.\n  I was new. I had been told that Secretary Rubin was quite a skillful \nwitness and that I should be careful. I said, ``Mr. Secretary, that is \na nice promise you made. But the truth is you won't be here in 2002 as \nSecretary of the Treasury, will you?'' Without hesitating, he said, \n``Well, I haven't talked to the Vice President yet.'' But I was left \nwith a thought that, well, President Clinton would not be here \nconstitutionally as President past his two full terms, and that he \ncould not make a promise that we could balance the budget long after he \nleft office.\n  So I just say that to say that less than 2 years ago there was great \ndoubt in our country and among our public policy leaders that we would, \nin fact, be able to balance the budget.\n  This Congress has stepped forward and has made some tough decisions. \nIt has worked with the administration. It has put caps on spending that \nare holding. And we have now produced a balanced budget amendment with \nmaybe a $70 billion surplus.\n  When I traveled across the state two years ago during my campaign for \nthe Senate, I learned that foremost in the minds of Alabamians \nregarding the future of our country was the economic legacy we as \ntaxpayers were creating for our children. At the time, that legacy \nmeant budget deficits as far as the eye could see. I believe that part \nof the reason why I was elected to the Senate was because of my promise \nto change that legacy by supporting a balanced budget, and to do so by \ncutting spending and eliminating fraud and abuse.\n  Today, I am proud to witness as a Member of Congress, the first \nbalanced budget in thirty years. It is an historic event much as Neil \nArmstrong's first steps taken on the Moon in 1969--the last year there \nwas no budget deficit.\n  As a result of this achievement, the American taxpayer is enjoying \nhistorically low interest rates on mortgages, car loans, and students \nloans. Those who could only dream of buying a home are becoming \nhomeowners. Automobiles are more affordable than ever. And students \nwith college loans are finding the burden of their debt lessened as \nthey graduate and enter the workforce.\n  Businesses are benefitting as well. Lower interest rates mean more \nmoney to invest in capital, and expanded capital means more jobs. The \nunemployment rate is at an historic low of 4.5 percent. The effects of \nthis tight labor market combined with such low interest rates has meant \nreturns to workers in the form of higher wages. Indeed, income for the \ntypical American household rose at nearly twice the rate of inflation \nin 1997.\n  There are many people that deserve credit for this historic \nachievement, but none more than the American people. It is the American \npeople that created a mandate for a balanced budget by electing those \nof us to office who would make it their number one priority to put the \ncountry's books in the black. I am proud to be part of that mandate. It \nis a Republican Congress who responded to this mandate by producing a \nbalanced budget and doing it ahead of schedule. If this responsibility \nhad been left to the President, today we would have a $196 billion \ndeficit, which he called for in his 1996 budget.\n  But it is not enough to balance the budget just once. Now that we \nhave achieved a balance, we need to maintain it. Interest rates don't \nrespond to what the deficit is today. They respond to what people think \nthe deficit is going to be in the future, and big hurdles remain before \na future of balanced budgets can be assured. Today, we begin a new \nfiscal year with a surplus of $63 billion. Yet, hard choices regarding \nspending must still be made in order to preserve Social Security and \nMedicare, as well as cut taxes in order to keep the economy and \nfamilies strong.\n  It is a time to celebrate, and I think we should pause and be \ngrateful.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/01/senate-section/article/S11304-5", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
