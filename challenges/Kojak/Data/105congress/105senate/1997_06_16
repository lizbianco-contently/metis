You are the answer \nto our deepest needs. More than any secondary gift You can give, we \nlong for the primary grace of Yourself offered in profound love and \nacceptance.

We \nentrust to You our concerns over people we will meet and the \ncircumstances we will encounter and the problems we will face. Our \ndesire is to give ourselves to the work of this day with freedom and \njoy. Give us strength when we become tired, fresh vision when our wells \nbecome dry, and enthusiastic hope when others become disappointed.\n  Thank You, Father, for the constancy of Your care and love. With one \nheart we ask You to comfort and strengthen Tom Daschle now in his grief \nover the death of his father, Sebastian Daschle. Be with Tom's mother, \nBetty, and give her peace in her time of need. Place Your arms of love \naround this family. In the name of Him who is the resurrection and the \nlife.

For the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in \na period of morning business today until the hour of 12:30 p.m. \nFollowing morning business, by previous consent, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the State Department reauthorization bill. Senators \nwho intend to offer amendments to that legislation should be prepared \nto offer and debate their amendments today. I understand we do have a \ncouple of amendments that may be offered. We have announced earlier \nthat any rollcall votes ordered on those amendments will not occur \ntoday but, instead, will be stacked to occur at a time to be determined \nin the morning by the two leaders. We do hope to open with some early \nvotes so we can get on toward completion of the State Department \nreauthorization hopefully by tomorrow night. Senator Daschle and I \ndiscussed that last week before he left, and we agreed that we would \ntry to complete action by Tuesday night, since we have bipartisan \nagreement on this legislation.\n  Senators will be notified accordingly exactly when the rollcall votes \nwill be scheduled, and we hope that we can finish the State Department \nreauthorization so that we can move on to other bills. We now have \nscheduled the Defense authorization bill for Wednesday and the \nremainder of the week. We have some other issues that we might try to \nget up, including the intelligence authorization bill.\n  So I remind Senators again that there are only 2 weeks remaining \nprior to the July 4 recess. The next 2 weeks will certainly be very \nbusy, and I hope Senators will continue to be cooperative as we \nschedule legislation and votes. I thank our colleagues for their \ncooperation in the Chamber. We may have to go into the night some the \nnext 2 weeks in order to get through the State Department \nauthorization, the Defense authorization, maybe even the intelligence \nauthorization and the two reconciliation bills next week, one on the \nspending side and, of course, the tax bill. That is a big order, but \nthe Finance Committee will be meeting most of the day tomorrow and \nWednesday and Thursday to complete action on those two important \nreconciliation bills that will carry out the directions of the budget \nresolution that we agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5651-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SYMPATHY TO THE DASCHLE FAMILY\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, as the House of Representatives begins \nthe process of MFN disapproval today, I rise to once again voice my own \nstrong opposition to the administration's proposed renewal of most \nfavored nation status to China. The United States Ambassador to China, \nJames Sasser, has recently stated--and of course Ambassador Sasser is a \nproponent, as a member of the administration, and he has favored MFN--\nbut Ambassador Sasser said China's defense budget is growing. The \nChinese themselves have announced an increase in that budget which will \nbring total defense outlays next year to $10 billion and he says some \nsuggest the amount is really closer to $40 billion.\n  So there is nothing at all theoretical about China's military \nbuildup. Even the administration, even those who are saying we should \ncontinue most-favored-nation status trading status for China, will \nadmit that there is a dramatic and drastic buildup of military \ncapability in China.\n  Here is what we know about the Chinese military and its potential, \nbased on the United States Government's own official estimates. The \n1997 report by the Office of Naval Intelligence, entitled ``Worldwide \nChallenges to Naval Strike Warfare 1997,'' is devoted almost entirely \nto rapid increases in Chinese capabilities with Iraq, North Korea, and \nLibyan capabilities covered almost as an afterthought. China, it \ninforms us ``is working on the development of at least six new tactical \naircraft at a time when most nations are finding it difficult to \nfinance even one.'' It continues, ``Overall, the Chinese hope to `leap' \ngenerations of technology with large investments in new air defense \ncapability.''\n  Mr. President, from Beijing, the words of China's military planners \nthemselves, such as this analysis from a paper prepared for senior \nChinese officials titled ``Can the Chinese Army Win the Next War?'' \n``While the conflict of strategic interests between China and the \nUnited States was overshadowed for a time by the tripartite great power \nrelationship, it is now surfacing steadily since the breakup of the \nSoviet Union. China and the United States, focused on their respective \neconomic and political interests in the Asia-Pacific region, will \nremain in a sustained state of confrontation.''\n  That is coming from the Chinese Government, predicting a sustained \nstate of confrontation. The evidence concerning a Chinese military \nbuildup is clear, it is crystal clear. Whether this evidence comes \nstraight from the administration that would renew MFN to China or from \nBeijing, how can we reward this regime with a most-favored-nation \nstatus? Many who regard themselves as free traders and who argue \nagainst linkage of trade through human rights or any other domestic \ncircumstance would admit that when our own national security is \ninvolved, when national security is raised to an issue, then trading is \na legitimate leverage and a legitimate tool for us to use as a Nation.\n  So apart from the abysmal human rights record, apart from the \ndeplorable human rights conditions in China today, apart from the fact \nthat human rights conditions in China have deteriorated over the last 5 \nyears, in spite of all of that, we could look alone at the military \nbuildup in China today and justify denial of most-favored-nation status \nfor China.\n  I believe that China's chemical and nuclear exports are the most \nserious proliferation threat in the world today, and China has held \nthat title at least for the past decade and a half. Since 1980, China \nhas supplied billions of dollars worth of nuclear and missile \ntechnology to South Asia, South Africa, South America, and the Middle \nEast. China has done so, Mr. President, in the teeth of United States \nprotests and despite repeated promises that they would stop.\n  The chemical and nuclear exports continue, and while they do, they \nmake it impossible for the United States and the West to halt the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction, a trend that endangers everyone.\n  Mr. President, China has been the leading proliferator of nuclear \nweapons in the world. China gave Pakistan nearly everything it needed \nto make its first atomic bomb. In the early 1980's, China gave Pakistan \na tested nuclear weapon design and enough high-enriched uranium to fuel \nit. Mr. President, this has to be one of the most egregious acts of \nnuclear proliferation in history. Then China helped Pakistan produce \nhigh-enriched uranium with gas centrifuges. Now, Mr. President, China \nis helping Pakistan build a reactor to produce plutonium for nuclear \nweapons, and helping Pakistan increase the number of its centrifuges so \nit can boost its production of high-enriched uranium.\n  If we grant MFN trading to China, we tacitly endorse the weapons of \nmass destruction, we support our enemies in their own military buildup, \nand last Mr. President we set a poor example as the leader of the free \nworld.\n  This administration continues to forgive and to forget China for the \nabuse, the persecution, and the military buildup that it is continuing \nto employ. There is no reason to think that China's nuclear and \nchemical export patterns will change. I know the Presiding Officer is \nwell aware of those trends and those practices in China today, but \nthere is no evidence that those patterns will change as long as the \nUnited States follows its current policy of MFN trade status for China. \nChina is now saying explicitly that it will not even talk to us about \nmissile and chemical proliferation.\n  As I have stated before, Mr. President, on this floor, there must be \nsome things more important than expanded trade opportunities, some \nthings more important than the almighty dollar. Today, as the House \nbegins the process of marking up most-favored-nation status disapproval \nresolution, I think it is the time for this institution to say we will \nnot continue business as usual with China. The administration's \nlobbying efforts to grant MFN trading status to China will most \nassuredly intensify in coming days. We as a country and we as an \ninstitution must set an example for the world to follow. If we grant \nthis regime MFN, we set, I think, a continued example only of \nappeasement.\n  Mr. President, I want to make one last point. The repressive Chinese \nCommunist regime has established a blood-stained record of \ndiscrimination, detention, and death. The reeducation through labor \ncamps are really no different at all from the old concentration\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\ncamps or the gulag. But people seem to know less, they seem to care \nless, in the case of China. Let this institution show that it, in fact, \nknows, and it, in fact, cares.\n  In my closing remarks I quote from an editorial that appeared in my \nhometown newspaper in Bentonville, AR, last week. The closing words of \nthe editorial said this: ``Every time you buy a product labeled Made in \nChina, send up a prayer for Chinese Christians who must live each and \nevery day in fear that their long-suffering faith will cost them their \nfamilies and their lives.''\n  Mr. President, I suggest it is past time that we stood as a Nation \nagainst the intolerable human rights record of the nation of China.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5652-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5653-S5655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken on the floor many, many times \nabout the pace of the Senate confirming judicial nominees. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, my friend, has had to do double duty \nbecause he has had to listen to me do it in the Judiciary Committee, \ntoo, on occasion. I commend his equanimity and patience in listening to \nmy remarks.\n  Mr. President, I urge all Senators, Republican and Democrat alike, to \nmove forward on the confirmation of judicial nominees. This weekend, on \none of the ubiquitous television talk shows, the distinguished majority \nleader said he intended to block action on all nominations except \nmilitary nominees until President Clinton fills four seats on the \nFederal Election Commission. The distinguished majority leader, of \ncourse, has the right and power to control the calendar of the Senate. \nI have no question about that. But I hope he would reconsider this \npolicy for all nominees, but especially for the Federal judiciary.\n  The distinguished majority leader has a concern with the President on \nthe FEC. I am not going to get in the middle of that issue. Both sides \nclaim they are moving forward with nominees. I have to assume the \nmajority leader of the U.S. Senate has ways of bringing pressure to \nbear on the President of the United States without having to cripple \nthe Federal judiciary or to do things that might appear, whether \nintended or not, to diminish the independence of the Federal judiciary.\n  For example, we have four noncontroversial nominees at the moment in \nthe Federal circuit and district courts. They should not get delayed in \nthis political squabble. They enjoy strong bipartisan support. They \nwere unanimously reported to the full Senate by the Judiciary Committee \nwith all Democrats and all Republicans on that committee voting for \nthem. More importantly, they are desperately needed in the courts which \nthey have been nominated.\n  Let me give an example. Alan Gold has been nominated to be a U.S. \ndistrict court judge for the southern district of Florida. Now, this is \na noncontroversial nominee but it is also one desperately needed. He is \nan extremely well qualified nominee. The Judiciary Committee \nunanimously reported his nomination last month, and the Southern \nDistrict Court of Florida desperately needs him to help manage its \ngrowing backlog of cases. This is in a district that has one of the \nfastest-growing populations in this country. In fact, during his \nconfirmation hearing, the distinguished Republican Senator from \nFlorida, Senator Mack, told the Judiciary Committee, ``This appointment \ncomes at a critical time for south Florida. The Supreme Court's recent \ndecision in Lenz versus Mathis has resulted in the early release of \nhundreds of violent criminals back on the streets and brought about a \ncrisis of confidence in the safety of our neighborhood. This unsettling \nfeeling made it especially critical for South Florida to have a full \ncomplement of the judges administering the laws to fight violent \ncrime.''\n  We first received Alan Gold's nomination in February of this year. \nThe President nominated him for a vacancy on the district court for the \nsouthern district of Florida. This vacancy existed since shortly after \nthe elections last year. He has the support of both Senator Graham and \nSenator Mack.\n  He had a hearing on May 7. The Judiciary Committee reported his \nconfirmation to the full Senate on May 22. This is the way the judicial \nconfirmation process should work. The position had been open only a few \nmonths. The Senate was out at the time the vacancy occurred. Shortly \nafter the elections, the President moved quickly with a nominee that \nhad strong bipartisan support for his home State senators. The \nJudiciary Committee moved very quickly, and the nomination passed out \nunanimously. We know that there is a major need for a judge there. Alan \nGold's nomination is now pending on the Senate calendar, awaiting \naction on the Senate floor. This process should not become entangled in \npartisan squabbling.\n\n  Instead, we should look at the one branch of our Government that is \nsupposed to be nonpartisan--the judiciary--and not allow the Federal \njudiciary to be caught up in partisan squabbling of Senators or with \nthe White House. We should move this nomination through the Senate very \nquickly.\n  Another example of a judicial nomination that we should move quickly \nis in the northern district of Georgia, where Thomas Thrash, Jr., has \nbeen nominated to be a U.S. district judge. We unanimously reported his \nnomination to the Senate last month, on May 22. But this is also a \ndistrict--the northern district of Georgia--there in the eleventh \ncircuit that desperately needs Thomas Thrash to help manage a growing \nbacklog of cases.\n  Now, we received his nomination in May 1996--over a year ago. He was \naccorded a hearing last Congress, on July 31, 1996. But his nomination \ngot caught in the election year freeze, which said we will not move \nnominations after a certain time in a Presidential election year. The \nPresident nominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same \nvacancy. That vacancy has existed since March of 1996, for over a year. \nHe had a confirmation hearing on May 7. He was supported by both \nSenator Cleland and Senator Coverdell, one Democrat and one Republican \nfrom Georgia, and was reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee \n2 weeks later. Now, this is not a case that should be held up because \nof a partisan squabble.\n  Also pending on the calendar is Eric Clay to be a circuit judge for \nthe sixth circuit, another noncontroversial, well-qualified nominee. \nThe Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the \nSenate on May 22 of this year. Now, the sixth circuit desperately needs \nhelp in managing a growing backlog of cases. They have three vacancies, \ntwo of which have been designated judicial emergencies by the Judicial \nConference of the United States. I mention the judicial emergencies, \nMr. President, because this is not a case of some mere debating point; \nthis is the Federal judiciary of this country with emergencies, where \nthey need judges, where we could confirm the judges, and, frankly, the \nU.S. Senate is not doing its job.\n  We first received Eric Clay's nomination in March 1996. He was \naccorded a hearing on March 26, 1996. He was reported unanimously by \nthe Judiciary Committee to the Senate on April 25, 1996. And now, more \nthan a year later, we are still waiting for him to be confirmed. Now, \nEric Clay has the strong support of both Senator Levin and Senator \nAbraham, one Republican and one Democrat. We ought to confirm this \njudge for the sixth circuit.\n  We also have Arthur Gajarsa's nomination to be U.S. circuit judge for \nthe Federal circuit on the calendar. We first received his nomination \nin April--not April 1997, but April 1996. His nomination was passed \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee back in June of last year. Now \nhe is back here again, passed unanimously again. He ought to be \nconfirmed quickly.\n  We also have the nomination of Margaret Morrow for the U.S. District \nCourt for the Central District of California on the Senate calendar. \nShe is another well-qualified nominee. Ms. Morrow is the first woman \npresident of the California Bar Association and the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously approved her nomination last year, but\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\nher confirmation got caught up in the election year stall on judicial \nconfirmations. Just last week, the Judiciary Committee again approved \nher nomination. The Senate should quickly take action on the nomination \nof Margaret Morrow.\n  We have confirmed less than one judge a month since the start of this \nsession in January. We have almost 100 vacancies in the Federal \njudiciary. Many of them are in critical areas, where huge backlogs are \noccurring, where courts are saying that we are benefiting criminals \nbecause they can't be tried; we can't have speedy trials. Criminals get \nthe benefit of this by not having judges to hear the cases. If you have \na civil case, forget about a speedy trial.\n\n  I just look at some of the headlines we have had recently seen, which \nare shown on this chart. One is by the Washington Post, by Sue Anne \nPressley: ``Cases Pile Up as Judgeships Remain Vacant; Drug Crackdown, \nImmigration Inundate U.S. Courts in Texas.'' Apparently, you can be on \nthe southern border of this country and have drug and immigration cases \nin major courts that can't be heard because you can't get enough judges \nthere.\n  Bruce Fein is one who has written primarily from a conservative \nviewpoint. His column: ``Judge Not.'' It speaks of the independent \nFederal judiciary. He says, ``The supreme jewel of our Constitution is \na fiercely independent Federal judiciary, but congressional Republicans \nare attacking this gem.''\n  We have a couple of editorials on the Chief Justice--one from the \nWashington Post and one from the New York Times--speaking of the alert \nfrom the Chief Justice: ``A Reminder From the Chief Justice.'' These \nare the cases where the Chief Justice of this country--another \nconservative Republican--has said, ``We have a crisis situation; let's \nmove on it.''\n  We have one entitled, ``The GOP Hold on Judgeships; Partisan Politics \nHave Ground Confirmations to a Halt.''\n  Now, I say this, Mr. President--I make the same argument now as when \nwe have had a Republican President and a Democratically controlled \nSenate. If there is one area where partisan politics should not be \nallowed, it is in the area of the Federal judiciary.\n  One thing that sets our country apart from virtually all others is \nthe independence of our Federal judiciary. Every country that in this \ncentury has moved toward democracy has sent observers to the United \nStates of America to look at our Federal judiciary and they say, ``How \ndo you have such an independent judiciary?'' Look what is happening in \ncountries that are sometimes lurching into democracy. They say the one \nthing that holds them back, that allows crime to continue, that allows \nan economic system to break down, that allows graft and corruption to \noccur in each of those countries is because their judiciary cannot be \ntruly independent. In our country, our Federal judiciary is truly \nindependent.\n  Now, each one of us, I would gather, on this floor at some time or \nanother has disagreed with a decision of a Federal judge, for different \nreasons. Each one of us, I would be willing to guess, has to thank God \nwe have an independent Federal judiciary and that we can't stand up and \ntell the judge how to rule. I know that when I argued cases before \nFederal courts, I used to sit there knowing they were going to be \nindependent, knowing that I might win and I might lose. I would make my \nbest argument, and it would go from there. That is the way it should \nbe.\n  What I worry about, Mr. President, is that if we allow the Federal \njudiciary to be caught up in partisan moves, where one side tries to \nget advantage over the other, while one side or the other might win in \nthe short term, all of us as Americans are damaged because our Federal \njudiciary is damaged. Every one of us--Republican or Democrat--should \nknow if we look at history, read history, and if we understand history, \nthat one of the reasons we are the greatest democracy history has ever \nknown is because of our independent Federal judiciary. We should never \nallow anything to happen to cut back on that independence.\n  I have never seen anything like this current stall in the judicial \nconfirmation process in almost 23 years in the U.S. Senate. I came here \nin 1974, in one of the largest classes of this Senate. In fact, I today \nstand here as the only one who has not announced retirement or left. \nBut I think all the way through that, working with some of the finest \nmen and women I have ever known in both parties--and we have had \nfights, partisan fights, saying that we should do this farm bill this \nway or this farm bill that way, or this highway bill this way or that \nway, or the crime bill this way or that way--we fought it out and we \nhave had the votes and one side or the other wins, and the President \neither signs it or not. We have done this on foreign policy issues and \non all others. But the one area that we have tried to protect from \npartisan squabbles has been the area of the Federal judiciary.\n\n  We know that whoever is President is going to have the greatest \ninfluence of all of us on who is going to be a Federal judge. President \nReagan made it very clear when he ran for President, for example, who \nhe would appoint as Federal judges. A lot of these Federal judges are \nnot the men and women I would have appointed from that circuit or that \ndistrict. But I voted for all of them because they were honest people, \npeople of integrity, people of confidence, and people I could look at \nand say, although I might have disagreed with their political \nbackground, I know that, as a litigant, if I came before his or her \ncourt, I could expect an honest treatment.\n  President Bush had other ideas who should be there, as President \nCarter and President Ford did. These are all Presidents I have served \nwith. President Clinton now has his ideas.\n  Now, the interesting thing, President Ford was appointed, but these \nothers, in every election, at some point during the campaign, it became \nan issue as to who will this Presidential candidate appoint to the \nFederal judiciary. And the American people examined their views and \nthey elected President Carter, President Reagan, President Ford, and \nPresident Clinton.\n  A President should be given a great deal of latitude on who he \nnominates to the Federal court. If we disagree with a nomination, then \nwe can vote against it. But, frankly, Mr. President, not only does it \ndamage the integrity and the independence of the Federal judiciary by \njust holding judicial nominations hostage where nobody ever even votes \non them, but I think it damages the integrity of the U.S. Senate.\n  I have said many times that the U.S. Senate should be the conscience \nof the Nation. On occasion, it has been. But it does not reflect the \nconscience of a great nation when we take a third and independent \nbranch of our Government, a truly independent branch of our Government, \nand try to whittle away its independence and try to whittle away its \nefficacy, and do it unwilling to stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nand vote one way or the other.\n  If President Clinton sends a nominee to the Senate that any Senator--\nDemocrat or Republican--doesn't like, vote against him or her. That is \nyour right as a U.S. Senator. But don't say, well, they look like \npretty good people, but we can't even allow a vote on their nomination. \nAnd don't say, if you are, for example, in Texas, that it is terrible \nthat drug and illegal immigrant cases are not being heard, what is the \ncourt doing? People in Texas should say, what is the U.S. Senate doing? \nWhy aren't they acting? If you are a civil litigant in the sixth \ncircuit or ninth circuit, or a number of others that have emergency \nvacancies, and you have one of your rights to be protected, what do you \ndo? You say, why aren't those judges hearing these cases? No. Say, why \nisn't the U.S. Senate confirming people.\n  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be advised that under the \nprevious order, at 12:30, the Senate was to begin consideration of S. \n903. Neither of the floor managers for that legislation are present; \ntherefore, a request to continue would be in order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent to continue for \nanother 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we live, unfortunately, in a partisan time. \nI have never seen either the U.S. Senate\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\nor the House of Representatives tied up in such partisan knots. I find \nthat it is personally distressing to me. I have enormous respect for \nthe U.S. Senate and enormous respect for the House of Representatives.\n  I have felt it a great privilege to serve with distinguished \nRepublican and Democrat leaders of both the House and the Senate. I \nthink I have been a personal friend of nearly every leader in the House \nand the Senate in both parties. And I have considered that as one of \nthe great joys of serving in the U.S. Senate. I can think of a number \nof times I have joined with Members of both parties to push difficult \nlegislation through. The last farm bill was an example when it was \ncompletely tied up. Then it became the Lugar-Leahy-Dole farm bill and \npassed this Senate with the highest number of votes which I believe a \nfarm bill had ever passed before. The next closest one was probably the \nLugar-Leahy farm bill of 5 years before.\n  I am not suggesting that the two parties hold hands on every issue by \nany means. I don't think that would serve the country well. But there \nare certain issues where we come together for the country. We have done \nthis on major foreign policy issues. We have done it at times when this \ncountry desperately needed it. We did it recently on the budget \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, each one of us should search our souls and ask whether \nthe country is well served by the bitterness that has gone on in some \nof the partisanship, by the personal attacks against each other and \nagainst the institution that we should be proud to serve, or the \nattacks against the President that have become so personal.\n  We should ask ourselves if we benefit this great Nation that we are \nprivileged to serve if we diminish and chip away and even destroy some \nof the independence of our Federal judiciary because, if we do that, \nMr. President, some day we will no longer be here. Nobody holds a seat \nin the U.S. Senate. The distinguished Presiding Officer will leave \nsometime, and the Senator from Vermont will leave the U.S. Senate \nsometime. All of us will.\n  But when we leave, we should look back, and ask, ``What did we do \nhere? What mark in history did we leave?'' If we have left as our mark \nthat we made the Government better, that we made the Senate better, \nthat we made the Congress better, that we protected the institutions of \nour Government, that we protected the people of our democracy, then we \ncan go home knowing that we served our Nation well.\n  But we should ask ourselves, each and every one, if we leave here and \nsay that as a result of our partisanship on either side of the aisle \nthat the Federal judiciary was diminished--one of the great \ninstitutions of this country, one of the reasons we have remained a \ndemocracy, one of the things which guaranteed our diversity, which \nallows the most powerful nation that history has ever known to be a \ndemocracy and not a dictatorship--then we cannot feel that we have \nserved our Nation well. We cannot feel that we can be proud of our time \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  So I urge Senators to think about this story. I realize that we are \nin a different time--and I am reminded that I have spoken before on the \nfloor of the Senate about the experience my father had in Vermont in \n1937, 3 years before I was born. Vermont was one of the most Republican \nStates back in 1936 in the Roosevelt great landslide. Alf Landon--the \ndistinguished father of our distinguished former colleague, Senator \nKassebaum--Alf Landon carried two States: Maine and Vermont.\n  And the head of our largest insurance company, the National Life \nInsurance Co., basically the titular head of the Republican Party, was \nstanding next to my father on State Street in Montpelier, VT, as \nPresident Roosevelt was making a visit to Vermont and went by in an \nopen car. The president of the National Life Insurance Co. stood at \nattention and took off his hat--all men wore hats at that time--and he \nheld it over his heart as President Roosevelt's car went by. My dad \nsaid, ``I can't believe you took off your hat for Franklin Roosevelt.'' \nHe looked with arched concern at my father and said, ``Howard, I took \noff my hat for the President of the United States, not for Franklin \nRoosevelt.''\n  I have disagreed with Presidents of both parties since I have been \nhere. I have agreed with President Ford, President Carter, President \nReagan, President Bush, and President Clinton. I have voted with each \nof these President's on occasions. I have voted against them on \noccasions. I felt it a privilege to meet with them and argue with them. \nI stated my position as clearly as I could, but always respectfully \nbecause of the office that they held--the same way those of us who have \nbeen lawyers, who have practiced, know the respect that we hold for the \ncourts that we enter. We all rise. We say ``Your Honor,'' and so forth. \nWe have done this not because we felt that every judge that ever \nappeared before us was the most brilliant person we have ever known, \nbut we have done it because we know this is an institution that must be \nprotected for the sake of our country. Our State courts must be \nprotected for the sake of our States because without an independent \njudiciary, then our system of government all breaks down.\n  We looked, following the tragedy of Oklahoma City, at the trial that \nhas just been completed, looked at a judge who commanded the respect of \nthat courtroom. Both sides--the prosecution and the defense--knew the \njudge who ran that case. I contrast that to a case of a year ago where \na judge allowed the case to just fall apart, and how much that damaged \nour judicial system. Then we go back to the Federal court and see a \njudge who knows that both sides will have their opportunity and their \nrights protected, and they will try this case. The lawyers on both \nsides knew and respected the Federal court. They knew that this was a \ncase that would be handled under our judicial system, even one \ninvolving one of the most horrible acts, certainly the most horrible \ndomestic act of my lifetime, and one of the most horrible domestic acts \nof this Nation's history. But because we can count on the Federal \ncourt, the whole Nation could watch, the whole Nation feeling the \nanguish that we all felt that terrible day in Oklahoma City. We could \nwatch that court and know that our system works, that we could trust \nthat system, because all of us--the distinguished Presiding Officer, \nmyself, and every one of us who--have always protected the integrity of \nour courts.\n  Let us not do anything as Senators, for whatever short-term political \ngain, to tear apart the integrity of our courts. Let us work together \nand call on the distinguished majority leader, and those who make the \ndecision of when these judges can come up, to work with all of us, not \nas Democrats nor as Republicans but as U.S. Senators, doing what is \nbest for this Nation, what is best for our judiciary, what is best for \nour democracy, and what is best for the independence of our judiciary \nthat has made us the great Nation that we are.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5653-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 903, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 903) to consolidate the foreign affairs agencies \n     of the United States, to authorize appropriations for the \n     Department of State for the fiscal years 1998 and 1999, and \n     to provide for reform of the United Nations, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the day and the time have arrived. The pending \nbusiness, as the distinguished clerk has just indicated, is the Foreign \nAffairs Reform\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\nand Restructuring Act of 1997, legislation which was reported from the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee this past Thursday, June 12, by a \nvote of 14 to 4.\n  This legislation provides sweeping and long overdue reforms in \nAmerica's foreign affairs agencies. It also mandates tough reforms at \nthe United Nations.\n  As I have tried to emphasize from the beginning, it has been my hope \nthat the effort to produce this legislation would be a bipartisan one, \ndedicated to reorganization and revitalization of our foreign policy \ninstitutions. That is what this legislation is, and that is what has \nbrought this bill to its present pendency in the Senate. It has been \nbipartisanship in the Senate, the same kind of honest give and take \nthat led to some of the truly great decisions by this Senate in years \npast and in past decades.\n  There is no point now in rehashing past difficulties or actions \neither by the Senate or by the President of the United States. The \nimportant point is that this time around there has been a remarkable \ndegree of working together, of give and take, and a determination by \nalmost everybody involved that this time a piece of legislation will be \nenacted by the Congress and signed into law by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention the distinguished Secretary of \nState, Madeleine Albright, who has made very clear and voluntary public \nassurances about this legislation. And that lady, Mr. President, has as \nalways stood by her word.\n  While all of that is obviously personally meaningful to me, it is no \nmore so than the splendid cooperation and genuine interest of the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware, the ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Biden, who not only has made clear his \nbipartisan support, he has worked tirelessly to make sure that he would \nbe on this Senate floor this afternoon to demonstrate his genuine \nsupport for a bill which hereinafter should be and will be known as the \nHelms-Biden Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997. I \nsuspect that Senator Biden is aware of how grateful I am to him. He is \nan able colleague for whom I have enormous respect.\n  That said, Mr. President, both President Clinton and Secretary of \nState Albright came forward with recommendations addressing many, \nthough not all, of my key concerns, and in the ensuing months Senator \nBiden and I, along with our respective and competent staffs, devoted \ncountless hours putting together this final package which so \noverwhelmingly was approved by the Foreign Relations Committee this \npast Thursday.\n  None of us got everything we wanted, but we worked together, and the \nlegislation before us today is a bipartisan bill that will abolish two \nof those temporary Federal agencies that were created a half-century \nago--the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the U.S. Information \nAgency. Moreover, this bill will move some of the functions of a third \nsuch ``temporary'' Federal agency known as the Agency for International \nDevelopment. These functions will move to a position within the State \nDepartment under the direct control and supervision of the Secretary of \nState.\n  I must be candid. If I had my way, and many other Senators feel \nprecisely the same way, the so-called Agency for International \nDevelopment would be abolished entirely. But that is going to take a \nlittle time. So, instead, this bill is the first of many steps in a \nperhaps lengthy process of reinventing the foreign affairs apparatus of \nthe U.S. Government. But, have no doubt about it, further reforms will \nhappen a little further down the legislative line in the years ahead.\n  The ball has begun to roll. But, for now, the pending legislation \nwipes away the Agency for International Development's often arrogant \nindependence from the Department of State by transferring many of the \nfunctions of that independent 50-odd-year-old temporary agency to the \nState Department, and to assure that the allocation of foreign aid will \nsoon be controlled by the Secretary of State, who will at long last \nhave policy control over our foreign aid program.\n  I have thought many times, during the lengthy hours that we have \nworked on this particular piece of legislation, of what Ronald Reagan \nonce said about temporary Federal agencies. He said, ``There is nothing \nso near eternal life as a temporary Federal agency.'' I think the three \nagencies that we are working on today are an illustration of that.\n  In any event, the pending bill will also contain U.N. reform \nbenchmarks that we have been negotiating with the administration for \nthe past 4 months. I think it is fair to say that this bill represents \nthe most comprehensive and most far-reaching U.N. reform package ever \nconsidered by this Congress. Indeed, the Washington Post, which is no \nfan of anybody who wants to reform the United Nations--the Washington \nPost referred to the plan before the Senate today, and I quote the \nWashington Post, ``* * * as one which would mark the most fundamental \nshift in relations between the United States and the United Nations \nsince the United Nations was established after World War II.''\n  Let's look at a few details a little more closely. Among other \nreforms, the pending bill will require the United Nations to reduce the \namount of money the American taxpayers are now required to contribute \nto the United Nations, reduce it from the present 25 percent of the \ntotal operations cost to 20 percent of the total U.N. operating costs. \nIf you do not think that is much, I will discuss that with you in just \na minute. This reduction is going to be in effect, by the way, no later \nthan fiscal year 2000. That one, single reform, two or three lines in \nthis bill, had it been enacted 5 years ago, would have saved the \nAmerican taxpayers more than $500 million. The bill looks a little bit \nbetter as you talk about it and examine it.\n  What else is in this bill? This bill requires the United Nations to \nadopt a real negative growth budget, one that will eliminate at least \n1,000 bureaucratic U.N. posts, so that the American taxpayers in the \nfuture will pay a smaller percentage of a smaller budget.\n  It will forbid future U.N. global conferences, for example the \nBeijing women's summit that caused such a stir in this country and \nelsewhere, and the Rio Earth summit, meaning that the American \ntaxpayers will never, never again be forced to pay the exorbitant costs \nof such boondoggles as those two that I mentioned.\n  The pending bill will require the United Nations to reimburse the \nAmerican taxpayers for U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping \noperations. And that means that the U.S. defense budget will no longer \nbe raided to support U.N. experimentation with peacekeeping operations.\n  Most important, this bill provides a very significant aspect. It \nforbids requiring the American taxpayers to furnish the money to pay \nany so-called U.N. arrearages unless and until the requirements in this \nbill have been met by the United Nations.\n  A lot of crabbing is going on about it, and a lot of speculation \nabout whether they will like it or not up there. They don't like it. \nYou know who doesn't care one whit whether they like it or not? You are \nlooking at him, Mr. President. My message to the United Nations is \nsimple but clear: No reform, no American taxpayers' money for \narrearages.\n  Last, and certainly not least, this legislation imposes very strict \nand very specific disciplines on spending and authorizing funding for \nthe Department of State and other related agencies.\n  Let me repeat for the purpose of emphasis. This legislation is \nbipartisan. It does not contain everything that I wanted. Senator Biden \nis a tough and fair negotiator. Nor does it reflect everything that the \nother side--Joe Biden and the Democrats--not everything that they \nwanted is in here. But, in the end, at the end of the day, as is so \noften said these days, I believe it is evident that the Foreign \nRelations Committee is proposing important reforms that will be highly \nbeneficial to this country and to the American taxpayers.\n  So I say again, it is truly a team effort by both sides, and I hasten \nto mention that it would not have been possible without the \nextraordinary efforts of the chairman of the International Operations \nSubcommittee, Senator Rod Grams, who devoted so many\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\nhours presiding over oversight hearings on important aspects of this \nbill. Senator Grams worked with us every step of the way in crafting \nthe legislation which I have just described in some detail. Moreover, \nSenator Grams' special expertise, gained by his having served as the \nU.S. Congressional Delegate to the United Nations, has been enormously \nhelpful in the crafting of this comprehensive U.N. reform proposal. And \nthen the committee has also worked closely with Senator Judd Gregg, the \ndistinguished chairman of the appropriations subcommittee which has the \nresponsibility, don't you know, for the Departments of Commerce, State, \nand Justice. Senator Gregg's support for this bill, this pending bill, \nsent a message to the administration early on that the appropriators as \nwell as the authorizers of the U.S. Senate would be standing together, \nunited in support of this pending bill.\n\n  Needless to say, I sincerely hope that the spirit of bipartisanship \nwill continue and that the Senate will expeditiously complete action on \nit.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the staff of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, both majority and minority, be given \nthe privilege of the floor for the duration of the Senate's \nconsideration of S. 903, the pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Biden is on his way to the Senate \nfloor. While we await the arrival of the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, is there controlled time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). There is no controlled time. \nThe pending business is S. 903.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the legislation before us. \nToday, the Senate begins consideration of the Foreign Relations \nAuthorization Act, comprehensive legislation regarding the \ninstitutional structure of and the funding for America's foreign \npolicy. This bill contains much more than the usual 2-year \nauthorization and funding for our foreign affairs agency which we \nattempt to bring to the floor out of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nIt addresses two important issues which were the focus of much-heated \ndebate in the last Congress.\n  Specifically, this bill provides for the payment of U.S. back dues to \nthe United Nations--I need not say a very controversial and hotly \ndebated subject in this body--contingent, I might add, on specific \nreforms in that body.\n  I note parenthetically that I spoke on Friday with the Secretary \nGeneral, Kofi Annan, and he indicated to me that it was his hope and \nexpectation that the Senate as a whole, that I in particular and the \nchairman of the full committee, Senator Helms, would be pleased with a \nnumber of the reforms he has initiated consistent with what he \nindicated he would do. Hopefully, they will be acted upon by the \nGeneral Assembly this summer. But whether they are or not, the back \ndues are contingent upon specific reforms in that body.\n  Additionally, the bill establishes a framework for the reorganization \nof U.S. foreign policy agencies, which is, in my view, totally \nconsistent with the plan announced by the President of the United \nStates in April. The bill, Mr. President, that we have before us is not \nonly complex and wide ranging, in that it covers more than one specific \nsubject, but it is also the product of what I think most people would \nacknowledge is a serious bipartisan effort on the part of the chairman \nof the full committee, members of the subcommittee in the majority, \nmembers of the subcommittee in the minority, and me as the ranking \nmember of the committee representing the Democratic position. In \naddition to that, the administration has been part of this lengthy and \nvery detailed negotiation for the past several months.\n  Last Thursday, after a markup that lasted less than 3 hours in the \nForeign Relations Committee, the Committee on Foreign Relations voted \noverwhelmingly, 14 to 4, to report this bill, with a majority of the \nmembers on each side of the aisle voting in favor of it. I am grateful \nto the majority leader, Senator Lott, and to the chairman of the full \ncommittee, Senator Helms, for working together to bring this bill to \nthe floor so promptly. The bipartisan cooperation on this bill thus far \nis a testament to the commitment of both the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, the Republican leadership, along with the \nadministration, to attempt to construct what we all talk about a lot \nbut seldom occurs: a truly bipartisan consensus on American foreign \npolicy.\n  This bill is quite detailed, so with the indulgence of my colleagues, \nI will take, which is the norm around here and the requirement, a few \nmoments to explain, as the Democratic manager of the bill, what its \nmajor provisions are.\n  First, the bill contains the basic authorization legislation for the \nDepartment of State, or, put in everyday parlance, money, the money for \nrunning the Department of State and our suggestion, as all authorizers \ndo, to the appropriators as to how much money we should be spending.\n  First, it contains the basic authorization legislation for the \nDepartment of State, the U.S. Information Agency, the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency and the Peace Corps.\n  The funding levels in the bill closely reflect that of \nthe President's budget. The total amount authorized for fiscal 1998 is \n$6.1 billion, as compared to the President's request of $6.2 billion. \nIn fiscal year 1999, and this is a 2-year authorization, the amount \nprovided in this bill is $5.9 billion. This modest reduction represents \nthe reduction in the international organization account consistent with \nthe administration's commitments. During debate on this legislation, I \nwill explain that in more detail.\n\n  Within this framework, we have provided, first, full funding for the \nDepartment of State's core activities; that is, the diplomatic and \nconsular programs, salaries and expenses, and protection and \nmaintenance of our embassies--full funding. It provides 99 percent of \nthe funding for the U.S. Information Agency's diplomatic programs; full \nfunding for our exchange programs, the Fulbright program and others; \nand full funding for international broadcasting. It provides full \nfunding for the National Endowment for Democracy, a bipartisan \noperation that has had very great success; full funding for the Peace \nCorps and the Asia Foundation; and $819 million over 3 years to pay our \nU.N. arrears.\n  After several years of reductions in spending for diplomatic \nreadiness, I am heartened we are restoring funds to the international \naffairs account, particularly to the core activities of the State \nDepartment. Although the cold war has ended, Mr. President, the need \nfor American leadership in world affairs has not. Our diplomats often \nrepresent the frontline of our national defense, and with the \ndownsizing of the U.S. military presence overseas, the maintenance of a \nrobust and effective diplomatic capability has become all the more \nimportant, in my opinion, and in the opinion of a vast majority of \npeople who study the issue.\n  Despite the reduction in our military readiness abroad, the increased \nimportance of diplomatic readiness to our national security has not \nbeen reflected in recent Federal budgets. According to a study of the \nCongressional Research Service prepared earlier this year at my \nrequest, foreign policy spending is now at its lowest level in 20 \nyears. Stated in 1998 dollars, the budget in the current fiscal year is \n$18.77 billion, which is 25 percent below the annual average of $25 \nbillion over the past 2 decades, the past 20 years, and 30 percent \nbelow the level of 10 years ago, which was very near the end of the \nReagan administration.\n  Mr. President, I emphasize, again, that this is a lot of money, but \nout of a $1.7 or almost $1.8 trillion budget and in light of the fact \nwe are the world's only superpower it is a small percentage. To \ncontinue to reduce our commitment to foreign affairs at a time when\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\nwe are necessarily reducing our military activity abroad, our military \npresence abroad, seems to me to be counterproductive. It seems to me \nthat in the former Soviet Union, the former Soviet states, the newly \nindependent states, we should be having an increased diplomatic \npresence there. We should be opening consulates; we should have a \nrobust economic presence there; and yet, as a matter of fact, we have \nbeen cutting back. This bill reverses that trend.\n  Let me put it another way. This halts the trend of downward movement \nand recognizes our need to engage the world with diplomacy and our \nforeign policy, not with our military.\n  So I am pleased that we are reversing the hemorrhaging of funds away \nfrom foreign policy, according to this bill.\n  Second, the bill provides a framework for the reorganization of the \nforeign affairs agencies that is consistent with the President's \nannounced plan on April 18. The backdrop for this, I know the Presiding \nOfficer knows very well, is that the world has changed drastically. The \nworld has changed drastically, as we all discuss and talk about, but we \nhave not reorganized the foreign policy establishment in our country. \nWe have not reorganized our foreign policy apparatus.\n  Although it made a great deal of sense, in my view, in the past years \nto have, for example, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency separate \nand apart from the State Department and our Agency for International \nDevelopment separate and apart, and other departments separate and \napart, it seems to me, and it seems to most observers, including the \nadministration, that it no longer makes sense. Here the credit must go \nto the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He has been \nconsistently advocating a major overhaul of the State Department, as \nwell as these other agencies, in terms of consolidation.\n\n  I might add that there are provisions in this legislation that, \nobviously, I should have said at the outset that I don't like. There \nare provisions I would like to change. For example, I think we should \nbe funding more money for the United Nations, although I acknowledge \nthe amount we funded can get the job done. I think we should be making \nadditional changes and giving greater flexibility to AID than we do in \nthis legislation. The fact of the matter is, this is a product of a \ncompromise on three major, major, major initiatives. As a consequence \nof that, neither Senator Helms nor I got all that we bargained for in \nthis. That is the nature of compromise. So this has been a very \nimportant element of this whole package for the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  Like the President's plan, the bill that we bring to the floor today \nprovides for integration of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency \nwithin the State Department within 1 year and ensures that the arms \ncontrol function is maintained in a position of prominence within the \nDepartment of State.\n  When I went months ago to negotiate or lay out how I would like to \nproceed and was willing to proceed with the chairman of the full \ncommittee, I indicated to him that I would work in a bipartisan way to \ndeal with the reorganization, deal with the United Nations and deal \nwith the funding of the State Department, assuming that he was not \nusing this reorganization and other methods as merely a means for us to \nwithdraw from the world. He not only indicated that it was not his \nobjective, he has followed through and has shown it was not his \nobjective, evidence the fact that we essentially fully fund the State \nDepartment for the next 2 years and he has agreed to significant \nlatitude for the State Department in the bill and its reorganization \nefforts, compared to the bills he has introduced for the last 2 years.\n  So, like the President's plan, the bill we bring to the floor today \nprovides for the integration of not only ACDA, but also the U.S. \nInformation Agency [USIA], into the State Department. It provides for a \n2-year transition for that to occur and creates a position of Under \nSecretary of State for Public Diplomacy.\n  Again, I indicated that my concern was that as we bring these \nspecialized agencies of significant consequence into the State \nDepartment, where they have never been before, that they be brought in \nat a level commensurate with their significance, that they not be \nsubsumed in the State Department and essentially lose their visibility \nand significance.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, arms control will be the single most \nimportant element of American foreign policy over the next two decades. \nFor it to be taken out of its independent status and subsumed into the \nState Department would be a mistake. What we do is we establish in this \nbill a position of prominence for the person who heads ACDA, as well as \nfor USIA, and we create the position of Under Secretary of State for \nPublic Diplomacy. There is only one difference in that it integrates \nthe Office of Public Liaison and Legislative Affairs into the State \nDepartment within 1 year.\n  The reason for that is, we think, quite simple. It is nothing \ncomplex. We think it can be done quickly and that it saves bureaucracy \nand it saves money.\n  Additionally, this bill puts some flesh on the bones of the \nPresident's plan with regard to international broadcasting. The \nPresident's plan was virtually silent on this question, stating only \nthat ``the distinctiveness and editorial integrity of the Voice of \nAmerica and the broadcasting agencies would be preserved.''\n  That is just what we have done here.\n  This bill just holds and protects that principle by maintaining the \nexisting Government structure established by Congress in 1994 \nconsolidating all U.S. Government-sponsored broadcasting. I might add, \nthis was a money-saving effort led by the Senator from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold. He has succeeded, at least in large part, in one of \nhis objectives, which was to save the American taxpayers a great deal \nof money. We have eliminated a bloated bureaucracy. We have \nconsolidated services, we have consolidated technical capability, and \nwe have preserved the integrity of the radios.\n  By radios I mean Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty--the things that \nLech Walesa said helped bring down the Berlin Wall more than anything \nelse. We established Radio Free Asia and Radio Marti and TV Marti \nrelating to Cuba. All of these maintain their journalistic integrity \nbecause of their editorial integrity.\n  So we have done, I believe, what the administration indicated it \nwished to do; that is, maintain the distinctiveness and editorial \nintegrity of these radios as well as the Voice of America. This bill \nupholds and protects that principle.\n  As I said, what we have done is consolidated from 1994 all the U.S. \nGovernment-sponsored broadcasting, that is Voice of America, Radio and \nTV Marti, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and \nWorldnet TV, under the supervision of one oversight board known as the \nBroadcasting Board of Governors. That has been done.\n  Importantly, however, the board and the broadcasters below them will \nnot be merged into the Department of State where their journalistic \nintegrity would be questioned and greatly at risk. The radios will, \nhowever, continue to play an important role in advancing U.S. foreign \npolicy objectives.\n  The board will have what I call a dotted line relationship with the \nState Department in that the new Undersecretary of State for Public \nDiplomacy, the same function now performed by the Director of USIA, \nwill have a seat on the board. Additionally, the Secretary of State \nwill provide foreign policy guidance to the board and will be consulted \nabout additions or deletions of language services currently performed \nby the radios.\n  Like the President's plan, the bill maintains the Agency for \nInternational Development, that is AID, as a separate agency, but \nprovides for its partial integration into the State Department.\n  This has been the most controversial part of all of this, I might \nsay, Mr. President. There is a constituency that has a very solid case \nto be made--I think a very strong case to be made--suggesting that the \nexpertise buildup by AID, headed now by Brian Atwood, and by many other \ndistinguished persons before him, is unique in that it is the outfit \nthat literally goes out and provides for digging the wells, bringing \nthe water, and bringing the new projects to those areas that need the \nhelp.\n  It was very important that we not take that expertise and merge it \ninto\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\nthe State Department, get it lost with every other GS-15 or 17 or 12 \nand lose the distinctive nature of those experiences. There is a \ndifference between those who do foreign policy and those who dig wells. \nIt is this distinctive nature--the ability to produce and deliver \nservices--that says we, the United States of America, through our aid \nprogram, are going to assist populations in need.\n  But it has been, I think, a legitimate concern, in light of the new \nworld we now face, that there be more policy sway on the part of the \nperson dealing with the foreign policy of America--the Secretary of \nState. We have tried to accommodate that, Mr. President. Just as the \nPresident announced, the AID administrator will be placed under the \ndirect authority of the Secretary of State and, consistent with the \nplan's objectives of improving coordination between the regional \nbureaus at State and AID, the Secretary of State will have authority to \ncoordinate this aid policy.\n  This is causing a bit of a flap, though. This has been the single \nbiggest thing that, to the average American and I suspect the average \nSenator, sounds merely like a giant bureaucratic snafu in that \nsomebody's turf is being stepped on and somebody else's turf is not \nbeing accommodated, et cetera. It is more than that. It is more serious \nthan that. But I suspect we have not heard the end of what we attempted \nto do in this legislation.\n\n  The concept of aid coordinators, that is, having aid coordinated by \nthe State Department, is not new in this legislation. Since the early \n1990's, the State Department has had such coordinators that have \nsupervised the aid programs in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  Under the leadership of President Bush and, prior to that, under the \nleadership of the Democratically controlled Foreign Relations \nCommittee, we first had a thing called the SEED program and then the \nPresident expanded that, President Bush expanded it into the Freedom \nSupport Act. That aid program involved deciding how much aid would go \nto the Ukraine, how much aid would go to Russia, et cetera. And we set \nup a special coordinator within the State Department to do that.\n  So this is not a new notion we are applying here. This legislation, \nquite frankly, is modeled on that concept. Indeed, the language we use \nhere is borrowed directly from the Freedom Support Act. But nonetheless \nwe are going to hear more about this because some of my colleagues, on \nboth sides of the aisle, have very, very strong views about this. I \nsuspect we will be debating this aspect of the reorganization more than \nany other.\n  Two other issues bear emphasis and belie any charge that we are \nmicromanaging the reorganization of the State Department.\n  First, unlike the bill reported by this committee in the last \nCongress, this reorganization bill does not--and I thank the chairman \nfor doing this because it is one of the major disagreements he and I \nhad--this bill does not, as the last bill introduced in the Congress \ndid, mandate specific reductions in budget or personnel. Instead, it \nrequires only a periodic report on savings that are achieved.\n  Second, the committee has provided no directives--none--on the \npromised reinvention of the State Department itself.\n  Let me be clear about this. The President's plan stated that a \ncentral element in the plan would be an ``intensified, comprehensive \ninternal reform program at State.'' In other words, the reorganization \nof State by itself.\n  Again, for my colleagues listening to this, there are basically three \npieces to this reorganization. One is you have the State Department \nsitting here and then you have these very important agencies, USIA, \nAID--I think those are the acronyms --U.S. Information Agency, the \nAdministration for International Development and the Arms Control \nDisarmament Agency.\n  For historical reasons, they had all been, if you will, satellite \nagencies outside the direct, immediate control of the State Department, \nalthough all related to the State Department. That is one big piece. \nWhat do you do about that matrix?\n  There is a second big piece here. The second big piece is, within the \nState Department, how many Undersecretaries of State do you have? How \nmany Assistant Secretaries of State? What do you do in terms of how \nthey relate to one another? How many personnel should be in the field \nand not in the field? How many consulates should you have and not have? \nThese are all very important decisions.\n  That is part of this $6.1 billion we are giving them to run this year \nand $5.9 billion in the second year of this 2-year authorization. We do \nnot fool with that. We do not micromanage that. We respond to the \nconcerns of the last administration and this administration. We say, \n``Look, you present us with a plan. You come up and you go ahead and \nreorganize that. We're giving you authority to go out and do it. You do \nit.''\n  We are not micromanaging, but we are going to deal with this big, \ncontroversial subject that has been sort of rattling around for the \nlast decade. We are going to take AID, ACDA, and USIA, and we are going \nto merge them in varying degrees into the State Department.\n  There are those who are going to come out on the floor and say that \nSenator Helms and I are into micromanaging the State Department's day-\nto-day activities. That is simply not true. That is not what we are \ndoing. But we are tackling the one issue no administration has really \nbeen able to successfully deal with. And that is, what do you do about \nthese three very important agencies that have very important \nconstituencies and very important functions? We are taking them--they \nhave been out there by themselves now for a number of years, with good \nreason--and we are merging them, in light of this changed world, into \nthe State Department. We are doing that. We are doing that, in my \nopinion, for several reasons.\n  I will tell you my motivation for doing it. First, internally \nhandled, I am not sure how it would ever get settled in the \nadministration. The constituencies are significant. The bureaucracies \nare real. They are important. Second, I worried that if we were \nessentially just going to use this as an excuse to eliminate their \nfunctions, we would be doing a great disservice to the Nation. Senator \nHelms agreed. Senator Helms said, let us bring them into, in \ncommensurate positions of responsibility and authority, the State \nDepartment. So we are doing that. But even within that, we leave a \ngreat deal of flexibility for the Secretary of State and the President \nof the United States.\n  Mr. President, I believe I speak for the chairman when I express my \nhope that the type of reform effort that the President has indicated he \nwishes to undertake--that is the actual reorganization of the State \nDepartment itself, which we do not do--my sincere hope that he will in \nfact vigorously pursue the long overdue internal management reform \nneeded because the State Department's problems could be compounded by \nthe absorption of two new agencies unless reforms are made.\n  So the irony here is, Mr. President, we are subsuming these \norganizations into the State Department, and now it is real important \nthat the internal management and reforms within the State Department \ntake place because, if there is difficulty in terms of organizational \nstructures at State now, they are going to be compounded by bringing in \nthese additional agencies.\n  We leave all of the aid personnel outside here. We take policy and we \nput it in, but the personnel, the people who actually go out and make \nsure the water goes to the village, their unique capability stays out \nhere as an independent agency.\n  So the point is that we are giving the State Department and the \nPresident ample opportunity to do what they say they needed. And I \nbelieve the administration--the administration; Freudian slip--my \nadministration, in effect, on the floor that I have to deal with is the \nmajority party. The majority party, led by Senator Helms, has given a \ngreat deal more flexibility than they intended to give for the \nadministration to be able to do that. Obviously, the administration \nwould prefer, as a matter of principle, passage of legislation that \ndelegates broad authority to the President to reorganize the whole \nshooting match.\n  Well, in a perfect world I would prefer that as well. The truth of \nthe matter is, it is not a perfect world. My\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\nteam does not control this place. The other team controls this place. \nThey have very different views. And I think we have worked out, in \nlight of that, a very, very important compromise that is consistent \nwith the overall objective the President has stated.\n  But under the administration's approach, which is basically just \ndelegate, the only moment for congressional action would be a \nresolution of disapproval of a plan. What the administration wanted, \nand if I could have waved a wand--put it another way; if I had 51 \nvotes--I might attempt to accommodate their wish.\n  But what the administration wanted was that they send a plan to us \nwhen they have the opportunity to go through it and vet it. They will \nsay, ``This is our reorganization plan, including the whole shooting \nworks. Now, you, the Congress, either approve or disapprove it.'' You \ncan only--excuse me, you have to disapprove it. If you do not \ndisapprove it, then it becomes law; it is changed. If you disapprove \nit, it has the benefit, if you are a President, of allowing you to get \nyour plan passed with only one-third of the Congress plus one voting \nfor it, because we can come along and get 51 votes and say, ``No; we \ndon't like the plan you submitted,'' and disapprove it. The President \nthen vetoes our disapproval of his plan. Now we have to override his \nveto. So we come back up here and we have to find a supermajority if we \ndo not like the plan.\n\n  So it is not something Congress would usually buy on to, any more \nthan administrations like to buy on to giving up any prerogative, and \none of their prerogatives is to reorganize the executive branch. They \ndo not like the fact that we are doing part of that for them, which is \nunderstandable. If I were President, I would feel the same way, or if I \nwere the Secretary of State, I would feel the same way. Conversely, \nCongresses are not real crazy about offers made to them that allow \nPresidents essentially to control the agenda, control the outcome by \nonly getting one-third of the Congress plus one person to vote with \nthem.\n  So here we are. I now am joining the chairman of the full committee \nin preferring that Congress should place its positive stamp on the \nPresident's plan rather than having the chance only to give a stamp of \ndisapproval and to be overridden by one-third plus one.\n  In general terms, the committee's approach does not provide any less \nflexibility to reorganize. To be sure, the committee locks in the date \nfor ultimate integration of the two agencies in question. And we are \nonly fully integrating two agencies, USIA and ACDA. And it speeds up \nthe partial integration of AID into State.\n  Within those broad outlines the administration has considerable \nflexibility to implement the thousands of decisions required under \nreorganization. Ultimately, Mr. President, the administration will have \nto return to the Congress for certain authorities to carry out the \ncomplicated integration of two large agencies into the State \nDepartment. However, I would be surprised if the administration \ncontends that this requirement to return to Congress is unduly \nburdensome.\n  I hope the administration will work with the committee on this \nprocedure. If the administration is committed to the reorganization \noutlined by the President's April 18 statement, as I believe it is, \nthen it should have no trouble implementing the legislative framework \nlaid down in this bill.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the bill provides for the payment of U.S. \narrearages to the United Nations. Now, in my almost 25 years of being a \nU.S. Senator, there is little that generates as much enthusiasm for \ndebate than when we talk about paying arrearages to the United Nations. \nMaybe when we talk about the question of abortion more vigor is \ndisplayed on this floor, but only abortion and a few other issues raise \nthe combative instincts of my colleagues more than paying back U.S. \narrearages.\n  Now, the proposal contained in our bill, this bipartisan proposal, \nled by my friend from North Carolina, I believe will serve three \nimportant purposes. One, it should finally end the long festering feud \nbetween the United Nations and Washington about our unpaid dues. \nSecond, it should bring much needed reform to the world's body so that \nit can more efficiently perform its missions, missions which we \nacknowledge in this legislation that we support. Third, it should, I \nhope, restore some of the bipartisan support in Congress for the U.N.'s \nsystem, support that has existed for most of the U.N.'s 50-year \nhistory.\n  The agreement before the Senate will allow us to pay $819 million in \narrears to the United Nations over a 3-year period contingent upon the \nUnited Nations achieving specific benchmarks, to borrow Chairman Helms' \nexpression.\n  Now, the payments are broken down as follows: In year 1, we will pay \n$100 million. I might add, even if we wanted to pay more, the budget \nagreement we passed does not accommodate us paying any more than that, \nso even if we wanted to pay all the rest, the Congress and the \nPresident have limited us to what we can pay under that budget \nagreement. Now, in year 2--and this was a significant compromise, and \nhe is on the floor, and I want to publicly thank him for accommodating \nmy request on this--in year 2, we pay $475 million, assuming the \nbenchmarks are met. In year 3, we will repay the remaining $244 \nmillion.\n  The significant feature of this payment scheme is that it will allow \nthe administration to pay off virtually all our arrears in the first 2 \nyears for the two most important accounts, which are the regular and \npeacekeeping budgets. With these two accounts current, our diplomats \nwill have the leverage they need to push through the tough reforms that \nare needed.\n  Let me mention a few of the particularly noteworthy benchmarks, again \nusing the chairman's term. The plan calls for a two-stage reduction in \nour regular U.N. assessment rate from 25 percent to 20 percent. Now, I \nhave been criticized a great deal for going along with this, as my \nfriend from North Carolina, I suspect, has been criticized for going \nalong with paying the arrears. I am told, ``Joe, as a supporter of the \nUnited Nations how can you possibly insist that the U.S. portion of the \nUnited Nation's regular dues be reduced from 25 percent to 20 \npercent?'' And I say I would rather just pay our arrears and then \nnegotiate that. But on the issue of what should we pay, Mr. President, \nI would respectfully suggest that if the meeting in San Francisco \norganizing the U.N. were today rather than 50 years ago, we would not \nbe sitting down with economic giants like Japan and the European \ncountries and others and saying, ``By the way, we should pay 25 \npercent.''\n  I argue it made sense after World War II when we were the only \neconomic power left standing in the world. We are not the only economic \npower left standing in the world. I want to pay our fair share. I do \nwant to carry our burden. But I am hard pressed to see why I am doing \nsuch a terrible thing, siding with the chairman, saying our numbers \nshould get down to 20 percent from 25 percent.\n\n  As I said, I challenge anyone to tell me why you think there would be \na consensus in the world that we should pay 25 percent if we were \nstarting from day one. Now, agreed, admittedly, the chairman and I do \nnot agree on how we should go about this. I would like to pay the \narrears, not make it conditional and negotiate our dues because this is \na little bit heavy handed, but I am a realist. Politics in the best \nsense of the word is the art of the practical. We have to get 51 votes \nto get this thing moving. The chairman and I have to make compromises. \nHe has come a long way. I am willing to go a long way because I think \nthis meets the most important requirement.\n  I hear people telling me now, and I see my friends on the floor, \nsaying, ``Joe, this is great. You worked out this compromise with \nSenator Helms, but if you got him to compromise this much, if you were \njust a little tougher you would have gotten a billion 300 million for \nU.N. arrears.'' First, they do not know my friend like I do. We have \nworked together for almost 25 years. We came here at the same time. \nSecond, it is amazing how people in hindsight say, ``Hey, this is \ngreat, this is great. We are moving along in the right direction.'' \nThis is the end of the road, this direction.\n  As I told the chairman, he came up to that $819 million, and the \nadministration says they can get the job done with that--it is a \nbottom-line number with me. If we go to conference and the House cuts \nthat number, I am not voting for this. And the chairman did not\n\n[[Page S5661]]\n\nlike going up that high but he is sure going no higher, unless I \nmisread him. So people say, ``Well, Joe, you are forcing the United \nNations to make these decisions. It is not fair.'' Well, I remind them, \ncan the United Nations take another year, can we handle another year of \nnonpayment without doing permanent damage or additional damage to our \nstatus within that agency, which I think is an important agency? \nEverybody tells me it is important this get done. I asked those folks \nwho now are saying this is not enough, I asked them, you figure out how \nto get 51 votes for something more than that, and if you do not get 51 \nvotes and this carries over for another year, what damage have we done? \nIf damage would be done by not paying the disputed amount between $819 \nmillion and what others say we owe, if damage would be done by that, \nhow much damage would be done if this thing goes over another year? I \nrespectfully suggest, a lot more damage by not acting. And, by the way, \nI have had this conversation with the President of the General Assembly \nand with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. They both want \naction now because they say what our fellow nations in the United \nNations are wondering, are we ever going to pay? Do we think we have an \nobligation? This, at a minimum, establishes that. It is very important, \nvery important.\n  We may have a slight disagreement, my friend from North Carolina and \nme, but I see the United Nations as a valuable tool. I do not want to \nbe sending U.S. troops everywhere in the world where there is a need \nfor international action, where there is a need for the world to \nrespond so it does not blow out of control. I do not want to do that. \nThe United Nations can be and is a very valuable adjunct and tool. I do \nnot want to see it come apart. To me, this is the single best way to \nmeet our foreign policy needs now. It is important we act now.\n  Let me mention a few of the particular noteworthy benchmarks beyond \nmoving from 25 to 20 percent. The plan also requires that the United \nNations make a commitment that the United States be reimbursed for \nsupport we provided for the peacekeeping operations, something that is \nvery important to the chairman. Some of my colleagues, all of whom I \nrespect, will come to the floor and say, ``Well, you know, Joe, look at \nwhat our share of the world's resources are and look at what our share \nof the world's economy is and look at what our share of our involvement \nin the United Nations is, and it really should be 25 percent.'' I say, \ndoes the rest of the world take into consideration the billions of \ndollars American taxpayers are paying to keep peace in the world? How \nabout Korea? How about Japan? How much do they pay? How about the \nbillions of dollars we have committed in Bosnia? How about the billions \nof dollars we have committed around the world? Now, I am not asking the \nUnited Nations to credit us for that. I do not know how they would \ncalculate that. I am asking them to recognize it.\n\n  I am asking, by us coming up with these arrearages, to stop the \nbashing, to stop the U.S. bashing, as well as, hopefully, to stop the \nU.N. bashing. This is a time for us to take advantage of the \ninstitutions in the best sense of the word that exist to maintain world \npeace without our having to be the world cop.\n  In addition, the plan calls for a number of budgetary and oversight \nreforms that promise to improve the efficiency both at the U.N. \nSecretariat and in its largest specialized agencies.\n  I say again to my friend who is on the floor, he may have been off \nthe floor earlier, I spoke with Kofi Annan on Friday. I suspect the \nSenator may have, as well. He indicated he appreciated our efforts. \nObviously, he would like more. He said something interesting. He said \nthat he was hopeful that you, Mr. Chairman, and I would be pleased with \nthe reforms he has already suggested and that he hopes the United \nNations will act upon this year prior to--prior to--commitments \nmandated by us in these benchmarks. He did not get specific about each, \nbut I am sure, knowing him as I do, he is committed to reasonable \nreform just like every other major business in the world is reforming \nand every major governmental institution is reforming and streamlining. \nI believe that it is the intention of the Secretary-General to do the \nsame thing. The end result will be to increase the efficacy of the \nUnited Nations and the fairness of those nations that contribute to its \nfunction.\n  There are many of my colleagues that will look at the list that I \nmentioned here today and wonder why such detailed restrictions are \nattached to the payment of this money. In an ideal world, as I \nindicated in committee, I indicated to the chairman, and I indicate \nnow, I would prefer far fewer restrictions. I support the United \nNations with all its flaws because I believe, more often than not, it \nadvances our national interests by providing a forum for combating \nproblems that no single nation can address on its own, or at least no \nsingle nation can efficiently address on its own. We should not have to \nbe the nation to address problems solely on our own. Placing conditions \non U.S. payment is not unprecedented. Congressional pressure has often \nbeen an important catalyst for change in New York.\n  For example, were it not for the efforts of our former colleague, \nNancy Kassebaum--and everybody thinks of Nancy Kassebaum as a supporter \nof the United Nations and looks to Senator Helms as the person who \nstopped all these payments to the United Nations, Senator Nancy \nKassebaum, now Nancy Kassebaum Baker, when she was a leader on this \nfloor--her efforts required that the U.N. system would have to adopt a \nconsensus-based budgeting process. Were it not for her efforts, that \nwould not have occurred. Were it not for the initiative of Congress in \n1994, then under Democratic control, in fairness to the chairman, there \nwould be no inspector general at the United Nations. That was a \ncondition we placed. That was a Democratically-controlled Senate, that \nwas a Democratically-controlled committee.\n  So this notion of benchmarks is not an unprecedented notion. What is \nunprecedented is the Senator from North Carolina saying, ``I will sign \non to pay our arrearages.'' That is the unprecedented part, from my \nstandpoint, and the benchmarks that he has insisted upon, I cannot look \nhim in the eye and say that they are not reasonable. I would prefer not \nto have them, but they are not unreasonable. I would prefer to do it \nanother way, but they are not unreasonable, and consequently I am \nsupporting him because this is all part of an overall agreement to deal \nwith the entire foreign policy of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, the achievements I mentioned earlier, the inspector \ngeneral and others, were reasonable conditions. So, too, are those \ncontained in the Senate bill now before the Senate.\n  The original plan offered by the majority, in my view, did not meet \nthe same standard, but as a result of good faith negotiations with the \nmajority, we now have a set of conditions, which the administration, \nincluding our Ambassador to the United Nations, our former colleague \nand now Ambassador Bill Richardson, believes are achievable.\n  Mr. President, I am often asked what it takes to be a U.S. Senator, \nand I say it takes two very important things: One, you have to be an \noptimist. If you are not, you are in the wrong business. It is not the \nplace to be. The second thing it requires, I think, is that you be a \npragmatist, because we have to achieve a consensus in this body. We \nrepresent over 250 million people with very different views. We \nrepresent very different constituencies and very different ideologies. \nPragmatically, we have to get to the point where we get 51 votes.\n  I recognize that no plan to pay our U.N. arrearages can get through a \nRepublican-controlled Congress without some of the conditions that are \non here. Again, I think the ones that remain are not unreasonable. I \nbelieve it is important to get this issue behind us and move toward a \nbipartisan foreign policy. This legislation should contribute \nconsiderably to straightening out our relations with the United \nNations.\n  For those colleagues on my side of the aisle who remain unconvinced, \nlet me state clearly that the administration was involved every step of \nthe way in the U.N. negotiations, and it has signed off on every \nelement of this U.N. package and supports the proposal as the best deal \nthat can be achieved, because they believe, as I do, that we must put \nthis behind us. So I don't\n\n[[Page S5662]]\n\nwant to hear that the chairman did this by fiat, or the chairman--which \nhe is capable of doing--got the ranking member in and convinced him, or \nhas mesmerized him into changing his view. That is not true--possible, \nbut not true. That is not what happened. The administration was either \nin the room or informed of everything we have done on this point. They, \nlike me, believe that this is the best we can get and that it can get \nthe job done.\n  Now, I say to some of my colleagues, very bluntly--I will state it on \nthe record--they say that they think the administration is wrong as \nwell. Well, look, I have to sign on with some team here, you know. They \nare the ones running the show. They are the ones with the expertise. \nThey know a lot more about what is needed to satisfy the 150 some \nnations of the United Nations. I take their word for it and I believe \nthey are correct--substantively correct--that it can be done. The \nadministration doesn't love this; I don't love it; the chairman doesn't \nlove it. But that's what this legislation is about. That is why we have \na Congress. That is how it is supposed to work to arrive at a \nconsensus.\n  Let me conclude by saying, Mr. President, that I have been here a \nlong time. I have worked on a lot of big bills. I have been, like the \nchairman of the committee, in the majority and the minority. I like one \nbetter than the other. I have been both places, and I have been in both \nplaces twice. As I said, I have had the responsibility on my side of \nthe aisle of shepherding through some very comprehensive legislation, \nnot the least of which was the crime bill. But I think if the chairman \nof the committee and I stood here in January, the first week we were in \nsession, and said that Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Joe Biden of \nDelaware are going to sit down in a room over the next 5 or 6 months \nand work out an entire package on how to deal with all this--when is \nthe last time we passed an authorization? It was in 1994. That was the \nlast time we passed any legislation to pay arrearages. It was the last \ntime we got any consensus on how to reorganize. Well, we have done \nthat. We both may be wrong, but we have done it.\n  We have brought to the floor a comprehensive package. So that I don't \nconfuse anybody, the most important thing to me is, first of all, to \nmaintain my principle, and, second, to maintain the commitments I make. \nThere are going to be amendments on this floor that I would like to \nvote for. For example, my friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar, one of \nthe most informed men in the United States of America on foreign \npolicy, believes, as I do, that we should dedicate more than $819 \nmillion toward paying our arrearages. As a matter of fact, I am the guy \nwho called him when I thought my friend from North Carolina and I could \nnot work out an agreement, and said, ``If I introduce an amendment to \nraise the arrearages, will you vote for me in committee?'' But then the \nchairman came along and said, ``I will agree.'' I ended up voting \nagainst my friend from Indiana in the committee to raise the number \nhigher. I did that because I made a commitment.\n\n  This is an overall package, all of this. It is not fair for me to say \nto the ranking member or to the chairman, who has made significant \nconcessions from his former positions, I want to take this one piece \nout of the overall agreement and still keep the agreement, any more \nthan it would be fair for him to go into a committee and vote to reduce \nthe number from $819 million to $600 million. He will not do that to \nme, and I will not do that to him. This is not a matter of us making a \npersonal deal. This is meeting the commitment given to us by the \nSenate: Can we put together a bipartisan consensus on this?\n  I want to announce to everybody that I am probably going to be \ncasting votes here, and I will state why at the time--they may say, \n``How can Biden vote that way?'' If it stood all by itself, I probably \nwould not vote that way. But I believe the package we brought for the \nSenate's consideration is serious, balanced, important to the foreign \npolicy of this Nation, and workable. I will stick with it. It is not a \nperfect bill. Like any document that is the result of negotiations \nbetween two opposing parties, it represents compromise and it contains \nsome elements that neither of us like. But it represents, in my \njudgment, an incredibly constructive compromise. I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. President, unless my friend from North Carolina wishes to take \nthe floor, I have nothing further to say.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I shall not devote a lot of time to \nexpressing my appreciation to Senator Biden. He knows how I feel. \nBeginning in January, he is correct, I wasn't sure that we would work \nthis out. He is a fair man, and I try to be. As I look back on it, it \nwas an inspiring experience for me. I thank him, and I hope we can \nexpedite the proceedings from now on.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the bill is open for amendment. This is a \ngood time for Senators who have amendments--and I hope only a few, if \nany, do, but I expect there will be some--this would be a good time for \nthem to come over. We will accord them as much time as they need. But I \nsay with all the earnestness that I have, it would be helpful if \nSenators will come and offer their amendments because the bill is open \nto amendment at this time.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \n15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5655-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5662-S5664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FIGHTING JUVENILE CRIME\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are facing a crisis in juvenile crime \nin America. At no time in our Nation's history have we experienced such \nsevere and pervasive juvenile violence.\n  The statistics tell a frightening story. From 1983 to 1992--in just 9 \nyears--juvenile arrests for violent crimes increased 57 percent. \nSpecifically, juvenile arrests for aggravated assaults increased 95 \npercent while juvenile arrests for murder rose 128 percent. To put it \nin more concrete terms, over 2 million juveniles are arrested each \nyear, many for violent crimes. In 1995 alone, teenagers committed \nalmost 4,000 murders. Sadly, the worst is yet to come.\n  A huge demographic explosion will occur early next century. By 2006 \nthe teenage population will top 30 million, the most in 30 years. \nRespected criminologists, such as James Q. Wilson and Marvin Wolfgang, \nagree that this demographic bulge could have a disastrous effect \nbecause of the large increase in young males in their crime-prone \nyears. The number of juveniles will increase 31 percent by the year \n2010. Experts predict this increase, particularly in young males, will \nmean at least 3,000 more murderers, rapists, and muggers on the streets \nthan exist today. A U.S. Department of Justice report confirms these \ndire predictions. The Justice report estimates that by the year 2010 \njuvenile arrests for violent crime will more than double.\n  So today I want to discuss how we can help the States fight juvenile \ncrime. As chairman of the Youth Violence Subcommittee of the U.S. \nSenate Judiciary Committee, I am greatly interested in crafting a \nbipartisan juvenile justice bill. But before we begin, let's face the \nfacts.\n  The Federal Government has only a limited role in fighting juvenile \ncrime. Ninety-nine percent of all juvenile\n\n[[Page S5663]]\n\ncases are tried in State courts. I believe that S. 10 is a great bill \nbecause its primary focus is aimed at helping the States fight juvenile \ncrime.\n  So today there are three main provisions of S. 10 that I would like \nto talk about and to highlight, and which I think we ought to consider: \ndrug testing, the expansion of juvenile detention facilities, and \nrecordkeeping.\n  S. 10--the Hatch-Sessions bill--deals with these important problems \nin an effective way. First, let's talk about drug testing. S. 10 \nprovides the States block grants to fight juvenile crime. One of the \nrequirements to receive the block grants is that States make reasonable \nefforts to drug test all juveniles arrested for a felony. There is no \nprovision in S. 10 more important, in my opinion, than drug testing.\n  Drug testing is one of the most important diagnostic and \nrehabilitative tools available in fighting crime. Mr. Eric Holder, \nPresident Clinton's nominee for Deputy Attorney General, who testified \njust last week before the Judiciary Committee, stated that drug testing \nprovided vital information for dealing with juveniles who have been \narrested, and that when he served as a Federal judge he tested all \narrestees.\n  Drug testing is so important because it allows authorities to \nidentify a drug problem before the juvenile becomes hopelessly \naddicted. It tells the parents what may have driven this young person \nto become involved in crime. It helps the judge to craft an appropriate \nsentence and appropriate police conditions. It helps the probation \nofficer conduct appropriate supervision of these young offenders. \nHowever, many have raised a concern about the cost of drug testing \nrequirements in S. 10. There is great bipartisan support for drug \ntesting. The only question raised is whether or not it is too \nexpensive. It is not. For example, a typical price charged by a \ncommercial laboratory for a single drug test for cocaine and marijuana \nis $5.75. Moreover, volume purchases of drug testing equipment can \nreduce that price to even less than $5. Both of these figures have been \nverified by official price quotes from commercial laboratories.\n\n  S. 10 provides $75 million to the States to implement this drug \ntesting provision. If the roughly 900,000 juveniles arrested last year \nfor FBI indexed felonies were tested at $6 a test, it would cost \napproximately $5.4 million. It should be noted that most States already \ntest arrestees to some extent. Therefore, the cost will be reduced \nsignificantly.\n  Obviously, S. 10 provides more than ample resources, not only for an \ninitial test but for supervision followup tests as well. That is \nimportant. When a young person is released from prison, followup tests \nshould be conducted, particularly if he has drug tendencies. A followup \ntest can tell whether or not that child is back into an unhealthy \nlifestyle and headed for criminal trouble and additional time.\n  Another important matter is juvenile recordkeeping. Juvenile \nrecordkeeping in America is a travesty. Most judges--whether in adult \ncourt or juvenile court--do not have access to a defendant's juvenile \nrecord because those records are either sealed or are not shared with \nother jurisdictions within the law enforcement community. S. 10 greatly \nimproves juvenile recordkeeping without overstepping the Federal \nGovernment's role in juvenile crime, and without great expense. One of \nthe few requirements in this bill is that the States make reasonable \nefforts to record, collect, and disseminate juvenile criminal records \nfor the FBI just like they do for all adult cases.\n  In order to ease the burden on the States, we provide funds to help \nthem upgrade their juvenile justice record system. We have estimates \nfrom organizations that specialize in recordkeeping that State juvenile \nrecords can be updated and sent to the FBI for roughly $50 million.\n  I believe S. 10 provides the States with more than sufficient \nresources to accomplish this goal. And please note that this bill in no \nway mandates the States to open their cases. Each State will make its \nown decision. It simply says that the law enforcement community, \nthrough the National Crime Information Center computer system, will \nhave arrests and convictions for serious felonies by juveniles. Those \nrecords are only available for law enforcement and judicial purposes.\n  The following is a true story that illustrates the problem we are \ntalking about. A 15-year-old was arrested and pled guilty to armed \nrobbery. Previously, he had been arrested several times for violent \ncrimes in a different State. Unfortunately, the presiding judge did not \nhave access to these prior arrest records because they were not part of \nthe National Crime Information Center computer system.\n  Despite the fact that he had pled guilty to a violent crime, the \njudge decided to release him after being assured that he would be going \ninto a residential facility. Soon after that young offender was \nreleased, he shot and paralyzed a police officer during an attempted \ntheft. There is no doubt that the judge would not have released him, \nhad he had access to that juvenile's prior record of violent crime. The \nlack of access to juvenile records in this case directly contributed to \na tragic crime. When a probation officer supervises a young offender, \nhe needs to know the young offender's criminal history. It is simply \nillogical that we fail to maintain those records in a readily \naccessible way.\n  Reporting juvenile records to a national clearinghouse will provide \nlaw enforcement officers and judges across this Nation with accurate \ncriminal history information. This will serve to protect law \nenforcement personnel when they are dealing with juvenile suspects and \ndefendants, as well as provide necessary information to the judiciary.\n  One proper role for the Federal Government, in law enforcement, is to \nserve as a national clearinghouse for information. Our proposal \nfulfills such a role and in the process dramatically improves our \njuvenile justice system.\n  There is another matter of importance. The Hatch-Sessions bill helps \nStates improve their juvenile detention centers. The bill provides \nmatching grant money to the States for the construction and renovation \nof juvenile detention facilities. In the last 20 years, juvenile prison \nconstruction has not kept pace with the tremendous increase in juvenile \ncrime. While States and the Federal Government have increased adult \nprison capacity significantly, the construction of juvenile facilities \nhas been neglected consistently.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, if crime is to be reduced, we \nmust increase juvenile detention and juvenile detention space. I \nmention crime, and not merely juvenile crime, for this reason. The line \nbetween juvenile crime and adult crime has never been so blurred. An \never-increasing amount of serious crime is committed by young \noffenders. By some accounts, juveniles now account for almost 20 \npercent of violent crime arrests and over one-third of all property \ncrime arrests.\n  The following facts illustrate the need for more juvenile detention \ncenters. Only 56 out of every 1,000 juveniles arrested are \nincarcerated. I repeat that. Only 56 out of every 1,000 juveniles \narrested are incarcerated. We are simply not identifying the violent \ncriminals and putting them in prison.\n  To put it in more concrete terms, consider this. In 1991, over \n123,000 juveniles were arrested for violent crimes, yet there were less \nthan 50,000 juvenile beds in the United States available to house them. \nAnd many repeat, habitual property criminals have to be incarcerated, \ntoo. I wish that were not so, but that is simply the fact. We have had \na doubling of violent juvenile crime in less than a decade. We simply \nhave to increase our bed space. Again, I wish that were not so.\n  A lack of proper juvenile detention centers eliminates the deterrent \neffect of the criminal justice system. When a police officer arrests an \noffender in a stolen car for burglarizing a person's home, and he \ncannot keep him even 1 night in the local jail because it is not an \napproved juvenile facility or because there is no space in the juvenile \nfacility--that young offender is released back on the street. This \nundermines respect for the law. Not only does the young offender get \nthe wrong impression, but so do his classmates, running-mates, and gang \nmembers. They see Billy get arrested and expect something to happen. \nWhen he is released the very same day, they get a message. It is not \nthe message we want to convey. We simply have to step up to the plate \nand do more about that.\n\n[[Page S5664]]\n\n  Another matter. Many of my colleagues have indicated that our bill \nfails to provide sufficient prevention money. I would like to point out \nthat according to the General Accounting Office, the Federal Government \ncurrently has 131 programs administered by 16 different departments and \nagencies that may be used to benefit at-risk and delinquent youth. In \n1995, the total cost of these programs exceeded $4 billion. We are \nalready spending tremendous sums of Federal taxpayer money on \nprevention programs. I hope they work. Some of them do and some of them \ndo not. We need to do a better job of oversight. And the States also \nare spending tremendous sums of money for prevention purposes. We have \na juvenile justice system that is broken, and we need to fix it.\n  Here is a chart which shows the huge number of programs and the total \ndollars--$4 billion--being spent right now with Government appropriated \nfunds for at-risk and delinquent youth. This bill has prevention \nmatters in it, but it is also focused primarily on changing our \njuvenile justice system from a state of collapse into an effective \nsystem that will actually work to deter crime.\n  There are 21 gang intervention programs, 35 mentoring programs, 42 \njob training assistance programs, 47 counseling programs, 44 self-\nsufficiency programs, 53 substance abuse intervention programs. Each of \nthese programs is already being funded in an effort to help at-risk \nyoung people not get caught up in a life of crime. The penalty imposed \nfor every act of wrongdoing, starting from that first offense, is in \nitself prevention.\n  Mr. President, 61 percent of the juveniles brought into the juvenile \ncourt system are 15 years of age or younger. These juveniles may still \nbe amenable to discipline. However, there is currently little respect \nfor our State juvenile system because the juvenile judges have little \nresources and almost no bed space to carry out the sanctions they would \nlike to impose. S. 10 will assist the States in rectifying this deficit \nin resources.\n  So, Mr. President, I have mentioned only three provisions of the bill \ntoday but there are many more. There is a tough antigang provision that \nhas great potential to crack down on gangs; historic reforms of Federal \nprocedures to make cases more easily prosecutable in Federal court; \nelimination of unwise Federal mandates; requirements for local juvenile \ncrime, advisory committee groups, and I just noticed the Senator from \nDelaware has arrived. This provision is modeled after a provision he \nput in the law a number of years ago to require the local court system \nto get together to discuss civil case processing.\n  We believe, and I think Senator Biden agrees, that if we are going to \ngive money to a local juvenile court system, we ought to at least ask \nthat the judge, the prosecutor, the sheriff, and the police chief get \ntogether and discuss just how well their system is working and what \nthey can do to make that system work better.\n  I appreciate the consistent leadership over the years that Senator \nBiden has provided. He is the ranking member of the Juvenile Justice \nSubcommittee, and his contributions were very valuable in putting \ntogether a bill that I believe eventually will be a historic step \nforward in juvenile justice. I believe that this is the most \nsignificant juvenile crime bill in over 20 years. Our juvenile justice \nsystem is broken. These are sound, thoughtful, practical and effective \nprovisions that will help fix a broken system.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues as time goes by to give the \nhighest consideration to this legislation and urge their support of its \npassage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nproceed for 20 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will say at the outset I will cease if \nanyone comes to the floor. I am acting in a bit of a dual capacity \nhere. I am comanaging the bill that is before us. We are waiting for \nsome of our colleagues to come over with amendments. But in the \nmeantime let me before the Senator from Alabama leaves the floor \nacknowledge and thank him for his acknowledgement of my efforts in this \narea and thank him for the knowledge he has brought to this body as a \nformer prosecutor, an attorney general in his State, and as a former \nU.S. attorney running a Federal operation in his State as well, and for \nthe vigor with which he has attacked the obvious problem. It is only of \nlate that most people are acknowledging we should be focusing on \njuvenile crime. He in his capacity within his State both as a Federal \nofficial and a State official has been focused on it for some time. He \nand I have some outstanding disagreement on how to approach this, but \nwe are substantially in agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5662-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5664-S5666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A LESSON FOR ALL OF US\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, with your permission, rather than \nimmediately comment on the same subject matter, I ask, as we used to \nsay in the Senate, a point of personal privilege. I would like to \ncomment on a story that was published in my hometown newspaper that is \nthe antithesis of problems relating to juvenile delinquency. It is a \nstory about a family I am very close to.\n  I should say at the outset I am prejudiced in this regard. I have a \nvery close relationship and high regard for the father and mother of \nthis family, and three of the four children in this family have worked \nwith me and are friends of my children. One of them is in this Chamber \ntoday at my request as an employee of one of our colleagues from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. President, I want to tell this story because we rarely get a \nchance to share with our colleagues the kind of story I am about to \nshare and, I might add, that in my almost 25 years in the Senate I have \nonly done this on one other occasion, but I think it is just \nremarkable.\n  The story is about a family named Kimmel, the Kimmel family. Going \nway back, I didn't practice law with but practiced law in adjoining \nsuites to Mort Kimmel and knew his wife Marsha. We go back now about 30 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, it is the kind of story which I rarely share but my \nreluctance to discuss this in a public forum was increased initially \nbecause the individuals involved were such close personal friends, Mort \nand Marsha Kimmel and their family. I have known Mort and Marsha, as I \nsaid, for 30 years and the children have worked with me on my campaigns \nand have been friends with my children as well. They are among the most \ngiving and caring people I know.\n  A story appeared on the front page of our largest statewide newspaper \nentitled ``Triumph of the Heart.'' I will ask at the appropriate time \nit be printed in the Record. It is a picture of my buddy, Mort Kimmel, \nand his wife and his four children. I will explain that in a minute. It \nis focused on a young man named Larry Spiller who is, in fact, the \nnephew of Mort and Marsha Kimmel.\n  It is really a story about Larry Spiller and his aunt and uncle and \nhis cousins who welcomed Larry into their home and into their hearts \nafter a severe family tragedy. I think it holds some lessons for what \nwe all say we value but few of us practice. It is a story of \nselflessness, of sacrifice, and, most of all, of what being family, in \nmy opinion, is all about.\n  On New Year's Eve, in 1987, the Spiller family got on an airplane--\nmother, father, and three children--to head to a ski trip in Vermont. \nLarry's father had a commercial pilot's license. He was instrument-\nrated but got caught while flying the family up to Vermont, after one \nstop and then taking off again, in a wind shear 90 feet before the \nrunway as they were landing and the plane crashed. Larry's mother and \nfather both died in the crash, and Larry's two brothers were mortally \ninjured. This young man, Larry Spiller, was then 8 years old. He was \nthe only survivor. And because he happened to have switched seats with \nhis mom just before they attempted to land--he had been riding in the \ncopilot seat, and his mom wanted to get up front to help his dad \nbecause of the weather--and he was seated in a seat where his back was \nto the pilot, I expect and most people think that is the reason why he \nsurvived.\n  Well, what happened was, on that awful day, there was a meeting \nshortly\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\nthereafter that took place in another family, and that is in the family \nof the brother-in-law, the family of the partner, because Larry's \nfather and my friend, Mort Kimmel, were law partners. But Larry's \nfather happened to have a mother who was the sister of my friend, Mort \nKimmel. And so Mort and Marcia Kimmel and their three young children--\nWayne, who is now 27, Michelle, who works here in Washington, who is \nnow 24, and Karen, 18--held a family meeting and they made a very \nfateful decision. They made a decision to bring Larry into their home \nas another son, another sibling--no holds barred, absolute, total, \nequal.\n  Karen, who is now 18 years old, on her own volition gave up her \nbedroom for her cousin. That was her idea. And many other personal, \nwhat appeared to be sacrifices were made through the selfless acts of \nthe three children and the mother and father. It is the kind of \nselfless family decision that is so often talked about, that we see in \nthe movies and we see glorified, but so seldom do we know of it \noccurring. Because we all have a tendency to rationalize when that kind \nof thing happens, even though it is your sister's child who survived. I \ncan picture thousands of good people rationalizing, ``Well, wait, we \nonly have so much. If we bring in Larry, then what about our three \nchildren? And maybe it is best for * * *'' and so on and so forth. As \nthe Presiding Officer knows, the ability of the human mind to \nrationalize is mind-boggling. But they made no rationalization. They, \nin a genuine family decision involving all three of their children, \ndecided that there was only one course of action.\n  There were adjustments and sacrifices for everyone involved. But for \nthe Kimmels, that is all part of being a family. You hear a lot of talk \nthese days about family values, but the Kimmels and Larry Spiller, that \nyoung 9-year-old boy at the time, have lived out what in reality is an \nold-fashioned notion, that families are there for one another.\n  We have an expression in my family. After my wife and daughter were \nkilled, I came home from the hospital, my two sons were in the \nhospital, and my sister had already moved into my house. She didn't ask \nanything--my younger sister and her husband. We have an expression in \nour family: If you have to ask, it's too late. Well, they didn't have \nto ask; they just decided and they acted.\n  Whether it involves taking in an orphaned child or bringing in an \nelderly parent or grandparent in your home, providing a sibling or an \naunt or an uncle a place to get back on their feet on solid ground \nafter a period of rough going or ill health, these sacrifices are all \nexamples of what we mean by family. Make no mistake about it: These \ndecisions are not easy. But family values, real, practice-what-you-\npreach family values, don't always make it easy for us to make \ndecisions. And they are not always convenient.\n  Family is, rather, about commitment. And the Kimmel family is a \nliving testament to that commitment.\n  Let me tell you what the article was about. I will not go on much \nlonger. The article is focused on how this young man, Larry Spiller, \nwho is now graduating from one of the finest high schools in Delaware, \nabout how well he has done in this family. He has excelled both \nacademically and athletically. This young man made all State in both \nbaseball and basketball, did incredibly well in school, and will be \nattending Cornell University. Like so many other great schools, it is \nvery difficult to get into, and his family has every right to be proud \nof this young man.\n  It would have been easy for a 9-year-old child, I can tell you from \nexperience, having been tragically robbed, in this case of his entire \nimmediate family, to let that tragedy define his life. No one would \nhave begrudged him that. That happens to a lot of people whose lives \nhave been scarred by tragedy. And it would have been equally \nunderstandable had Mort and Marcia Kimmel and their children allowed \nLarry to slip into that kind of thinking or allowed Larry to slip \nthrough their fingers and allowed the tragedy to be the focal point of \ntheir lives. But that did not happen. They all grieved, of course, and \nstill do. But they have been able to move on, to live their lives as a \ndynamic family, each of them involved in school and sports and civic \nactivities. They proved that while bad things do happen to good people, \ngood things happen, too, especially when you make up your mind not to \nlet the bad experiences define and dominate your life.\n\n  Last summer, young Larry turned 18 and received the bulk of his \nparents' estate. It was a substantial sum of money for a young man just \nbeginning to make his way in the world. It could make Larry's life a \nlot easier in the coming years. But, instead, Larry Spiller and the \nKimmels have used the money to establish the Kimmel-Spiller Charitable \nFoundation to help sick children and those facing injuries and \ndisabilities.\n  In the newspaper interview that I will submit for the Record, he, \nyoung Larry, who was graduating, as I said, was asked what he had to \nsay about this. He said, ``There is really no need for me to have all \nthat. I want to work for my own money as a lawyer, which I will \nprobably do, and my parents''--he refers to Mort and Marcia as his \nparents--``will support me through college. It could help other \npeople.''\n  How many young kids, with that kind of a capability, that kind of \nmoney, would say, ``You know, there is really no need for me to have \nit; I'll work for my own money; I'll be able to do it''?\n  Larry goes on to say in that article, ``I'm lucky to be here. I'm \nlucky I could just move into another family and be so stable. I was \nalways happy to have a second chance.''\n  Larry Spiller and Wayne and Michelle and Karen Kimmel, the other \nchildren, and their parents, Mort and Marcia Kimmel, are a very special \nfamily, and in their story lie some valuable lessons for all of us. It \nis not easy to be a family. The decisions aren't always painless \ndecisions. Sacrifice almost always goes with love. But when love is \nthere, anything can be overcome.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nWilmington News Journal about Larry Spiller and his family be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the News Journal, June 11, 1997]\n\n                          Triumph of the Heart\n\n\nORPHANED AT 9 AND TAKEN IN BY HIS UNCLE AND FAMILY, LARRY SPILLER IS A \n            STORY OF ACADEMIC, ATHLETIC AND PERSONAL SUCCESS\n\n                          (By Kevin Tresolini)\n\n       Your heart wants to ache for Larry Siller, but he will not \n     let it.\n       He is a young man who could have withdrawn, cursing the \n     fates--and the wind shear--that orphaned him almost 10 years \n     ago.\n       Instead, he radiates happiness.\n       ``I consider myself lucky,'' Spiller said. ``It's not as if \n     nothing has happened, but I'm very comfortable with who I \n     am.''\n       Now 18, he is poised to move into the next phase of life \n     with his graduation tonight from Tower Hill School. He has \n     excelled academically--earning admission to Cornell \n     University beginning this fall--as well as athletically, \n     making All-State in basketball and baseball.\n       Spiller almost didn't live to see this day.\n       He was 9 years old, traveling with his parents and two \n     brothers on Dec. 31, 1987, when the six-seat Piper Lance \n     airplane carrying the family crashed 10 feet short of the \n     runway at Burlington (Vt.) International Airport.\n       Spiller's father, Paul, a 39-year-old Wilmington attorney \n     who was piloting the plane he co-owned, and mother, Judith, \n     35, were killed instantly. His brothers, Harvey, 14, and \n     David, 5, suffered severe spine and head injuries and died \n     within two weeks.\n       A National Transportation Safety Board investigation \n     concluded that wind shear--a sudden, violent, vertical burst \n     of wind--brought the plane down.\n       Spiller, who suffered a broken leg and concussion, \n     survived. And he has become an inspiration to others around \n     him.\n       ``What he's done is unbelievable,'' said David Glazier, a \n     Brandywine High School senior who is a close friend. ``He's \n     the opposite of what you think might happen. I've never seen \n     him upset.''\n       ``He is an absolutely outstanding individual,'' said Steve \n     Hyde, his baseball coach at Tower Hill, ``in every sense of \n     the word.''\n\n\n                 the plane crash that changed his life\n\n       Paul Spiller was an experienced pilot with a commercial \n     pilot's license, a flight instructor's certificate and 734 \n     hours of flying time when the Piper Lance left Greater \n     Wilmington Airport at 1:30 p.m. bound for Rutland, Vt.\n       The Spillers were going to meet friends for a quick \n     vacation at the Killington ski resort.\n       According to federal transportation officials, the plane \n     landed in Binghamton, N.Y., at 2:47 p.m. to wait out bad \n     weather. At 4:01, the plane left Binghamton.\n       About an hour later, the Spillers' plane was cleared for \n     approach to Rutland. But the plane began to accumulate ice, \n     and Paul\n\n[[Page S5666]]\n\n     Spiller asked to be diverted to clearer weather. He was \n     informed that Burlington, the picturesque college town \n     straddling Lake Champlain 67 miles to the north, had radar \n     contact and 15 miles visibility. He headed there.\n       At 5:20 p.m., when he couldn't maintain 5,500 feet altitude \n     because of ice, Spiller declared an emergency. He was given \n     permission to descend to 2,000 feet, where ice began coming \n     off the windshield. Then it iced up again, and the Burlington \n     control tower turned the runway lights up.\n       ``I was in the front seat with my dad when he called an \n     emergency,'' Larry Spiller remembered. ``My mom said, `Switch \n     seats with me. I want to be up front to help your father.' ''\n       Larry moved to the second row of seats, which pointed \n     backward. His brothers were facing him. Behind them was the \n     luggage compartment.\n       At 5:40 p.m., the pilot radioed again. ``The runway is \n     clear now. I can see it clearly. Thank you.''\n       All seemed fine. One minute later, Paul Spiller radioed \n     again and was cut off midword.\n       ``I just experienced what I think to be wind sh--''\n       The plane plummeted 200 feet to the ground and slid another \n     100 feet. It briefly caught fire, but emergency workers--\n     stationed nearby because of the emergency call--quickly \n     extinguished the flames.\n       Workers found Larry, conscious, with the luggage. They took \n     him and his unconscious brothers to the Medical Center \n     Hospital of Vermont.\n       Spiller could not recall the crash when he woke up in the \n     hospital and saw his mother's brother, Morton Kimmel.\n       ``When I told him, [about the accident] he didn't believe \n     it,'' Kimmel said. ``I said, `It's true.' ''\n       Larry visited his brothers, who never regained \n     consciousness.\n       ``I think about [my family] pretty much every day, even if \n     it's just for a second,'' Larry said. ``They're * * *.\n\n\n                       Spiller gets a new family\n\n       With the crash, Morton Kimmel lost his sister, two nephews \n     and a brother-in-law who was his law partner.\n       But he gained a son, when he took Spiller into his family.\n       Kimmel and wife, Marcia, eventually became Spiller's legal \n     guardian. His cousins--Wayne, now 27, Michell, 24, and Karen, \n     also 18--became his new siblings.\n       ``They took me in and I was just part of their family,'' \n     Spiller said. ``Ever since then, I've been calling them my \n     parents and my brothers and sister.\n       ``It's really a very normal life. I didn't change schools. \n     I didn't change sports.\n       ``My first father coached me in every sport. My present \n     father now coaches everything, too. Few things changed except \n     the people I was living with.''\n       Larry's grandparents, Benjamin and Bebe Spiller, now living \n     in Pompano Beach, Fla., lost their son, daughter-in-law and \n     two grandsons. Larry gave them a lifeline, Benjamin Spiller \n     said.\n       ``We survived because of him.''\n\n\n                         `can I call you mom?'\n\n       On his first night with his new family, 9-year-old Larry \n     Spiller, a boy with his whole life ahead of him but the lives \n     of his immediate family members behind him, tentatively asked \n     his aunt, Marcia, ``Can I call you mom?''\n       Feeling it was too soon, and not wanting Larry to forget \n     his real parents, she responded, ``Let's just wait.''\n       The following New Year's Eve, one year to the day after the \n     crash, he asked again.\n       ``I was tucking him into bed,'' she said, ``and he said, \n     `It's been a year', and asked again. We have family meetings \n     every week. I said, `This would be a big change,' but I knew \n     it would be all right. We talked about it at our next family \n     meeting and said, `We'd love to do this.' ''\n       Stripped of the security of his immediate family, Larry had \n     every reason to feel alone. He never did.\n       ``Our families were so close,'' said Spiller, who was a \n     Tower Hill third-grader at the time of the crash. ``We were \n     together all the time anyway before the crash. I never felt \n     alone at all, there were so many people around me.''\n       One of the most important was Karen, a cousin eight months \n     younger than Larry.\n       ``Everybody was walking on eggshells,'' Mort Kimmel said of \n     Larry's first fragile days with his ``new'' family. ``Except \n     Karen. Karen gave him her room. Karen brought him back into \n     reality.''\n       At Tower Hill, classmates marveled at Spiller's strength.\n       ``I remember when he came back to school,'' said longtime \n     pal Chip Goodman. ``His leg was in a cast and part of his \n     head was shaved. But that was all there was to tell you what \n     had happened.''\n       As Spiller developed into an athlete, his new family \n     cheered him on. He would up scoring more than 1,100 points as \n     a Tower Hill basketball player, the third-highest total in \n     school history.\n       A pitcher and infielder in baseball, he batted .375 as a \n     junior and .351 this spring, securing All-State recognition \n     both years. He'll play in Saturday's annual Blue-Gold Senior \n     All-Star Game, and made the Delaware South roster for this \n     month's Phillies-sponsored Carpenter Cup tri-state tournament \n     at Veterans Stadium. This summer, he's again playing for the \n     defending state champion R.C. du Pont American Legion \n     baseball team.\n\n\n                      giving away his inheritance\n\n       On Aug. 5 last summer, Larry's 18th birthday, his \n     biological parents' financial holdings and life insurance \n     benefits, which had been held in trust, became Spiller's. The \n     amount, he said, ``is substantial.''\n       He's giving it away. Along with his present parents, Larry \n     has set up the Kimmel Spiller Charitable Foundation. The \n     first grant will likely be worth $30,000 Mort Kimmel said.\n       ``It's a fund for sick kids or people injured or with \n     disabilities,'' Spiller said. ``There's really no need for me \n     to have it. I want to work for my own money as a lawyer, \n     which I'll probably do, and my parents will support me \n     through college. It could help other people.\n       ``I definitely consider myself lucky,'' Spiller said again. \n     ``Just switching seats with my mom. If I hadn't done that, \n     there's no way I would have had a chance to survive.\n       ``I'm lucky to be here. I'm lucky I could just move into \n     another family and be so stable. I was always happy to have a \n     second chance.''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I know there \nare thousands of other families who made the same kind of sacrifices. \nWhen we talk about family values, this is what I mean by family values, \nfamily values that reflect a common consensus about sacrifice to make \nthings better for everyone else in the family.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to know the entire Kimmel family, and I am \nproud that one of the young children in that family--not quite so young \nanymore, she is still very young by our standards--is down here making \nher contribution to her Nation by working on the staff of one of our \ncolleagues from Florida.\n  Mr. President, with the Chair's permission, I would like to move onto \na different subject, the subject spoken to by my friend from Alabama. \nIf my friend, Senator Durbin, is ready to move on his, I will withhold \nthat until the next lull we have and respond to my friend from Alabama \non the issue he raised regarding youth violence.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct. The Senate is on S. \n903.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 377\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding United States \n                      citizens imprisoned in Peru)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment for consideration by \nthe Senate which I have discussed with Senator Biden's staff as well as \nSenator Helms' staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 377:\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XVI, add the following (and conform the \n     table of contents accordingly):\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING UNITED STATES CITIZENS \n                   HELD IN PRISONS IN PERU.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Government of Peru has made substantial progress in \n     the effort to restrict the flow of illicit drugs from Peru to \n     the United States.\n       (2) The Government of Peru has cooperated greatly with the \n     United States Government to stop individuals and \n     organizations seeking to transport illicit drugs from Peru to \n     the United States and to jail such drug exporters.\n       (3) Any individual engaging in such exporting of illicit \n     drugs and convicted in a court of law should face stiff \n     penalties.\n       (4) Any such individual should also have a right to timely \n     legal procedures.\n       (5) Two United States citizens, Jennifer Davis and Krista \n     Barnes, were arrested in Peru on September 25, 1996, for \n     attempting to transport illicit drugs from Peru to the United \n     States.\n       (6) Ms. Davis and Ms. Barnes have admitted their guilt upon \n     arrest and to an investigative judge.\n       (7) Ms. Davis and Ms. Barnes have volunteered to cooperate \n     fully with Peruvian judicial authorities in naming \n     individuals responsible for drug trafficking and several have \n     been arrested.\n       (8) More than 7 months after their arrest, Ms. Davis and \n     Ms. Barnes have not been formally changed with a crime.\n\n[[Page S5667]]\n\n       (9) Peruvian domestic law mandates that formal charges be \n     brought within 4 to 6 months after arrest.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Government of Peru should respect the rights of prisoners \n     to timely legal procedures, including the rights of all \n     United States citizens held in prisons in Peru.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \ninvolving a very sad situation. This amendment expresses the sense-of-\nthe-Senate that the Government of Peru should respect the rights of \nprisoners to timely legal procedures, including the rights of all \nUnited States citizens currently being held in prison in Peru.\n  This amendment was included in the State Department authorization \nbill that has been enacted by the House of Representatives. It was \noffered in that Chamber by my colleague from Illinois, Congressman Tom \nEwing. It was accepted as part of the chairman's en bloc amendment.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to encourage the Government of Peru \nto bring to trial two young Americans who have been held in prison in \nPeru for more than 7 months without being formally charged or brought \nto trial. These two young Americans have received a lot of publicity in \nthe United States. One from the State of Illinois, Jennifer Davis, and \nanother, Krista Barnes of California, have admitted their guilt to a \nserious crime. They were arrested in Peru when they were 19- and 20-\nyear-olds, respectively, after being recruited by drug smugglers in \nattempting to carry powdered cocaine out of Peru.\n  These two teenagers made a tragic mistake. They are prepared to \naccept the legal penalties for their actions. And it will be a harsh \npenalty. They and their parents are only asking that they be brought to \ntrial by Peruvian authorities and convicted so that they can be \nextradited to the United States to serve their sentences.\n  The physical conditions under which Jennifer and Krista are being \nheld are in violation of the basic spirit and letter of international \nhuman rights agreements, to which Peru is a signatory. I have spoken to \ntheir parents. The prison where they are being held is extremely \novercrowded. Basic health care is not provided. Nourishment is \ninadequate. There is sexual and other violence taking place. The shared \nbathroom facilities have no running water and are extremely filthy, and \ndisease is rampant.\n  The amendment specifically states that any individual engaged in the \nexport of illicit drugs and convicted in a court of law should face \nstiff penalties. But the amendment also states that individuals \nengaging in the export of illicit drugs should have the right to a \ntimely trial.\n  I know this is an important matter to many families in Illinois who \nare friends of Jennifer Davis. They understand the serious mistake she \nhas made. They understand that she will pay a price for it that she \nwill never, ever forget. All they are asking for is humane treatment, \nthat she be brought to trial and, if convicted, we can then apply for \nextradition to the United States.\n  What we are asking of Peru is nothing new. The government of that \ncountry has already signed international agreements saying that they \nwill treat all prisoners in a humane way, and that they will bring \nprisoners to trial. So I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me \nin the approval of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution as an amendment \nto the Foreign Affairs bill which is presently under consideration.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, does the Senator have a second amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have another amendment, and Senator Gorton of \nWashington has a companion. If we can deal with the Peruvian amendment \nfirst, and hope he comes to the floor momentarily?\n  Mr. BIDEN. With the permission of the chairman, I think we can deal \nwith this. There is no real objection to what the Senator is \nsuggesting. It makes sense.\n  There is another one of our colleagues who wishes to deal with a \nsimilar circumstance in Peru. Maybe the Senator could withhold seeking \naction on this and see if we can accommodate this all in one amendment, \nand possibly move to a second amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am learning in the Senate that accommodation is a good \nidea if your amendment is well received. I sense the amendment is well \nreceived.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend, that is the case. The \nquestion is whether or not we can accommodate another one of our \ncolleagues as well. It is always better than to have a rollcall vote.\n  If the Senator will seek to lay aside this amendment temporarily and \npossibly proceed to his next amendment, maybe we can accommodate both \nat the same time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. I would be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COLLINS). Without objection, the amendment \nis set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 378\n\n   (Purpose: To designate additional countries as eligible for NATO \n                        enlargement assistance)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have a second amendment that I would \nlike to present for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and Mr. \n     Gorton, proposes an amendment numbered 378.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . DESIGNATION OF ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES ELIGIBLE FOR \n                   NATO ENLARGEMENT ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Designation of Additional Countries.--Effective 180 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, Lithuania, \n     Latvia, Estonia, and Romania are each designated as eligible \n     to receive assistance under the program established under \n     section 203(a) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 and \n     shall be deemed to have been so designated pursuant to \n     section 203(d)(1) of such Act, except that any such country \n     shall not be so designated if, prior to such effective date, \n     the President certifies to the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate that the country fails to \n     meet the criteria under section 203(d)(3) of the NATO \n     Participation Act of 1994.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--The designation of countries \n     pursuant to subsection (a) as eligible to receive assistance \n     under the program established under section 203(a) of the \n     NATO Participation Act of 1994--\n       (1) is in addition to the designation of other countries by \n     law or pursuant to section 203(d)(2) of such Act as eligible \n     to receive assistance under the program established under \n     section 203(a) of such Act; and\n       (2) shall not preclude the designation by the President of \n     other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe \n     pursuant to section 203(d)(2) of such Act as eligible to \n     receive assistance under the program established under \n     section 203(a) of such Act.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I hope in designating this amendment, it \nwill designate as my cosponsor Senator Gorton of Washington. He and I \nare cosponsoring similar amendments, and I think he will be on the \nfloor momentarily to discuss his amendment, but I would like to discuss \nthis amendment directly.\n  This amendment designates Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Romania as \neligible to receive assistance to prepare for future NATO membership.\n  This amendment does not require that any nation be invited to join \nNATO. It simply makes Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Romania eligible \nto receive assistance to prepare for NATO membership in the future. A \nsimilar amendment was in the House-passed version of the State \nDepartment authorization bill.\n  I say to my colleagues, this last February, I visited Lithuania, the \nhomeland of my mother, for my fourth visit. I found, much to my \namazement, that no matter where I traveled in this small country, no \nmatter what official I sat down to meet with, people had on their mind \none thing and one thing only: NATO membership.\n  The Baltic States, particularly Lithuania and Latvia, believe that \nNATO membership is crucial to their survival. They are surrounded, in \nmany instances, by questionable circumstances, Russian troops and a lot \nof question marks that leave them uncertain about their future.\n  I said to them at that point that when I returned to the Senate, I \nwould do everything in my power to inform\n\n[[Page S5668]]\n\nand educate my colleagues about this deep, heartfelt feeling in the \nBaltics, that their membership in NATO is where they want to be in this \nnext century, looking to the West, looking to democracy, being part of \nour security alliance which was so crucial for half a century in \nWestern Europe.\n  This amendment is consistent with current laws and programs to assist \nthe new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe to prepare for future \nNATO membership. It includes, obviously, the Baltics States and \nRomania. The NATO Participation Act of 1994 authorized the President to \nestablish a program to assist emerging democracies in Central and \nEastern Europe to prepare for future NATO membership. The NATO \nEnlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 designated Poland, Hungary, the \nCzech Republic and Slovenia to receive assistance to prepare for future \nNATO membership, and the act directed the President to designate \nadditional democracies in Central and Eastern Europe if they met \ncertain criteria.\n  It is clearly in the interest of the United States to support \ndemocracy, free-market reform and security in the Baltics and Romania. \nThere is no better way to do this than to help them prepare for NATO \nmembership. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Romania are doing everything \nasked of them--and more--to prepare for future NATO membership. They \nshould be designated as eligible to receive assistance under the NATO \nEnlargement Facilitation Act of 1996.\n  Examples of how the Baltics and Romania are meeting the criteria \nestablished by this act for assistance to prepare for NATO membership:\n  They have made courageous choices and painful sacrifices to \nreestablish their freedom and rebuild their democracies and free-market \neconomies. It is hard to imagine, the Baltic States and other Eastern \nEuropean countries, once members of the Warsaw Pact, which were \nsubjugated to Soviet rule for 50 years, this blanket of Soviet hegemony \nvirtually snuffed out the initiative, creativity and energy of these \ngreat nations, but they survived. And not just survived, they came out \nof it determined to rebuild, rebuild with a face to the West.\n  All of these nations have applied for NATO membership.\n  They have made significant progress toward establishing civilian \ncontrol of their militaries, police and intelligence services.\n  They are adhering to the rule of law.\n  They are respecting the values and interests shared by other NATO \nmembers.\n  They are accepting the obligations, responsibilities and costs of \nNATO membership.\n  Their parliaments are making financial commitments, many times at \ngreat sacrifice, to prepare for NATO membership, significantly \nincreasing their support for national defense and Partnership for Peace \nactivities.\n  My vision, and I hope one shared by my colleagues, is that an \nenlarged NATO will put Europe in a position to deal with its own \nproblems in a better fashion. We are now deeply committed in Bosnia, as \nwe should be, to bring peace to that region. But if there were a strong \nNATO encompassing so many more countries in Europe, I think we can \nenvision a day when that sort of a dispute and that sort of a problem \nwill be dealt with primarily, if not exclusively, by NATO members in \nEuropean States.\n  This suggestion of enlarging NATO eligibility is a step on a path \nthat could lead us to that favorable conclusion.\n  These countries have demonstrated they are fully committed to sharing \nthe responsibilities of NATO membership.\n  They are building their defense forces in accordance with NATO \nplanning standards.\n  They are improving their communication and information systems, \ncommand and control, and English training.\n  They are active participants in the Partnership for Peace Program.\n  They have participated in joint exercises, training programs, and \npeacekeeping operations led by NATO and the United States.\n  It was, I guess, incredible to me to consider that a tiny country \nlike Lithuania would send a small group to IFOR in Bosnia to \nparticipate in peacekeeping. Tragically, one of the Lithuanian soldiers \nwas one of the early casualties because of the detonation of a mine. \nThe Lithuanian Parliament might, at that point, have had a vigorous \ndebate and decided they made a mistake, that they were not ready to get \ninvolved. They decided just the opposite. Even having lost a Lithuanian \nsoldier in a joint effort with the United States and other NATO \ncountries to bring peace to Bosnia, the Lithuanian Parliament voted \noverwhelmingly to commit even more troops in their peacekeeping effort \nto demonstrate to Europe, to the world, and all the NATO members they \nare serious about making this kind of a participation a reality.\n  I learned last week from the Prime Minister of Latvia that the same \ntype of commitment was made. They have participated in NATO's \npeacekeeping mission. They have increased their troop commitments, and \nit is clear that they are sincere. They are strategically significant \nto an effective NATO defense, and they are likely to be in a position \nto further the membership of NATO and contribute to the security of the \nNorth Atlantic area in the near future.\n  I have nothing further on this amendment. I defer to the chairman or \nminority spokesman as to whether they would like to consider the \namendment at this point or wait for Senator Gorton to come to the floor \nwith his companion amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I suggest we await the arrival of Senator \nGorton so we can see the whole picture at one time, if that suits the \nSenator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is fine.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I agree, but if he will yield for me to \nmake a comment, if I may, to my friend. The Senator has made the case \nfor the Baltics and for Romania. As to the Baltics, it seems to me, the \ncase is obvious. With regard to Romania, that important country has \nmade significant strides in the last 6 months.\n  I want to make clear so that we all know, what we are talking about \nis the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act, which was passed in 1996. \nBasically, what the act does, Madam President, as you well know, is \nthat it says there are newly independent states, which formerly were \nsatellite states of the Soviet Union, who are seeking membership or may \nseek membership in NATO. It is kind of a two-stage process. We did the \nsame thing for Hungary, we did the same thing for Poland, we did the \nsame thing for the Czech Republic, and last year we added Slovenia. We \nbasically said, look, we, the Congress and the President, will come up \nwith some money to help you begin to organize yourself to meet the \ncriteria for admission into NATO. This is not a club that you join \nbecause you like it, or join because you simply want to join. This is a \ndeal where everybody has to carry their own weight proportionately \nwithin the club, and we are not going to admit anybody who cannot do \nthat. But it requires some expenditure of money on the part of these \ncountries to essentially do the political, economic, and military \ninventory they need to be able to determine whether or not they can \nmeet the criteria. This is what it is. This is prep money to get them \nup and running to make their case.\n  So, we are going to be doing here for the Baltics--and I share my \nfriend's view--and for Romania, what we did for Slovenia, for Hungary, \nfor the Czech Republic, and for Poland.\n  I respectfully suggest, now that our friend from Washington is on the \nfloor as well, that there be consideration of amending their amendment \nto add Bulgaria. Let me explain why.\n  I stated earlier on this floor that I was pleased that the Clinton \nadministration decided to support the first three countries mentioned \nin the first round. In our meetings we had an opportunity to make our \ncase to the President as to who we thought should be invited to final \naccession negotiations at Madrid next month. I was disappointed, quite \nfrankly, that the administration decided not to push Slovenia in the \nfirst round. After discussion with the President and his advisers, \nhowever, I am absolutely confident that Slovenia will make it in the \nsecond round, and I am confident that Romania will too.\n  For everybody to understand, we are not just talking about a one-time\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\nevent. NATO enlargement is an evolving process. Every European \ndemocracy, theoretically, is eligible. Probably the Baltics elicit more \nsupport than any other area of Europe, for the reasons stated by my \nfriend.\n  With that in mind, the Senator's amendment designates Lithuania, \nLatvia, Estonia, and Romania to join Poland, the Czech Republic, \nHungary, and Slovenia to be eligible for receiving assistance to prep \nthem for future membership in NATO. They have established democracies, \nmade courageous reforms to create free-market economies, are putting \ntheir armies under civilian control, and deserve our support.\n\n  Another Eastern European country that deserves inclusion in this \namendment to let them get prepped and make their case is Bulgaria. \nAfter having gotten off to a very slow start toward democracy after the \nWall came down, it has now voted the post-Communists out of office. The \nnew Bulgarian administration has begun free-market economic reforms, \nand recently the Bulgarian Parliament went on record as naming NATO \nmembership as its primary foreign policy goal.\n  Madam President, over the centuries, Bulgaria has been the most pro-\nRussian country in Europe. So these changes are truly noteworthy. \nBulgaria is not as far along the path to NATO membership as the other \nfour countries named in Senator Durbin's amendment, but they have made \na definitive break with the past, and the democrats in Sofia, I think, \ndeserve our support and encouragement to move further.\n  I will not push my second-degree amendment now. Before we vote on \nthis, however, or before the chairman makes a decision, I would like \nthem seriously to consider, while the Senator from Washington is making \nhis case, whether or not we should include Bulgaria.\n  As the Senator found in traveling to the Baltics, what I found, \nwhether I was in the Balkans or whether I was in Central or Eastern \nEurope, that the prospect of becoming a member of NATO has a \nsignificant positive impact on whether they establish a market economy, \nwhether they move away from the Communist-controlled apparatchiks who \nare left over, and whether or not they embrace a foreign policy that \nlooks to the West rather than to the East.\n  So I would ask for his consideration.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There was a Senator from Illinois many years ago named \nEverett Dirksen who said on another totally unrelated issue that \n``There is nothing more pregnant than an idea whose time has come.'' \nThe idea of NATO expansion, the idea of involving former Soviet \nclients, allies and republics into a new peace-seeking alliance is an \nidea whose time has come.\n  I would certainly defer to the Senator's request and be happy to add \nan amendment in the second degree and hold my amendment at the desk \nuntil we accomplish that. The inclusion of Bulgaria would be a very \npositive addition.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  I will check with my chairman to see if he agrees with that.\n  In the meantime, I see our friend from the State of Washington is \nhere, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. What is the question before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Before the Senate is the Durbin amendment No. \n378.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 379\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that Estonia, Latvia, and \n     Lithuania should be integrated into the North Atlantic Treaty \n                             Organization)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, with the indulgence of the Senator from \nIllinois and the two managers of the bill, I should like to ask \nunanimous consent to set that amendment aside and send up another \namendment sponsored jointly by the Senator from Illinois and myself, \nsimply in order to broaden the discussion of this present subject as it \nis on the present subject with the hope of eventually following the \nsuggestion of the Senator from Delaware and perhaps consolidating this \nset of ideas into a single amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GORTON. With that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe present amendment be set aside and that the amendment I send to the \ndesk be immediately considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, and Mr. D'Amato, proposes an amendment numbered 379.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XVI, insert following:\n\n     SEC.    . ADMISSION OF ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITHUANIA INTO \n                   NATO.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania \n     are undergoing a historic process of democratic and free \n     market transformation after emerging from decades of brutal \n     Soviet occupation.\n       (2) Each of the Baltic countries has conducted peaceful \n     transfers of political power since 1991.\n       (3) The governments of the Baltic countries have been \n     exemplary in their respect for human rights and civil \n     liberties and have made great strides toward establishing the \n     rule of law.\n       (4) The governments of the Baltic countries have made \n     consistent progress toward establishing civilian control of \n     their military forces and, through active participation in \n     the Partnership for Peace and the peace support operations of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (in this resolution \n     referred to as ``NATO''), have clearly demonstrated their \n     ability and willingness to operate with the forces of NATO \n     nations and under NATO standards.\n       (5) Each of the Baltic countries has made progress toward \n     implementing a free market system which has and will continue \n     to foster the economic advancement of the people of the \n     Baltic region.\n       (6) The Baltic region has often been a battleground for the \n     competing territorial designs of nearby imperial powers \n     which, along with other factors, has contributed to a history \n     of insecurity and instability in the region.\n       (7) NATO has been a force for stability, freedom, and peace \n     in Europe since 1949.\n       (8) NATO has indicated it will begin to invite new members \n     in 1997.\n       (9) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, exercising their \n     inherent right as participating states in the Organization \n     for Security and Cooperation in Europe, have voluntarily \n     applied for membership in NATO.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are to be commended for \n     their progress toward political and economic liberty and \n     meeting the guidelines for prospective NATO members set out \n     in chapter 5 of the September 1995 Study on NATO Enlargement;\n       (2) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania would make an \n     outstanding contribution to NATO if they become members;\n       (3) eventual extension of full NATO membership to Estonia, \n     Latvia, and Lithuania would make a singular and lasting \n     contribution toward stability, freedom, and peace in the \n     Baltic region.\n       (4) upon satisfying the criteria for NATO membership, \n     Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should be invited to become \n     full members of NATO at the earliest possible date; and\n       (5) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should be invited to \n     attend the NATO summit in Madrid on July 8 and 9, 1997.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, the thrust of this amendment is to \nencourage the inclusion of the three Baltic Republics, Estonia, Latvia, \nand Lithuania, in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the \nearliest practicable date. It is similar to the proposal already made \nby the Senator from Illinois, which is directed more at the time of \npreparation; this one, with that ultimate goal.\n  I think that, in the most profound sense, this is not a highly \ncontroversial matter. The President has stated that the goal of the \nUnited States in the present round is to admit three highly qualified \nnations, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary, to NATO. I want \nsimply to say at this point that I enthusiastically support that policy \non the part of the President and will certainly vote to ratify any \ntreaty to that effect.\n  I share some of the disappointment of the Senator from Delaware, with \nwhom I previously discussed this subject in private, that the first \nround is not more expansive than it seems likely to\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\nbe. I tend to fall on the side of those European allies of ours who \nwould admit Slovenia at the very least and perhaps Romania as well. \nNevertheless, any step forward in bringing thoroughly into the fold of \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization and therefore into first class \nmembership in the basically Western European and North Atlantic \ncommunity is a consummation that is devoutly to be sought by all of us.\n  My particular amendment, and that of the Senator from Illinois, is \nfocused on three nations collectively, not as large in population as \nthe smallest of the three nations that are about to be admitted to \nNATO.\n  The three Baltic nations have a unique role in European history, in \nsome respects a uniquely tragic role in that each of them in modern \ntimes stood as an independent nation only for roughly 20 years. Between \nthe end of World War II, 1939, 1940, they lost their independence until \neach of them regained that independence in the early 1990's.\n  They are unique as well, madam President, in the sense that it is \ngreatly to the credit of the United States of America that this Nation \nalmost alone of all of the nations of the world never formally \nrecognized the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the \nSoviet Union. For the better part of half a century, there were tiny \nembassies here in Washington, DC, representing what seemed, I suspect, \nto most the vain hope that at some distant future day those nations \nwould once again meet their own aspirations and become independent.\n  I always agreed with this policy. It was policy that was followed by \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt, by President Truman, by President \nEisenhower, by President Kennedy, by President Johnson, by President \nNixon, by President Ford, by President Carter, by President Reagan, \ninto the administration of President Bush, at which point that \nindependence and freedom became a reality.\n  I had the great honor, Madam President, a number of years ago of \nhaving been invited to address the Congress of Estonia, the first, and \nillegal under Soviet law, calling together a group of people in Estonia \nto begin that process of independence. It is a mark of the opposition \nin the then Soviet Union to that independence that I was not granted a \nvisa and was unable to make that speech in Tallinn. I made the speech, \nhowever, from the floor of this United States Senate, Madam President, \nand sent the videotape to Estonia. As I was told afterward, it made a \ngreater splash, greater showing than if I had actually been able to be \nthere in person.\n  So I have this particularly close feeling for the people of Estonia \nand for its independence. It was several years later that I was first \nable to visit that country. But I know what each of these other \nSenators on the floor knows, that the people of those tiny nations \nregard themselves as integral parts of our Western European North \nAtlantic civilization.\n  Their foreign policy can be summed up in a desire to join the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization. Yes, a major part of this is a feeling \nthat their physical security will be enhanced by being a part of NATO. \nAnd, yes, in some sense it will be. But I believe more than that, the \npsychological value felt by the people of those nations, freed after \nalmost half a century of being occupied, frozen in place by a Soviet \ndictatorship, is equal to whatever the formal security arrangements \nwill be.\n  I believe that nothing could be more in the tradition of the United \nStates of America, that from 1940 until early in the 1990's never \nrecognized that these nations had lost their independence, than to \ninvite these three small nations as quickly as possible to be a part of \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  Obviously, they are not on this list for the first round. If in fact \na second round is limited to, say, Slovenia and Romania, they will not \nbe a part of the second round either. I do believe, however, Madam \nPresident, that it is important for us here in the U.S. Senate to \nrecognize that these aspirations take place because of the tremendous \nadmiration the people of those countries have for the United States and \nfor all we have stood for during their long decades of darkness.\n\n  So I hope, and I hope fervently, that in the course of the next 24 \nhours the group of Senators here on the floor can reach an \naccommodation pursuant to which that aspiration on the part of the \npeople of these three small nations will be recognized in this bill by \nthe time that we have passed this bill. The House of Representatives \nhas already done so in slightly different language than my amendment or \nthe amendment from the Senator from Illinois.\n  One of my suggestions might be that we try to create parallel \nlanguage so that each of the Houses of Congress has passed exactly the \nsame thought.\n  I am, however, quite flexible on how we go about granting this degree \nof recognition and support. But I do think that for the future of \ndemocracy, for the future of small countries who so long aspired to be \nfree, and now with our help are free, that this recognition should be \ngranted.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am a cosponsor of the Senator's amendment. I spoke to \nthis issue before his arrival on the floor, and I will not belabor the \npoint. I will say, for colleagues who are wondering what role the \nsmaller states play, Senator Gorton and I coauthored two amendments. My \namendment asks that the Baltic States and Romania be considered in \nterms of funds for preparation to be part of NATO. The amendment then, \ncoauthored by the Senator and myself and presently pending before the \nSenate, says--and I think this is important--``upon satisfying the \ncriteria for NATO membership, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should be \ninvited to become full members . . .'' So it is a two-step process.\n  I think both amendments are consistent, coauthored by the same two \nSenators, because we believe that given the funds, given the \nopportunity, the Baltic States, Romania, and perhaps Bulgaria added by \namendment, could certainly then apply as eligible for membership.\n  I join with my colleague from Washington in saying that at this \nmoment I hope the United States will lead the way in saying that the \nBaltic States, subjugated to Soviet tyranny for half a century, would \nhave that moment they are praying for, full membership in NATO.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding and including me in this important \namendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my friend from Illinois. He has put this case \nextremely eloquently both in private and in public. I am delighted to \nbe joined with him.\n  I hope that the two managers of this bill will be in some form able \nto accommodate the thought that I believe is very widely held in this \nbody and throughout the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand there are amendments pending. I ask \nunanimous consent the pending amendments be laid aside so it will be in \norder for me to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 380\n\n (Purpose: To delete section 1145, which limits the remedial authority \n                of the Foreign Service Grievance Board)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 380.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  On page 96, delete lines 1 through 12.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, this amendment would delete section \n1145 in the bill, the section which purports to clarify the remedial \nauthority of the Foreign Service Grievance Board, but which in effect \nlimits the remedial authority of the Foreign\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\nService Grievance Board. I am frank to say I hope we will not do that.\n  The section in question would expressly limit the remedial authority \nof the Foreign Service Grievance Board to those actions specified in \nsection 1107(b) of the Foreign Service Act.\n  Now, as I understand the Department's thinking in this matter, they \nbelieve it is necessary to prevent the Board from relying on other \nstatutes as authority for directing remedies that are not contained \nwithin section 1107(b) of the act. Those would include the award of \nliquidated damages in cases that fall under the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, and compensatory damages in discrimination cases.\n  Section 1101(a) of the Foreign Service Act provides the Grievance \nBoard with jurisdiction in cases alleging the violation, \nmisinterpretation, or misapplication of applicable law. Thus Congress \nhas given the Foreign Service Grievance Board the authority to decide \ngrievances under other laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act and \nthe equal employment opportunity laws.\n  It would seem to me that if we have given them the authority to \ndecide grievances under these other laws, that it was our intention \nthat the Board would have the authority to provide the remedies \navailable under those laws. And those remedies, in particular, are the \nliquidated damages available under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the \ncompensatory damages under the EEO laws.\n  In other words, the Grievance Board ought to retain the authority to \nprovide remedies under the laws over which it has jurisdiction.\n  Of course, first a grievant must be successful in pressing a claim. \nThe question is, having won the grievance, what remedies are available?\n  Now, the Foreign Service Grievance Board's own regulations provide \nbroad remedial authority. If the Board finds that a grievance is \nmeritorious, the Board is authorized to ``take any corrective action'' \nit deems appropriate that is not contrary to law or the applicable \ncollective bargaining agreement.\n  Furthermore, the act requires the Foreign Service Grievance Board to \napply the substantive law that would be applied by the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission for all grievances alleging a violation of the \nequal employment opportunity laws.\n  If the Grievance Board is directed to apply the substantive law that \nwould be applied by the EEOC, I see no reason in the world why it would \nnot be able to apply the remedy that would be available to an EEO \naction. In other words, I am just trying to ensure that the Grievance \nBoard is able to provide appropriate remedies.\n  These remedies, liquidated damages and compensatory damages, are \navailable under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the EEO laws, and \nthose laws have no exemption in them for the Department of State or \nother foreign affairs agencies. Nor do they provide any rationale for \nexcluding the foreign affairs agencies from laws with which that every \nother Federal agency must comply.\n  I am fearful that by denying or limiting the remedial authority of \nthe Foreign Service Grievance Board, the effect of section 1145 would \nbe to require those with grievances to go into court, or through the \nEEOC, rather than through the grievance procedure, because the \ngrievance procedure would not be able to provide them full relief. I \ncan't believe that this is the kind of arrangement we want to have.\n  It seems to me that it makes eminent good sense that the Grievance \nBoard, which has the authority to apply these other statutes in its \nsubstantive determinations, ought to have the authority to provide \nremedies to correct violations. The limitation that is sought to be \nplaced on the remedial authority of the Board would unfairly \ndisadvantage foreign service officers with grievances, whose cases may \nbe quite legitimate.\n  This is an important issue for people with grievances, and I think we \nmust be careful in working out the statutory arrangements by which they \nhave their grievances resolved. For the life of me, I don't understand \nwhy we would deny to the Board the remedial authorities that I have \noutlined here. I hope that the managers of the bill will find this \namendment acceptable.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I apologize to my colleague. I was on the \nphone. If he could give me a second to catch up with my staff on what \nthe Senator just had to say before I attempt to answer him. I apologize \nfor not being here while he spoke. If he has a second amendment, he can \ngo ahead and we may be able to work this out. Let me check.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I appreciate the response of one of the managers of the \nbill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, rather than take the time of the Senate, \nI think the suggestions made by the Senator are appropriate, and I \nwould be happy to--and my colleague from North Carolina indicates he \nwould also--accept the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 380) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask again that the pending \namendments be set aside in order to be able to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 381\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify which management officials are prohibited from \n                participating in collective bargaining)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 381.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at an appropriate point in the bill a new section as \n     follows:\n\n     SEC.  . LIMITATIONS ON MANAGEMENT ASSIGNMENTS.\n\n       Section 1017(E)(2) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 \n     U.S.C. 4117(e)(2)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(ii) and \n     paragraph (1)(B), the term `management official' does not \n     include chiefs of mission, principal officers or their \n     deputies, administrative and personnel officers abroad, or \n     individuals described in section 1002(12) (B), (C), and (D) \n     who are not involved in the administration of this chapter or \n     in the formulation of the personnel policies and programs of \n     the Department.''.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment would add a section to \nthe bill to clarify a previous action taken by the Congress, which, in \neffect, was too broad, too expansive, and caused unnecessary \ndifficulties. I support the general purpose of the existing law, which \nwas to prevent conflicts of interest in negotiating management-labor \ndisputes. I am in favor of trying to deal with that problem. But it now \nappears that we went too far in trying to do so.\n  The amendment I am now offering would narrow the definition of \n``management official'' to a more appropriate group. A similar \nprovision, I believe, was included in the companion to this bill \nrecently adopted by the House of Representatives.\n  Let me briefly try to outline the situation. In the early 1990s, the \nCongress amended the 1980 Foreign Service Act, placing restrictions on \nthe movement of foreign service personnel between certain positions in \nthe American Foreign Service Association, which is the organization \nthat represents foreign service employees, and management jobs in the \nforeign affairs agencies. The Act was amended to prohibit any \nindividual who served as an agency management official or confidential \nemployee during the preceding 2 years from participating in the \nmanagement of the American Foreign Service Association for the purposes \nof collective bargaining or representing them in such bargaining. And, \nconversely, any individual who had participated in AFSA management for \nthe purposes of collective bargaining, or who represented AFSA at the \nbargaining table,\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\nis precluded, for 2 years, from serving as a management official or \nconfidential employee. So for 2 years, such officials could not move in \neither direction.\n  I have no quarrel with the purpose of that amendment, which was to \nprohibit a foreign service employee from moving from one side of the \ntable to the other in labor-management negotiations. However, I think \nthe definition of ``management,'' as we try to deal with this problem \nthat is currently in the law, is too broad because it can encompass \nofficials who play no role in labor-management relations or the \nformation of personnel policy.\n  This broad definition creates an obvious problem for people who might \notherwise want to participate in the American Foreign Service \nAssociation and hold responsible positions in that organization. If \nthey become officers in AFSA, and then in that capacity participate in \nlabor-management relations--which in many instances is part of the \njob--they would be precluded from a whole range of potential posts \nwithin the agencies.\n  The amendment I am offering would narrow the definition of \n``management official'' by exempting chiefs of mission, principal \nofficers or their deputies, administrative and personnel officers \nabroad, who are not involved--I emphasize ``not involved''--in the \nformulation of the personnel policies and programs of the Department.\n  In other words, we would continue the protection against conflicts of \ninterest by covering only those officials who are involved in labor-\nmanagement relations or personnel policies and programs. And so a \nforeign service officer who is in any way involved with those issues on \nbehalf of the Department may not move into an AFSA position involving \nthose issues for 2 years.\n  Likewise, someone who has served in an AFSA position that involves \nlabor-management relations may not take a management position in a \nforeign affairs agency for 2 years that would involve these issues. But \nthis amendment would not prohibit, for instance, someone who was an \nofficer in AFSA from becoming a Deputy Assistant Secretary in a \nregional bureau that has nothing to do with developing personnel \npolicies or programs.\n  At the moment, the broad limitation has a rather chilling effect on \npeople who are willing to assume a responsible role in AFSA. They say \nto themselves, ``If I do that, for 2 years I am blocked out of taking a \nwhole host of positions in the foreign affairs agencies.'' Of course, \nAFSA represents the employees in all of the foreign affairs agencies. \nIts officers are being prevented from taking a wide range of subsequent \nassignments.\n  I don't think this was the intent of the statute. I agree with the \nbasic effort to preclude any conflict of interest, and this amendment \nin fact accepts the proposition that you ought not to be able to go \nfrom one side of the bargaining table to the other. But my amendment \nseeks to limit the current provision's coverage so that it does not \nexclude former AFSA officers from responsible positions in the foreign \naffairs agencies that really don't involve the bargaining table. That \nis the amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think the point my friend makes is a \nvalid one. I don't think it was our intention to have this blanket \nexemption. As I understand the Senator's amendment--and, obviously, the \nchairman is checking this out himself for his position--from my \nperspective, it seems to make sense.\n  I want to ask a question. Where there is the potential for a direct \nconflict--that is, if I were representing the employees on one side of \nthe table, then I were to shift to a policy position or a management \nposition that had jurisdiction over the very issues I was negotiating, \nI would still be precluded from taking that management position; but if \nI were to go off to be the economic counselor to the Embassy in Paris, \nor in Beijing, I would not be precluded, is that right?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That's right. You would be prohibited, for 2 years, \nfrom shifting over into a position that involved labor-management \nrelations or developing personnel policy. So you could not just go over \nto the other side.\n  Mr. BIDEN. What is happening now, as I understand what the Senator is \nsaying, is a very talented, hopefully ambitious, Foreign Service \nofficer who may very well want the opportunity to have those positions \nfilled--for example, the economic consular in the Embassy in Beijing--\nmay not take the time to fill the position representing the union; that \nhe or she would be precluded from any reasonable prospect for \nadvancement for 2 years after they leave that position for a practical \nmatter.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is the basic thrust of it. I am not sure the \neconomic counselor is the right example because I don't think that is \ncovered right now. But currently, as I understand it, you couldn't \nbecome a chief of mission or deputy chief of mission.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Which is, of course, a very important stepping stone on \nthe career of a Foreign Service officer. I take it that currently, the \nDCM is regarded as a ``management official.'' Even though the deputy \nchief of mission is not involved in labor-management negotiations, or \nin developing department-wide personnel policies, he or she does \nadminister an Embassy.\n  So the question then is, should you keep someone who has been an \nofficer in the Foreign Service Association from being able to accept \nsuch a position? I don't think we should. I do think they should be \nprohibited from becoming involved with labor-management negotiations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Based on what I understand the amendment intends to do, as \nthe staff informs me, I personally don't have any objection, nor I am \ntold does the chairman.\n  So I urge that we accept the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 381) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the manager of the bill for his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 382\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a substitute for title XXII relating to United \n                       Nations arrears payments)\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana (Mr. Lugar) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 382.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Beginning on page 180, line 1, strike all through page 198, \n     line 20, and insert the following:\n\n                TITLE XXII--ARREARS PAYMENTS AND REFORM\n\n              CHAPTER 1--ARREARAGES TO THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n     SEC. 2211. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Department of State for payment of arrearages owed by the \n     United States to the United Nations and its specialized \n     agencies as of September 30, 1997--\n       (1) $409,500,000 for fiscal year 1998; and\n       (2) $409,500,000 for fiscal year 1999.\n       (b) Limitations.--Amounts made available under subsection \n     (a) are authorized to be available only--\n       (1) to pay the United States share of assessments for the \n     regular budget of the United Nations (excluding the budgets \n     of the United Nations specialized agencies);\n       (2) to pay the United States share of United Nations peace \n     operations; and\n       (3) to pay the United States share of United Nations \n     specialized agencies.\n       (c) Availability of Funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to subsection (a) are authorized to remain available until \n     expended.\n       (d) Congressional Notification.--Before the disbursement of \n     funds under this section, the Secretary of State shall notify \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives at least 15 days in \n     advance in accordance with the procedures applicable to \n     reprogramming notifications under section 634A of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered strikes \nTitle XXII, which is the portion of the\n\n[[Page S5673]]\n\nlegislation that deals with payments of arrears to the United Nations \nand reform of the United Nations.\n  I offer this amendment fully respectful and cognizant of the \nremarkable work achieved by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator \nHelms, and the Ranking Member, Senator Biden, in negotiating on behalf \nof members of the committee a comprehensive bill with regard to the \norganization in the State Department and other foreign affairs \nagencies, in addition to the matters relating to the United Nations \nthat are the subject of my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I want to discuss very broadly today why I take this \noccasion to offer this amendment because the timeframe for \nconsideration is necessarily very short. The markup in our committee \noccurred just last Thursday. The debate today on the floor is occurring \non Monday, and presumably we will have votes on these and other issues \non Tuesday, tomorrow. Therefore, Senators and their staff will need to \nunderstand issues quickly in order to make a judgment on what I believe \nis a monumental turning point in American foreign policy, and perhaps \none of the most serious foreign policy debates that we will have this \nyear.\n  I ask, first of all: Why have we come to such a point? By that, I \nmean why and how could the United States have come to owe hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to the United Nations? It did not occur overnight. \nAs I will illustrate in the course of my remarks, the amounts we owe \nare, in most respects, not to the United Nations organization per se. \nIndeed, again and again I will reiterate that only about 5 percent of \nour arrears are actually owed to the United Nations. Well over $650 \nmillion of the money is owed to other countries in which the United \nNations is merely a passthrough largely to these countries for \nreimbursement of past peacekeeping expenses.\n  So the debts that we owe are to Great Britain, to France, to Germany, \nto Italy, and to a host of friends and allies of the United States. We \nhave accumulated debts to them largely because of their peacekeeping \nactivities that we voted for. Our country frequently took the position \nthat we were not in a position nor did we wish to send Armed Forces to \nvarious areas in which the United Nations, with our votes, decided to \ntry to keep the peace. Therefore, our agreement in these cases was to \npay money while other nations sent their forces, and on some occasions \ncontributed money also.\n  I mention this point because for several years there has been an \nassumption on the part of many Members of this body and of the House--\nperhaps even of the Presidential administration--that the U.N. had very \ngreat problems. As a matter of fact, many Members from time to time \nhave suggested a lack of general support for the United Nations, \nsuggesting that it impinged on our sovereignty, and on our ability to \nconduct foreign policy in a straightforward way. In fact, Mr. \nPresident, I submit that a great number of Americans not confined to \nthis Chamber have come to a psychology that the United Nations has been \npreying upon us; that somehow an organization located in our country, \nin New York City, has been imposing insuperable demands upon us and \nthey resent that. And, because of our resentment, so this argument \ngoes, we ought to reform the U.N; we ought to teach it a lesson; we \nought to deprive it of money; we ought to make editorial views of those \nactivities we think are not very good, even those that we have voted \nfor; and that by depriving the United Nations of money change its \ncourse, we indicate that we really do not wish to participate at all.\n  Mr. President, I think we are coming to a much more crucial point in \nthis debate than simply whether we will pay the arrears--the money that \nwe owe. I think Senators will fundamentally have to determine: Should \nwe continue to be a part of the United Nations? Because, if in fact the \nUnited Nations is deprived of the funds that we owe and other nations \ntake our lead and are not prepared to pay either for diverse reasons of \nforeign policy it is apparent that the United Nations will be severely \nweakened. As a matter of fact, it will be less and less effective, if \neffective at all.\n\n  So, Mr. President and Members, I think at the outset as we come to an \nunderstanding of how we got to this point, we have to decide: Do we \nreally want the United Nations to be a forceful advocate for peace, for \njustice, an instrument of our foreign policy, and a group of nations in \nwhich we play a vital role as members of the Security Council with veto \npower from the beginning of the San Francisco Charter? Do we want this? \nIf we do, we are going to have to not only try to shape up the United \nNations but shape up our own views and our own activities as a member \nState--our own leadership, as a matter of fact--if the United Nations \nis to be effective.\n  I come out on the side of one who believes that we ought to be active \nand vital in the United Nations; that, as a matter of fact, the United \nNations plays an important part in our foreign policy; that it is \nextremely important to our overall security in the world; and, that it \nis an organization in which we play a leading role which ought to be \nsupported by us as opposed to constricted by us, demeaned by us, and \ncriticized by us. Given an opportunity, it seems, that the Congress has \nagain and again not only tried to inhibit the United Nations but, as a \nmatter of fact, may finally succeed in killing it off, if we are not \nthoughtful.\n  Mr. President, if Members believe that these are the views of their \nconstituents in a representative democracy, eventually the U.N. will \nreceive the brunt of those attacks. But I would suggest that the \nAmerican people have different views. As a matter of fact, Members will \nbe interested in polls taken by the Wirthlin group and other polling \ngroups for the United Nations Association. And one question that I \nfound relevant was this one:\n  Considering the problems we are likely to face in the coming years, \nhow important is it for America to be an active part of the United \nNations--an active part--very important, somewhat important, or not \nimportant that America be an active member?\n  Fifty-four percent of Americans said it is very important that we be \nan active member. Another 28 percent said it is somewhat important that \nwe be an active member. Only 12 percent said it is not important, and 6 \npercent had no answer.\n  That is a rather extraordinary breakdown.\n  Mr. President, of 82 percent of Americans, 54 percent are saying it \nis very important to be very active in the United Nations.\n  Then in a Times Mirror poll, they asked: Do you agree or disagree \nwith the following statement: The United States should cooperate fully \nwith the United Nations?\n  On that kind of a question, 65 percent say we should cooperate fully. \nTwenty-nine percent disagree with that proposition.\n  Another question asked: Do you favor or oppose legislation that would \nhave the United States withdraw completely from the United Nations? The \nWirthlin group found again: 22 percent favor withdrawal, 71 percent \noppose withdrawal, and 7 percent had no answer.\n  On still another quesiton, overall, do you think that in the long run \nefforts to strengthen the U.N. would be a good investment or not a good \ninvestment? This is the program on international policy attitudes poll.\n  Sixty-eight percent of Americans said good investment, and 28 \npercent, not a good investment.\n  Now we come to the crux of our issue today, Mr. President.\n  The question posd was: Do you favor or oppose the United States \npaying its U.N. dues in full? Do you feel that way strongly or somewhat \nstrongly?\n  Thirty percent favor strongly our paying our dues in full. Twenty-\neight percent favor somewhat. Thirteen percent oppose somewhat, and 16 \npercent oppose strongly.\n  Adding together those figures, Mr. President, you once again get \nabout the same 2-to-1 ratio. Fifty-eight percent believe that we ought \nto pay in full, and 29 percent do not.\n  By 2 to 1 the American public believe that we ought to be paying our \nfair share and our full share.\n  Interestingly enough, another qustion asked: Do you believe that U.N. \nmember states should always pay their full dues to the U.N. on \nschedule, or should a state hold back its dues to pressure other \nmembers to agree to changes that it believes are needed? Again, the \nWirthlin poll. Mr. President,\n\n[[Page S5674]]\n\nin 1989, 60 percent of Americans said we should always pay. In April \n1996, 78 percent said members should always pay.\n  I find that interesting, Mr. President.\n  The evolution of the American people with regard to the United States \nmeeting its obligations has led to a much higher percentage of \nAmericans saying that member states should always pay.\n  Honor U.N. peacekeeping--the basic reason that we are here today, as \na general rule, when it is necessary to use military force to deal with \ntrouble spots in the world--Do you feel more comfortable having the \nUnited States contribute to a U.N. military action or for the United \nStates to take military action by itself?\n  Sixty-nine percent said U.N. military action while 24 percent said \nU.S. action alone.\n  Do you think peacekeeping should be a high priority of the United \nNations' system; somewhat of a priority; or not a priority? The \nWirthlin group poll again: 75 percent of Americans in April 1996 said a \nhigh priority, somewhat of a priority said 17 percent, and not a \npriority, only 6 percent.\n  Mr. President, I shall not recite further polling data except to make \nthe observation that by fairly large ratios of about 2 to 1, or larger \nthan that, Americans believe that we ought to participate in the U.N.; \nthat we ought to pay our dues on time; that all nations should pay \ntheir dues on time; that peacekeeping operations are very important for \nthe United Nations to conduct.\n  I mention that because it appears to me that most Members may not be \naware to whom we owe the money.\n  I would just simply point out, Mr. President, and I take this \nopportunity to cite precisely the countries to whom we believe we owe \nmoney. They may have different views as to how much we owe, but there \nis general agreement between the administration and the Foreign \nRelations Committee to have come up with the figure of $819 million to \nbe authorized and appropriated in one form or another. We have agreed \nthat the U.S. portion of that debt is more than one-third.\n  Using that ratio, France is owed by the United States $60.1 million; \nGreat Britain is owed $41 million; the Netherlands, $21.3 million; \nPakistan, $20.1 million; Germany, $18.3 million; Belgium, $17.3 \nmillion; Italy, $17.2 million, $16.1 million to India; $14.2 million to \nour neighbor Canada, and a long list of countries with smaller sums \nthan that, all owed by the United States, with the United Nations \nmerely a passthrough to them.\n  Mr. President, it is clear, at least in my judgment, that we owe the \nmoney, that it is clear to whom we owe the money, but it is not at all \nclear whether the money is likely to be repaid.\n  Now, I mention this because we had a debate in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee markup on Thursday and the assertion was made essentially, \nand the press has picked up this story largely intact, that however you \nlook at this, this provision entails a significant change in the course \nof American foreign policy. Essentially there is now agreement on the \npart of the United States to pay a part of the money we owe.\n  Following the Foreign Relations Committee meeting, Nick Burns, on \nbehalf of the administration, was asked: ``What are you saying to \nSenator Lugar who says that the arrears are contractual obligations of \nthe United States and should not be the subject of conditions?'' Mr. \nBurns punts the issue, in my judgment. He says:\n\n       Well, I think President Clinton and Secretary Albright have \n     been very clear for as long as they have been in office that \n     we do not like being the largest donor--that is, debtor--to \n     the United Nations. In fact--\n\n  Mr. Burns says, and I am quoting--\n\n     we have called ourselves publicly the largest deadbeat debtor \n     to the United Nations. We don't like that. The American \n     people don't want their Government to be in arrears to any \n     institution, much less the United Nations, but we have an \n     opportunity here to make sure that while we take steps that \n     are costly for us to pay off our arrears, we send forward a \n     very strong signal that reform is important and the reform \n     ought to be followed through.\n\n  Mr. Burns continues.\n\n       We have taken the opportunity and we have not been met with \n     a fundamental objection by Secretary General of the United \n     Nations, Kofi Annan. He has welcomed the progress that has \n     been made this week. He has put forward his own reform \n     proposal. So we don't have a problem with the Secretary \n     General and we certainly would look forward to the continued \n     support of Senator Lugar in this effort.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not certain what that means. Clearly Mr. Burns \ndoes reflect the thought of the administration and most Americans. We \ndo not like to be thought of as a deadbeat country, but he is \nsuggesting, I suppose, that somehow all of that has been finessed this \nweek--a certain amount of reform, a certain amount of payment, the \nSecretary General not giving fundamental objections and a hope that \nsomehow I might be pacified.\n  I was even more intrigued by reports on Saturday in the Washington \nPost and the Washington Times after our Ambassador to the United \nNations, Bill Richardson, was accompanied by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Rod Grams, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee \nand chairman of the subcommittee dealing with international \norganizations. Senator Grams and Ambassador Richardson went to New York \nand had a press conference. I quote from the story by John Goshko in \nthe Saturday, June 14, issue of the Washington Post.\n  John Goshko said:\n\n       They denied Congress wants to micromanage the United \n     Nations and they insisted the plan is not a take-it-or-leave-\n     it proposition. Instead, they said, it is a set of \n     suggestions aimed at helping the United Nations become, as \n     Grams said, the best United Nations it can be.\n       The two officials' assertions that conditions or so-called \n     benchmarks in the plan are only suggestions ran counter to \n     remarks by Senator Helms on Thursday.\n\n  Senator Helms is quoted in the story.\n\n       ``This bill will prohibit the payment--prohibit the \n     payment--``by the American taxpayers of any so-called U.N. \n     arrears until these congressionally mandated benchmarks have \n     been met by the U.N.,'' Helms said.\n\n  Quote again.\n\n       The message to the U.N. is simple but clear: no reform, no \n     American money for arrears.\n\n  On another key point, Mr. Goshko says:\n\n       Washington desires to cut the U.S. share of the U.N. \n     operating budget from 25 percent to 20 percent. Richardson \n     said it would be his job to negotiate with the other members \n     to win such a change. But----\n\n  Says Mr. Goshko--\n\n       Helms used language implying that attainment of that goal \n     is not subject for negotiation.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just say that clearly at some point or other in \nthis debate or on some other occasion, we will have to make up our \nminds. It will be impossible for Ambassador Richardson or my \ndistinguished friend, Senator Grams, to go to New York and indicate, as \nthe Washington Times said, and they quote Senator Grams:\n\n       ``These are broad suggestions.'' At a press conference both \n     men took pains to soften the edges of a bill most here see as \n     a nefarious ``take it or leave it'' offer. Mr. Grams said he \n     plans to spend time at the United Nations this summer selling \n     the package to foreign envoys.\n\n  But at this stage, whether one has the hard version or the soft \nversion, my basic question is: is it likely the money will be repaid at \nall? And that is fundamental. If you buy my premise the United Nations \nis important, that it is important for us to make sure it is beefed up, \nis stronger, is viable as a part of our foreign policy, then, at a \nminimum, this means we must pay our arrears. And those arrears are only \nslightly owed to the U.N. superstructure. Most is owed to our allies \nwith whom we have dealings in many other fora.\n  If, in fact, we pass legislation--and I believe the legislation that \ncame out with regard to Title XXII, the arrears section we are \ndiscussing, leads to so many stipulations, not only micromanagement but \nconditions to a fault, that the likelihood of very much money passing \nto our allies or to the U.N. is very small.\n  The Washington Times article and writer counted as many as 20 \nconditions that would be required. My staff, in analyzing title XXII, \nhas found at least 38. I have discussed briefly some of the major \nconditions, and these are major decisions for the United Nations must \nmake to get its money and to make possible our payment of the arrears \nto our allies. But it is quite a change from dues in which we pay 25 \npercent of the U.N. budget to 20 percent and is quite a move for us to \nget 31 percent dues for peacekeeping down to 25.\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\n  There are many Americans, not simply Senators in this Chamber, who \nwould rather pay less. So I suspect there will not be an argument that, \ngiven your druthers, it would have been fine if our statesmen \nnegotiated a long time ago a U.N. debt for dues for us of 20 percent as \nopposed to 25, or for 25 percent for peacekeeping as opposed to 31.\n  Mr. President, I think we have to recognize that we are saying in \nthis legislation is that unless the rest of the world, the other 183 \ncountries, acquiesce to the United States and arbitrarily lower our \ndues, we will not pay. There may be a suggestion somehow that money is \ngoing to come forward, but unless those two requirements are met, it \ndoes not appear to me possible that payment is likely to occur.\n\n  Now, we add on a number of other conditions such as the fact that \nU.N. conferences can occur in only four cities in the world and the \nrest of the world will have to accept that because we put it in this \nbill and we have said, in essence, we are not going to pay unless each \nof these conditions is met. Perhaps Ambassador Richardson and Senator \nGrams read this legislation in a different way and saw all of this \nlegislation as merely suggestions, sort of ideas that might be kicked \naround up there at the U.N. with our friends. That is not the way the \nbill reads. It says you meet our requirements or there is no money to \npay our past dues. And the distinguished chairman of the committee has \nunderlined that view in his own remarks last Thursday.\n  So, Mr. President, is the money likely to be paid? Probably not. And \nthat means that the debate we are having today is likely to linger. The \nproblem is there will not be as good a time to finally take care of \nthis problem than there is presently. The Budget Committee, those who \nhave been working on the overall reduction to zero deficit in 5 years, \nset aside the money and their plan is for us to pay off. If we do not \nauthorize the money to do that, then it disappears from the table. It \nis unlikely to appear again. I do not suspect that the Congress will be \ninvolved in another 5-year plan for deficit reduction soon. We will \nhave adopted one. We will be in the plan. We can choose to authorize \nthe money and appropriators can finally decide whether to appropriate \nit. But at this point we come up with an option, under 20 conditions or \n38 conditions, or however many you may be able to derive from Title \nXXII, that if we decide not to pay any money, we are going to have a \nproblem, and that is what I want to discuss.\n  Now, what are the problems if we don't pay? I think the problems are \nnot only the inevitable weakness of the U.N., but the quality of our \nrelationships with our allies in the world. Americans may not realize \nthat is the problem we are talking about, our relations with Germany, \nGreat Britain, Italy, with our NATO allies. At other times in other \nfora we are discussing NATO expansion, we are discussing new \nobligations, and arguing how extensive those will be. And most \nAmericans, including myself, who have argued for NATO expansion have \npointed out that we anticipate our obligations will be relatively \nsmall. I accept the estimate of the President of the United States in \nhis London press conference with Prime Minister Blair that we will be \npaying $150 million to $200 million a year. But this implies that our \nEuropean allies will be paying a lot more. The countries coming in will \nhave to pay a great deal to bring their infrastructure up to speed to \nmeet the common defense principles. Essentially, the United States will \ntake the position with regard to NATO expansion that burdensharing \nmeans a very large burden taken on by our European allies for their \ndefense, for the defense of Europe, and we will argue that that is \nperfectly logical; they are the countries most in harm's way and that \nwe already have provided substantial infrastructure in Europe. But the \nstakes are very high and the money sums are very large that we are \ngoing to ask of European allies. Now, what if, in the midst of that \nargument, we still have the U.N. arrears situation? There are Members \nof the Senate arguing: We don't like the United Nations. We think it's \ntop heavy with bureaucrats, that these people are inefficient, that too \nmany come from countries other than our own, that essentially they hold \ntoo many conferences in strange cities all over the world, and we will \nnot pay either the United Nations or our European allies until all of \nthis is terminated--ad seriatim, as you go through and read Title XXII.\n\n  Those negotiations for NATO expansion might be very difficult. I \nsuggest a whole set of other negotiations may be very difficult. I had \nin my office this afternoon a distinguished Austrian statesman. We have \na lot at stake in negotiating on agriculture with Europe, enormous \nsums, in terms of whether we come to agreement on technology, science \nand on export subsidies and export taxes. There is a lot at stake for a \nlot of Americans. Those negotiations are very tough. We are coming up \nto another GATT round in 1999 on agriculture. It is not at all certain \nhow much headway we shall make. But it makes an enormous difference, in \nbillions of dollars of exports, that we make a lot of headway and that \nwe be negotiating with friends in good faith.\n  How in the world can we anticipate useful negotiations on NATO or the \nEuropean agriculture plan or the GATT situation with the very same \ncountries to whom we are, in essence, saying: Sorry, we are not going \nto pay because a number of Senators don't like the United Nations? They \nstill have a billboard mentality which says, ``Get us out of the United \nNations.''\n  Some of us are going to have to say on this floor, ``Not only keep us \nin, but make the U.N. work.'' I certainly subscribe to every reform \nproposal that makes sense at the United Nations, and the Secretary \nGeneral, who is a friend of the United States, subscribes to much of \nthat. I have no doubt if we are a vigorous player in the United \nNations, as opposed to taking the thought that we are being preyed upon \nby a group of nations over whom we have no control. If we are a \nvigorous player, we are going to be able to negotiate changes that are \nsubstantial, and we are going to have to do that in the European \nCommunity with the agricultural plan and with NATO. There is no free \nlunch in this business. The idea that we can, with an ultimatum, say, \n``Take it or leave it,'' and that somehow the United Nations will make \nthese changes to accommodate us, I believe is unrealistic.\n  Mr. President, let us take, hypothetically, one more situation \nsuggested by the distinguished junior Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kerry, during the markup in the Foreign Relations Committee. \nSenator Kerry said, from his experience in dealing with U.N. reform, \nand he has had substantial experience on this topic, he thinks there is \na possibility that all the other 183 countries will acquiesce. They \nwill finally read Title XXII as the Foreign Relations Committee adopts \nit and grudgingly, and with great passion and recrimination and so \nforth, understand that it's lights out for the United Nations if they \ndon't acquiesce to the United States, which they will describe as a \nbully, as a country operating totally outside international norms, as a \ncountry that did not recognize its obligations.\n  That is still another scenario. I gather proponents of the bill think \nthat is the best scenario. The United States wins. We reduce our dues \nunilaterally and our peacekeeping moneys. We managed to bully every \nother nation on Earth into acquiescence on the basis that a United \nNations without us would be unthinkable. I would say, under those \ncircumstances, we still have ahead some mighty rough sledding with \nregard to any other international organizations or negotiations on \ntrade, or NATO, or whatever.\n  The amendment I have offered is a simple solution. It says, in \nessence, that we owe $819 million. We ought to pay it in 2 years, two \nequal installments with no conditions, because we owe it to other \ncountries, essentially. We owe it to some international organizations \nsuch as the Food and Agricultural Organizations, the FAO. We are about \n$100 million behind in our dues payment to them. We are about to lose \nour seat and our vote, even while those of us in agriculture feel it is \nvery important we be at the table. There are consequences for being a \ndeadbeat, for trying to stiff other countries. We ought not do it. We \nought to affirm that the United Nations is important, that we are a \nleading player, that we are the leading player in terms of confidence \nbuilding in international diplomacy, in security arrangements which the \nUnited Nations represents.\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\n  I have offered this amendment as a substitute for the entirety of 18 \npages that contain all of these conditions, an extraordinary array of \npages and language. I am hopeful Members and their staffs will read \nthis before they commit themselves to a vote in favor of this \nprovision.\n  I rise today simply to offer Members an alternative. The \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, has argued with a great deal of skill in the Foreign \nRelations Committee markup, that even if my position is right, even if \nthere is some logic to what I have to say, the fact is the alternative \nwas never my position. The fact is, the very best situation that he was \nable to negotiate with the distinguished chairman of our committee was \nfor 18 pages of title XXII as they now exist. In essence, we are faced \nwith the situation, as I read the logic of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware, of a take it or leave it with the Senate, quite apart \nfrom a take it or leave it with the rest of the world. The implication \nis, if we do not adopt title XXII as negotiated, there is likely to be \nno money, zero money, for the United Nations.\n  But I am suggesting that the outcome of adopting title XXII may very \nwell be zero money for the United Nations, that you get to zero either \nway, that we have not solved the arrears problem, that the headlines \nthat somehow or another the United Nations is about to be revived are \npremature. Or, to state Senator Kerry's position, as I have already: \nSomehow, the United Nations gets the money, they go through all the \nhoops and with all of the resentments, recriminations, and difficulties \nwe have around the world, we pay dearly, a multiple of whatever has \nbeen squeezed out of this process.\n  It is not an easy choice for Senators to make. But that is why I pose \nit in these terms and why I believe it is fundamentally one of the most \nimportant debates that we shall have about foreign policy. It gets to \nthe heart of our relationship with our friends, with the rest of the \nworld, and with the United Nations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I, myself, am in the strangest position I \nhave found myself in, probably, in the 25 years I have been here. I \ndon't disagree with a single thing that my friend from Indiana has \nstated.\n  Let me review the bidding, as I understand it, very, very quickly. \nNo. 1, we have to decide, is the United Nations useful? Is the United \nNations an important instrument in dealing with crises and conflicts in \nthe world? Should we be a part of it? Does it augment our foreign \npolicy? Is it important? Is it vital?\n  In my view, the answer to every one of those questions is a \nresounding yes. As a matter of fact, I went so far, as the fellow with \nwhom I engaged in a political campaign last year repeatedly pointed \nout--I wrote a very long paper, not too long ago, about 4 years ago, \nwhere I wrote that I believed we missed an opportunity for making the \nUnited Nations the centerpiece for the architecture of peace well into \nthe next century. I think it has a capacity far beyond that which we \nare asking of it, and I think it has a capacity that is unparalleled by \nany other potential organization existing or one that I can \ncontemplate.\n  I think we do not spend nearly enough time pointing out what my \nfriend from Indiana has, that 80 percent of the U.N.'s work is helping \ndeveloping countries help themselves. The fact of the matter is, their \nwork includes promoting and protecting democracy and human rights, \ndeveloping effective food distribution and food cultivation strategies, \nassisting disaster victims, helping nations avert military threats by \nproviding a diplomatic floor for dispute resolution. Who else does that \nbesides the United Nations? Where else in the world--where in the world \ncan we possibly go to have any of those functions undertaken?\n\n  Some would say the United States should do that. The very people who \nsay the United States should do that are the very people who, when the \nrubber meets the road, say, ``No, no, no, no, we should not be \ninvolved. We, the United States, should not be involved. We can't be \nthe world's policemen. We can't be expected to do everything.'' I find \nit ironic, the same people say the United Nations isn't worth the \npowder to you know what.\n  So much--all of what the United Nations does, frankly, even though it \nis exasperating and time consuming and frustrating sometimes, is \nclearly in our interest. We rely on the United Nations to provide \nhumanitarian assistance to millions who otherwise would have no source \nof food or shelter. We rely on the United Nations to eradicate disease \nand improve health around the world. And particularly, it is the United \nNations that leads the world in helping children by providing food and \nshelter and by protecting them from the scourge of disease that \nthreatens their health in many parts of the world.\n  We, the United States, rely on the United Nations to handle the \nincreasing flow of refugees across borders and to prevent refugees from \ndevastating and destroying neighboring economies, security, and the \nenvironment. We rely upon the United Nations to counter global crimes. \nThe United Nations coordinates the international cooperation to fight \nterrorism, to counter drug trafficking. We rely on the United Nations \nto facilitate and maintain peace. In short, we rely on the United \nNations in a way that we rely on no other organization. It is \nindispensable.\n  So, that is the place from which we both start. I think it is fair to \nsay our voting records for the last 20 years or so have been almost \nidentical relative to the United Nations. I have not been one who has \nvoted to cut the United Nations.\n  The point that the Senator has made repeatedly and I have made \nrepeatedly is the average American thinks, when we talk about \narrearages we owe the United Nations, they think we owe money to a \nbloated bureaucracy out there that is wasting our money with all of \nthese ghost employees who are doing nothing but subsidizing the economy \nback home and wasting our money and then voting against our interests, \nand that is where the money goes.\n  Hardly any of the money that we owe goes to the Secretariat, goes to \npay salaries at the United Nations, or goes to turn the heat and light \non. The bulk of the money we owe, we owe to our friends for the reason \nmy friend said. We said: Hey, we ain't sending GI Joe. You send your \nguys. You send your guys. We can't be expected to be everywhere. And we \nvote. We have a vote in the U.N. Security Council. If we don't want to \nvote to send anybody there, we can say no, and they don't go. But we \nvote yes because we view it to be in our policy interests, our foreign \npolicy interests. So, who do we owe? We owe France, we owe England, we \nowe Belgium. I have a list right here. I will repeat it. It bears \nrepeating: France, Great Britain, The Netherlands, Pakistan, Germany, \nBelgium, Italy, India, Canada. That is where the bulk of the money is \nwe owe--for peacekeeping.\n  I say to my friend from Indiana, one of the things I tried to note in \nnegotiating this is: I'll tell you what, why don't we just pay all the \npeacekeeping stuff up front? We can sell that to the folks here. Even \nthe those that don't like the United Nations, they like Great Britain, \nthey like Germany. Even the folks that don't like the United Nations \nacknowledge France is an ally. Why don't we just pay them, no strings, \nnothing, pay what we owe, bingo.\n  I even tried to put in an amendment. The Senator used the phrase, \n``pass through.'' In a sense, the United Nations is passing through \nthat money to them. I even came up with language--I should say this \nyoung man on my staff came up with language--to say: Guarantee that the \nmoney just passes through, cannot be diverted to go anyplace else: Pass \nthrough, pay France; pass through, pay Belgium, pass through--et \ncetera.\n  Tried that route. As was pointed out accurately by my friends with \nwhom I was negotiating, ``Hey, look, we realize if you pay our friends, \nthen the pressure is relieved. The pressure is relieved. We're not \nlikely to get these changes we want in the United Nations.''\n  So you are right, this is pressure; you are right. We finally, after \nall these negotiations, which included the administration, said, ``OK, \nwhat do we do? Do we end up essentially emasculating the United \nNations, causing its further''--talk about resentment--``further \nresentment?''\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\n  Let me back up. I apologize to my friend for him having to hear this \nfor the third time from me. I have heard from him as well three times, \nand I welcome hearing 10 more times, because he is right on the merits. \nI was asked if I would have a meeting with the President of the General \nAssembly. I forget how many people he brought along with him, three or \nfour folks representing their countries in the United Nations, their \nAmbassadors.\n  They came down to see me--I am paraphrasing as was stated by the \nspokesperson for the President--as a friend of the United Nations \nseeking my help. We sat around the conference table in my office for, I \ndon't know, an hour, hour and a half. I listened to what they had to \nsay.\n  I said, basically, ``You're right.'' I said, ``Let me get this \nstraight now. You are saying three things to me: One, you acknowledge \nthe United Nations needs some reform and you want that reform to take \nplace anyway and you're going to initiate it. But if we even request, \nif Senator Helms' benchmark includes any of the reforms you have \nalready contemplated you want to do, if it did, then it would make it \nharder for you to do them because people would resent the fact that we \nwere telling you you had to do them.'' I said, ``Do I have that \nstraight?''\n  They said, ``Yes, that's right.''\n  I said, ``Let me get the second point. The second point is you \ndesperately need a demonstration of the board of findings of the United \nStates that we're going to pay our debt, and that you can't wait \nanother year on promises. It is no longer good enough you have a \nPresident who says he is with you and you have a minority of Senators \nwho say they are with you, you need something tangible right now.''\n  ``Yes, that's my second message, Senator.''\n  ``But your third message is: Give us the money with no strings now, \neven if it is not all of it, in order for us to be able to get things \nunderway to demonstrate we will reform in order for you then to have \nenough votes to produce the rest of the money.'' I said, ``So you \nacknowledge it is going to have to be staged, right?''\n  ``Yes.''\n  I said, ``I agree with you, but before you leave, let me ask you a \nquestion. Given your choice, no money and no conditions this year or \nconditions that are consistent with the things you say you want to do \nanyway and you are willing to attempt to do, and significant money this \nyear with a significant commitment for the bulk of the money the next \nyear and the remainder the third year, which do you pick?''\n  They said, ``We pick the conditions and money rather than no money, \nno conditions.''\n  So I sat down with the administration and I said, ``OK, folks, you \nsent up here a proposal for over a billion dollars in 1 year. Got \nanybody to support it besides me?''\n  ``Yeah, we got some other people to support it,'' and named, I \nbelieve your name was taken in vain, I say to Senator Lugar, and a few \nothers.\n  I said, ``Do you think you have enough votes to get that done?''\n  They said, ``No, we don't think so.''\n  ``What do you want me to do? Well, let's see what we can get done.''\n  So I met with the Secretary, and I met with our U.N. Ambassador, our \nformer colleague from the House. I said, ``You have to tell us your \ndrop-dead number''--excuse the expression. ``What is the bottom line on \nthis? If I can't get all you need, what is the bottom line on all this? \nAnd I want to tell you what the conditions are here that Senator Helms \nwants. I don't want any of those conditions, but what ones can you live \nwith and what can't you live with?'' And we began a long, long process \nof negotiating.\n\n  The end result is what you see here. The end result is the \nadministration, whether they are right, wrong or indifferent, told me \non this part of the U.N., they want more. They don't like the \nconditions. They believe the minimum number should be $1.21 billion. \nThey don't believe we owe, by the way, 1 billion 4. They don't agree \nwith that. They don't think we owe that, which is the number everybody \nuses. They say we don't owe that.\n  When the day was done, the Senator from North Carolina made some \nsignificant concessions. That left the Senator from Delaware in a \nposition to say, ``OK, the U.N. says, bottom line, they would rather \nrun the risk of not risking another year of nothing,'' notwithstanding \nthe fact it will cause them serious problems. In turn, I think the \nSenator is right; it is going to cause us additional problems. The \nadministration says we can do it on this amount of money and we can \nmake those conditions work if you stagger the conditions to the end. \n``Give us the bulk of the money upfront and make the hard conditions at \nthe end.'' That is what they said.\n  So we go back to the threshold question: Is the United Nations in our \ninterest? I believe deeply that it is essential--essential--to the \nability to carry a sound foreign policy for this country into the next \ndecade and beyond. OK.\n  Now, what is the best chance of the U.N. continuing to be viable? \nTake a chance on something that the President of the General Assembly \ndoesn't like but acknowledges, given two bad choices, would rather \nhave, take the position the President does not like, our U.N. \nAmbassador does not like but believes can get the job done if that is \nwhat it has to be, or go back to square one, which is debate this on \nprinciple--and I am not belittling and I am not being a smart guy \nsaying that--debate the principle of this for another 4 months or 2 \nmonths or 6 months or a year and leave Ambassador Richardson totally \nempty-handed, with no money, not give the Secretary General anything to \ndemonstrate that we have other than a minority of us and the President \nsaying we will pay, the check is in the mail, or go ahead and do what \nis proposed in this legislation?\n  I honestly believe, unless the administration is fundamentally wrong \nin their calculation, this is in the absolute best interest of the \nUnited States of America and has the greatest prospect of continuing to \nhave the United States viable than any other alternative I can come up \nwith.\n  The next question, it seems to me, is reasonable to ask: OK, Biden, \ngeez, you agree with Senator Lugar, he is your ally, you are in the \nsame boat on this thing, you agree with the principle he is saying, you \ngot this much, why not go along with him and raise it? Maybe if you \nspeak up now, you may get enough votes to get 51 people in this body to \nvote up that number.\n  There is a simple answer to that. It may not be a good answer in the \nminds of most people. The editorial boards of the New York Times and \nothers won't like it, but if I do that, there is no deal. Then we go \nback, not negotiating between 819 and 1 billion 21 or whatever the \nSenator's amendment is going to say precisely, or saying we pay all the \n819 without any conditions and whether we pay the 819 with conditions, \nwe go back to zero versus 1.021, or zero versus 819 and no conditions.\n  I don't suggest that I know any more than my friend from Maryland, \nSenator Sarbanes, and my friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar, but I do \nsuggest I don't know any less about how this place works. I do suggest \nthat paying this over 2 years will be better than over 3, but the issue \nis whether it is over 5 or none when we started this. I do suggest it \nis better to have no conditions than the conditions we have in here, \nbut I suggest it is much worse to have the original conditions than the \nconditions that are in this bill.\n  I have a vast amount of respect for both my colleagues. As my friend \nfrom Indiana will tell you, when I thought that the Senator from North \nCarolina was unwilling to raise the level to the amount that the \nadministration said they needed, I picked up the phone and I called the \nSenator from Indiana, and I called two other of my Republican \ncolleagues on the committee, and I said, ``If I offer an amendment to \nfully fund this,'' or if we offer it, ``can we get it adopted?''\n  In the case of two other Republican Senators, I said, ``If I offer \nit, will you vote for it?''\n  In the case of the Senator from Indiana, I said, ``If we offer it, \nwhat do you think our chances are?''\n  In the meantime, the Senator from North Carolina, the chairman of the \ncommittee, said, ``All right, I will go to the minimum number that the \nadministration says they need, but I won't go any further.''\n  In addition to that, we also were able to get the number up for the \ninternational organization account for this year's State Department \nauthorization\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\nand a lot of other things that the administration wanted.\n  So here we are. I will end where I began, where the Senator from \nIndiana began. This is one of the most important decisions we are going \nto make. The viability of the United Nations and our influence on that \norganization is critical to American foreign policy interests, to the \ninterests of the United States over the next several decades.\n  Strategically, we have not one bit of difference. Tactically, is it \nbetter to get what the administration says they can make work, what the \nSecretary General says he appreciates--the attempt we are making and \ndoesn't know if he will get funding from, but thanks for the effort, \nand what the President of the General Assembly says he would rather \nhave, given two bad choices. Is it tactically better to go that route, \nto ``save the U.N.'' and us in it, or is it tactically better to not go \nthis route, go the route of the amendment of my friend from Indiana, \nand if we win, hope that my friend from North Carolina says, ``Well, I \nlost here on the floor, that's OK by me''? I choose the first tactical \noption for the same strategic reason the Senator from Indiana chooses \nthe second.\n  I had one of my colleagues say, ``You know, you got the chairman to \ngo up to 819. The trouble with you is you just didn't have a tough \nenough bargain. You could have gotten him to go higher. If you just \nheld faster, he would have gone higher.''\n  I respectfully suggest, name me someone else who got the chairman up \nto 819 or even remotely close.\n  There is one other provision I am almost reluctant to raise here, but \none of the provisions the chairman has in this mark is that we get paid \nmoney for our peacekeeping.\n  The administration believes there are moneys owed us as well and \nbelieves the U.N. owes us about $107 million. That is not part of this \nlegislation, but it is part of the calculus. It may end up being a \nfight between OMB and the administration--I mean, within the \nadministration. It may be a fight in some other place if the \nadministration really cares about this. Do not come to me and tell me \nit is easier to get another $107 million from my good friend here and a \nmajority of his colleagues, our colleagues who are his allies, if they \ncannot work out an internal problem within the administration.\n  So we are at least theoretically talking about $925 million versus \n$1.021 billion. We have all been in this business long enough. If, in \nfact, our Ambassador to the United Nations--probably the most skilled \nnegotiator we have ever had in that spot in the history of the United \nNations--if he cannot figure out the difference over 3 years for \nroughly $90 million, then he is not the fellow I worked with in the \nlast decade and a half.\n  Like I said, as one of my colleagues said to me, ``Joe, I've been \nhere too long. I'm not doing this on anything other than on pure \nprinciple anymore.'' Well, that is great. That is great. My honest \nopinion--and that was not said by my friend from Indiana, although he \nis an incredibly principled guy--in my view, tactically, this is the \nsingle best thing that can happen to enhance and give the greatest \nprospect for the outcome that I desire occurring, and that is, a viable \nUnited Nations, with the United States playing a vital role and the \nUnited Nations playing a vital role.\n  Again, every argument made by my friend from Maryland in the \ncommittee and my friend from Indiana in the committee, and here, is \naccurate as it relates to whether or not we are imposing on the United \nNations. We are. I might add, I do not know how they voted, but we \nvoted on legislation that imposed on the United Nations an IG, an \ninspector general. We imposed that on them. I did not hear anybody \nstanding on the floor then saying, ``We are imposing on the United \nNations.'' Maybe somebody did. It sure did not reach this level. It is \nnot new.\n  Some may recall in a previous Republican administration, the \nSecretary General discussed with us reducing our share to 20 percent--\nactually, below 20 percent, between 10 and 15 percent --and the then \nRepublican Secretary of State said, ``No, we don't want to go that low. \nIt will diminish our influence.'' So it is not like we are coming out \nof the blue with a number that cannot possibly be met.\n  Agreed, I do not like doing business this way. If I sign on to a \ncontract, even though the terms turn against me, I stick with the \ncontract until--as our friend from Mississippi, Senator Stennis, used \nto say every time you would look at him--I have one of his letters he \nsent me. He said, ``You got to plow the field to the last furrow, to \nthe end of the road.'' Well, that is how I think contracts work. You \nplow the field to the last furrow, to the end of the road, then \nnegotiate next year's crop, then negotiate how many furrows next year. \nThat is the better way to do it. That is how I am used to doing \nbusiness.\n  Personally, as a Senator, as a legislator, as a man--as a man--this \nfield is not going to have any crops. It is not going to grow anything \nbecause there is no plow in the field right now. We may not have enough \nof a plow to plow the field to the last row, to the last furrow at the \nend of the row, but, boy, we have 99 percent of the field covered.\n  Then, as I said earlier--and I will yield the floor with this--in a \nslightly different context today I said, you know, I am a Senator. That \nmeans I am an optimist. To be a Senator, it seems to me, you have to be \nan optimist. You would not choose this job knowingly if you thought \nthings were not going to turn out.\n  Well, look, 3 years is a long time. Kofi Annan, the Secretary \nGeneral, called me on Friday. I realize that is nothing unique. I am \nnot the only guy that has spoken to him. But he called me. I happened \nto have known him in his former incarnation in the United Nations. He \nis one heck of a guy. And he called and said, ``Joe, I want to thank \nyou for the try.'' He did not say, ``I called and said I think it is a \ngood deal.'' He said, ``I want to thank you.'' I do not recall whether \nhe said it or I said it, but he will hear it, so he will correct me if \nI am wrong. My recollection was that one of us said off the other's \nsentence, ``Three years is a long time.'' And then he said, ``I hope by \nthe end of this year many of the very proposals and reforms you're \nasking for will already be done and maybe that will change some \npeople's minds.''\n\n  The administration only asks for $100 million in fiscal year 1998, \nand this gives them $100 million in fiscal year 1998. The conditions \nthey have to meet are basically zero. They have to promise our \nsovereignty is not in jeopardy, essentially. The second year, the $400 \nmillion and some, the conditions get a little tougher--not very tough. \nThe third year, the last $244 million, that is where the rubber meets \nthe road.\n  The Senator did not want to do it that way. The Senator wanted the \nrubber to meet the road the first date.\n  Is that a fair statement, I say to my friend from North Carolina?\n  He has actually made some genuine, serious concessions. I said, let \nus keep this ball in play. That is my plea. Let us keep the U.N. in \nplay. Get them money now. Start to pay back our debts now. Get it \nunderway now. As I am one of those guys that thinks once you put the \nball in play, we win--we will reach the appropriate outcome.\n  My concern with the approach taken by my friend from Indiana--and he, \nas I said, has been here almost as long as I have; he is a skilled \npolitician in the best sense of the word, as well as a principled, \nknowledgeable legislator--he could be right that the route I am taking \nyou down tactically will not get us to the strategic objective, and \nmaybe the way to do this is call the bluff, call the bluff. But I doubt \nwhether or not even he believes that if we were to prevail, or if I \nwere to abandon this fairly reached deal, that we would likely, at the \nend of the process, be any further along than we were the end of last \nyear.\n  Keep in mind--I want to say it again because I have been absolutely, \ncompletely straight with my friend from North Carolina--if we go to \nconference and they have no money--by the way, unless something \nhappened in the last couple days, they have zero, nothing, for the \nU.N., zero--if this means we go to conference and Biden is expected to \ngo from $819 million to $408,500,000, they have the wrong guy. My \nbottom line is $819 million.\n  So we may not get to there from here even if we do it my way--not my \nway, the way suggested in this legislation. But I respectfully suggest \nno one has laid out for me, and I am anxious to hear it, how we get \nfrom here to there.\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\nAnd the ``there'' is preserving the United Nations, our position within \nit, its viability, credibility, and ours as well.\n  I cannot believe, if the Senator from Indiana were President--and he \nwould have made a good one--and I were the Secretary of State--I doubt \nhe would have picked me--I cannot believe, if he said, ``Joe, you go \nsee Chirac, you go see Blair, you go see Kohl, you work out something \non this arrearages deal with them.'' I cannot believe I could not get \nthat done for him without damaging my relationship with them and \nfiguring out a way at the end of the day--the end of the day, whether \nthat means 3 years or 5 years or 7 years--to pay what we owe.\n  But I do not know how to get from here to there. Were he President \nand I Secretary of State, and he said, ``Joe, go work out a deal with \nthose guys. And, by the way, you have no money. We can't come up with a \nnickel. You go work it out.'' I do not know, folks--I do not know. I \nthink I have a little bit of a greater faith in this administration \nthan my colleagues do, and a little greater faith in the ability of our \nAmbassador to the United Nations to make this work without suffering \nthe consequences that could and may be suffered if this were to pass. \nBut like I said, I have not heard any other idea. And I have been \nworking with this too long to fall on my sword.\n\n  I again close where I opened. I think on the merits--my friend from \nNorth Carolina knows how I feel--I think on the merits my friend from \nIndiana is correct. But I think the merits and the friendship of the \nSenator from Indiana may get me into the girls State championship \nbasketball game in Indiana, maybe, but it will not get me much \nfurther--probably will not even get me there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Since the Senator sought the floor----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Go ahead.\n  Mr. HELMS. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No.\n  Mr. HELMS. How long does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will yield to the chairman, obviously.\n  Mr. HELMS. I understand that. But I respect the Senator from \nMaryland. I want him to have his say.\n  Certainly, Mr. President, I am not going to criticize Senator Lugar. \nI think and hope we have been friends ever since he came here. I have \nmade several statements publicly in his advocacy. I think he will \nacknowledge that. But he is not in a position in which he has to make \njudgments that will lead to either a successful piece of legislation or \nan unsuccessful one, depending on which decision is made.\n  Senator Biden has very eloquently and accurately described the \nprocess by which the committee brought in a lot of views and a lot of \npeople, including the distinguished majority leader, Trent Lott, and \nthe relevant appropriations subcommittee chair Judd Gregg. As I said in \nmy statement earlier, this bill will not represent every provision that \nI want, but I think it is the best legislation for the American people. \nI do not need any pollster to tell me that; in fact, I have found out \nthat the results often depend on who the pollster is taking a poll for \nand what the people who paid for the poll want to accomplish with the \npoll. That certainly is a game that is played in politics constantly.\n  But let me say that speaking, I think, for a sizable percentage of \nthe American people--and not having a poll except the ringing of the \ntelephone in my office and the fax machine grinding constantly and the \nmail by the sackfuls--we do not owe it to the rest of the world to pay \nthe so-called arrearages to the United Nations for peacekeeping, and we \ncertainly do not owe these nickel and dime amounts to our allies or to \nanyone else, for that matter.\n\n  Let me set the record straight just a bit. I do not say this with any \nhostility, but if you think the American people have not been socked \nwith enough taxes to support whatever project or institution that is \nsupported at the moment, let's look at the facts. Since 1950 the United \nStates--that means the American taxpayers--has given other countries \n(free of charge) $120 billion in military assistance through grants and \nloans. In just the past 10 years, the United States paid $40.4 billion \nin military assistance to another set of countries. I have heard no \nmoaning and groaning on this floor about what we owe, but nothing about \nall of the support the U.S. has given.\n  When you add up the low-cost and no-cost loans to the total \nassistance that the American taxpayers have been forced by their \nGovernment--by this Senate, by the House of Representatives, by the \nPresident sitting in the Oval Office on Pennsylvania Avenue --the total \nassistance that the American taxpayers have given out since 1950 \namounts to at least $161 billion--and mind you, that does not include \ninterest that has been forgiven when we didn't seek repayment of loans.\n  In addition, every dime of this has been given away in years when we \ndid not balance the budget. These costs are part of the reason that we \nhave a $5.400 trillion federal debt today. So let me be clear--we long \nhave bankrolled the world, and I will cry tomorrow for those \nambassadors from France and Germany, and even Poland, who say that they \ndo not like what Jesse Helms is doing in the Senate. Well, Jesse Helms \ndoes not like to have to do it, but some of us have reached the point \nthat we have to hold hands tight and work out a deal that will achieve \nlong overdue reforms.\n  Now, this pending bill is the proposition that has been agreed to by \nthe President of the United States, by the Secretary of State, by Joe \nBiden--who is the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee--\nand by countless other distinguished Americans whom we have consulted \nand with whom we have worked.\n  Now, let me tell you something. It is easy to sit back and say, \n``Well, we have got to pay our debts.'' With what and on what schedule? \nAre you going to add it to the federal debt? What are you going to cut \nout of the budget which we have been unable, thus far, to get balanced \nin this body and in the House of Representatives and then signed by the \nPresident?\n  We all hear that there is a coalition of interests, but my primary \ninterest happens to be the people who pick up their lunch pail and go \nto work every morning, who do not know much about Congress. They are \ntrusting us to protect their future and the futures of their children \nand grandchildren. Now, every campaign they are celebrated as the \nreason Joe Candidate and Mary Candidate are running for office, looking \nfor votes. But as soon as the election is over, you do not hear much \nmore except a political speech now and then.\n  Now, I have been on the Foreign Relations Committee quite a while. \nJoe Biden and I held up our hands to take the oath of office on the \nsame day--January 3, 1973, right over in that corner. We have been in \nthe Senate the same length of time. I have enjoyed serving with Senator \nBiden because although he and I seldom agree on fundamental issues, he \nalways shoots straight with me--and I think that he will say that I \nhave shot straight with him. I am a conservative and I am unabashed \nabout it. And Joe, no doubt about it, is a liberal. That is the way it \ngoes in this body.\n  But also on the Foreign Relations Committee some years ago, I think \nin the mid-1980s, one of the bad ladies who served on the committee--\nnow, I am not even going to joke about it. She is one of the sweetest \nladies I have ever known, one of the brightest ladies I have ever \nknown, and one of the most unyielding ladies I have ever known-- and \nher name was Nancy Kassebaum. It is now Nancy Kassebaum Baker because \nshe is the bride of Howard Baker, the former majority leader of this \nSenate.\n  Now, it was, I believe, 1986 an amendment was enacted into law in the \nState Department Authorization Act. And by the way how many \nauthorization bills have been passed since that year? Not many, not \nmany. So the affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. \nPresident, have been handled by the Appropriations Committee until this \nyear and we are endeavoring to have the Foreign Relations Committee \nresume its rightful place in the conduct of foreign affairs. I do not \nthink it ought to be conducted by the Appropriations Committee.\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\n  But in any case, our former colleague from Kansas, the then Nancy \nKassebaum, used a very interesting approach more than a decade ago in \ntrying to get a budget reform at the United Nations. She was so \ndisappointed and so was I with the way the United Nations was being \noperated. Her amendment was enacted into law for the authorization act \nfor fiscal years 1986 and 1987. It explicitly and unilaterally withheld \n20 percent of the U.S. contribution to the United Nations and its \nspecialized agency until voting reforms took place at the U.N. Now, I \nmust ask, what is so unusual about this bill? We are including \nprovisions that require reforms in the same way--by withholding U.S. \ncontributions. I do not know whether Senator Lugar was chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee at that time. If he was, I doubt that he \nvery strongly opposed Senator Kassebaum.\n  But the point is we have so many people who have responsible roles to \nplay in this matter. We are hearing from the President and former \nPresidents, we are hearing from Secretaries of State and former \nSecretaries of State, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, as Yul Brenner \nsaid in ``The King and I.''\n  I have a letter from Bob Dole supporting this plan. I ask unanimous \nconsent it be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. I appreciate the remarks that Senator Lugar has made. But \nI just wish there would be some understanding of what our options are. \nSure, we could watch Senator Lugar talk about it, but we will end up \nwith the Appropriations Committee running for the Senate our role in \nthe foreign policy apparatus.\n  I admire Senator Lugar, always have, always will, and I refuse to get \nin a fuss with him. His amendment is dictating to all those who have \nworked for months to arrive at a consensus piece of legislation how to \ndo things when he does not have any workable alternative. I will still \nrespect him, but I say that the Foreign Relations Committee, and the \nSenate, has for the first time in a long time the opportunity to take \nits rightful place in the procedure of determining the foreign policy \napparatus of this country.\n  I will have more to say, if necessary, as time goes by, but I hope \nthe Senator will not press his amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    June 12, 1997.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, Senate \n         Dirksen Office Building Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jesse: I want to take this opportunity to commend you \n     for a job well done on your United Nations reform \n     legislation. I know you have spent many hours ensuring that \n     our national interests--and the interests of American \n     taxpayers--are better protected at the United Nations.\n       As you know, I have long supported efforts to achieve \n     reforms in United Nations peacekeeping and in the other areas \n     of U.N. operations. The personnel, budgetary and organization \n     reforms your legislation requires before additional U.S. \n     funds go to the U.N. are comprehensive and long-overdue. I am \n     pleased to see your legislation effectively precludes U.N. \n     efforts to create a standing army, impose taxation or control \n     U.S. property. I am particularly supportive of the provision \n     which requires U.N. reimbursement for all costs associated \n     with U.S. support for U.N. peacekeeping, and the provision \n     which lowers the U.S. annual assessment for the U.N. budget. \n     If such provisions had been in place in 1993, U.S. taxpayers \n     would have saved literally billions of dollars.\n       You have put together an impressive piece of legislation. I \n     congratulate you for leading a difficult effort that will \n     result in a more efficient and more limited United Nations, \n     and help ensure that American interests come first in our \n     policy toward the United Nations.\n       I am writing this letter solely on my own behalf and the \n     opinions expressed herein are my own.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Dole.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I commend the very able Senator from Indiana for \noffering this amendment and for, in effect, crystallizing this issue on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I share his view that this is an extremely serious matter and that \nthe American commitment to the United Nations, despite various \nassertions we are hearing to the contrary, in fact may be in the \nprocess of being seriously eroded. This is a very important amendment.\n  It is my own strongly held view that the interests of the United \nStates have been served by our Nation's active participation in the \nUnited Nations and the U.N. system. Over the years, since the end of \nWorld War II, the U.N. often has been an effective means of promoting \nU.S. foreign policy interests. When we work with and through the United \nNations, we can leverage our resources and our influence in order to \nachieve a much greater impact than we could unilaterally.\n  Why do we go to the U.N. and seek these resolutions to sanction \nvarious actions we take around the world to serve and protect our \nnational security interests? Because it gives us an international \nmandate to pursue a course of action, and frequently elicits \ncontributions from other countries. Sometimes, in fact, the other \ncountries are the ones who put their troops on the line, not the United \nStates, in order to accomplish objectives that we regard as important.\n  Now, in the last decade, our status as the U.N.'s biggest debtor has \naffected our credibility and undermined our leadership with our allies \nand within the international community. The United States owes over $1 \nbillion to the U.N. for regular activities and peacekeeping, more by \nfar than any other country. Our arrearages are nearly two-thirds of the \ntotal amount owed by all countries to the United Nations.\n  There has been a misperception that the U.N. can somehow dictate \npolicies to the United States and force us to undertake actions that do \nnot serve American interests.\n  This is simply not the case. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nU.N. peacekeeping operations cannot be established without the \nconcurrence of the United States. Of all of these various peacekeeping \noperations, none of them could have happened without American \nconcurrence in their going forward.\n  As a key member of the Security Council, we are one of five countries \nwith veto power over all resolutions that are considered by the \ncouncil. We have a veto power that, in effect, can prevent any action \nof which we disapprove from taking place.\n  As a country, we pride ourselves for following the rule of law and \nholding our citizens responsible for meeting various legal obligations. \nIn fact, we try to get other countries to follow our example and live \nup to those standards, both domestically and internationally. It is \nfrequently a tremendous challenge to get countries to respect the basic \nrights of their citizens and to act in accordance with international \nlaw.\n  We ourselves are not now meeting those high standards, as they relate \nto the United Nations. We undertook commitments under the U.N. Charter, \nand we have a responsibility to make good on them. The starting point \nhere must be a recognition that this is an obligation that we freely \nundertook, upon which we have defaulted. We have not met our \nresponsibilities.\n  Now, this legislation, first of all, does not provide money to meet \nall of our arrears. There has been a negotiating process between \nMembers of the Congress and the administration. The United Nations \nsays, well, this is what we think the United States owes--$1.3 billion \nand some. The administration says, no, we think we owe just over $1.0 \nbillion. This legislation has in it just over $800 million. It does not \neven have the figure which the administration states is what we owe to \nthe United Nations, let alone the figure which the United Nations \nasserts that we owe.\n  The gap between the United Nation's assertion and the \nadministration's position is largely the consequence of a unilateral \naction by the United States lowering its peacekeeping assessment from \n31 percent to 25 percent. We just came along and said to the \norganization, well, we are going to cut it, just like we are doing here \nnow on regular assessments. This is an organization with clear \nprocedures for working out these responsibilities, and we are simply \ntelling them what the situation is going to be.\n  Now, I have no doubt that if some other country, delinquent in \nmeeting its obligations, showed up with the demands that we have put in \nthis legislation, we would be absolutely outraged. We would say, who do \nthey think they are and what do they think they are doing? They had \nthese obligations and now they are coming in and rewriting\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\nthem unilaterally and imposing these conditions.\n  These are conditions on past obligations. This is not looking to the \nfuture. This isn't saying, well, we rethought the matter and we don't \nreally want to be part of this organization, unless it does such and \nsuch and so and so in the future.\n  These are past obligations. These are instances in which many \ncountries have gone out and have put their people at risk, at our \nencouragement as a matter of fact, and now we come along and we refuse \nto pay the bill. We are refusing, in effect, to reimburse other \ncountries for sending their troops on peacekeeping missions that we \nhave voted for. Many countries have done that. They have gone and sent \ntheir troops, put their troops' lives on the line in order to \naccomplish these objectives. Our responsibility in most of those \ninstances was to provide the money to cover the activities, activities \nthey were performing for us and for the entire world. Those missions \nhave been accomplished. The bill has not been paid.\n  The approach taken by Senator Lugar would seek to address our \nprevious obligations in a very straightforward manner, and he also, as \nI understand it, has a proposal to fully meet current obligations, \nthereby enabling us to break out of the cycle of growing debts and \nwaning influence.\n  Now, it is asserted here that we are not trying to micromanage the \nUnited Nations. We just went through this tremendous struggle at the \nUnited Nations to get a new Secretary General. The United States was a \nmoving force in that effort and, from all indications, was happy with \nthe change that took place. Now we are throwing a burden on the new \nSecretary General which I have serious concerns that he can sustain.\n\n  I want to go through just a few of the kinds of conditions that are \ngoing to be imposed here. I urge my colleagues to take a copy of S. 903 \nand go through it to see the kind of regime it establishes. Ask \nyourselves whether this is consistent with our Nation's participation \nin the U.N. for over 50 years now, as governed by the charter.\n  First of all, we say that $80 million can only be made available \nsemiannually every year on a certification that the United Nations \nhasn't taken any actions that raise their budget over what had been \nprojected. What happens if we get a new peacekeeping responsibility? \nWhat happens if there is an outbreak of hostilities somewhere, and \nfinally to help bring it under control the United Nations takes action, \nas it has done in other places, and there are costs associated with \nthat action? Well, I take it, if they do that without finding an \noffset--even with our support--we must withhold the money.\n  Twenty percent of the funds made available each fiscal year are going \nto be withheld to comply with a certification that is contained on \npages 158 and 159; $50 million is going to be withheld from \ndisbursement until the Secretary of State certifies that they have cut \na thousand posts from the United Nations--995 won't do it; you have to \nhave 1,000. Then the following fiscal year we will withhold $50 million \nfrom disbursement until there is a certification that the United \nNations is running a vacancy rate of not less than 5 percent.\n  Now, this isn't negotiated with the United Nations. This is not the \noutcome of extended discussions as to what the United Nations is going \nto do. This is the Congress telling the United Nations that this is \nwhat it must do. So, in effect, we are saying that we are going to run \nyour organization and all you other countries who pay the bulk of the \ncost will have to live with it. I would note that even with our large \nassessments, we are still a minority payor in the U.N. overall.\n  Then there is a provision, which I hope to address later, that \nprovides for our withdrawal from the United Nations. We have finally \ncome to the point in this legislation where there is a serious \nproposition for withdrawal of the United States from the United \nNations--not an argument about how much we ought to pay, not an \nargument about how fast we pay the arrearages, but provisions that set \nout a process for withdrawal. I am frank to tell you that I never \nthought I would see the day we would be facing this. We ought to \nconfront this challenge head on. If that is the agenda that is behind \nall of this, we ought to fight it out on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  There are additional conditions that appear in different places \nthroughout this legislation. It is not until you identify them all and \nlook at them all--they are not all in one place--and go through them \nthat you begin to appreciate how heavy a burden is being created here. \nThis bill provides, as the newspaper stories explain today, that if the \nU.N. does not meet all the benchmarks, they don't get the money.\n  There was a press conference up in New York where some suggested that \nthese ``benchmarks'' were only guidelines. But, clearly, they are not \nsimply guidelines. In fact, they are written as binding conditions \nwhich, if adopted by the full Congress, will become U.S. law. So this \nlegislation moves beyond suggestions, recommendations, or proposals. \nThese conditions would be mandatory elements of U.S. law, and would \nhave to be carried out.\n  Now, there is another provision here that, in the next fiscal year, \nin order to release the money, there has to be a certification by the \nSecretary of State that the assessed contributions of the United States \nfor the regular budget of the United Nations have been cut from 25 to \n22 percent and the following year from 22 to 20 percent. Now, I think \ntrying to negotiate such a reduction is acceptable as a goal or an \nobjective of U.S. policy. But this isn't negotiating a reduction, this \nis a unilateral condition on which the payment of our arrearages \ndepends.\n\n  Here is what we are doing. We are coming along and we are saying we \nare not going to pay all of our arrearages. We are not even going to \npay the amount that our own Government has said we owe. We are going to \nfall short on that score. Moreover, we are going to create new \narrearages. So it is not as though we come in and say, yes, we are \ngoing to pay all of our arrearages, we will pay our current assessment \nin full. We do neither of those two things.\n  Then we provide those partial repayments under a whole set of \nconditions, including that the United Nations reduces our assessment--a \nmatter which, under the U.N. process, needs to be negotiated and \narrived at by consensus.\n  I ask Members again to stop and think what their reaction would be if \nanother country showed up in this heavy-handed way and started \ninsisting that this is what would have to be done in order for them to \npay up the obligations which they owe. I daresay we would not give them \nthe time of day. So we fall short on meeting the arrearages, we fall \nshort on the current payment, and then we tie these payments to a whole \nset of conditions. In effect, we say to the United Nations: Well, if \nyou want to get any of this money, you have to do all of this.\n  Now, I think we must proceed on the basis of careful consideration of \nthe United Nations and its role and its importance. If there are those \nwho don't think we ought to stay in the United Nations, we ought to \nhave that debate. As I have indicated, I think the United Nations \noverall has served our interests. That doesn't mean we agree with every \nsingle thing they have done or we necessarily think that it has been \nrun in an exemplary fashion. It has had its ups and downs, no question \nabout it.\n  But the real question is: How did the United States approach the \nU.N.? How is the United States going to exercise its international \nleadership in the post-cold war-period? Is the United States simply \ngoing to dictate, to simply throw its weight around, and say, ``Well, \nwe are going to make these unilateral judgments. Congress discussed \nthis; now we are going to bring it to the United Nations, and you had \nbetter take it, or else?''\n  They held a press conference in New York the other day. Our \nAmbassador and one of our colleagues at the outset of this press \nconference tried in effect to portray the benchmarks as mere \nsuggestions. But that portrayal comes at odds with what Senator Helms \nsaid in introducing the bill. He said, and I quote from his statement, \n``Most importantly, this bill would prohibit the payment by the \nAmerican taxpayers of any so-called U.N. arrears until''-- with the \n``until'' underlined--``these congressionally mandated benchmarks have \nbeen met by the U.N.''\n  He continues, ``The message to the United Nations is simple but \nclear: no reform, no American taxpayer money\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\nfor arrears.'' That doesn't sound like a suggestion.\n  So that is where we find ourselves. I mean we are now at the point \nwhere we are going to dictate these conditions. I think it is going to \ncause us great difficulty at the United Nations. In fact, I think the \ncommittee's approach of seeking unilaterally to impose an American \nposition on the United Nations may well alter the very nature of our \nrelationship with the U.N. to our own detriment, let alone to our \nrelationship with some of the major actors at the U.N. Many of them are \nour closest allies over the years and are very much interested in how \nthe United States revolves this matter.\n  So I commend the Senator from Indiana for bringing this issue \nforward.\n  The U.N. has been a favorite target of criticism and abuse. But it \nhas done good work over the years, and I think we certainly need it. We \nneed it to continue to function, hopefully in a strengthened position. \nThe benchmarks or preconditions in this legislation--there are close to \n40 of them of one sort or another in this legislation, not all in the \nsame place--will not accomplish that.\n  The decision to join the United Nations made at the end of World War \nII was one of the most significant and momentous decisions made in this \ncentury. It came on the basis of a great deal of history which had \nconcluded that the American failure to participate in the League of \nNations was a very serious error, and that World War II might have been \nprevented had the United States undertaken an active international \nrole.\n  The effective workings of the United Nations, as it was envisioned by \nthose who planned it during World War II and in the immediate \naftermath, were in effect brought to a standstill by the cold war and \nthe consistent exercise by the Soviet Union of its veto at the security \ncouncil. The veto, of course, as I have indicated, the United States \nalso has, and has had from the very inception of the United Nations.\n  With the implosion of the Soviet Union and a change in the whole \nnature of the international arena, the opportunities for the United \nNations to carry forward and carry out many of the responsibilities \nwhich had been envisioned for it at the time of its founding reemerged \nin this decade.\n  It is difficult because many of the problems they try to contend with \nare extremely complex involving enmities and hostilities of long \nstanding. Neither the U.N. nor anyone else has a magic wand they can \nwave over those conflicts. But there is an opportunity for the United \nStates, working through the United Nations and with the United Nations, \nto make a major contribution to world peace and to world prosperity. \nBut to do that we need to be full members of the organization. And we \nneed to step up and assume our responsibilities. We are not doing that \nin this legislation.\n  I am very concerned at what the reaction will be over time. Will they \nsimply swallow it with great resentment? Will they feel when all the \ncertifications can't be made that they really have not been dealt with \nfairly? Will we be up there managing it in a very detailed way because \ncondition 21 or condition 32 has not been complied with? What do we do \nwhen we try to get nations to work with us in a particular direction? \nWe can't compel them to do it.\n  We exercise our leadership in a sense by developing a consensus to \nsupport our position because we think it is the right position. And \nhere we are taking a position which is the wrong position because we \nare failing to do a very basic thing, and that is simply meet our \nobligations. These are past responsibilities--not future \nresponsibilities. We are using the fact that we failed to meet past \nresponsibilities, and now are talking about meeting some but not all of \nthem to impose a whole string of conditions and requirements on the \nUnited Nations. Otherwise you say, ``Well, we simply won't abide by \nwhat our obligations were.''\n  I am frank to tell you that I don't think that is the way a great \npower ought to behave. The United States is a great power. The United \nStates is the great power in the world today. And with that role come \nimportant responsibilities in how we exercise that power. In my \njudgment, we are failing here to exercise those responsibilities in a \nmanner that will strengthen our posture in the international community. \nI hope but I fear we may find that this effort has in the end altered \nthe nature of our relationship with the U.N. to the detriment of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have had several inquiries about how late \nwe are going. My response has been, of course, that that is up to the \nleadership of the Senate. For the time being, I hope that the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio would be recognized to offer an \namendment, and that the pending amendments be laid aside temporarily, \nat the conclusion of which I would appreciate the Chair recognizing me \nfor any further comment that I may have received from the majority \nleader in regard to how late we will stay here tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, is it the \nintent of the distinguished chairman to continue debate on my \namendment? The request has been made to lay the amendment aside.\n  Mr. HELMS. Certainly, as long as the Senator from Indiana wishes to \nstay. But I did not recognize the very distinguished remarks of the \nSenator to be pro or con on his amendment, at least as they were \nwritten. But to respond to the Senator's question, I will stay here as \nlong as he will.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator. I would like to be heard again on my \namendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Carolina, \nand I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 383\n\n   (Purpose: To exclude from the United States aliens who have been \n       involved in extrajudicial and political killings in Haiti)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my distinguished \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Graham, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio (Mr. DeWine), for himself, and Mr. \n     Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 383.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XVI of division B of the bill, insert \n     the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . EXCLUSION FROM THE UNITED STATES OF ALIENS WHO HAVE \n                   BEEN INVOLVED IN EXTRAJUDICIAL AND POLITICAL \n                   KILLINGS IN HAITI.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) At the time of the enactment of this Act, there have \n     been over eighty extrajudicial and political killing cases \n     assigned to the Haitian Special Investigative Unit (SIU) by \n     the Government of Haiti. Furthermore, the government has \n     requested that the SIU investigate on a ``priority basis'' \n     close to two dozen cases relating to extrajudicial and \n     political killings.\n       (2) President Jean-Bertrand Aristide lived in exile in the \n     United States after he was overthrown by a military coup on \n     September 30, 1991. During his exile, political and \n     extrajudicial killings occurred in Haiti including Aristide \n     financial supporter Antoine Izmery, who was killed on \n     September 11, 1993; Guy Malary, Aristide's Minister of \n     Justice, who was killed on October 14, 1993; and Father Jean-\n     Marie Vincent, a supporter of Aristide, was killed on August \n     28, 1992.\n       (3) President Aristide returned to Haiti on October 15, \n     1994, after some 20,000 United States troops, under the code \n     name Operation Uphold Democracy, entered Haiti as the lead \n     force in a multi-national force with the objective of \n     restoring democratic rule.\n       (4) From June 25, 1995, through October 1995, elections \n     were held where pro-Aristide candidates won a large share of \n     the parliamentary and local government seats.\n       (5) On March 28, 1995, a leading opposition leader to \n     Aristide, Attorney Mireille Durocher Bertin, and a client, \n     Eugene Baillergeau, were gunned down in Ms. Bertin's car.\n       (6) On May 22, 1995, Michel Gonzalez, Haitian businessman \n     and Aristide's next door neighbor, was killed in a drive-by \n     shooting after alleged attempts by Aristide to acquire his \n     property.\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\n       (7) After Aristide regained power, three former top Army \n     officers were assassinated: Colonel Max Mayard on March 10, \n     1995; Colonel Michelange Hermann on May 24, 1995; and \n     Brigadier General Romulus Dumarsais was killed on June 27, \n     1995.\n       (8) Presidential elections were held on December 17, 1995. \n     Rene Preval, an Aristide supporter, won, with 89 percent of \n     the votes cast, but with a low voter turnout of only 28 \n     percent, and with many parties allegedly boycotting the \n     election. Preval took office on February 7, 1996.\n       (9) On March 6, 1996, police and ministerial security \n     guards killed at least six men during a raid in Cite Soleil, \n     a Port-au-Prince slum.\n       (10) On August 20, 1996, two opposition politicians, \n     Jacques Fleurival and Baptist Pastor Antoine Leroy were \n     gunned down outside Fleurival's home.\n       (11) Other alleged extrajudicial and political killings \n     include the deaths of Claude Yves Marie, Mario Beaubrun, \n     Leslie Grimar, Joseph Chilove, and Jean-Hubert Feuille.\n       (12) Although the Haitian Government claims to have \n     terminated from employment several suspects in the killings, \n     some whom have received training from United States advisors, \n     there has been no substantial progress made in the \n     investigation that has led to the prosecution of any of the \n     above-referenced extrajudicial and political killings.\n       (13) The expiration of the mandate of the United Nations \n     Support Mission in Haiti has been extended three times, the \n     last to July 31, 1997. The Administration has indicated that \n     a fourth extension through November 1997, may be necessary to \n     ensure the transition to a democratic government.\n       (b) Grounds for Exclusion.--The Secretary of State shall \n     deny a visa to, and the Attorney General shall exclude from \n     the United States, any alien who the Secretary of State has \n     reason to believe is a person who--\n       (1) has been credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted, in the extrajudicial and political \n     killings of Antoine Izmery, Guy Malary, Father Jean-Marie \n     Vincent, Pastor Antoine Leroy, Jacques Fleurival, Mireille \n     Durocher Bertin, Eugene Baillergeau, Michelange Hermann, Max \n     Mayard, Romulus Dumarsais, Claude Yves Marie, Mario Beaubrun, \n     Leslie Grimar, Joseph Chilove, Michel Gonzalez, and Jean-\n     Hubert Feuille;\n       (2) has been included in the list presented to former \n     president Jean-Bertrand Aristide by former National Security \n     Council Advisor Anthony Lake in December 1995, and acted upon \n     by President Rene Preval;\n       (3) was a member of the Haitian presidential security unit \n     who has been credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted, in the extrajudicial and political \n     killings of Pastor Antoine Leroy and Jacques Fleurival, or \n     who was suspended by President Preval for his involvement in \n     or knowledge of the Leroy and Fleurival killings on August \n     20, 1996; or\n       (4) was sought for an interview by the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation as part of its inquiry into the March 28, 1995, \n     murder of Mireille Durocher Bertin and Eugene Baillergeau, \n     Jr., and were credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted, in those murders, per a June 28, \n     1995, letter to the then Minister of Justice of the \n     Government of Haiti, Jean-Joseph Exume.\n       (c) Exemption.--This section shall not apply where the \n     Secretary of State finds, on a case by case basis, that the \n     entry into the United States of the person who would \n     otherwise be excluded under this section is necessary for \n     medical reasons, or such person has cooperated fully with the \n     investigation of these political murders. If the Secretary of \n     State exempts such a person, the Secretary shall notify the \n     appropriate congressional committees in writing.\n       (d) Reporting Requirement.--(1) The United States chief of \n     mission in Haiti shall provide the Secretary of State a list \n     of those who have been credibly alleged to have ordered or \n     carried out the extrajudicial and political killings \n     mentioned in paragraph (1) of subsection (b).\n       (2) The Secretary of State shall submit the list provided \n     under paragraph (1) to the appropriate congressional \n     committees not later than three months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (3) The Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a list of aliens denied visas, and \n     the Attorney General shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a list of aliens refused entry to \n     the United States as a result of this provision.\n       (4) The Secretary shall submit a report under this \n     subsection not later than six months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and not later than March 1 of each year \n     thereafter as long as the Government of Haiti has not \n     completed the investigation of the extrajudicial and \n     political killings and has not prosecuted those implicated \n     for the killings specified in paragraph (1) of subsection \n     (b).\n       (e) Definition.--In this section, the term ``appropriate \n     congressional committees'' means the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives and \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, my amendment really is a very simple \namendment. The amendment that Senator Graham and I have offered would \ndeny entry into the United States to anyone who has been credibly \nalleged to have ordered or carried out extrajudicial and political \nkillings in the country of Haiti.\n  Mr. President, to an extent almost unimaginable to us who live in the \nUnited States, the history of Haiti has been a sad chronicle of brutal \nand repeated acts of political violence. Some of these extrajudicial \nkillings occurred while former President Aristide was in exile. Some of \nthese killings occurred after he returned to power. And tragically they \nhave continued to occur after Mr. Aristide left office and President \nPreval became President.\n  During Mr. Aristide's exile, the victims included Mr. Aristide's \nfinancial support, Antoine Izmery, who was killed on September 11, \n1993; Guy Malary, Mr. Aristide's Minister of Justice, who was killed on \nOctober 14, 1993, and Father Jean-Marie Vincent, an Aristide supporter \nwho was killed on August 28, 1992.\n  Mr. President, after President Aristide regained power, it was the \nother side's turn.\n  On March 28, 1995, a leader of the opposition to Mr. Aristide, \nattorney Mireille Durocher Bertin, was gunned down in her car. One of \nher clients, Eugene Baillergeau, was also killed in the shooting.\n  On May 22, 1995, Michel Gonzalez was killed in a drive-by shooting--\nafter alleged attempts by Mr. Aristide to acquire his property.\n  Three former top army officers were assassinated: Col. Max Mayard, \nkilled on October 3, 1995. Col. Michelange Hermann, killed on May 24, \n1995. And Brig. Gen. Romulus Dumarsais, killed on June 27, 1995.\n  Since the inauguration of President Preval, further killings have \ntaken place.\n  On March 6, 1996, police and ministerial security guards killed at \nleast six men during a raid in Cite Soleil in Port-au-Prince.\n  On August 20, 1996, two opposition politicians--Jacques Fleurival and \nPastor Antoine Leroy--were gunned down outside Mr. Fleurival's \nhome. And the death toll goes on and on: Claude Yves Marie. Mario \nBeaubrun. Leslie Grimar. Joseph Chilove. Jean-Hurbert Feuille.\n\n  The Haitian Government has assigned over 80 extrajudicial and \npolitical killing cases to the so-called Special Investigative Unit, \nthe SIU. The Haitian Government says that they have fired several \ngovernment employees who are suspects in these killings. But the sad \nfact remains that there has been no substantial progress made in these \ninvestigations. With the exception of one case that did go to trial \nwhere there was an acquittal, no one else has been tried. No one else \nhas been convicted and no one has been punished for any of these \nassassinations.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, we need to do everything in our power to \nencourage the Haitians to bring the killers to justice. We as a nation \nhave made a substantial investment in the building of Haitian \ndemocracy. And the plight of Haitian boat people demonstrates very \nclearly and dramatically that moving Haiti into some level of stability \nis clearly in our national interest.\n  But peace, democracy, and stability will not set down firm roots in \nHaiti unless and until the Haitian people themselves finally believe \nthat power in their country can no longer be won at gunpoint.\n  The days when political murders can be carried out with impunity must \nbe brought to an end. This amendment that my colleague, Senator Graham, \nand I are now offering tells the Haitian people that political murder \nis no longer business as usual as far as the U.S. Government is \nconcerned. In our view, it is time to stop adding names to the death \ntoll of Haitian politics.\n  The premise behind this amendment is that visiting the United States \nis a privilege, one that should not be taken for granted. By not \nallowing these Haitian political murderers into our country, we send a \nstrong message to them and to all people that political violence in \nHaiti will not be ignored by the United States.\n  This amendment does exempt persons on a case-by-case basis for \nmedical reasons and cases in which the person has cooperated fully with \nthe investigation of these political murders. This amendment also \nincludes a reporting requirement. Our administration would be directed \nto submit to the appropriate\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\ncongressional committees:) a list of those who have been credibly \nalleged to have ordered or carried out the extrajudicial and political \nkillings;) a list of those who have been refused entry to the United \nStates as a result of this provision; and a report on this matter to be \nsubmitted once each year until such time as the Government of Haiti has \ncompleted the investigation of the extrajudicial and political killings \nand has prosecuted those implicated in the killings.\n  This amendment really is a very practical expression of our \nsolidarity with the Haitian people, our solidarity with the Haitian \npeople, as they aspire to real and true democracy and as they aspire to \na peaceful civil society based on the rule of law instead of brutal \nviolence.\n  For too long, for tragically too long, violence, political violence \nhas been the way of life in Haiti. Whether the government is led by \nGeneral Cedras or President Aristide or President Preval, one sad truth \nremains: Too many Haitians die, too many Haitians die due to political \nviolence.\n  In past remarks on this Senate floor, I have outlined some of the \nmeasures the United States has taken and is taking to help the Haitian \npeople break the cycle of violence. We are helping to train and provide \nresources for the SIU detectives who I talked about a moment ago, and \nwe have sent experienced U.S. police officers to help mentor the young \ncivilian police.\n  As I have said on this floor on several occasions, one of most \nheartening things as I have visited Haiti now four times in the last \nseveral years is to see the young American, big-city police officers, \nCreole-speaking, Haitian born but United States citizens who are down \nthere, trying to make a difference with this young police force. So \nthere are things that are happening. Progress is being made. There is \nsome good news. Haitians are making progress in a very tough, uphill \nbattle.\n  The adoption of this amendment will not solve their problems. It \ncertainly will not solve their problems overnight, but I believe it \nwill help. It will tell the Haitian people that we in the United States \nare on the side of everyone in that country who wants to create jobs, \nwho wants to create hope; we are on the side of everyone in Haiti who \nwants a peaceful life, and we are on the side of everyone in Haiti who \nwants justice.\n  When a country tries to move to democracy, we always look to see \nwhether there is peaceful transition of power. We look to see whether \nor not there are elections and whether they are free and fair \nelections. We sometimes forget that that is not the only indicator of \ndemocracy and certainly is not the only indicator of whether or not \nthat country will be able to preserve a fragile democracy.\n  The other thing we have to look at is whether or not people feel they \ncan have redress in the courts and whether or not, if someone, \ntragically, is murdered, or someone is injured, they have the \nopportunity or there will be the opportunity for their assailants to be \nbrought to justice. This amendment deals with that and I believe will \nhelp the Government of Haiti and help the people of Haiti continue to \nprogress towards the democracy that we want them to have and that they \nwant. And the understanding must be that democracy is not just about \nelections, however important they are, but it is also about redress in \ncourts. It is also about justice. It is also about a judicial system in \nwhich the general population can have confidence and faith. The solving \nof some of these high-profile political murders will go a long way to \nbringing about that type of confidence for the people of Haiti and will \ngo a long way to creating the climate that we know must exist in Haiti \nif democracy is, in fact, to flourish and to survive.\n  I ask, as I conclude my remarks, unanimous consent to insert at this \npoint in the Record a letter which is referenced in this amendment. It \nis a letter bearing the date of June 28, 1995, from the Justice \nDepartment of the United States to the Minister of Justice of Haiti. I \nask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                            Industrial Park, Haiti, June 28, 1995.\n     Jean Joseph Exume,\n     Minister of Justice, Government of Haiti,\n     Port-Au-Prince, Haiti.\n       Dear Minister Exume: Following is a list of individuals the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to interview in \n     the immediate future as part of its ongoing investigation of \n     the assassination of Mireille Durocher Bertin and Eugene \n     Baillergeau, Jr., on 3/28/95.\n       A. From the IPSF:\n       Maj. Dany Toussaint\n       Capt. Mendes Lesly Petion\n       Lt. Youri Latortue\n       Lt. Mignard Jean-Pierre\n       Lt. Ruguins Andre\n       Sgt.

James Jean-Baptiste for IPSF personnel and with Me. \n     Francois Dormevil for those working at the palace. Thank you \n     for your cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Richard J. Giannotti,\n\n                                         Supervisory Special Agent\n                                  Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair. I thank again my distinguished \ncolleague, the chairman of the committee, Mr. Helms from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I support this amendment and I have a hunch \nthat most Senators will. I will be surprised if there are many Senators \nwho will not support the amendment.\n  Since the United States returned Aristide to power in Haiti, there \nhave been dozens upon dozens of politically motivated assassinations \ncarried out by Haitian security forces trained by the United States. \nThese people who have been assassinated in almost all cases, as I \nunderstand it, have been opponents of Mr. Aristide. Does the Senator \nagree with that?\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I could respond to my colleague, tragically, political \nmurders have continued. We saw them before Aristide came to power, we \nsaw them during the time he was in power, and we have continued to see \nthem with the current President, President Preval. I believe it is very \nimportant that the people of Haiti must see that no matter who is in \npower, no one is above the law and supporters of someone in power are \nnot above the law.\n  Mr. HELMS. Right. In any case, Mr. President, despite the American \ntaxpayers being required to put up the money to prop up the Haitian \nGovernment with U.S. troops, and the expenditure of something like $2 \nbillion, the Haitian Government has rebuffed all of the attempts by our \nGovernment to investigate these murders. The human rights situation has \ndisintegrated to such a point that last year President Clinton had to \nrush diplomatic security officers to Haiti to protect Aristide's \nreplacement, President Preval, from his own palace security guards whom \nthe United States had trained and equipped.\n  Here is one example of so-called justice in Haiti today. Michel \nGonzalez lived next door to Mr. Aristide. Mr. Gonzalez was gunned down \nin May of 1995 outside of his home after refusing to sell his property \nto Mr. Aristide. The Haitian Government claims that the autopsy report \nwas lost and the Haitian Government refuses to turn over critical \nevidence to the U.S. Government.\n  One of those implicated in orchestrating the assassination is Dany \nToussaint, who got a U.S. green card as an ``agricultural worker''--and \nI wish I knew how to put oral quotation marks around agricultural \nworker. In any case, he has been allowed to roam free in the United \nStates, and in Haiti. It seems to me that spending $2 billion on a \nregime that protects murderers is bad enough, but allowing these \nassassins to come into the United States is quite another thing. It is \nnot only asinine; it is breathtaking in its stupidity.\n  In 1993 and 1994, I took some flak as a Senator because I warned that \nwhen Aristide and his cronies were fully disclosed, the record would be \nclear that\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\nthey are or were anti-American thugs. There is no other way to put it. \nAristide himself rose to prominence making hate-filled diatribes \nagainst the United States of America. He accused the United States of \nhaving some strange diabolic design on Haiti.\n  Now, I noticed in yesterday's Washington Post a report that Mr. \nAristide is engineering a bid to resume power in Haiti even though it \nis against Haiti's Constitution for him to be President again.\n  According to this article, and I quote from the Washington Post: \n``Arrested is rallying his militants by blaming U.S. imperialism for \nthe woes of Haiti's poor.'' That is some thanks, I guess, for the \nbillions of dollars of American taxpayers' money spent in Haiti or on \nbehalf of Haiti.\n  There is no getting around the fact that the lives of American \nservicemen and women were put at risk and billions of taxpayer dollars \nhave been wasted to prop up a government run by corrupt cronies of \nArrested--people who hate America and who sanction assassinations \nagainst political opponents.\n  Mr. President, it boils down to this: If the Haitian Government will \nnot prosecute these assassins, the least we can do is deny them U.S. \nvisas.\n  I wonder if Senator Biden is available. I would like to get the yeas \nand nays. I presume the Senator wants the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I would like a rollcall vote, if we could.\n  Mr. HELMS. The distinguished Senator from Delaware will have to be on \nthe floor in order to get them, but we will get the yeas and nays and \nhave a rollcall vote, probably an early vote tomorrow morning.\n  I thank the Senator. I have received no further information from the \nleaders about how late we should go, so I think it is time to hear from \nthe distinguished Senator from Indiana again, Mr. Lugar.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 382\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman and the Chair. Let me \nsummarize. Earlier in the afternoon I offered an amendment to strike \nTitle XXII from the legislation dealing with the United Nations. \nEssentially, I call for payment of our debt in 2 years, without \nconditions.\n  Title XXII, as we observe, contains 18 pages of conditions. That is \nthe issue. Senator Biden, the distinguished ranking member of the \ncommittee, argued that he believed in principle that my arguments were \ncorrect. He argued that pragmatically, in the negotiation that he had \nencountered with the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, the \nchairman led him to believe that the amounts of money, $819 million, \nand the conditions that are imposed by Title XXII were the best \narrangement that was possible under these circumstances.\n  The distinguished Chairman, Senator Helms, has argued that the \nForeign Relations Committee ought to take action, as opposed to \nallowing the appropriators to take action, as so often has been the \ncase with matters before our committee in recent years. I certainly \nsubscribe to that thought, that we ought to take action. Clearly this \nbill as a whole is an attempt to do so in a very comprehensive and \npositive way. But it is important that Members realize the gravity of \nthe debate that we are having on the United Nations.\n  Senator Sarbanes, I think correctly, in his remarks, mentioned that \nthe very thought of withdrawal, which appears in this bill, is a very \nserious business. Earlier I suggested that it is not at all beyond \nconjecture that there will be no money paid to the United Nations given \nthe severity and the number of conditions that are required; that \nMembers, in casting a vote on this, have to consider that casting that \nvote imperils the United Nations, quite apart from our reputation for \npaying our debts to our allies who have been involved in peacekeeping \noperations which we supported.\n  These are serious matters. A basic dilemma is that the language is \nvery complex. Many Senators may not have had an opportunity to read \nwhat the conditions are and all the reasons why this Senator argues it \nwill be very difficult for the payments to be made. Senators may not \nhave realized the implications of nonpayment, noncooperation, and \nnonleadership on our part could imperil the United Nations. If Senators \nare, in fact, of a mind that they really do not care or if they believe \nthe United Nations has served its time and that this is an unusual \nback-door way of finalizing the problem, that is one point. But if \nSenators believe, as do two-thirds of the American people, that the \nUnited Nations is important, that we ought to be taking leadership, \nthat we ought to be paying our debts, then Senators will vote to do so. \nThey will support my amendment.\n\n  It is not inconceivable that my amendment should pass and that we \nshould proceed along this course of action. What has been argued this \nafternoon by the distinguished Ranking Member of the committee is that \nthe distinguished Chairman disagreed with payment of very much money, \nand the distinguished Chairman insisted upon a large number of \nconditions. Apparently, he acquiesced and finally allowed some of the \nfunds to be stricken from the legislation. That is the argument we are \nhaving. I would simply say that Senators must consider this, I believe \nquickly, because the timeframe of all this debate is very rapid. If \nthere were more time, my guess is that around the Nation, members of \nthe general public, editorial writers in newspapers, opinion leaders in \nforeign policy would agree, this is very serious. This is a moment of \ntruth for the Senate with regard to the United Nations. There would be \ntime for many people to reflect upon this, including Senators who must \nvote. And it is very possible that Senators would decide we really want \nto take leadership and we want to affirm the ties that we have with our \nallies to whom we owe the money.\n  As we have pointed out again and again, $658 million is owed to \ncountries such as Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and other \nfriends and allies--not to the Secretariat of the United Nations or the \nstructure that has been described as overblown. That is a red herring; \njust 5 percent of the money is owed to the United Nations per se. The \nreal issue is whether we will meet our obligations to our friends, \nwhether we will take leadership at the United Nations, whether we will \nassert that the United Nations should continue as an important part of \nour foreign policy.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, I will be pleased to respond.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Are these obligations to our friends, to which the \nSenator has referred, those instances in which our allies undertook \nactions under the umbrella authority of the United Nations, often with \nthe use of their own troops, to carry out activities which the United \nStates supported, which the United States made the judgment served our \nown national security interests? Would that be correct?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is absolutely correct, that our interests were \nserved. We voted for peacekeeping operations. Other nations stepped \nforward, and we agreed to pay our fair share of the money and not to \nsend our troops.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, in fact, in some of \nthose instances, while we wanted the activity done, we were unwilling \nto commit our own forces directly in order to do it, and the problem \nwas then resolved by the willingness of other countries to commit their \nforces in order to carry out these important activities; was that not \nthe case?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct. Of course, one of the most vivid \nand recent experiences was that in Bosnia, to which our country for \nsome time did not wish to commit forces, did not wish to commit NATO or \nget a vote of our NATO allies. So, as a result, other nations attempted \nto bring about peace in Bosnia largely because our Nation stood aside \nbut indicated to them they ought to carry on.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, in fact, if we \ncannot continue to work this way, I take it that if confronted with a \ncrisis abroad, our choices would either be to do nothing or to become \ninvolved unilaterally and directly, by ourselves. We would lose what, \nit seems to me, has been a very\n\n[[Page S5686]]\n\neffective weapon for serving U.S. interests without necessarily \ncommitting the United States directly in the activity. Would that be \ncorrect?\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator has stated the options all too vividly; \nnamely, we respond to security crises by ourselves or we say nothing is \ngoing to happen in the world. And worse still, we lose the option, if \nwe do not have the United Nations, of going as we did to the Security \nCouncil, at the time the United States presided, during Desert Storm \nwhen we obtained a Security Council resolution that brought a number of \nnations to our side in a very, very important endeavor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield on that very point, it was my \nvery strongly held impression that obtaining the resolution of the \nSecurity Council, in effect, gave legitimacy to the strongly driven \nU.S. action, in terms of international approval that otherwise would \nhave been lacking or missing in the situation.\n  We treat these U.N. participations as though they don't count for \nvery much. Yet, around the world, the fact that the United States has \ngone to the United Nations and gotten the United Nations to approve it, \ngives a legitimacy to the activity that might not be there, at least in \nthe eyes of some countries, if the United States were simply to \nundertake it directly, without this approbation from the international \ncommunity.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct. As the Senator will recall, we \ntook this international legitimacy as a basis for our literally asking \nother nations all around the globe to pay the bulk of the moneys for \nDesert Storm. As I recall, over $50 billion was collected from Japan, \nfrom Germany, and from many of the nations that are being cited now as \ncountries to whom we owe money in other peacekeeping endeavors.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator for his questions.\n  Mr. President, during this debate, strangely enough, we have really \nnot argued about the text of the 18 pages that I wish to eliminate with \nmy substitute amendment. No Senator has risen to defend that language \nand the labyrinth of the conditions that are involved in it. Rather, we \nhave had a suggestion that this was the best that could occur, given \nthe players in the legislative drama. I say it is not good enough. As a \nmatter of fact, I believe that very drastic circumstances not in our \ninterest are liable to arise from this language. This is why I make a \npoint of it.\n  I have not generally not offered amendments to this legislation. I \nbelieve the reorganization efforts and a good number of reforms that \nthe committee has brought about in this legislation are important. But \nI believe the particular item we are talking about now with regard to \ncontinuation of the United Nations is a critical item and deserves \nunderlining. It deserves attention, it deserves careful reading by all \nSenators prior to vote on my amendment or on final passage of \nlegislation that will contain this arrears provision.\n  I conclude simply by saying that I believe the United Nations is \nimportant for our foreign policy. I believe we ought to be vigorous in \ntaking international leadership, in making certain that the United \nNations fulfills our aspirations in working constructively with other \nnations. I believe we ought to pay our obligations to other nations. I \nbelieve, as a matter of fact, if we do so, we are likely to be more \neffective in our negotiation with many of the same nations in other \nvital international negotiations that will continue on the expansion of \nNATO, on freer and fairer trade around the globe, and on a number of \nthings that are very important to our security and bread-and-butter \ninterests.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I will ask for the yeas and \nnays. As neither the Chairman nor Ranking Member are on the floor, I \nsuspect the Chair may or may not be in a position to grant that.\n  I will ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, what does constitute a sufficient second? I \nam carrying Senator Biden's proxy. Could we just have a gentleman's \nagreement on that?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There now appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Maryland yield to the \nSenator from North Carolina?\n  Mr. HELMS. We have just one thing we would like to do----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Can I make a 30-second statement, and then I will yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, I simply commend the Senator from Indiana for sounding \nthe alarm in the night, and I very much hope that Members will \ncarefully read through the actual provisions of this legislation. It is \nvery important that they do that. This is a very important issue. I \nthank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 383\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on the same basis that we granted the yeas \nand nays on the question on Senator Lugar's amendment, I ask for the \nyeas and nays on Senator DeWine's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator. We have one more thing that we need \nto do on Senator Gorton's amendment, which we will approve on a voice \nvote.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                 Amendment Nos. 378 and 379, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Durbin and Senator Biden, that amendments Nos. 378 and \n379 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 378 and 379) were withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 384\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Durbin, myself, Senator Helms, Senator Roth, Senator \nBrownback, and Senator Biden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Helms, Mr. Biden, Mr. Roth, and Mr. Brownback, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 384.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title XVI, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . DESIGNATION OF ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES ELIGIBLE FOR \n                   NATO ENLARGEMENT ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (1) Designation of Additional Countries.--Effective 180 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, Romania, \n     Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria are each designated \n     as eligible to receive assistance under the program \n     established under section 203(a) of the NATO Participation \n     Act of 1994 and shall be deemed to have been so designated \n     pursuant to section 203(d)(1) of such Act, except that any \n     such country shall not be so designated if, prior to such \n     effective date, the President certifies to the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives and \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate that the \n     country fails to meet the criteria under section 203(d)(3) of \n     the NATO Participation Act of 1994.\n       (2) Rule of Construction.--The designation of countries \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) as eligible to receive assistance \n     under the program established under section 203(a) of the \n     NATO Participation Act of 1994--\n       (A) is in addition to the designation of other countries by \n     law or pursuant to section 203(d)(2) of such Act as eligible \n     to receive assistance under the program established under \n     section 203(a) of such Act; and\n       (B) shall not preclude the designation by the President of \n     other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe \n     pursuant to section 203(d)(2) of such Act as eligible to \n     receive assistance under the program established under \n     section 203(a) of such Act.\n       (3) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria--\n       (A) are to be commended for their progress toward political \n     and economic reform and\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\n     meeting the guidelines for prospective NATO members;\n       (B) would make an outstanding contribution to furthering \n     the goals of NATO and enhancing stability, freedom, and peace \n     in Europe should they become NATO members; and\n       (C) upon complete satisfaction of all relevant criteria \n     should be invited to become full NATO members at the earliest \n     possible date.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. This amendment, Mr. President, merges together two \namendments related to NATO enlargement offered earlier by Senator \nDurbin in the case of amendment No. 378, and myself and others in \nconnection with amendment No. 379.\n  I understand, through the graciousness and thoughtfulness of the \nsenior Senator from North Carolina and Senator Biden from Delaware, \nthat this amendment has now been agreed to. It does express United \nStates support for working toward the qualification of five nations for \nNATO--the three Baltic States, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, together \nwith Romania and Bulgaria. The latter was suggested by Senator Biden \nand expresses the view of the Senate that when each of those nations \nhas become qualified for that membership, that that membership ought to \nbe granted.\n  I spoke earlier about my strong feelings, strong feelings with which \nI know Senator Durbin particularly concurs, in favor of the Baltics \nafter their long struggle through half a century of darkness to their \nindependence and their growing democracies.\n  Romania, of course, has been suggested by a number of European \ncountries for membership at the current time. It has had dramatic \nchanges toward democracy and responsibility in recent years. Bulgaria, \njust in the last few months, now seems to be moving in that direction.\n  We all feel that as they qualify, they ought to be welcomed into this \nunited group of Western European and North Atlantic nations into the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. Each of them will contribute to it, \neach of them will be strengthened by it, not just from the point of \nview of their physical security, but I might put it their moral \nsecurity as well, their desire to be a part of the world from which \nthey were excluded for so long by the Soviet Union.\n  This amendment is identical, with one exception, to an amendment \nalready passed in the House of Representatives. The wording is \nprecisely the same. Bulgaria, at the suggestion of Senator Biden, has \nbeen added.\n  With that, Mr. President, I think I speak for each of the sponsors \nand I thank Senator Helms for his understanding and support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 384) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nD'Amato be added as a cosponsor to the amendment which was just \napproved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, may I inquire, is Senator Durbin's \namendment No. 377 still pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 377, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Durbin. This amendment modifies the amendment relating to \nthe one filed earlier by him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  Mr. HELMS. Did the Chair understand that the Durbin amendment is \nbeing withdrawn? Perhaps I didn't make it clear.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Durbin amendment No. 377 be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 377) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 385\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, now I send to the desk on behalf of Senator \nDurbin an amendment on the same subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for Mr. \n     Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 385.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XVI, add the following (and conform the \n     table of contents accordingly):\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING UNITED STATES CITIZENS HELD \n                   IN PRISONS IN PERU.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) as a signatory of the International Covenant on Civil \n     and Political Rights, the Government of Peru is obligated to \n     grant prisoners timely legal proceedings pursuant to Article \n     9 of the International Covenant on civil and Political Rights \n     which requires that ``anyone arrested or detained on a \n     criminal charge shall be brought promptly before a judge or \n     other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power \n     and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to \n     release;'' and that ``anyone who is deprived of his liberty \n     by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings \n     before a court, in order that that court may decide without \n     delay on the lawfulness of his detention and order his \n     release if the detention is not lawful;'' and\n       (2) the Government of Peru should take all necessary steps \n     to ensure that any U.S. citizen charged with committing a \n     crime in that country is accorded open and fair proceedings \n     in a civilian court.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Durbin for calling \nattention to the problems with the judicial system in Peru. He has laid \nout some very specific cases of two United States citizens who are \nresidents of his State of Illinois.\n  I would also like to call to the attention of my colleagues the case \nof Ms. Lori Berenson of New York. Ms. Berenson was convicted of treason \nby a secret military tribunal in January 1996. Since then she has been \nserving a very tough sentence under exceeding harsh conditions in the \nYamamayo prison.\n  Mr. President, I do not know about the innocence or guilt of Ms. \nBerenson with respect to the crimes with which she has been charged. \nWhat I do know is that she was not accorded a fair and open trial which \nis a hallmark of any democratic legal system. On August 6, 1996, I \njoined with 19 other Senators in a letter to the President of Peru \ncalling upon him to take all necessary steps to provide an open and \nfair proceeding in civilian court to Ms. Berenson. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of that letter be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the President of Peru, Alberto Fujimori \nnever responded to that letter.\n  The pending amendment would once again call upon the Government of \nPeru to take all necessary steps to provide her with such a trial. I \nwould hope that President Fujimori would take note of this amendment \nand act in this case and the others that Senator Durbin has mentioned.\n  I commend the Senator from Illinois for his very thoughtful and \ntimely amendment. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 6, 1996.\n     President Alberto Kenyo Fujimori Fugimori,\n     Palacio de Gobierno, Plaza de Armas s/n, Lima 1-Peru.\n       Dear President Fujimori: We write to express our deep \n     concern that Ms. Lori H. Berenson, a United States citizen, \n     has not been afforded her rights of due process of\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\n     law. Ms. Berenson was recently convicted of treason by a \n     military tribunal in Peru and is currently imprisoned in \n     Yanamayo prison. The lack of due process at her trial leaves \n     the question of her involvement in illegal activity \n     unanswered.\n       We are particularly concerned that Ms. Berenson did not \n     have an open trial; was not allowed to cross-examine \n     witnesses or challenge evidence; and was tried in a military \n     court by judges whose identities were concealed. Such \n     practices preclude a fair trial. We urge you to take steps to \n     ensure that she is retried before a civilian court which \n     upholds internationally recognized rights of due process.\n       We note that Article 14 of the International Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Peru on April 28, \n     1978, stipulates that:\n       ``Everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing \n     by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal \n     established by law. . . .\n       ``[and is entitled] to examine, or have examined, the \n     witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and \n     examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same \n     conditions as witnesses against him.''\n       In addition, it appears inappropriate to try civilians in a \n     military court. We are aware that the Peruvian Government \n     gave assurances to Assistant Secretary of State Alexander \n     Watson over two years ago that civilians would no longer be \n     tried in military courts.\n       We find it troubling that during the trial of Ms. Berenson, \n     the Peruvian judicial system failed to uphold these and other \n     international standards. The Constitution of the Republic of \n     Peru states that:\n       ``It is the duty of the President of the Republic to obey \n     and ensure obedience to the Constitution and all treaties, \n     laws, and other legal provisions. (Article 118)''\n       While we make no claims concerning Ms. Berenson's alleged \n     guilt, we ask that you take the necessary steps to provide an \n     open and fair proceeding in a civilian court. Indeed, the \n     entire Peruvian judicial system should be brought in line \n     with the solemn international commitments made by the \n     Peruvian Government.\n       We thank you for your attention to our request.\n           Sincerely,\n         James M. Jeffords, Alfonse M. D'Amato, Daniel Patrick \n           Moynihan, Christopher J. Dodd, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, \n           Carl Levin, Paul Simon, John D. Rockefeller IV, \n           Claiborne Pell, Carol Moseley-Braun, Dianne Feinsein, \n           Patty Murray, Barbara Boxer, Patrick J. Leahy, Dale \n           Bumpers, Daniel K. Inouye, Barbara A. Mikulski, David \n           Pryor, Wendell H. Ford, John F. Kerry.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, inasmuch as the amendment now pending by \nSenator Durbin has been approved by both sides, the pending amendment \nmodifies the amendment relating to Peru. There being no objection to \nthat amendment, I propose that it be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 385) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5666-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Utah Jazz, \nwho just completed their most successful season in franchise history. \nAfter clinching the Western Conference Championship with a last-second, \nheart-stopping shot at the buzzer, they competed for the NBA title \nagainst the talented Chicago Bulls with grit and sheer determination. \nThroughout this season, our Utah Jazz have displayed tremendous skill, \ndetermination, strength, and character to forge ahead and accomplish \nwhat very few thought they could do. This team captured the hearts of \nbasketball fans from coast to coast with their hard work, down-to-earth \npersonalities, and belief in themselves.\n  The Utah Jazz story has been filled with many years of strength \nbuilding and even some challenges. In 1979, a struggling NBA basketball \nfranchise pulled up its stakes and moved from New Orleans to what is \nthe smallest market in the National Basketball Association, Salt Lake \nCity, UT. The Jazz have built their program slowly but surely thanks to \nthe big shoulders of some very good people.\n  Jazz owner Larry H. Miller had the determination and the vision to \nknow what it could mean for Utah to have its own NBA basketball team. \nLarry is more than an owner. His players are his family. His love and \nenthusiasm for his Utah Jazz team is infectious. Utah has been greatly \nrewarded through Larry's leadership and commitment.\n  Former coach and current team president, Frank Laydenn has been the \nUtah Jazz' all-time best cheerleader. Frank has always believed in his \nteam. He has won over many fans through his enthusiasm, humor, and love \nfor the game.\n  Coach Jerry Sloan is an example of leadership and fortitude. His \nmotto to ``never give up,'' is evident in the guts and determination \nhis players show on the basketball court. Jerry not only teaches his \nplayers good basketball skills, he also builds character. He has \ninstilled his own hardwork ethic into every aspect of the Utah Jazz.\n  John Stockton, the all-time NBA assist and steals leader, has \ndisplayed time and time again courage under pressure, and an absolute \nbelief that ``we could win.'' The success he has enjoyed has not \ndetracted from his thoughtful, unassuming manner. He is indeed a worthy \nrole model for many young people today.\n  And who else has displayed more utter conviction than league MVP, \nKarl Malone. Karl has provided the Utah Jazz with leadership and valor. \nAnyone who has followed the Utah Jazz knows how valuable Karl is to the \nteam's overall scoring and rebounding capabilities. Aside from his on-\ncourt presence, Karl has been an outstanding ambassador for the NBA. \nHis reputation of honesty and hard work has made him one of the \ngreatest role models in professional sports.\n  Not only am I proud of the Utah Jazz for winning the Western \nConference Championship, I am even more proud of the high caliber of \nindividuals that make up the Utah Jazz. Our team is willing to work \nhard, to believe in themselves, to reflect the values of the community \nin which they play, and to never give up. I am proud of the way they \nrepresent our State and its fans.\n  I am sure that all Utahns would be happy to join with me in saying a \nbig thank you to all of the players on the Jazz, as well as the coaches \nand management staff for all you have done for Utah--both on and off \nthe court. The Utah Jazz united the people of our great State in a way \nthat has not been equaled since Brigham Young led the covered wagons \ninto the Salt Lake Valley. Citizens from all over our State, and from \nall walks of life, have united together behind one single entity--the \nUtah Jazz. This is an accomplishment all its own. The enthusiasm Utahns \nfelt for their team was electric and awe-inspiring. Everyone who has \never felt like an underdog has embraced this team and gloried in its \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, although we didn't bring home the ultimate trophy, our \nUtah Jazz gave us a season to remember. This team has done us all \nproud, and we are proud of them. So, here's\n\n[[Page S5689]]\n\nthanks and best wishes to Karl, and John, Jeff, Greg, Bryon, Shandon, \nHoward, Greg, Antoine, Adams, Chris, Stephen, and Coach Sloan and his \nstaff. And, as a word of warning to all the teams in the NBA--David \nslew plenty of Goliaths this year; watch out, we'll be back next year \nwith a hand full of stones.\n  Go, Jazz!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5688-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE LANDMINE ELIMINATION ACT OF 1977\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last Thursday, 55 of us joined Senators \nLeahy of Vermont and Hagel of Nebraska in cosponsoring the Landmine \nElimination Act of 1977. This landmark legislation will bar, as of \nJanuary 1, 2000, the use of any U.S. funds for new deployments of \nantipersonnel landmines.\n  I am proud to be one of the cosponsors of this legislation, which \naddresses a subject of terrible urgency. Every hour, more innocent \ncivilians are killed or wounded by landmines in Angola, Afghanistan, \nBosnia, Cambodia, Ecuador, and elsewhere. The scourge of landmines is \nso great that the United States and other governments have special aid \nprograms to help locate and destroy landmines left over from the wars \nof the past.\n  The United States is pursuing many avenues to battle this plague. We \nare a signatory of the antipersonnel landmine protocol to the \nConvention on Conventional Weapons, which I would hope the Senate will \ngive its advice and consent to ratification of that protocol sometime \nthis year. That protocol bans undetectable mines, such as the toy-like \nplastic butterfly mines that maim so many children. The United States \nis well on its way toward converting all its nondetectable mines, so \nthere will be very few costs associated with ratification of this \nprotocol.\n  We are also engaged in negotiations in Geneva and working with the \nGovernment of Canada on the projected Ottawa convention in hopes of \nobtaining a worldwide ban on antipersonnel landmines. But those \nnegotiations have left the United States in a quandary. Russia and \nChina--the world's major suppliers of antipersonnel landmines--have \nrefused to participate in the Ottawa process to achieve an immediate \nban on these mines. And Mexico has blocked the U.N. Conference on \nDisarmament from opening the formal negotiations in which Russia and \nChina are willing to participate.\n  Nobody is clear on whether Mexico's step reflects frustration with \nthe idea of gradualism in eliminating antipersonnel landmines, or a \ndesire to continue using such mines in Mexico's own war against the \ndomestic guerrilla movements. What is clear, however, is that bold \nsteps are needed to regain momentum in the crusade to end this most \nhorrendous aspect of modern warfare.\n  Two years ago, two-thirds of this body voted for a moratorium on new \nantipersonnel landmine deployments, beginning in February 1999. The \nLandmine Elimination Act of 1977 will go a giant step further, by \ncommitting the United States to just say no to these mines on January \n1, 2000. This action will put the United States on a higher moral plane \nthan ever before on this issue. With a legally binding commitment to \nend our own role in sowing needless destruction, perhaps we can more \neffectively influence Russia and China and Mexico to step up to the \nresponsibility of protecting the innocents even when we make war on our \nenemies.\n  S. 896 is a carefully constructed bill, Mr. President, and that is a \nsign of the seriousness with which this body approaches the topic of \nlandmines. Subsection 2(d) of the bill permits the President to delay \napplication of the ban with respect to the Korean peninsula on a yearly \nbasis if he determines that new deployments would be indispensable to \nthe defense of the Republic of Korea if war should occur there. This is \na broader exemption than that in the moratorium we passed 2 years ago, \nwhich allows such mining only along international borders and in the \nDMZ. Given the risk that a dying Stalinist regime in North Korea might \nthrow all its forces into a last-gasp effort to conquer the South, this \nbroader exemption is sensible indeed.\n  S. 896 also is clearly limited to the most heinous landmines: Mines \ndelivered by artillery, rocket, mortar, or similar means, or dropped \nfrom an aircraft. The bill goes to state, at subsection 4(b): ``The \nterm `anti-personnel landmines' does not include command-detonated \nClaymore munitions.''\n  Command-detonated landmines do not cause the many civilian casualties \nthat have prompted work action. They are generally set off either by a \nnearby soldier, who waits for the enemy to approach, or by a tripwire \nin an ambush. They are used often to blow up tanks, and do not leave \nthe indiscriminate killing fields that so plague farmers and travelers \nand children today.\n  Nobody is comfortable manufacturing any instrument of death. But at \nleast Claymore munitions are targeted munitions, designed to kill the \nenemy rather than his neighbors and his children.\n  The care with which S. 896 has been drafted makes this a bill that \nall of us can support. I am happy to cosponsor it and I am confident \nthat it will be enacted into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5689-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5689-S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE--H.R. 363\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, when the Subcommittee on Energy Research, \nDevelopment, Production, and Regulation of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee filed its report on H.R. 363, to amend section 2118 \nof the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to extend the Electric and Magnetic \nFields Research and Public Information Dissemination program, the \nestimates from the Congressional Budget Office were not available. The \nreport has now been received and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record for the information of the Senate and the public.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n     H.R. 363--An act to amend section 2118 of the Energy Policy \n         Act of 1992 to extend the Electric and Magnetic Fields \n         Research and Public Information Dissemination program\n       Summary: H.R. 363 would extend and modify the authorization \n     for a multiyear initiative focused on the health effects of \n     electric and magnetic fields. This interagency research \n     effort, which is funded jointly with the private sector, is \n     administered by the Department of Energy (DOE). The current \n     authorization allows the appropriation of up to $65 million \n     over a multiyear period ending in 1997, provided that \n     nonfederal sources match the federal funds. Since the \n     program's inception in 1993, appropriations have totaled $20 \n     million and have been matched by a corresponding amount of \n     nonfederal support. Enacting this legislation would enable \n     the program to receive funding through 1998, and would reduce \n     the multiyear authorization ceiling to $46 million.\n       Assuming funds are appropriated for these activities in \n     1998, CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 363 would result in \n     additional discretionary spending of $4 million over the \n     1998-2002 period. The legislation would not affect direct \n     spending or receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures \n     would not apply. The legislation does not contain any \n     intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n       Estimated cost to the federal government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of H.R. 363 is shown in the table on the \n     following page. For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes \n     that appropriations for this program would total $4 million \n     in 1998, the amount provided under current law for 1997, and \n     that this amount would be matched by nonfederal sources. \n     Although the amount authorized to be appropriated in 1998 \n     could total up to $26 million (the balance between the $46 \n     million cap and the $20 million appropriated to date), CBO \n     estimates that the program only needs about $4 million to \n     complete it mission. We assume outlays would follow \n     historical spending patterns for such research and \n     assessment activities at DOE.\n\n                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION                   \n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 1997   1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpending under current law:                                             \n    Budget authority \\1\\......      4      0      0      0      0      0\n    Estimated outlays.........      5      2      1      0      0      0\nProposed changes:                                                       \n    Authorized level..........      0      4      0      0      0      0\n    Estimated outlays.........      0      2      1      1      0      0\nSpending under H.R. 363:                                                \n    Authorization level \\1\\...      4      4      0      0      0      0\n    Estimated outlays.........      5      4      2      1      0      0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 1997 level is the amount appropriated for that year.            \n\n       The costs of this legislation fall within budget function \n     270 (energy).\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: H.R. 363 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, and \n     would not impose any costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Previous CBO estimate: CBO has prepared cost estimates for \n     two other versions of H.R. 363.

Mr. President, the primary mission of any army is to \nfight and win the wars of the nation which it protects. For the past \n222 years, since June 14, 1776, the soldiers of the United States Army \nhave valiantly and successfully defended the interests, ideals, and \npeople of our Nation.\n  The American Army that was born on that June day a little more than \ntwo centuries ago is very different from the military force that meets \nour Nation's security needs as we prepare to enter the new millenium. \nThe soldiers of our first Army were largely untrained, were poorly and \ninfrequently paid, and faced tremendous logistical burdens. It is truly \ntestament to the leadership abilities of General Washington that he was \nable to hold his troops together in the face of such odds. Of course, \nthe men and women who serve in today's Army receive months of intensive \nand excellent training before they join their units, are paid fair \nwages on a regular basis, and benefit from a commitment to creating a \nprofessional, career oriented force. Despite these differences, one \nthing that has remained constant about those who have served in the \nUnited States Army over the past 222 years is that these are largely \nmen and women who are selfless individuals and who are motivated by a \npatriotic desire to make a difference. From Valley Forge to Sierra \nLeone, no nation's army has benefitted more from the efforts of a finer \narray of people than our's.\n  Throughout its history, the American Army and its soldiers have \nserved with distinction on literally every continent of the world. \nMinutemen, Johnny Reb & Billy Yank, Rough Riders, Doughboys, Dogfaces, \nand GI Joes have stood up to dictators, deposed tyrants, beaten back \ncommunism, defended freedom, and protected all that we hold dear. \nAdditionally, our soldiers have served as a grassroots diplomatic corps \nin combat boots, spreading to people around the globe the knowledge \nthat Americans are peaceful, that there is no finer form of government \nthan democracy, and that we prefer building friendships with the \ncitizens of other nations to fighting them in wars. There is no \nquestion that in many ways, a candy bar given to a small child from a \nsmiling GI is the best form of foreign aid and diplomatic relations \nthat can be undertaken by the United States.\n\n  While the battlefield accomplishments of the United States Army are \nimpressive and unequalled in history, the missions of today's Army go \nfar beyond that of warfighting. In addition to being able to act and \nreact decisively to threats to our Nation no matter where they might \narise, our Army is now tasked with a number of non-traditional missions \nwhich range from providing fresh water to refugees in Rwanda to keeping \nthe peace in Bosnia. Though these missions are more varied and \ndecidedly different from simply containing or destroying our enemies, \nour soldiers have characteristically embraced their new \nresponsibilities without complaint and are carrying out their duties \nprofessionally.\n  As we approach the new century and look to the future, Americans have \ngood cause to be optimistic. Our Nation is enjoying a period of \nprosperiety, the world is in a relativly peaceful state, and we no \nlonger are in a Cold War contest with another superpower, however, we \nmust not allow ourselves to be lulled into a state of complacency. \nWhile things are calm now, we must remember that threats to our \nsecurity and interest can crop up suddenly and we must remain vigiliant \nfor such developments. We cannot ignore our military and those who \nserve in them, to do so would undermine years of hard work and the \nsignificant investment we have made in building the finest and most \ntechnologically advanced fighting forces ever known to man. Clearly the \nArmy will continue to have a critical role in assuring that the United \nStates remains secure and that the world remains a stable place where \ndisputes are resolved in manners short of warfare.\n  Mr. President, as the Army celebrates its 222nd birthday, it is \nimportant that we pause from our duties to remember the men and women \nwho have served in the ranks of this service throughout its history. It \nis easy to forget that those who protect us and who carryout the \npolicies we develop in this Chamber are individuals who are young, \nmaking many sacrifices, and have volunteered to protect the Nation. \nTheir service is invaluable and they should be commended for their \nefforts. On this occasion I say to each of these soldiers, from the \nnewest graduate of Fort Jackson to Chief of Staff Reimer, a happy 222nd \nbirthday and thank you for all you do to keep the United States free \nand safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5690-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5690-S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OBSERVATIONS REGARDING A TRIP TO LEBANON\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I visited Lebanon over the Memorial Day \nrecess in order to assess the security situation there. A number of my \nLebanese-American constituents have contacted me to request that the \nState Department's travel policy for Lebanon be changed, and I also \ndecided to see first-hand the situation there.\n  Pursuant to United States law, the Secretary of State may restrict \nthe use of United States passports for the travel of U.S. citizens to \ncountries with which the United States is at war, where armed \nhostilities are in progress, or where there is imminent danger to the \nhealth or the physical safety of United States travelers. The Secretary \nof State has exercised that authority in the case of Lebanon and \nconsequently U.S. passports are not valid for travel to, in or through \nLebanon unless special validation has been obtained. The passport \nrestriction includes landing at the Beirut airport en route to another \ndestination.\n  Special validation is possible for professional reporters; \nrepresentatives of the American Red Cross traveling pursuant to an \nofficially-sponsored Red Cross mission; compelling humanitarian \nconsiderations such as a critical illness of an immediate family \nmember; family reunification such as a situation where a spouse or \nminor child is residing in Lebanon, with and dependent on, a Lebanese \nspouse or parent for his or her support; or where the travel is found \nto be in the national interest.\n  In view of the limited exceptions to the travel restriction, a number \nof Americans have resorted to the practice of acquiring a Lebanese visa \non a piece of paper separate from their American passports so that they \nwill not encounter any difficulty from U.S. authorities upon returning \nto the United States. I have been advised that forty to fifty thousand \nAmericans travel to Lebanon by this means each year. In doing so, they \nmay be violating U.S. law. Countless other Americans, despite their \nearnest desire to visit relatives or friends in Lebanon, await a change \nin U.S. policy.\n  I traveled to Lebanon with the approval and support of the State \nDepartment. I arrived at the U.S. Embassy compound via U.S. Army \nhelicopter from Cyprus in mid-afternoon on May 29th, spent the night on \nthe embassy compound, and returned to Cyprus by the same means in mid-\nmorning on May 30th.\n  While in Lebanon, I had a busy schedule. I met at length with our \nAmbassador Richard Jones. I also met with Nasrallah Sfeir, 76th \nMaronite Patriarch of Antioch and all of the East; Mohamed Rashid \nQabbani, Grand Mufti of the Republic; IMAM Mohamed Mahdi Shamseddine, \nPresident, Higher Islamic Shi'a Council; Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri; \nPresident Elias Hrawi; and General Emile Lahoud, Commander of the \nLebanese Armed Force. In each instance, the meeting was held at the \nplace where the religious figure or government official was located, \nrequiring travel throughout the city of Beirut and its environs. \nAdditionally, I met with a number of government officials, members of \nthe Lebanese Parliament, and Lebanese businessmen at a dinner at the \nAmerican Embassy hosted by Ambassador Jones.\n\n  I made it a point to ask each individual with whom I met about the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S5691]]\n\nStates travel policy. I was advised that there are large numbers of \nAmericans in Lebanon at all times and that they are safe. Frequent \nreference was made to the recent visit of the Pope to Lebanon. Finally, \nI was told that the U.S. travel policy was keeping relatives apart and \nwas preventing needed U.S. private investment in Lebanon. General \nLahoud pointed out that members of the Hizballah Party, which is the \nprimary security concern of the United States, were elected to and \nparticipating in the Lebanese parliament and that there had not been an \nincident against an American in five years.\n  Significantly, our representatives in Beirut favored a lifting of the \ntravel restriction.\n  Based upon my personal observations during my visit, it is clear to \nme that perceptions about the security situation in Lebanon are \noutdated. There is no substitute for an on-the-scene assessment.\n  Later on the trip I visited Bosnia and I had an opportunity in \nSarajevo to meet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. I urged \nher to send a team to Lebanon to assess the security situation there \nand was pleased when she advised me that she was doing so. I am \nconfident that such an assessment will provide a sound basis for the \nrevision of the current policy and I have written to Secretary Albright \nurging her to change the current U.S. policy. Senator Abraham has \njoined me in writing to Secretary Albright.\n  While I strongly favor a lifting of the travel restriction, I realize \nthat the situation in Lebanon is not normal. Accordingly, in our letter \nto Secretary Albright, we also urged that a travel warning for Lebanon \nbe issued in lieu of the current travel restriction. In addition to \nciting the always possible Hizballah terrorist attacks, I believe that \nthe travel warning should note that as long as foreign military forces \nare present in Lebanon, the situation there is not normalized.\n  I ask unanimous consent that our letter to Secretary Albright be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Secretary of State bears a heavy \nresponsibility when assessing the security situation in a country to \ndetermine if travel restrictions should be applied. The imposition of a \ntravel restriction is rare, as it should be. For example, in the case \nof travel to Somalia, the State Department issued a travel warning on \nJune 28, 1996, which is still in effect, that states that:\n\n       The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all \n     travel to Somalia. Sporadic fighting among local militias \n     continues in parts of the country. Kidnappings and other \n     threats to foreigners occur unpredictably in virtually all \n     regions. There is no national government in Somalia to offer \n     security or police protection for travelers. There is no U.S. \n     diplomatic presence in Somalia to provide consular assistance \n     to U.S. citizens. United Nations peacekeeping forces were \n     withdrawn from Somalia in March 1995 and all U.S. citizens \n     were advised to depart the country.\n\n  In another example, the Department of State travel warning that was \nissued on September 2, 1996 regarding Iraq, states:\n\n       The U.S. Government views with grave concern the latest \n     reports of spreading violence in northern Iraq. Given the \n     government of Iraq's renewed repression, we are strongly \n     recommending that all U.S., citizens leave Iraq.\n\n  Mr. President, based upon my visit to Lebanon, I see no reason to \ntreat Lebanon more restrictively than countries like Somalia and Iraq. \nI strongly believe that the time has come to substitute a travel \nwarning for the current travel restriction with regard to Lebanon.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Madeleine K. Albright,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, DC\n       Dear Madam Secretary: I am writing to you to request a \n     change in the State Department's policy prohibiting the use \n     of a U.S. passport for travel to, in or through Lebanon.\n       My colleague, Senator Spencer Abraham, who is very familiar \n     with these matters and who has received numerous briefings \n     from Administration officials on this policy, joins me in \n     this request.\n       As you know, I visited Beirut, Lebanon from May 29 to May \n     30 via the Beirut Air Bridge that operates out of Cyprus. \n     During my visit to Beirut, I met at length with Ambassador \n     Richard Jones. I also met with Nasrallah Sfeir, 76th Maronite \n     Patriarch of Antioch and all of the East, Mohamed Rashid \n     Qabbani, Grand Mufti of the Republic, IMAM Mohamed Mahdi \n     Shamseddine, President, Higher Islamic Shi'a Council, Prime \n     Minister Rafig Hariri, President Elias Hrawi, and General \n     Emile Lahoud, Commander of the Lebanese Armed Force. In each \n     instance, the meeting was held at the place where the \n     religious figure or government official was located, \n     requiring travel throughout the city of Beirut and its \n     environs. Additionally, I met with a number of government \n     officials, members of the Lebanese Parliament, and Lebanese \n     businessmen at a dinner at the American Embassy hosted by \n     Ambassador Jones.\n       I made it a point to ask each individual with whom I met \n     about the United States travel policy. I was advised that \n     there are large numbers of Americans in Lebanon at all times \n     and that they are safe. Frequent reference was made to the \n     recent visit of the Pope to Lebanon. Finally, I was told that \n     the U.S. travel policy was preventing needed U.S. private \n     investment in Lebanon and was keeping relatives apart. \n     General Lahoud pointed out that members of the Hizballah \n     Party, which is the primary security concern of the United \n     States, were elected to and are participating in the Lebanese \n     parliament and that there had not been an incident against an \n     American in five years.\n       Significantly, Ambassador Jones, the Embassy staff, and the \n     representatives of other U.S. government agencies in Beirut \n     favored a lifting of the travel restriction.\n       During the course of my visit, I learned that a number of \n     U.S. businessmen and, to a lesser extent, U.S. citizens with \n     relatives in Lebanon travel there by obtaining a Lebanese \n     visa which is issued on a piece of paper separate from the \n     visitor's U.S. passport. Unfortunately, as I understand it, \n     that practice avoids problems when the traveler returns to \n     the United States but they still may be violating U.S. law. I \n     have been contacted by a number of my constituents who want \n     to visit their relatives in Lebanon, but are unwilling to \n     violate U.S. policy.\n       Prior to my departure from Washington, I was urged by a \n     high-level U.S. official not to travel to Lebanon because I \n     would not be safe there. Based upon my personal observations \n     during my visit, it is clear to me that perceptions about the \n     security situation in Lebanon are outdated. I was pleased to \n     learn during our meeting in Sarajevo that you are sending \n     people to Lebanon to assess the security situation there. \n     There is no substitute for an on-the-scene assessment. I am \n     confident that such an assessment will provide a sound basis \n     for the revision of the current policy.\n       Finally, we would urge that a travel warning for Lebanon be \n     issued in lieu of the current travel restriction. In addition \n     to citing the threat from Hizballah terrorists, the travel \n     warning should note that as long as foreign military forces \n     are present in Lebanon, that the situation there is not \n     normalized.\n           Sincerely,\n     Spencer Abraham.\n     Carl Levin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5690-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:39 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Iowa; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, this nation is dependent upon the consumption of \n     ever-diminishing domestic crude oil reserves with the United \n     States annually importing foreign petroleum which accounts \n     for 54 percent of the nation's petroleum consumption and \n     contributes to the nation's serious trade deficit; and\n       Whereas, a significant amount of this nation's air \n     pollution is caused by vehicles, emitting a variety of \n     petroleum-based pollutants, including benzene and other \n     aromatics, nitrous oxides, particulate matter in the form of \n     smoke and soot, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide; and\n       Whereas, the state of Iowa ranks as a preeminent \n     agricultural state, leading the nation in the production of \n     corn; and\n       Whereas, the processing of corn into ethanol adds value to \n     this nation's abundant corn crop, increasing net farm income, \n     creating employment opportunities, increasing state and \n     federal tax receipts, reducing this nation's dependence upon \n     foreign nations, and reducing the federal trade deficit; and\n       Whereas, in 1996 ethanol production contributed $1.9 \n     billion to Iowa's economy, affected the employment of 13,250 \n     Iowans, and increased the value of Iowa's corn crop by $335 \n     million; and\n       Whereas, ethanol provides competition in fuel markets and \n     expands consumers' choice of motor fuels which has resulted \n     in a 45 percent market share in the state of Iowa; and\n       Whereas, motor fuel that includes only a 10 percent blend \n     of ethanol contains 3.5 percent oxygen, which enhances octane \n     levels and provides more oxygen for fuel combustion resulting \n     in reduced levels of hazardous emissions such as carbon \n     monoxide and which provides Americans with healthier air to \n     breathe; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress in supporting the need \n     to reduce this nation's dependence upon foreign petroleum, to \n     provide additional markets for domestic corn, to protect the \n     public health, and to preserve the nation's environment, has \n     traditionally encouraged ethanol production and consumption; \n     and\n       Whereas, long-standing bipartisan congressional support for \n     the ethanol industry is reflected by the 5.4 cent federal tax \n     exemption applicable to gasoline formulated using clean \n     burning ethanol; and\n       Whereas, the federal tax exemption, currently scheduled to \n     expire on December 31, 2000, is subject to attack by certain \n     members of the current session of the 105th Congress of the \n     United States, as manifested by H.R. 161 introduced by United \n     States Representative Phil English and H.R. 587 introduced by \n     United States Representative Ken Bentsen, both supported by \n     United States Representative Bill Archer, serving as the \n     Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee: Now therefore\n       Be it resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring, That the general assembly encourage the Congress \n     of the United States to resist all efforts to diminish its \n     traditional support of corn growers and the ethanol industry.\n       Be it further resolved, That the Congress of the United \n     States renew this nation's commitment to the ethanol \n     industry, including by continuing its support of the federal \n     ethanol tax exemption, increasing its commitment to this \n     environmentally benevolent renewable fuel, and taking other \n     actions to increase this nation's commitment to the \n     production and use of ethanol.\n       Be it further resolved, That copies of this Resolution be \n     sent by the Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives to \n     the President of the United States.\n       Be it further resolved, That copies of this Resolution be \n     sent by the Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives to \n     the President of the Senate of the United States; the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives of the United States; the \n     majority and minority leaders of the United States Senate; \n     and the majority and minority leaders of the United States \n     House of Representatives.\n       Be it further resolved, That copies of this Resolution be \n     sent by the Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives to \n     the chairmen and ranking members of the United States Senate \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; the United \n     States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation; the United States Senate Committee on \n     Finance; the United States Senate Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources; the United States House of Representatives \n     Committee on Agriculture; the United States House of \n     Representatives Committee on Ways and Means; the United \n     States House of Representatives Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure; and the United States House of \n     Representatives Committee on Resources.\n       Be it further resolved, That copies of this Resolution be \n     sent by the Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives to \n     the Iowa's congressional delegation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-145. A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, The number of adoptions by American citizens of \n     children born in other countries is increasing more rapidly \n     than any other type of adoptions in the United States. \n     According to the National Council for Adoption (NCFA), in \n     1991 there were 9,008 foreign adoptions in the United States. \n     More than 60%, or 5,409, of the children adopted were under \n     one year of age; and\n       Whereas, In certain countries, war, political turmoil and \n     economic circumstances contribute to a situation in which \n     there are very few prospective individuals interested in \n     adopting in comparison to the vast number of children in need \n     of home. In addition, few countries have designed laws in a \n     way which facilitate the placement of children in permanent \n     homes. Instead, children languish in orphanages or \n     institutions where they suffer the effects of malnutrition, \n     overcrowding, disease, abuse and neglect; and\n       Whereas, Political forces in countries where international \n     adoptions are on the rise condemn the practice of ``giving \n     their children away'' to foreigners, making it more difficult \n     for individuals from outside these countries to adopt \n     children in need of homes. In the United States, Congress has \n     severely limited the scope of foreign adoptions by permitting \n     entry to adoptees that fit the narrowly defined category of \n     ``orphan;'' and\n       Where, Many individuals, such as single men and women and \n     couples over the age of 40, find it difficult to adopt in \n     this country and foreign adoptions afford them the only \n     opportunity to create a permanent family. Certain countries \n     have developed bilateral treaties or other agreements \n     designed to govern adoptions between countries, but most of \n     the cooperations which exists between the United States and \n     other countries when dealing with international adoption \n     issues is found on the adoption agency level; and\n       Whereas, In order to help individuals who are interested in \n     adopting children from other countries, unimpeded access to \n     orphaned and abandoned children should be guaranteed. To \n     accomplish this goal, a legal framework should be \n     established, through treaties or other agreements, in the \n     United States and around the world that would maximize the \n     potential for cooperation among the countries who have \n     children to adopt and the countries whose citizens are \n     interested in adopting those children and remove the barriers \n     which hinder international adoptions: Now, therefore\n       Be it resolved by the General Assembly by the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The United States Department of State is memorialized to \n     adopt a guarantee of unimpeded access to orphaned and \n     abandoned children by Americans as a tenet of foreign policy \n     when negotiating treaties.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested by the Clerk \n     of the General Assembly shall be transmitted to the presiding \n     officers of the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives, the members of the New Jersey Congressional \n     delegation and the Governor of the State of New Jersey.\n\n\n                               statement\n\n       This resolution memorializes the United States Department \n     of State to adopt a guarantee of unimpeded access to orphaned \n     and abandoned children by Americans as a tenet of foreign \n     policy when negotiating treaties. The purpose of the \n     resolution is to urge the federal government to help remove \n     the legal barriers that make it so difficult for Americans to \n     adopt children from other countries.\n       Memorializes the U.S. Department of State to adopt a \n     guarantee of unimpeded access to orphaned and abandoned \n     children by Americans as a tenet of foreign policy when \n     negotiating treaties.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-146.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries with choices, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     THE COMPREHENSIVE MEDICARE REFORM AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise for a moment or two to speak to a \nbill which Senator Mack and I are introducing today on the entire \nquestion of Medicare. So many people around the country have heard \nCongress and elected officials for a long period of time talk about how \nwe need to reform the Medicare Program. The Medicare Program has been a \nwonderful program since 1965. It has assured our senior citizens they \nwill have adequate health care in a period in their lives when health \ncare is vitally important.\n  We have all seen the studies and the reports which clearly point out \nthat unless Congress fundamentally reforms this program, it is not \ngoing to be around for much longer. We clearly see a program that will \nbe bankrupt, which is running out of money, and that has to be a \ntremendous concern not only to our Nation's seniors but also to their \nchildren and their grandchildren and to society at large. \nUnfortunately, every time Congress moves toward trying to reform \nMedicare, we do not do it. We have taken the same approach year in and \nyear out with the thought of fixing Medicare with a Band-Aid type of \napproach instead of addressing the fundamental defects in the program. \nWe have every year said we are going to fix it this year by reducing \nthe reimbursement fees that doctors and hospitals get for treating \nMedicare patients.\n  I said the other day, and others have made this comment, that before \ntoo long doctors and hospitals will refuse to take Medicare patients \nbecause their reimbursement rate from the Government will be less than \nit costs them to do business, that they will simply refuse to take \nMedicare patients any longer.\n  That is already happening in my own family. My mother-in-law just a \nweek ago informed us that after being diagnosed with an ailment of \ndiabetes, in trying to go to a local physician in our State of \nLouisiana, they promptly informed her they do not take Medicare \npatients. I think that is something we all need to be very concerned \nabout. We cannot continue to try to fix Medicare with a proposal that \ntruly does not fix it.\n  What we introduce today is a proposal to make an option available to \nMedicare recipients which is patterned on the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Plan that every Member of the Senate and every Member of the \nHouse and all 9 million Federal employees have.\n  It is a program which is fundamentally different than Medicare \nbecause, unlike Medicare, it is based on competition in the marketplace \nas opposed to arbitrary price fixing of Medicare services, which is the \ncurrent system under Medicare based here in Washington.\n  There was an interesting story in the Washington Post this morning \nwhich talked about how House and Senate committees are looking at \nbringing about reform to Medicare and Medicaid and basing that reform \non the Federal health plan available to Members of Congress and other \nFederal employees. Unfortunately, while the Medicare proposals which \nare now pending in the House and the Senate will increase the range of \noptions available to seniors, they lack the most important feature of \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. That is competition. \nMedicare is the only program that fails to deliver health care based on \ncompetition but does it based on arbitrary price fixing, which is no \nlonger working. The proposals currently in both the House and the \nSenate plan would continue to base what we pay managed care programs on \nwhat we spend on the so-called fee-for-service, currently available \nunder Medicare. And that is the\n\n[[Page S5695]]\n\nproblem. There is not fundamental reform.\n\n  I think most committees are to be commended. Our Finance Committee \ndraft does recognize that there is a problem. But in trying to reduce \nthe costs of Medicare by $115 billion, almost all of those savings come \nout of reducing payments to doctors and hospitals. I have said what the \nproblem is there. Doctors and hospitals will begin to refuse to take \nMedicare patients. That, certainly, is not going to help anyone.\n  So what we are recommending, Senator Mack and I, by our approach, is \nto introduce a test program over a 5-year period to try to \nfundamentally reform Medicare; to set up demonstration projects around \nthe country to allow competitive bidding and negotiations to take part \nin the delivery of Medicare services to seniors in this country. We had \nan interesting report the other day in our Aging Committee that pointed \nout we are overpaying managed care programs under Medicare by almost $2 \nbillion a year more than it is costing them to treat the patients. That \nis because it is not based on competition, but rather on an arbitrary, \nbureaucratic program that is run out of a department here in \nWashington. I don't fault the program managers and the bureaucrats. \nThat is how Congress set it up. But while it may have been a good idea \nin 1965, in 1997 it is no longer working. It is totally out of step \nwith the way health care services need to be delivered in this country.\n  So what the Breaux-Mack proposal says is that we are going to take a \nlook at how the Federal employee plan works; we are going to do some \ndemonstration projects around the country; we are going to take those \nresults, and Congress will act on those results. We will not just let \nthe study sit on a shelf somewhere in a library and not have anything \nhappen with it, but rather we will have the Congress actually take \nthose recommendations and act on those recommendations.\n  We are convinced that with this new approach, Medicare beneficiaries \nwill get more services. We start off with a basic standardized plan \nthat in addition to what is now available to Medicare patients, also \nincludes prescription drugs, which is incredibly important. We also \nguarantee this basic package will be available to all of the people we \nare proposing. But the fundamental difference is they will have more \ninformation about the plans, so the plans will be able to be compared \nfor people to see which plan is the best. So we will create a situation \nwhere Medicare beneficiaries will have more services offered to them, \nmore choices of which plan they would like to consider, more benefits \nunder those plans, and we think we can clearly do it for less money \nthan is being spent on the program right now.\n  One of the features of our program is that it sets up an office of \ncompetition, much like the private plans that are available now to \nFederal employees. We think that an office of competition will be able \nto call for people to actually come in and submit proposals. Then, \nafter they look at these proposals and make sure they meet the \nstandardized package of benefits, they will begin to negotiate with \nthese people who are offering these plans to our seniors in the United \nStates.\n  Competition is a wonderful thing. For the right to treat 38 million \nMedicare recipients, people will compete. They will say, ``Our plan is \nbetter than their plan. Our plan offers more than their plan. Our plan \ncan do it at a better price.'' There will be a competitive world set up \nthat is not now available to Medicare recipients.\n\n  That is the fundamental problem, I think, that the House and Senate \nbills, and respective Finance and Ways and Means Committee bills, do \nnot address. It still says we are going to continue to fix prices out \nof Washington for Medicare recipients. I think that every think tank we \nhave talked to--and Senator Mack and I have met with liberal think \ntanks and conservative think tanks, and people who have spent a \nlifetime studying this problem. Generally, they all have come to the \nsame conclusion--that greater competition in the marketplace will allow \nhealth providers to offer more services to senior citizens and do it at \na better price.\n  So we are going to introduce today legislation that does establish a \nMedicare reform package or proposals which we think represent \nfundamental reform in the system. We are not saying that all seniors \nhave to move into this program immediately. No, we are saying we ought \nto have a demonstration project in 10 cities around the country and in \nrural areas around America, to see how it would work, do this test \nmarketing for about a 5-year period, until we can get a great deal of \ninformation about what is happening out there when you try to reform \nthis system, then take that information and bring it back to the \nCongress and have Congress act on that recommendation. We think that is \nsomething that makes a great deal of sense.\n  I think it is a balanced way to proceed. We are not rushing into it. \nWe are not telling seniors they have to do something overnight, but \nmerely giving them the choice during this period of time. I think that \nis what seniors really want. They want the choice. They want more \ninformation. They want a better benefit package. And all of us want, \nbottom line, to see that this program is going to be around for when we \nmove into it, when our children move into it, when the baby-boomer \ngeneration we hear so much talk about is ready to participate in the \nprogram.\n  We clearly cannot continue down the same path that we have continued \non for so many years, since 1965. We think the Breaux-Mack proposal is \na realistic alternative. It merits bipartisan support, and we hope both \ncommittees ultimately will bring to the floor a type of program based \non what myself and Senator Mack will be introducing in the Congress \ntoday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 905. A bill to establish a national physical fitness and sports \nfoundation to carry out activities to support and supplement the \nmission of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                the sports foundation establishment act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with \nSenator Hollings, the National Physical Fitness and Sports Foundation \nEstablishment Act. This bill would create a charitable, not-for-profit \nfoundation to raise funds from the private sector to support the \nactivities of the President's Council on Physical Fitness.\n  The President's Council presently relies on Federal appropriations to \nsupport its activities. In each of the last 2 fiscal years, the \nPresident's Council has received appropriations of approximately $1 \nmillion. Future appropriations for the Mr. President's Council are at \nrisk as we strive to balance the Federal budget.\n  The foundation created by this bill would raise private funds to \nsustain the President's Council on Physical Fitness. To facilitate \nfundraising, the foundation is permitted to offer the use of the seal \nof the President's Council for promotional purposes in exchange for \nsponsorship funds. The bill does not authorize the expenditure of \nFederal funds.\n  The primary goal of the President's Council is to foster programs \nthat encourage people of all ages to participate regularly in sports \nand physical activities. The President's Council focuses on grassroots, \ncommunity-based programs. Perhaps the Council's most well known \nactivity is the President's Challenge Physical Fitness Awards Program \nwhich is administered by teachers and youth programs across the \ncountry.\n  We should act to preserve the President's Council. Its activities are \nparticularly important because our Nation's children are becoming \nincreasingly less physically fit even as we learn that physical fitness \nin one's youth is important to living a healthy life during adulthood.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Breaux, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Graham):\n\n  S. 906. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe economic activity credit for Puerto Rico, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    THE PUERTO RICO ECONOMIC ACTIVITY CREDIT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Chafee, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\nMoynihan, Senator Breaux, Senator Hatch, and Senator Bob Graham in \nintroducing legislation that will induce investment and create \nemployment in Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since \n1917. Since World War I an estimated 200,000 Puerto Ricans have served \nin the U.S. Armed Forces. Yet, the Puerto Rican unemployment rate is \nmore than twice the national average, its annual per capita income is \nless than half the national average, and well over 50 percent of its \npopulation live below the poverty line. We as a Congress must take \naction to bring Puerto Rico's economy up to the levels that we expect \nfor all Americans.\n  Under current law, section 30A of the Internal Revenue Code provides \na targeted wage credit to companies during business in Puerto Rico \nbased upon the compensation paid to their employees. It does not allow \nnew business starts and the credit terminates in 2006. As a result, \nexisting companies have little incentive to make new investments or \nreplace depreciating plant and equipment. Job losses will occur as \nexisting plants are shut down and these activities may be transferred \nto foreign locations. Net job growth can only occur if new firms start \nup and if expanding firms replace job losses. Manufacturing accounts \nfor more than 40 percent of Puerto Ricos gross domestic product.\n  This legislation expands section 30A to provide an employer tax \ncredit for employees located in Puerto Rico that will also cover new \nbusinesses. This credit is based upon the compensation to their \nemployees. The credit will only remain until economic conditions \nimprove within Puerto Rico including an unemployment rate not to exceed \n150 percent of the U.S. average, per capita income is at least 66 \npercent of the national average, and that the poverty level does not \nexceed 30 percent. The economic conditions for the tax incentives to \nend are modest but achieve significant economic progress for the people \nof Puerto Rico.\n  This legislation serves U.S. fiscal interests. Without spurring job \ncreation in Puerto Rico, the United States will be paying unemployment \nand welfare benefits to people that have a strong work ethic and \nimpressive job skills. Puerto Rico has a labor force of 1.3 million \npeople. Of this total approximately 190,000 are available for \nemployment. We must do everything possible to help facilitate \nemployment for these people.\n  Even though Puerto Rico is located 1,600 miles southeast of New York \nCity, the people of New York have a direct interest in the Puerto Rican \neconomy. Puerto Rican subsidiaries of mainland companies purchase \napproximately $195 million per year worth of supplies and services from \nNew York. Corporations headquartered in New York State that have \ninvested in Puerto Rico employ over 39,000 persons in New York. If \ncorporations are drawn to other regions where there are tax incentives, \nNew York State will not only lose jobs but also significant amounts of \nincome from goods and services.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a powerful economic development \ninitative that is vital to Puerto Rico because of the many hurdles the \npeople face in their struggle for development.

Mr. President, today I am joining Senator D'Amato, \nalong with Senators Chafee, Breaux, Hatch and Graham, in introducing \nbipartisan legislation to improve the existing tax credit for providing \nemployment in Puerto Rico.\n  Economic conditions in Puerto Rico are cause for serious concern. \nOver half of the population lives below the poverty line. Puerto Rico's \naverage annual per capita income of approximately $7,500 is less than \none-third the national average. Its average unemployment rate is well \nover twice the national average of 4.8 percent for May 1997.\n  In recent years, Congress has twice imposed significant tax increases \non companies doing business in Puerto Rico, first in 1993 and again in \n1996. While it is unclear to what extent those tax changes will result \nin employer relocation or lost jobs, they undoubtedly have increased \nthe vulnerability of the economy of Puerto Rico. Exacerbating this \neconomic uncertainty, the tax changes are being phased in at the same \ntime that Puerto Rico faces increased economic competition from low-\nwage Caribbean countries and from Mexico.\n  This legislation would respond to these serious problems by building \non the temporary wage credit that is currently provided in the Internal \nRevenue Code. Employers generally would be eligible for a tax credit \nequal to 60 percent of wages and fringe benefit expenses for employees \nlocated in Puerto Rico. New as well as existing employers would be \nrewarded for providing local jobs. The credit would remain in effect \nuntil the attainment of specific\n\n[[Page S5698]]\n\neconomic goals in Puerto Rico, which would trigger an automatic \nphaseout of the credit.\n  I believe this investment in the long-term economic health and well-\nbeing of Puerto Rico is imperative. It is our obligation to the people \nof Puerto Rico, who are U.S. citizens but not represented in the \nSenate, to take note and address the very serious plight of their \neconomy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to join with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Moynihan, the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, along with both Republicans and Democrats on the Finance \nCommittee to seek a restoration of job creation and economic growth \nincentives for U.S. businesses in Puerto Rico.\n  Last year's tax legislation eliminated the longstanding incentive \nthat applied in Puerto Rico: section 936. Efforts were made to replace \nsection 936 with a new wage credit provision in section 30A, but even \nthat provision is scheduled to expire. The legislation enacted did not \nprovide for any tax benefits for new companies locating in Puerto Rico \nor existing companies expanding their operation on the island. The \nlegislation we introduce today will make permanent wage credit benefits \nof section 30A to companies seeking to locate or expand their \nactivities in Puerto Rico.\n  Puerto Rico's economy is directly related to the economies of Florida \nand many other States. Most of the materials and many services used by \nmanufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico are supplied from the States. \nPuerto Rico is also the center of economic activity for the entire \nstrategic Caribbean region. Any downturn in the economy of Puerto Rico \nwould have serious negative implications for the States that do \nsignificant business with the island as well as for the Caribbean Basin \nas a whole.\n  The bill we introduce today would tie tax benefits directly to wages \npaid and investment made in Puerto Rico. It is targeted, efficient, and \nhas the broad bipartisan support of the public and private sectors in \nPuerto Rico. It is a provision that we should act on now. We should not \nawait a significant downturn in the Puerto Rico economy before taking \naction. It is clearly desirable and necessary to act this year if we \nare to increase economic conditions in Puerto Rico to levels consistent \nwith those we should expect for all American citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n\n  S. 907. A bill to amend the Revenue Act of 1987 to provide a \npermanent extension of the transition rule for certain publicly traded \npartnerships; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          TAX CODE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Baucus in \nintroducing legislation that will amend the Tax Code to provide a \npermanent extension of a grandfather provision contained in the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1987. This 10 year grandfather provision \nwas provided for publicly traded partnerships [PTP's] that were in \nexistence as of December 17, 1987. A PTP is a partnership whose \ninterests are traded on established securities exchanges or are readily \ntradable in secondary markets.\n  Included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 is section \n7704 of the Internal Revenue Code. The section provides that PTP's will \ngenerally be taxed as corporations; income or loss does not pass \nthrough to the partners. Section 7704 does not apply, however, to PTP's \nwhere 90 percent or more of their income is qualifying income, such as \nfrom interest, dividends, real estate, timber, oil, and gas. This \nexception applies regardless when the PTP was formed. Other PTP's in \nexistence when section 7704 was enacted were grandfathered, but only \nfor 10 years, through 1997. Our legislation would extend the \ngrandfather provision permanently.\n  The purpose of section 7704 according to the committee reports was \nintended to stop the long term erosion of the corporate tax base. There \nwas a concern that much of corporate America would convert to PTP's \nresulting in a decline of corporate tax revenues.\n  This purpose has been achieved because of the prospective application \nof that section. There were approximately 120 PTP's in existence in \n1987 and because of the legislation the number of PTP's did not \nsnowball. Permanently grandfathering PTP's would not defeat the purpose \nof the 1987 legislation since the grandfather applies only to those \nPTP's that were in existence at the time of the 1987 legislation.\n  Fairness to the owners of the PTP's that were grandfathered during \nthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 is an important issue. \nThe conversion from a corporation to a PTP was a costly and time-\nconsuming process. The companies that converted to PTP form relied on \nthe expectation that they would be able to operate as partnerships as \nlong as they wanted. The conversion process involved consultation with \ninvestment bankers, appraisals, planning by corporate finance, \nsecurities and tax lawyers, multiple filings with the Securities and \nExchange Commission and State securities agencies, proxy statements and \nshareholder votes, et cetera. This process would not have been started \nor completed had there been any reasonable prospect that a change in \nthe tax law would have applied retroactively or after a limited period \nof time. Failure to pass this legislation will be punishing PTPs that \nplayed by the rules.\n\n  If the grandfather is not made permanent many of these same costs \nwill be incurred once again. Grandfathered PTP's will be forced to \nconvert to corporate form by January 1998. To do so will require \nlengthy planning, and the same investment banking advice, appraisals \nand attorney fees. The need for extensive, advance planning makes it \nessential that the matter be resolved this year. These PTP's relied on \nthe law in effect before passage of the 1987 act and it is unreasonable \nand unfair to now force these PTP's to undergo this expensive, time \nconsuming process to convert to corporate form. No public purpose will \nbe served by such forced conversions.\n  The loss of the grandfather will hurt PTP investors and employees of \nthe companies. The value of PTP units will decline if the grandfather \nis not permanently implemented. Most of these investors are average, \nmiddle-class taxpayers who have invested in PTP units oftentimes \nthrough an individual retirement account, because of the desire for a \nsafe, liquid investment. As PTP units decline in value, a company's \nability to expand will be negatively affected and the employees will \nsuffer.\n  We do not achieve any tax policy goal by honoring the 10-year \ngrandfather. That goal was fully achieved by making section 7704 apply \nprospectively. Instead, all we would accomplish by not making the \ngrandfather provision permanent would be harm to these PTP's and their \ninvestors. The PTP's operate in all 50 States affecting many of our \ndistricts and include a wide variety of industries, from motels and \nrestaurants to chemicals and financial advising. The most recent count \nindicates that there are well over 300,000 individual investors.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin me and Senator Baucus in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the \nbill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 907\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF TRANSITION RULE FOR CERTAIN \n                   PUBLICLY TRADED PARTNERSHIPS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 10211(c) of the \n     Revenue Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-203) is amended to read \n     as follows:\n       ``(1) In general.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1987, except that such amendments shall not apply to any \n     existing partnership.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the provisions of section \n     10211 of the Revenue Act of 1987.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, \nSenator D'Amato, in introducing this legislation, which would \npermanently extend the 10-year grandfather for publicly traded \npartnerships [PTP's].\n  PTP's were first created in the early 1980's for the purpose of \ncombining the traditional limited partnership form with the ability to \nhave the partnership units freely traded on established securities or \nsecondary markets. When Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1987, it included a\n\n[[Page S5699]]\n\nprovision which reversed existing law at the time by requiring that \nPTP's would generally be treated as corporations for income tax \npurposes. The act completely exempted certain types of PTP's from the \nlaw, primarily those whose income is derived from resources such as \ntimber, oil and gas, minerals, and real estate. PTP's which did not \nmeet the criteria were given a 10-year transition period, after which \nthey would no longer be exempted from the new requirements. This \ntransition period, the grandfather, expires at the end of 1997. Our \nbill would extend it permanently.\n  Mr. President, there is no public or tax policy reason for treating \nthe grandfathered PTP's differently than those completely exempted from \nthe law. All of the PTP's relied upon the law that was in effect when \nthey were created. They are all similarly structured and deserve the \nsame right to preserve their partnership status, regardless of the line \nof business in which they operate. There are only 27 of them remaining, \nand they are involved in a wide variety of industries, from motels and \nrestaurants to chemicals, financial advising and macadamia nuts. They \nwent through a costly and time-consuming process in order to convert \nfrom a corporation to a PTP in the first place, and will incur many of \nthe same costs if they are now required to convert back to corporate \nform when the grandfather expires in January.\n  More importantly, I am concerned about the effect that the loss of \nthe grandfather will have on PTP investors. It is a virtual certainty \nthat the value of PTP units will be adversely affected if the \ngrandfather expires, reducing the value of the investor's holdings. \nMost of these investors are average, middle-class taxpayers, many of \nthem elderly, who invested in PTP units because of their high yield. \nThey are scattered throughout the country, and at last count numbered \nover 300,000. Many made this investment before the 1987 act was passed.\n  There is no tax policy goal that will be achieved by allowing the \ngrandfather to expire. That goal was fully achieved by making the law \napply prospectively. All we accomplish is inflicting harm on these \nPTP's and their investors, without their having done anything illegal \nor improper when they were created. With this action, all remaining \nPTP's would be treated uniformly under the law. If the legislation is \nincorporated into this year's reconciliation bill, it will be as a \nrevenue-neutral measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 908. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in a water conservation project with the Tumalo Irrigation \nDistrict, OR; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\nTHE TUMALO IRRIGATION DISTRICT WATER CONSERVATION PROJECT AUTHORIZATION \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am today introducing \nlegislation to authorize financial assistance to the Tumalo Irrigation \nDistrict for the construction of water system improvements for the \npurposes of efficient utilization of water and to increase water for \nin-stream flows in Tumalo Creek and the Deschutes River basin.\n  The district will conserve approximately 40,000 acre feet of water \nper year upon completion of the project. This conservation will allow \nthe diversions from the Deschutes River and Tumalo Creek to be reduced \nby about 32,000 acre-feet. This increased in-stream waterflow will \nimprove water quality, fisheries, increase opportunities for \nrecreation, and enhance fire protection with the possible installation \nof hydrants.\n  This legislation also has the added benefit of local funding with 50 \npercent coming from the district, State, and community. This project \nwill be completed in phases with the recommended total appropriation at \n$15,000,000.\n  I am proud of the district's work to improve in-stream flows. This is \na positive solution to the inefficient and environmentally unsound \nsystem now in place. Oregon has long demonstrated its ability to \nidentify innovative and progressive solutions, and I believe that this \nlegislation will allow the Tumalo Irrigation District to proudly \ncontinue that tradition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \ninserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 908\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress Assembled, That this \n     Act may be cited as the ``Tumalo Irrigation District Water \n     Conservation Project Authorization Act''.\n       Sec. 2. At the request of the Tumalo Irrigation District, \n     Oregon, the Secretary of the Interior may participate in the \n     design, planning, and construction of a comprehensive water \n     conservation project by the District. The federal share of \n     the costs of such project may not exceed 50 percent.\n       Sec. 3. There are authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Secretary of the Interior, plus or minus such amounts as may \n     be justified by reason of ordinary fluctuations of applicable \n     cost indexes, not to exceed $15,000,000 for the federal share \n     of costs related to the project.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Hollings):\n\n  S. 909. A bill to encourage and facilitate the creation of secure \npublic networks for communication, commerce, education, medicine, and \ngovernment; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                       Secure Public Networks Act\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, earlier, I sent to the desk a bill that I \nintroduced on behalf of myself, Senator McCain of Arizona, Senator John \nKerry of Massachusetts, and Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina. \nThe bill is called the Secure Public Networks Act of 1997, and it \nestablishes as a priority that we are going to try with our law to \ndevelop a mechanism whereby, in collaboration with the private sector, \nthe U.S. Government can work to secure these public networks upon which \nour commerce depends, our Government operations depend, and \nincreasingly our national security depends.\n  Secure public networks are essential to the protection of personal \nprivacy and the promotion of commerce on the Internet and other \ncommunications networks. Without trust in the system, the Internet will \nnever reach its full potential as a new form of communications in \ncommerce.\n  I believe there is an urgent need to enact legislation this year \nwhich can promote the creation and use of new networks, provide the \nsecurity American citizens require in their communications and balance \nAmerica's compelling interest in commerce and public safety.\n  Congress has been gridlocked for more than a year in the debate about \nthe Nation's export policy for encryption products. Our Nation's policy \non encryption is only a single piece of the puzzle, however. We need to \nensure that the whole system of our public communications networks \nprovides the security required.\n  There are three large interests, as I see it, at stake in this entire \ndebate. One of the reasons there is an urgency to develop new \nlegislation and enact new legislation that the President will be able \nto sign this year is that unless these networks are secure, we risk all \nthree.\n  The first is in the area of commerce. The increasing amount of \nbusiness that is being done on the network and the failure to be able \nto establish security on an international basis risks the full \ndevelopment potential of commercial networks.\n  The second is in the area of Government operations itself. Not only \nare there concerns in the private sector but on the Government side, \nfrom the Internal Revenue Service even to the operations of schools, \nthat we need to have a secure public network. Obviously, if we are \ngoing to develop fully the electronic filing system--and for \ncolleagues' reference, less than 1 percent error rate occurs in \nelectronic filing, where nearly a 25-percent filing rate occurs in \npaper filing, there is a potential for saving money.\n  In addition to that, there is an increasing amount of education that \nis occurring on the network, once again offering a tremendous amount of \nsavings for individuals who look for ways to leverage intellectual \nproperty and increase the efficiency of education. You need look no \nfurther than what is going on now in the area of education on the \nnetwork, but it needs to be secure.\n\n[[Page S5700]]\n\n  In the area of law enforcement, again, there is an offensive and \ndefensive capability, and I am addressing at this instance the \ndefensive capability, our ability to be able to communicate, for \nnational security reasons, and our ability to be able to communicate \nfor law enforcement reasons and know those communications are secure is \nthe first order of business of the Secure Public Networks Act of 1997.\n  Our commercial interests, Mr. President, lie in maintaining American \ncompanies' leading position as producers of software and in the \npromotion of commerce on-line on the Internet. I do not believe we can \nfully achieve either of these objectives if the current law remains \nunchanged.\n  Second, the American people should be able to have secure access to \ntheir Government, as I indicated before, not just with the IRS, but \nalso a whole range of other services, including the Government job of \neducating our people. There is a tremendous requirement in every single \noperation of Government for the consumer of those services to know that \ntheir communication is secure, that there is no manipulation of the \ndata, no transference of that data.\n  And as I said, again, thirdly, there is a public safety interest in \nmeeting the needs of law enforcement and national defense. Here a \nsecure public network can provide both defensive and offensive \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, the greatest threat to our citizens' privacy is very \noften described by some advocates of change as being the Government. \nThey are afraid of the Government interfering with their privacy. But I \nurge my colleagues to consider what the marketplace sees out there, \nwhich is that increasingly it is the private-sector interests that are \nthe greatest threat to the privacy of citizens.\n  For example, the FBI reported last month that a hacker collected \n100,000 credit card numbers from an Internet provider and then \nattempted to sell these numbers for cash. This is a private-sector \nindividual out there, obviously very skilled. These hackers and \ncrackers are skilled way beyond my capacity to understand what they are \ndoing, except to know that they have the ability to come in and steal \ninformation that has great value, to manipulate that data and do not \njust a little bit of mischief but put our commercial and our national \nsecurity interests at risk.\n  There was a story in the New York Times last week, Mr. President, \nthat detailed the trauma and the horror faced in 1994 by a Texas woman \nwho received a letter full of threatening sexual comments from an \ninmate in a Texas prison. She asked the question, ``How did this inmate \nget access to the information?'' and was surprised to discover that her \npersonal life had become available as a result of a private-sector \ncompany's use of Texas inmates to do input into their data bases.\n  There was another example in this same article about a 1993 employee \nat a car dealership in New Jersey using their company's access to \ncredit information to open false accounts in their customers' names and \ncharging up thousands of dollars of merchandise with the fraudulent \ncards.\n  Another example, in 1995, a convicted child rapist, working in a \nBoston hospital, used a former fellow employee's password to access \ninformation on the hospital's patients. He found the phone numbers of \nyoung patients in the area, and then made obscene phone calls to girls \nas young as 8 years old.\n  There are many other examples that one could give. The point that I \nam trying to make, Mr. President, is, as this debate unfolds, one of \nthe things you will hear immediately is that this legislation is an \nattempt by Government to gain access over the privacy of individuals. \nThat is simply not true. There is protection after protection after \nprotection in this legislation guarding against that.\n  This is an attempt to tighten up the security so that we know that a \nprivate individual, as I indicated here earlier with three or four \nexamples, does not have the opportunity to either come in and intercept \nyour communication or go into your data base and retrieve information \nthat they will use against you or manipulate a data base so as to \nengage in fraudulent transactions that could cost not only the \ncompanies but could cost the individual substantial amounts of money.\n  To provide privacy protection and help prevent abuse of public \nnetworks, the Secure Public Networks Act makes it illegal for a person \nto use encryption to commit a crime; to exceed lawful authority in \ndecrypting data or communications; to break the encryption code of \nanother for the purpose of violating privacy, security, and property \nrights; to steal intellectual property on a public communications \nnetwork; and to misuse key recovery information.\n\n  This act fully protects and strengthens the privacy rights of the \nindividual without damaging the interest of public safety. Law \nenforcement will be granted access to key recovery information only if \nthey have authority based on existing statute, rule or law. Audits will \nbe performed by the Department of Justice which will ensure this \nprocess is not circumvented or abused, and I would expect these audits \nto be available to the appropriate congressional oversight committees.\n  Both the Government and the private sector need to work together to \ncreate the infrastructure and technology that will give the users total \nconfidence in the security of commercial transactions and personal \ncommunications. As the largest purchaser of computer software and \nhardware, the Federal Government can create important incentives to \nhelp the market fulfill this need.\n  The idea here, Mr. President, is to say that the Federal law can \nprovide incentives for market-based solutions. It will be for the most \npart the market that solves these problems and determines what kind of \ntechnology will be used in the solution of these problems. The Secure \nPublic Networks Act of 1997, however, provides a framework and some \nstandardization to make certain that we expedite that happening.\n  This act also sets up a voluntary registration system for public key \ncertificate authorities and key recovery agents which help build \nconfidence in the secure public network. Since the Internet is \ninternational and online commerce will be worldwide, the United States \nalone cannot develop a secure public network on the scale necessary to \naddress this technology. Our legislation therefore, Mr. President, \ncalls on the President to continue consultations and negotiations with \nforeign countries to ensure secure public networks are built on a \nglobal scale.\n  The Secure Public Networks Act creates an advisory panel with \nindustry representatives to assist the Government in adapting policies \nto meet changing technology and changing commercial situations. This \npanel will also advise the Secretary of Commerce on the commercial \nsituation American companies face overseas and recommend changes in \nU.S. policy to assist industry.\n  The act also calls for additional Federal research to facilitate the \ncreation of secure public networks and the cooperation and coordination \nof departments and agencies on both Federal and State levels to ensure \nthe development of secure public networks.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Secure Public Networks Act of 1997 will \nmove our Nation closer to secure computer and telecommunications \nnetworks and help resolve the debate on encryption as well. The \nalternative to the rule of law in this dynamic area is chaos and \nanarchy, a condition which will prevent Internet-type networks from \nreaching their full potential and which will hurt the interests of \nindustry, the interests of the public, and the interests of law \nenforcement and national security. Congress' duty to make laws to \nstrengthen these networks is clear. I suggest we set a public goal of \ngetting a bill to the President by October 1. I believe if we set a \ngoal of this kind and stick to it, we will enable not only the market \nto develop, but it will enable us to provide the security needed for us \nto be able to move Government operations into the new paradigm of \nnetwork activity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 910. A bill to authorize appropriations for carrying out the \nEarthquake Hazard Reduction Act of 1977 for fiscal years 1998 and 1999, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n[[Page S5701]]\n\n the 1998-99 reauthorization of the earthquake hazard reduction act of \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the 1998-99 \nReauthorization of the Earthquake Hazard Reduction Act of 1977. This \npiece of legislation reauthorizes the agencies that are working to \nreduce earthquake hazards throughout the Nation. These four agencies: \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], which serves as the \nlead agency, the U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], National Science \nFoundation [NSF], and National Institute of Standards and Technology \n[NIST], each play a critical role in this important mission.\n  This bill continues the funding for agency activities including \nresearch, hazard assessment, and public education, and moves these \nactivities forward. It also builds upon the national seismic network, \nimproving its capability, and forming the basis for a real-time seismic \nhazard warning system. A real-time warning system has the potential for \nsaving lives by alerting people outside the immediate area of an \nimpending seismic shock. Advance warning can be critical in preventing \ninjury in many sectors of modern life, such as high-speed trail \ntransportation.\n  This reauthorization has an important provision which underscores our \ncommitment to education. This bill would let NSF create and disseminate \nEarth science educational materials in a way that permits easy access \nby educators and the general public. Acknowledging that FEMA and NSF \nhave both done an outstanding job in creating educational material, we \nare looking for continued cooperation of all the agencies, one of the \nhallmarks of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program [NEHRP].\n  Mr. President, I believe that the passage of this legislation will \ncontinue of the good work that these four agencies have been \nundertaking--work that saves property, but most importantly, saves \nAmerican lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 910\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax to individuals who are active participants in \nneighborhood crime watch organizations which actively involve the \ncommunity in the reduction of local crime; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n            taking back our neighborhoods crime fighting act\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Taking \nBack Our Neighborhoods Crime Fighting Act. This bill has already been \nintroduced in the House by Representative Bob Filner, and I thank him \nfor his efforts in crafting this innovative and exciting approach to \nneighborhood crime fighting.\n  Mr. President, this is a very simple bill. Our legislation would \nprovide a $50 tax credit to any American who actively participates in a \nNeighborhood Watch or other local crime fighting program. These local, \ncitizen-run initiatives have proven extremely effective in reducing \ncrime and restoring confidence in the safety of our local communities.\n  Neighborhood Watch programs empower residents and bring neighbors \ntogether, creating a renewed sense of community, and common purpose. \nWorking hand in hand with law enforcement, these groups are a vital \npart of the community policing which has been so successful in \ndramatically reducing crime over the last few years. It is no wonder \nthat this tax credit proposal has received support from hundreds of \npublic officials, including dozens of big city mayors, local sheriffs, \npolice chiefs, and district attorneys.\n  Mr. President, by providing this tax credit, we focus attention on \nthe benefits of these local programs, and we reward those who already \nparticipate with a small token of appreciation. But more importantly, \nwe also provide one more incentive to those who may have been reluctant \nto join a local group, or perhaps just didn't take the time to look \ninto it. We hope that this additional incentive will create the final \npush needed to encourage everyone in our communities to join in the \neffort to stop crime and take back our streets.\n  Even if people intend to go just a couple of times in order to \nqualify for the tax credit, I am certain that many of them will become \nactive and lifelong participants once they are exposed to what \nNeighborhood Watch is all about.\n  Mr. President, just a few months ago I traveled to a Newark townhouse \nand paid a visit to a courageous woman named Donna Cherry. Tired of the \nviolence and the gunshots plaguing her neighborhood, Donna Cherry took \nmatters into her own hands and formed a neighborhood watch organization \nto protect her community. Starting within her own townhouse complex, \nshe and the group soon set their sights on surrounding areas. Members \nof the group patrol the streets, log and report suspicious activity, \nand plan youth conferences to educate local children about cooperation \nand making the right choices. By their actions--indeed simply by their \nvisible presence on the streets of their community--these people \nundoubtedly deter crime.\n  When I visited that neighborhood in March, I assured the group that \nthe Federal Government would always stand behind efforts within \ncommunities to cooperate in the fight against crime--valiant efforts to \nsave communities should not fail for lack of resources. We already \nprovide indirect Federal funding for many of these groups, but funding \nis useless without the people to use it efficiently. Our bill will \nprovide one more tool for community leaders like Donna Cherry to \nrecruit new members and clean up our communities.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \neconomical and exciting bill to encourage local crime fighting. Every \nstep we take towards encouraging citizen action is a step toward the \nreduction of crime in our communities. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 911\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for certain military retirees and \ndependents a special medicare part B enrollment period during which the \nlate enrollment penalty is waived and a special medigap open period \nduring which no underwriting is permitted; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      medicare part b legislation\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that \nwould provide for certain military retirees a special Medicare part B \nenrollment period during which the late enrollment penalty is waived.\n  Major changes in the Department of Defense's [DOD] health care \ndelivery system, including the introduction of a managed care program \ncalled TRICARE and the closing or downsizing of many military medical \nfacilities, have hindered access to health care services for older \nmilitary retirees, or those aged 65 and over. It is important to note \nthat the TRICARE Program was designed for active duty and CHAMPUS \neligible beneficiaries and the overall intent is for those aged 65 and \nolder to receive their health care through the Medicare Program.\n  Many of our country's military retirees moved close to bases in order \nto receive care from these facilities. Due to the fact that they had \nmedical services available on base, before the implementation of \nTRICARE and base closures, many of these retirees did not sign up for \nmedicare part B. Once their access was restricted, many elected to \nchoose part B after the enrollment period expired and were therefore \nslapped with a penalty for signing up late. Others chose not to sign up \nat all because they were unable to afford the late enrollment penalty.\n  Thus, waiving the part B penalty for those retirees who dedicated \ntheir lives to serving our country is a matter of justice. There was no \nway that military retirees could have anticipated the changes that have \noccurred within the DOD's health care delivery system.\n  Further, these changes were completely out of their control.\n  Mr. President, the Senate must act now. This measure rectifies the \nunfairness inherent in the Medicare part B penalty on certain military \nretirees and honors our Nation's commitment to those individuals who \nselflessly served our country through many years of military service. I \nlook forward to the Senate's consideration of this proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

S. 903, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of title XVI of division B of the bill, insert \n     the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . EXCLUSION FROM THE UNITED STATES OF ALIENS WHO HAVE \n                   BEEN INVOLVED IN EXTRAJUDICIAL AND POLITICAL \n                   KILLINGS IN HAITI.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) At the time of the enactment of this Act, there have \n     been over eighty extrajudicial and political killing cases \n     assigned to the Haitian Special Investigative Unit (SIU) by \n     the Government of Haiti. Furthermore, the government has \n     requested that the SIU investigate on a ``priority basis'' \n     close to two dozen cases relating to extrajudicial and \n     political killings.\n       (2) President Jean-Bertrand Aristide lived in exile in the \n     United States after he was overthrown by a military coup on \n     September 30, 1991. During his exile, political and \n     extrajudicial killings occurred in Haiti including Aristide \n     financial supporter Antoine Izmery, who was killed on \n     September 11, 1993; Guy Malary, Aristide's Minister of \n     Justice, who was killed on October 14, 1993; and Father Jean-\n     Marie Vincent, a supporter of Aristide, was killed on August \n     28, 1992.\n\n[[Page S5705]]\n\n       (3) President Aristide returned to Haiti on October 15, \n     1994, after some 20,000 United States troops, under the code \n     name Operation Uphold Democracy, entered Haiti as the lead \n     force in a multi-national force with the objective of \n     restoring democratic rule.\n       (4) From June 25, 1995, through October 1995, elections \n     were held where pro-Aristide candidates won a large share of \n     the parliamentary and local government seats.\n       (5) On March 28, 1995, a leading opposition leader to \n     Aristide, Attorney Mireille Durocher Bertin, and a client, \n     Eugene Baillergeau, were gunned down in Ms. Bertin's car.\n       (6) On May 22, 1995, Michel Gonzalez, Haitian businessman \n     and Aristide's next door neighbor, was killed in a drive-by \n     shooting after alleged attempts by Aristide to acquire his \n     property.\n       (7) After Aristide regained power, three former top Army \n     officers were assassinated: Colonel Max Mayard on March 10, \n     1995; Colonel Michelange Hermann on May 24, 1995; and \n     Brigadier General Romulus Dumarsais was killed on June 27, \n     1995.\n       (8) Presidential elections were held on December 17, 1995. \n     Rene Preval, an Aristide supporter, won, with 89 percent of \n     the votes cast, but with a low voter turnout of only 28 \n     percent, and with many parties allegedly boycotting the \n     election. Preval took office on February 7, 1996.\n       (9) On March 6,1996, police and ministerial security guards \n     killed at least six men during a raid in Cite Soleil, a Port-\n     au-Prince slum.\n       (10) On August 20,1996, two opposition politicians, Jacques \n     Fleurival and Baptist Pastor Antoine Leroy were gunned down \n     outside Fleurival's home.\n       (11) Other alleged extrajudicial and political killings \n     include the deaths of Claude Yves Marie, Mario Beaubrun, \n     Leslie Grimar, Joseph Chilove, and Jean-Hubert Feuille.\n       (12) Although the Haitian Government claims to have \n     terminated from employment several suspects in the killings, \n     some whom have received training from United States advisors, \n     there has been no substantial progress made in the \n     investigation that has led to the prosecution of any of the \n     above-referenced extrajudicial and political killings.\n       (13) The expiration of the mandate of the United Nations \n     Support Mission in Haiti has been extended three times, the \n     last to July 31, 1997. The Administration has indicated that \n     a fourth extension through November 1997, may be necessary to \n     ensure the transition to a democratic government.\n       (b) Grounds for Exclusion.--The Secretary of State shall \n     deny a visa to, and the Attorney General shall exclude from \n     the United States, any alien who the Secretary of State has \n     reason to believe is a person who--\n       (1) has been credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted in, the extrajudicial and political \n     killings of Antoine Izmery, Guy Malary, Father Jean-Marie \n     Vincent, Pastor Antoine Leroy, Jacques Fleurival, Mireille \n     Durocher Bertin, Eugene Baillergeau, Michelange Hermann, Max \n     Mayard, Romulus Dumarsais, Claude Yves Marie, Mario Beaubrun, \n     Leslie Grimar, Joseph Chilove, Michel Gonzalez, and Jean-\n     Hubert Feuille;\n       (2) has been included in the list presented to former \n     president Jean-Bertrand Aristide by former National Security \n     Council Advisor Anthony Lake in December 1995, and acted upon \n     by President Rene Preval;\n       (3) was a member of the Haitian presidential security unit \n     who has been credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted in, the extrajudicial and political \n     killings of Pastor Antoine Leroy and Jacques Fleurival, or \n     who was suspended by President Preval for his involvement in \n     or knowledge of the Leroy and Fleurival killings on August \n     20, 1996; or\n       (4) was sought for an interview by the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation as part of its inquiry into the March 28, 1995, \n     murder of Mireille Durocher Bertin and Eugene Baillergeau, \n     Jr., and were credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, \n     or materially assisted, in those murders, per a June 28, \n     1995, letter to the then Minister of Justice of the \n     Government of Haiti, Jean-Joseph Exume.\n       (c) Exemption.--This section shall not apply where the \n     Secretary of State finds, on a case by case basis, that the \n     entry into the United States of the person who would \n     otherwise be excluded under this section is necessary for \n     medical reasons, or such person has cooperated fully with the \n     investigation of these political murders.

In \n     Shanghai, for example, more than 300 house churches or \n     meeting points were closed down by the security authorities \n     in April alone.''.\n       (4) The People's Republic of China's compulsory family \n     planning policies include forced abortions.\n       (5) China's attempts to intimidate Taiwan and the \n     activities of its military, the People's Liberation Army, \n     both in the United States and abroad, are of major concern.\n       (6) The Chinese government has threatened international \n     stability through its weapons sales to regimes, including \n     Iran and Iraq, that sponsor terrorism and pose a direct \n     threat to American military personnel and interests.\n       (7) The efforts of two Chinese companies, the China North \n     Industries Group (NORINCO) and the China Poly Group (POLY), \n     deserve special rebuke for their involvement in the sale of \n     AK-47 machine guns to California street gangs.\n       (8) Allegations of the Chinese government's involvement in \n     our political system may involve both civil and criminal \n     violations of our laws.\n       (9) The Senate is concerned that China may violate the 1984 \n     Sino-British Joint Declaration transferring Hong Kong from \n     British to Chinese rule by limiting political and economic \n     freedom in Hong Kong.\n       (10) The Senate strongly believes time has come to take \n     steps that would signal to Chinese leaders that religious \n     persecution, human rights abuses, forced abortions, military \n     threats and weapons proliferation, and attempts to influence \n     American elections are unacceptable to the American people.\n       (11) The United States should signal its disapproval of \n     Chinese government actions through targeted sanctions, while \n     at the same time encouraging worthwhile economic and cultural \n     exchanges that can lead to positive change in China.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should--\n       (1) limit the granting of United States visas to Chinese \n     government offices who work in entities the implementation of \n     China's laws and directives on religious practices and \n     coercive family planning, and those official materially \n     involved in the massacre of Chinese students in Tiananmen \n     square;\n       (2) limit United States taxpayer subsidies for the Chinese \n     government through multilateral development institutions such \n     as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the \n     International Monetary Fund;\n       (3) reduce United States financial assistance to \n     international bodies and organizations that provide family \n     planning assistance to the Chinese government;\n       (4) publish a list of all companies owned in part or wholly \n     by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the Chinese \n     government who export to, or have an office in, the United \n     States;\n       (5) impose targeted sanctions on NORINCO and POLY by not \n     allowing them to export to, nor to maintain a physical \n     presence in, the United States for a period one year; and\n       (6) promote democratic values in China by increasing United \n     States Government funding of Radio Free Asia, the National \n     Endowment for Democracy's programs in China and existing \n     students, cultural, and legislative exchange programs between \n     the United States and the People's Republic of China.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 387\n\n       On page 155, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n           TITLE XVIII--ADVANCEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA\n\n     SEC. 1701.

Mr. President, this week, the Senate Finance \nCommittee will begin consideration of the tax portion of this year's \nbudget agreement. I strongly support the pro-family and pro-growth \nportions of that package and I intend to discuss these provisions at a \nlater time. Today, I wanted to address the Senate regarding a smaller \ntax issue of interest to the State of Michigan and communities \nnationwide--targeting tax benefits at brownfields.\n  Mr. President, brownfields are abandoned commercial and industrial \nproperties which are suspected of being environmentally contaminated. \nEarlier this year, I visited several locations in Michigan which fit \nthis definition, and I want to relate to the Senate why this is an \nissue of national importance. It is an issue of community renewal, \neconomic growth, job creation, and environmental remediation.\n  Heatherwood Farms in Lansing, MI is a good example of how brownfields \naffect all these issues. Located in a middle-class residential \nneighborhood with several other commercial properties, it was the \nformer site of an industrial\n\n[[Page S5710]]\n\nwarehouse for over 50 years. According to the Michigan Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, assessment work is needed to verify whether the \nproperty is contaminated with PCB's, chemical solvents, asbestos, and \nother contaminants.\n  Mr. President, who will conduct this work? The former owners are \nbankrupt. The State government doesn't have the resources to \ninvestigate every abandoned industrial site in Michigan. And potential \npurchasers are scared away by tax and environmental laws that combine \nfew benefits with unlimited liability.\n  The city of Flint faces the same dilemma, where the former site of \nThrall Oil Co. now sits vacant. Economic development officials believe \nthis property should attract future manufacturing development, but, \nbecause the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality has labelled \nit ``contaminated,'' developers cannot be found.\n  This problem is not limited to Michigan. Across the country, there \nare over 30,000 sites similar to Heatherwood Farms --abandoned former \nindustrial sites which may or may not be contaminated. A survey of \nToledo, OH businesses found that environmental concerns were affecting \n62 percent of the area's commercial and industrial real estate \ntransactions. The result is lost jobs and opportunities for the \nresidents of these communities and lower economic growth in the country \nas a whole.\n  Which brings me to my tax provision. For the past two Congresses, I \nhave advocated changing the Tax Code to permit new owners of so-called \nbrownfields to deduct the cost of cleaning up these sites from their \nincome. This reform is a vast improvement over the current code, which \nrequires companies to capitalize these costs over many years. It is a \nsmall provision which I believe will have far-reaching economic effects \nin attracting new owners to these abandoned properties.\n  It will also have positive environmental effects that we can all \nsupport. First, it will accelerate the remediation of contaminated \nproperties. As I said previously, the State, local, and Federal \ngovernments do not have the resources to identify and clean these \nproperties. To make progress, we must enlist the assistance and \nresources of the private sector. This brownfields tax provision does \njust that.\n  Second, it will protect so-called greenfields from development. When \ndevelopers turn away from Heatherwood Farms and other brownfields, they \nturn instead to properties that have no history of industrial or \ncommercial use. That is certainly not in the interest of communities \nlike Lansing or Flint, and it is not conducive toward maintaining our \nundeveloped countryside.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year I joined Senators Lieberman, \nMoseley-Braun, D'Amato, Jeffords, and others in introducing legislation \nwhich would target this tax incentive at distressed communities across \nthe country. This legislation has the support of the administration and \nthe United State Conference of Mayors. I encourage Senator Roth to \ninclude this provision in his tax bill when he presents it to the \nFinance Committee this week, and I look forward to working with all \nSenators in promoting economic growth and job creation in our \ndistressed communities nationwide. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5709-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CHARMAINE CACCIOPPI\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \ntoday to recognize the important work of Lloyd Weaver in ongoing flood \nrecovery efforts in the Dakotas.\n  Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South \nDakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold \ntemperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane \ncleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead \nlivestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As \nif surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents \nof the upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother \nNature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood. Record levels on the \nBig Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5,000 residents of \nWatertown, SD to evacuate their homes and left over one-third of the \ncity without sewer and water for 3 weeks. The city of Bruce, SD was \ncompletely under water when record low temperatures turned swollen \nstreams into sheets of ice.\n  The 50,000 residents of Grand Forks, ND and 10,000 residents of East \nGrand Forks, MN, were forced to leave their homes and businesses as the \nRed River overwhelmed their cities in April. The devastation was \nastounding; an entire city underwater and a fire that gutted a majority \nof Grand Forks' downtown. Residents of both cities recently were \nallowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and \ndifficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning.\n  Lloyd Weaver lived through the 1972 flash flood that killed hundreds \nof people in Rapid City, SD. He knows what his North Dakota neighbors \nare currently experiencing. That's why Lloyd's Carpet and Cleaning \nService in Rapid City chartered a plane and donated 25 large canisters \nof chemicals to deodorize homes in Grand Forks. Lloyd Weaver also met \nwith relief officials and instructed them on the proper use of the \nchemical to help get homeowners and business people back on their feet.\n  While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction \nwrought by this year's floods, I have been heartened to witness \nfirsthand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within \ntheir community to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from rising \nflood waters.

Mr. President, last week the Senate adopted the \nemergency supplemental bill by a vote of 78 to 21. As one of the \nMembers who voted against it, I wanted to take this opportunity to \nexplain my vote.\n  I reluctantly voted for the last disaster relief bill--even though I \nbelieved it contained too many nonemergency spending times and that it \nexacerbated an already inequitible transportation funding situation for \nMichigan. The reason I did so was the inclusion of the continuing \nresolution language that would have protected Americans from another \nGovernment shutdown and the loss of necessary Government services.\n  The legislation adopted on Thursday did not contain this protection, \nand so left the American taxpayer and the Congress at the mercy of a \nPresident who has consistently demanded ever-higher levels of \nGovernment spending, and who is willing to shutdown the Federal \nGovernment to get it.\n  Moreover, the legislation contained extraneous, nonemergency spending \nitems as well as more money than the Congress was willing to spend just \na few short weeks ago. As a final insult, this legislation fails to \nfully offset the additional spending it provides, and therefore will \nresult in another increase to the deficit.\n  Mr. President, I sympathize with the plight of the people living in \nthe flooded States and I fully support providing the disaster \nassistance they need to rebuild their communities and their lives. \nHowever, for the Congress to adopt legislation which adds to the \ndeficit, includes nonemergency extraneous matters, and that does not \nprotect the taxpayers against another Government shutdown, was in my \nview wholly irresponsible and not deserving of my support. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5712-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5712-S5713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF HOOKSETT ON ITS 175TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the town of Hooksett, NH on their 175th anniversary. \nHooksett is celebrating their 175th birthday during the month of July, \nand the town's citizens will highlight these festivities with the \ndedication of a new safety center and numerous other activities. This \nNew Hampshire town has a significant heritage to celebrate on their \n175th anniversary.\n  The history of Hooksett began in the 1700's. The early settlers of \nthis untamed country were independent and self-sufficient folk, \ncharacteristics that\n\n[[Page S5713]]\n\nhave endured in the people of this region. With their independent \nspirit and determination they built a strong and lasting community that \nmakes their descendants proud. What is now Hooksett was once part of \nthree other communities during the 18th century. The residents of these \ntowns were dissatisfied with having to travel 17 miles over rugged \nterrain to the community of Chester to attend church or to vote.\n  On June 11, 1782, 40 years before the town would be incorporated, the \nGeneral Court granted a petition that established a ferry at Isle of \nHooksett Falls. The town would eventually take its name from this area. \nThese strong-spirited citizens were determined to form their own \ncommunity and five petitions later to the General Court, Hooksett was \nfinally incorporated July 2, 1822. The first town meeting was at Halls \nTavern on September 16, 1822, where the first town officials of \nHooksett took the oath to serve the people of the community. The voters \nelected: the Honorable Richard H. Ayer, selectman and moderator; Samuel \nhead, selectman; Samuel Poor, selectman and Gideon Flanders as town \nclerk. The residents also elected constables, surveyors of lumber, \ntreasurer, hog reeves and a school committee.\n  Today, the town of Hooksett prides itself on its quality of life and \ncommunity spirit, a tradition that has manifested itself throughout the \ntown's history. This town of 9,400 residents boasts not only \nmagnificent surroundings, but a community of friendly, caring neighbors \nas well.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the town of Hooksett on this historic \nmilestone and wish them a happy 175th anniversary celebration.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an extremely \nimportant and successful medical facility, Truman Medical Center East--\nTruman East--Kansas City, MO. On Friday, June 20, 1997, a special \ndedication will be held in honor of the new Truman East Care Center and \nambulatory/emergency services renovation/expansion project.\n  Truman East has been serving residents of eastern Jackson County \nsince the mid-1800's and continues to meet the challenges of this \ngrowing area.\n  Truman East is primarily a teaching institution for the University of \nMissouri--Kansas City School of Health Sciences. It contains the \ndepartment of family and community medicine along with the large family \npractice residency program which provides primary care. In addition, \nTruman East manages the Jackson County Health Department in \nIndependence, MO. It has an extensive gerontology fellowship which \nprovides excellent opportunities for the elderly to enhance the quality \nof daily life.\n  One of the biggest improvements to the facility is the replacement of \na 212-room long term care residency with a state-of-the-art facility. \nThe older buildings, from 1908 and 1930, have been converted into \noffices in order to keep the renovations cost effective. Students and \nhealth care professionals alike will benefit from these expansions and \nimprovements of the Truman East facility.\n  It is a great privilege to honor this high caliber medical facility. \nI know that Truman East will continue to improve and grow for years to \ncome. The State of Missouri is lucky to have such a facility and I want \nto express my sincere appreciation to everyone who makes Truman East \nexcel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5713-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING TRUMBULL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring up to the \nattention of my colleagues a very special event that occurred recently. \nOn June 10, 1997, I was privileged to participate in an evening parade \nsponsored by the U.S. Marine Corps at the Iwo Jima Memorial.\n  As my colleagues know, the Marine Corps hosts these parades weekly \nduring the summer for local residents, tourists, and supporters of the \nArmed Forces. However, this parade was particularly special for those \nof us who treasure our Nation's military history and traditions.\n  The parade was attended by the Secretary of the Navy, the Commandant \nof the Marine Corps, other distinguished leaders, and a collection of \nIwo Jima survivors. Amidst great anticipation, the Secretary seized \nthis unique forum to announce that the latest WASP Class amphibious \nwarship, the LHD-7, would be named the ``USS. IWO JIMA.''\n  As the sponsor of previous legislation to provide this designation \nfor the LHD-7, I was both pleased and privileged to participate in this \nvery special event. Indeed, as the Sun slowly set over Arlington \ncemetery, the Iwo Jima Memorial was aglow against the backdrop of the \nWashington skyline. And those veterans of Iwo Jima who graced us with \ntheir presence seemed transformed once again into the same youthful \nheroes who fought so nobly in defense of freedom 52 years ago. It was a \nvery, very special night.\n  Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues who were not able to \nattend last week's parade, I would like to take this opportunity to \ninsert into the Record the statements delivered by the Secretary of the \nNavy and myself in commemoration of the event. While it is difficult to \ncapture in mere words the essence of that wonderful evening, it is my \nhope that the American people will be able to review these remarks and, \nperhaps, gain a better appreciation of the U.S. Marine Corps, its \nhistory, and tradition. I know that I was enriched by the experience, \nand I want to personally thank Gen. Chuck Krulak and America's Corps of \nMarines for the honor of participating in this unforgettable event.\n  I ask that the speeches delivered at the Iwo Jima Memorial on June \n10, 1997, by Secretary of Navy John Dalton and myself be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\n              Remarks of Senator Bob Smith--June 10, 1997\n\n       Thank you very much General Krulak. Secretary Dalton, \n     Admiral Johnson, my host General West, fellow veterans, \n     particularly veterans of Iwo Jima that are with us tonight, \n     members of the Armed Services, ladies and gentlemen.\n       Tonight, we gather against the backdrop of this wonderful \n     shrine, to commemorate the long and distinguished history of \n     our United States Marine Corps. We also celebrate the \n     designation of the latest WASP-Class Amphibious Assault ship \n     the ``USS Iwo Jima.''\n       It is a very special evening, and I am deeply honored to \n     participate in these activities.\n       In the annals of military history, no battle conjures up \n     more powerful or compelling images than Iwo Jima. That \n     ferocious battle, to capture four miles of strategic island \n     territory, is forever a part of our national character. And \n     it will forever define our United States Marine Corps.\n       Between February 19th and March 26th, 1945, 19,000 \n     Americans were wounded and 7,000 were killed in the campaign \n     to capture Iwo Jima. This was no walk through the park. This \n     was lengthy, brutal, hand to hand, close quarters combat.\n       There were no stealth fighters, satellites or precision \n     guided munitions at Iwo Jima. No attack helicopters, infrared \n     sensors or tomahawk cruise missiles, either. Our secret \n     weapon was the tenacity and unbridled patriotism of 80,000 \n     United States Marines.\n       There was nothing high tech about these leathernecks. They \n     weren't pretty and they weren't glamorous. But those Marines \n     gave everything they had. They provided exactly what \n     technology couldn't. Guts. Courage. Valor. Discipline. \n     Unparalleled heroism.\n       As Admiral Chester Nimitz concluded after the battle, and I \n     quote, ``among the Americans who served on Iwo Island, \n     uncommon valor was a common virtue.''\n\n[[Page S5714]]\n\n       I am proud to stand before you tonight and say without \n     question that the tradition, the character, the fortitude, \n     and the dignity displayed by those Marines at Iwo Jima 52 \n     years ago lives on today. It lives on in the 174,000 men and \n     women who serve in the United States Marine Corps.\n       They hold the torch of freedom. They are the ones who \n     sacrifice each day so that this nation may live free. They \n     are the ones who are on station at a distant shore, 24 hours \n     a day, 365 days a year defending our liberty and preserving \n     our security.\n       As you admire the parade this evening, I urge you to look \n     closely at these young men and women. Look at their demeanor. \n     Look into their eyes and you will see the spirit of those \n     80,000 Marines who served at Iwo Jima. Look into those eyes \n     and you will see the pride, the discipline, the commitment to \n     God and country that distinguishes our Corps of Marines from \n     any other fighting force on Earth.\n       Look into those eyes and you will see a window into the \n     soul of this great Nation.\n       As parents, one of the most important values that we can \n     transmit to our children is to remember, and to honor, those \n     who fought, sacrificed and perished on behalf of freedom.\n       As a United States Senator, I take great pride in having \n     played a role in naming the LHD-7 the ``Iwo Jima. From my \n     perspective, as long as marines are deployed in defense of \n     liberty, there must always be an Iwo Jima in the fleet.\n       This ship, the finest of its kind, will carry on the legacy \n     of those fresh faced leathernecks who turned the tide of \n     history 52 years ago. It is an event to be commemorated. It \n     is a ship worthy of the distinction.\n       Semper Fidelis.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     Remarks of Hon. John H. Dalton\n\n       Thank you General Krulak, for that kind introduction. \n     Senator Smith, Assistant Secretary Stuart (Sandra Stuart, \n     ASD--Legislative Affairs), Rear Admiral Ryan, Major General \n     Haynes, Veterans, especially those Veterans of the Battle of \n     Iwo Jima (seated ahead and to your left) and serving members \n     of our Armed Forces, ladies and gentlemen.\n       I am honored to be here, at this glorious moment, a bold \n     and powerful testimony to the commitment and sacrifice of \n     those proud Marines and Sailors who fought and died to \n     preserve America's precious freedoms and liberties. The Iwo \n     Jima Memorial commemorates a great moral and strategic \n     victory in the Pacific campaign of World War II, and one of \n     the fiercest fights in the annals of combat.\n       In this battle we took more casualties than the enemy, in \n     this battle there were more medals of honor awarded than in \n     any other battle in U.S. history. We simply had to have that \n     island.\n       The outcome of that struggle was not only the preservation \n     of the greatest Democracy and Nation in the world, but also \n     the subsequent spread of democratic forms of government to \n     distant and foreign shores.\n       In that light, Iwo Jima represents not just a single, \n     costly battle, so long ago. It symbolizes also, the proud \n     heritage of our Marines and Sailors who recognize a greatness \n     beyond themselves and their service. Because of Iwo Jima and \n     battles like it, the world can appreciate America's \n     commitment to democracy and justice. It led nations toward a \n     more peaceful world, a world in which we all pray there will \n     never be another Iwo Jima.\n       I am constantly reminded of the Battle for Iwo Jima. In my \n     office hangs a painting of Joe Rosenthal's famous photograph \n     after which this memorial is sculpted. I have met Joe \n     Rosenthal and the sculptor of this great work, Felix De-\n     Weldon. And just 2 years ago, I was honored to stand on the \n     top of Mount Suribachi, and participate in a Memorial Service \n     on the 50th anniversary of the battle.\n       But perhaps my greatest reminder of all are daily \n     encounters with Marines and Sailors of today's Naval Service. \n     These encounters give me total confidence that the supreme \n     sacrifice of those who went before is embodied in the \n     fighting spirit of today's Marines and Sailors.\n       My hope is that all Americans would have the opportunity to \n     be reminded of their servicemembers' fighting spirit and \n     willingness to sacrifice, as I so often am as Secretary of \n     the Navy. That is why I am proud to announce today, that the \n     Navy and Marine Corps' newest amphibious warship, the seventh \n     of our WASP class LHD's, will be named U.S.S. Iwo Jima.\n       LHD-7, the U.S.S. Iwo Jima, to be christened at the turn of \n     the century, will embody the most powerful technology and \n     weapons capability available to our Navy and Marine Corps \n     Team. U.S.S. Iwo Jima's ultimate strength will be the ability \n     to deter aggression. And her lifeblood will be our Sailors \n     and Marines who man the deckplates, they will fulfill the \n     tradition of sacrifice so honorably held by those who fought \n     and died at the battle of Iwo Jima.\n       I think it is appropriate to recall the words of Chaplain \n     Roland Gittelsohn when he dedicated the Fifth Marine Division \n     Cemetery on Iwo Jima fifty-two years ago. On February 19, \n     1995, Rabbi Gittelsohn recalled his words when he \n     participated at a ceremony here, commemorating that battle. \n     He said then, and repeated 2 years ago:\n       ``Here lie officers and men of all colors, rich men and \n     poor men together. Here are Protestants, Catholics and Jews \n     together. Here no man prefers another because of his faith or \n     despises him because of his color. Here there are no quotas \n     of how many from each group are admitted or allowed. Among \n     these men there is no discrimination. No prejudice. No \n     hatred. Theirs is the highest and purest democracy.\n       Any man among us, the living, who failed to understand \n     that, will thereby betray those who lie here . . . whoever \n     lifts his hand in hate against a brother, or thinks himself \n     superior to those who happen to be in a minority, makes of . \n     . . their sacrifice an empty, hollow mockery.\n       Thus do we consecrate ourselves, the living, to carry on \n     the struggle they began. Too much blood has gone into this \n     soil for us to let it lie barren.''\n       Those words spoken in honor of fallen Marines and Sailors \n     hold a living truth. The truth is that we, the living, must \n     carry on their struggle for liberty and freedom everyday, and \n     in everything we do. I am confident that our Navy and Marine \n     Corps Team embodies that continuing struggle. And I am proud \n     that this great Nation will commission the U.S.S. Iwo Jima in \n     the year 2000, to honor those of you who fought there, and \n     the enduring legacy of our fallen comrades who so dedicated \n     their lives to this great Nation. God bless this great \n     memorial and the selfless sacrifice it represents. God bless \n     our Navy and Marine Corps, and God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/16/senate-section/article/S5713-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I do not know whether the distinguished \noccupant of the Chair has noticed, but we have 20 new pages as of \ntoday. Every year I say they can't get any better, but they do. They \nare fine young people who come here from all across the country. They \nwork hard, as they will discover as the days go by and the temperature \ngets hot in the debate, and messages will be floating back and forth \nlike Tennyson's brook.\n  But I want you to know that here is one Senator who welcomes you. I \nam proud of you. I think you are going to enjoy your time in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I hear from the pages, former pages, of years ago, \nwith some regularity. They send me pictures of their new babies. They \nsend me pictures of themselves and in their wedding gowns. It is \ninteresting to track all these young people as they have moved into \nmaturity and have become good citizens. I even know of two who are \nserving in State legislatures now. So, tempus fugit.\n  When I came on to the Senate floor from the cloakroom, I was told \nthat the wrap-up material would be presented in about a minute. It will \nbe here. And I am not going to suggest the absence of a quorum. So \nthere.\n  These young people are lucky, I might add, because there is no school \nin the summertime, is there? But the rest of the year, they start \nschool at 6:15 in the morning. Classes begin then. And unless the \nSenate runs past--what is it?--10 o'clock in the evening--the 6:15 a.m. \ntime is still in effect for the pages.\n  So now I feel like I am back in television with producers standing in \nthe background saying ``Stretch it. Stretch it.''\n  I guess I may as well suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5715]]\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Originally it was \nto have been divided equally between Senator Biden and me, and I \nthought in fairness to Senator Lugar it ought to be made equal between \nSenator Lugar, Senator Biden, and me.\n  Further, Mr. President, at the hour of 12 noon, the Senate proceed to \na vote on or in relation to the DeWine amendment No. 383, to be \nimmediately followed by a vote on or in relation to the Lugar amendment \nNo. 382, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided before each vote. \nFollowing those votes, the Senate will recess until the hour of 2:15 \np.m. for the weekly policy luncheon meetings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
