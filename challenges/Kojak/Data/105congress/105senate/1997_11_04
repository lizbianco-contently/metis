Introduction\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise this morning to discuss the \nnomination of Mr. Bill Lann Lee of California to be President Clinton's \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Let me say at the outset \nthat, in my 5 years as the senior Republican on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have been proud to have advanced no less than 230 of \nPresident Clinton's nominees to the Federal courts. After a thorough \nreview of these nominees' views and records, I have supported the \nconfirmation of all but two of them. In addition, I have also worked to \nensure that President Clinton's Justice Department nominees receive a \nfair, expeditious, and thorough review. Without question, the Senate's \nadvice and consent responsibility is one that I take very seriously. \nThis nomination is no exception.\n  While I have the highest personal regard for Bill Lann Lee, his \nrecord and his responses to questions posed by the committee suggest a \ndistorted view of the law that makes it difficult for me in good \nconscience to support his nomination to be the chief enforcer of the \nNation's civil rights laws. The Assistant Attorney General must be \nAmerica's civil rights law enforcer, not the civil rights ombudsman for \nthe political left. Accordingly, when the Judiciary Committee votes on \nwhether to report his nomination to the full Senate, I will regretfully \nvote ``no''.\n  At the outset, I want to say that no one in this body respects and \nappreciates the compelling personal history of Mr. Lee and his family \nmore than I. Mr. Lee's parents came to these shores full of hope for \nthe future. They believed in the promise of America. And despite meager \ncircumstances and the scourge of bigotry, they worked hard, educated \ntheir children, and never lost faith in this great country.\n  Yet, what we must never forget as we take up this debate is that the \nsum of our experiences says less about who we become than does what we \ntake from those experiences. For example, my good friend Justice \nClarence Thomas was, like Mr. Lee, born into a circumstance where \nopportunities were\n\n[[Page S11618]]\n\nunjustly limited. Nevertheless, Clarence Thomas worked hard, and has \ndevoted his career to ensuring that the law protects every individual \nwith equal force. The same can be said of another African-American, \nBill Lucas, who was nominated by President Bush for the same position \nas Mr. Lee, but whose nomination was rejected by my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  Bill Lann Lee is, to his credit, an able civil rights lawyer with a \nprofoundly admirable passion to improve the lives of many Americans who \nhave been left behind. His talent and good intentions have taken him \nfar. But his good intentions should not be sufficient to earn the \nconsent of this body. Those charged with enforcing the Nation's laws \nmust demonstrate a proper understanding of that law, and a \ndetermination to uphold its letter and its spirit. Unfortunately, much \nof Mr. Lee's work has been devoted to preserving constitutionally \nsuspect race-conscious public policies that ultimately sort and divide \ncitizens by race. To this day, he is an adamant defender of \npreferential policies that, by definition, favor some and disfavor \nothers based upon race and ethnicity.\n  At his hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Lee suggested he \nwould enforce the law without regard to his personal opinions. But that \ncannot be the end of our inquiry. The Senate's responsibility is then \nto determine what the nominee's view of the law is. That question is \nparticularly important for a nominee to the Justice Department's Civil \nRights Division.\n\n\n                       II. Civil Rights Division\n\n  As I have made clear in the past, it is my view that the Assistant \nAttorney General for Civil Rights is one of the most important law \nenforcement positions in the Federal Government. No position in \nGovernment more profoundly shapes and implements our Nation's goal of \nequality under law.\n  The Civil Rights Division was established in 1957 to enforce \nPresident Eisenhower's Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first civil rights \nstatute since Reconstruction. Since the appointment of the first \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Mr. Harold Tyler, the \nDivision has had a distinguished record of enforcing the Nation's civil \nrights laws, often against perilous political odds. With great leaders \nlike Burke Marshall, John Doar, and Stanley Pottinger, the Civil Rights \nDivision emphasized the equality of individuals under law, and a \ncommitment to ensuring that every American--regardless of race, \nethnicity, gender, national origin, or disability--enjoys an equal \nopportunity to pursue his or her talents free of illegal \ndiscrimination. That is a commitment that I fundamentally share, and \ntake very seriously as I consider a nominee to this important Division.\n  Today, however, the Civil Rights Division, and the Nation's \nfundamental civil rights policies, stand at a crossroads. In recent \nyears, the Nation's courts have underscored the notion that the \nconstitutional guarantee of equal protection applies equally to every \nindividual American. Consistent with that principle, they have placed \nstrict limitations on the Government's ability to count among its \ncitizens by race. Nevertheless, many among us who lay claim to the \nmantle of civil rights would have us continue on the road of racial \nspoils--a road on which Americans are seen principally through the \nlooking glass of race. I regret to say that Bill Lee's record suggests \nthat he too wishes the Nation to travel that unfortunate road.\n  The country today, however, demands a Civil Rights Division devoted \nto protecting us all equally. It cannot do that when it is committed to \npolicies that elevate one citizen's rights above another's. Let me \nshare one example of what results from the race-consciousness that \nsome, Bill Lann Lee among them, would have us embrace.\n  Earlier this year, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing to examine \nthe problem of discrimination in America. One story, that of Charlene \nLoen was particularly moving. Ms. Loen is a Chinese-American mother of \ntwo who lives in San Francisco. Ms. Loen's son Patrick was denied \nadmission to a distinguished public magnet school in San Francisco, \npursuant to the racial preference policy contained in a consent decree \nwhich caps the percentage of ethnic group representation in each of the \ncity's public schools. The cap has the effect of requiring young, \nChinese students to score significantly higher on magnet school \nentrance exams than students of other races. While young Patrick scored \nhigher than many of his friends on the admissions exam, he was denied \nadmission, while other children who scored less well were admitted. Ms. \nLoen sought to have Patrick admitted to several other public magnet \nschools in the city, and time after time she was told in no uncertain \nterms that because he was Chinese, Patrick need not apply.\n  So you see, a policy that prefers one, by definition disfavors \nanother. In this case, the disfavored other has a name, Patrick. The \nlaw must be understood to protect Patrick, and others like him, no less \nthan anyone else. What matters under the law is not that Patrick is \nethnic Chinese, but that he is American. Affirmative action policies as \noriginally conceived embraced that ideal. Recruiting and outreach that \nensures broad inclusion is one thing; racial and gender preferences \nthat enforce double standards are quite another.\n  But the case against Bill Lee is broader, and more fundamental, than \nhis aggressive support for public policies that sort and divide by \nrace. What Bill Lee's record fundamentally suggests is a willingness to \nread the civil rights laws so narrowly--and to find exceptions so \nbroad--as to undermine their very spirit, if not their letter. Let me \nshare a few cases to illustrate the point.\n\n\n                              III. Adarand\n\n  At his hearing, Mr. Lee was asked about the Supreme Court's holding \nin the case of Adarand Constructors versus Pech, in which the Supreme \nCourt held that State-sanctioned racial distinctions are presumptively \nunconstitutional. When asked to state the holding of the case, Mr. Lee \nsaid that it epitomizes the Supreme Court's view that racial preference \nprograms are permissible if ``conducted in a limited and measured \nmanner.'' That is, arguably, a narrowly correct statement. But it \npurposefully misses the mark of the Court's fundamental holding that \nsuch programs are presumptively unconstitutional. Imagine if a nominee \nhad come before this body and stated for the record that the Court's \nfirst amendment cases stand for the proposition that the state can \ninterfere with religious practices if it does so carefully. Such a \npurposefully misleading view would properly be assailed as a \nfundamental mischaracterization of the spirit of the law. So, too, is \nMr. Lee's view of the Supreme Court's statements about racial \ndistinctions enforced by the Government.\n  In addition, Mr. Lee stated for the record his personal opposition to \nAdarand. He then said that in spite of that, he would enforce the law, \nif confirmed. Fair enough. But, in response to a written question from \nSenator Ashcroft, Mr. Lee's narrow view of what the law is becomes \nastonishingly clear. Senator Ashcroft asked Mr. Lee whether the program \nat issue in the Adarand case is unconstitutional. Mr. Lee noted that \nthe Supreme Court in Adarand remanded the case to the district court in \nColorado. He further noted that the district court just this summer \nheld that the programs in question are not narrowly tailored and are \ntherefore unconstitutional. In so holding, the court stated in its \nopinion that\n\n       [c]ontrary to the [Supreme] Court's pronouncement that \n     strict scrutiny is not ``fatal in fact,'' I find it difficult \n     to envisage a race-based classification that is narrowly \n     tailored.\n\n  But despite the court's strong pronouncement, Mr. Lee asserts in his \nresponse to Senator Ashcroft that he believes ``this program is \nsufficiently narrowly tailored to satisfy the strict scrutiny test.'' \nApparently, then, Mr. Lee is prepared to support racial preference \nprograms until every possible exception under the law is unequivocally \nforeclosed by the Supreme Court, despite the Court's view that such \nprograms are presumptively unconstitutional and may only be used in \nexceptional circumstances. Mr. Lee's view of the law, it seems to me, \nis exceedingly narrow and violative of the Court's rulings and \nholdings. We must expect more of the Nation's chief civil rights law \nenforcer.\n\n\n                          IV. Proposition 209\n\n  I realize that some still embrace policies that divide and sort by \nrace. And\n\n[[Page S11619]]\n\ngiven the court's narrow exception in Adarand, I am willing to consider \na nominee who believes such policies may be constitutional in limited \ncircumstances. It is fair that that view is heard. Yet, it is quite \nanother matter altogether when a nominee takes the position that the \ncontrary view--that racial preferences should be prohibited--is \nunconstitutional. Such a view of the law effectively silences \ndissenting voices on this, the most important civil rights issue of our \nday.\n  Mr. Lee and his organization, the Western Office of the NAACP Legal \nDefense & Educational Fund, have led the opposition to California's \nproposition 209, which said simply that no Californian can be \ndiscriminated against or preferred by the State on the basis of race, \ngender, or national origin. He has also challenged the University of \nCalifornia's efforts to comply with its colorblindness mandate, by \ncomplaining to the Federal Department of Education that the \nUniversity's race-neutral use of standardized tests and weighted grade \npoint averages violates the civil rights laws. Even the anti-209 \ndirector of admissions at the UCLA School of Law, Michael Rappaport, \nhas described the NAACP's complaint as ``frightening'' for universities \nwishing to employ rigorous academic standards. That complaint is only \npart of a comprehensive effort by Mr. Lee and his organization to \nundermine the people of California's political judgment that their \ngovernment should respect the rights of citizens without regard to \nrace.\n  Soon after 54 percent of Californians voted to pass proposition 209, \nMr. Lee's office filed a brief in the Federal court action challenging \nthe constitutionality of the initiative, relying on the cases of Hunter \nversus Erickson--fair housing legislation--and Washington versus \nSeattle--busing--to allege that 209 was an unconstitutional \nrestructuring of the political process because minorities are no longer \npermitted to petition local governments for preferential treatment. Of \ncourse, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--perhaps the most liberal \ncircuit court in the Nation--forcefully and unequivocally rejected that \nargument, noting that governmental racial distinctions are \npresumptively unconstitutional, and concluded:\n\n       As a matter of ``conventional'' equal protection analysis, \n     there is simply no doubt that Proposition 209 is \n     constitutional. . . . After all, the ``goal'' of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment, ``to which the Nation continues to \n     aspire,'' is ``a political system in which race no longer \n     matters'' (citation omitted). . . . The Fourteenth Amendment, \n     lest we lose sight of the forest for the trees, does not \n     require what it barely permits.\n       (Coalition for Economic Equity, et al. v. Wilson, 122 F.3d \n     692 [9th Cir. 1997].)\n\n  Earlier this year, the Clinton administration filed an amicus brief \nin the ninth circuit supporting the constitutional challenge so \ndecisively rejected by the appeals court. I asked Mr. Lee whether, \ngiven the Supreme Court's holding in Adarand and the forceful statement \nof law by the ninth circuit, he would argue against the \nadministration's continued challenge to prop 209's constitutionality. \nHe said he would support the administration's position.\n  After Mr. Lee's hearing, I took it upon myself to offer an olive \nbranch to the administration. I emphasized the fundamental problem I \nhave with Mr. Lee's and the administration's view of the Constitution \nas it relates to racial matters. I suggested that if this White House \ncould find its way to put aside the now-discredited argument that \nefforts like prop 209 actually violate the Constitution, that it would \nbe much easier for my colleagues and me to support this nomination. It \ncertainly would be something that would be helpful.\n  On Wednesday of last week, I received a letter from Mr. Lee \nexplaining that he would recuse himself from the administration's \ndeliberations about its policy in the specific prop 209 case. And just \nyesterday, of course, the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari in \nthe 209 case. But, important as they are, those gestures do not lessen \nmy fundamental concern about Mr. Lee's view on the matter. Those \ndevelopments do nothing to preclude the administration from challenging \nfuture colorblindness efforts in the States, or in the Congress--\nincluding my and Senator McConnell's Civil Rights Act of 1997; they do \nnothing to provide much needed leadership within the Department on this \nmost important policy issue--creating yet another leadership void \nwithin the Department; and at bottom, Mr. Lee's letter seems little \nmore than a cynical ploy by the administration to momentarily ease Mr. \nLee's way to confirmation, while doing nothing to address my \nunderlying, substantive concerns about his interpretation of the law. \nIn the final analysis, my concerns about Mr. Lee's record are vastly \nbroader than simply how he might counsel the administration in one \ndiscrete case.\n\n\n                    V. Prison Litigation Reform Act\n\n  Mr. Lee was also asked for his views on the Prison Litigation Reform \nAct, a piece of legislation that I sponsored and worked hard to pass in \nthe last Congress. In response to written questions from Senator \nAbraham about the Department's enforcement of the PLRA, Mr. Lee either \ndefended unjustified Department positions, or evaded the questions \naltogether.\n  The PLRA establishes a 2-year limitation on most consent decrees \ngoverning prison operations. If after the 2 years, a constitutional \nviolation continues to exist, the law provides that a prisoner may \npetition a court to extend the term of the decree. When asked whether \nthe Department was correct to argue that PLRA places the burden of \nproof on a defendant seeking to be relieved from a prison consent \ndecree to prove that constitutional violations no longer exist, rather \nthan on a prisoner seeking extension of a decree to show that \nviolations continue to exist, Lee argued that the Department's \n``approach seems sensible to me.'' But the Department's approach \nundermines the spirit of the law, which places limits on judicial \ncontrol of our prisons absent proof of a continuing constitutional \nviolation.\n  Mr. Lee's support for the Justice Department's efforts to undermine \nthe effectiveness of the Prison Litigation Reform Act further justify \nopposition to his nomination. This view is yet another example of Mr. \nLee's approach to the law, which suggests that when confronted with a \nlaw he doesn't like, he creatively interprets the law in the narrowest \npossible fashion, to allow him to pursue his ends contrary to the \nspirit, if not the letter, of the law. That is unacceptable for one \nseeking to enforce the Nation's civil rights laws.\n\n\n                  VI. Los Angeles Consent Decree case\n\n  I am also troubled by Mr. Lee's involvement in an apparent effort to \nrush through a consent decree in Los Angeles that would have bound the \ncity to racial and gender hiring goals for 18 years. Mr. Lee and other \nattorneys in the case sought to have the proposed consent decree \napproved by the city council and then by a magistrate judge on the very \nday that the citizens of California were voting on proposition 209. \nProposition 209 would quite likely prohibit enforcement of the goals in \nthe proposed decree. But by its terms, the proposition does not apply \nto consent decrees in force prior to its effective date. The decree was \ntaken to the magistrate without notice to the district judge presiding \nover the case, as was required by local court rules; and more \nimportantly in my view, Mr. Lee sought to have the decree approved \nwithout a fairness hearing to assess the impact of the decree on \nindividuals who might in the future be affected by its terms, but who \nwere not represented in the negotiations.\n  It should be noted that even Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a \nsupporter of Mr. Lee's nomination, and then-Los Angeles Police \nCommission President Raymond Fisher, the President's nominee to be \nAssociate Attorney General, both opposed the proposed decree. Mayor \nRiordan expressed concern about the scope of outside enforcement \nauthority under the decree, and Mr. Fisher called the decree \n``extremely intrusive to the operations of the [police] department.'' \nTo seek even partial approval of a decree raising such concerns, \nwithout benefit of a fairness hearing, raises legitimate questions.\n  The district court judge, learning of the parties' ploy through media \naccounts, resumed control over the case, citing the significance of a \ndecree that would bind a government for 18 years, and remarked that the \ndecree ``may present substantial constitutional questions.'' The judge \nlater noted in a memorandum order that\n\n       . . . the unusual procedures employed by the existing \n     parties in this case--seeking\n\n[[Page S11620]]\n\n     same-day approval of the Proposed Decree and requesting that \n     no fairness hearing be held--certainly raise alarm bells \n     about the adequacy of their representation [of potentially \n     affected individuals not represented in the negotiations].\n  Mr. President, the very core of what we must expect of an Assistant \nAttorney General for Civil Rights is a steadfast concern that every \nindividual be treated fairly--equally--under our laws. Mr. Lee's \ninvolvement in an effort to lock in 18-year racial hiring goals for \npublic employment without an opportunity first to consider the impact \nof that race consciousness on individuals who may fall on the wrong \nside of those goals, suggests a willingness to place group \nrepresentation above the rights of individuals to be treated equally \nunder the law. As Senators sworn to uphold the Constitution, we have a \nresponsibility to reject that priority for the Nation's defender of \ncivil rights. While I do not question Mr. Lee's integrity, I am \nconcerned about his commitment to serve every citizen of the Nation in \nequal measure.\n  Selecting an Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights should not \nbe a simple coronation of an effective civil rights litigator for a \nleading activist organization. Enforcing the Nation's laws on behalf of \nevery American citizen is a profoundly different role. Despite that, \nMr. Lee seems simply unable to distinguish his role as NAACP activist \nlitigator, and the role of Assistant Attorney General. When asked by \nthe Judiciary Committee to list cases he filed at the LDF which he \nwould not file as Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Lee simply replied \nthat, as a jurisdictional matter, he could not bring State law claims \nas Assistant Attorney General. Everything else is apparently fair game. \nClearly then, Mr. Lee is unable to distinguish the substantive role of \nlaw enforcer for all citizens from that of a private activist litigator \ncharged with pushing the limits of the law. That is unacceptable for an \nindividual seeking to take the reins of the Civil Rights Division's \nmassive enforcement apparatus.\n\n\n             VII. Deval Patrick and Consent Decree Activism\n\n  Mr. Lee's supporters have characterized him as a ``pragmatist''--a \n``practical litigator,'' rather than a pro-preference ideolog. That is \na familiar tune in this debate. Three years ago, the President \nnominated another individual who was widely hailed as a pragmatist. \nDeval Patrick, another man for whom I have a high personal regard, was \ndescribed by one paper as ``a practically oriented working lawyer.'' \nBased upon those assurances, I resolved to set aside my concerns about \nMr. Patrick's views, gave him the benefit of the doubt, and supported \nhis nomination.\n  But upon assuming the reins of the Civil Rights Division, Mr. Patrick \nrevealed himself to be a liberal civil rights ideolog. He used \nstatistical racial imbalances and the vast resources of the Justice \nDepartment to extract race-conscious settlements from businesses and \ngovernments, large and small. For example, he undertook a credit-bias \nprobe of Chevy Chase Savings & Loan in Maryland based largely on the \nfact that the bank had opened branch offices in the District of \nColumbia suburbs, but not in the city itself. There was no evidence \nthat the bank had discriminated against qualified individuals seeking \nbank services. Nevertheless, Mr. Patrick entered into a consent decree \nthat essentially forced the bank to open a branch in a low-income \nDistrict neighborhood, and measures the bank's compliance with the \ndecree by assessing whether the the bank achieves a loan market share \nin minority neighborhoods that is reasonably comparable to its share in \nnonminority neighborhoods. Mr. Patrick's Civil Rights Division took it \nupon itself to decide where a bank must do business, and then \nimplemented dubious statistical measurements to determine whether the \nbank's efforts stayed clear of the division's view of the law.\n  Mr. Patrick also forced municipalities across the country to abandon \ntests used to evaluate candidates for local police forces. In Nassau \nCounty, NY, Patrick entered into a consent decree that forced the \ncounty to abandon a rigorous test that yielded a differential passage \nrate for different ethnic groups. The test now used by the county, \nafter the expenditure of millions of dollars in the action, is so weak \nthat the reading portion of the exam is now graded on a pass/fail \nbasis. A candidate passes the reading test if he or she reads at the \nlevel of the lowest 1 percent of existing officers. So much for high \nstandards.\n  In another case, Mr. Patrick ordered Fullerton, CA to set-aside 9 \npercent of its police and fire department positions for African-\nAmericans, despite the fact that fewer than 2 percent of the city's \nresidents are black.\n  These cases suggest the damage that can be done when the resources of \nthe Justice Department are brought to bear to force defendants into \nconsent decrees. Such decrees are often attractive to both parties. \nPreference ideolog in the Justice Department win so-called voluntary \ncommitments to undertake constitutionally suspect race-conscious action \nto eliminate racial disparities; defendants save millions of dollars in \nlegal fees and receive a public disclaimer of liability. Everyone wins, \nexcept for consumers and individuals on the losing end of the racial or \ngender goals and preferences.\n  Given Deval Patrick's excesses in the Department, I am unprepared to \nagain give the benefit of the doubt to a liberal activist nominee \ndescribed by political allies as a pragmatist and a conciliator. When \nasked at his hearing how he would differentiate his views from those of \nMr. Patrick, Bill Lee was unable to muster a response.\n\n\n                            VIII. Conclusion\n\n  I am sad to say, Mr. President, that Bill Lann Lee has fallen victim \nto President Clinton's double-talk on the issue of racial and gender \npreferences. In the wake of the Adarand decision, the President pledged \nto ``mend it, not end it.'' In practice, however, the President's \npolicy on preferences can more accurately be described as ``don't mend \nit, extend it.'' In fact, while the Congressional Research Service \ntells us that there are at least 160 Federal programs containing \npresumptively unconstitutional racial preferences, the President has \nseen fit to eliminate fewer than a handful of them. When Mr. Lee was \nasked to suggest real or hypothetical Federal programs that may not \nmeet constitutional muster, he was able to come up with a whopping \none--one that the Clinton administration had already seen fit to \neliminate. In fact, the Clinton administration has sought to pitch Mr. \nLee, and itself, as something they simply are not--centrists on civil \nrights policy.\n  In the end, my decision today is an unhappy one. It brings me no \npleasure to oppose the nomination of this fine activist lawyer and this \nvery fine human being. But fine human beings--and certainly fine \nlawyers--can make mistakes. And they can approach the law in a way that \nis flawed, and that disserves the laws they are sworn to uphold. That \nis the case with this nomination. Bill Lann Lee's long record of public \nservice must ultimately be reconciled with the role he seeks. The \nAssistant Attorney General is America's civil rights law enforcer, not \nan advocate for the political left.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Lee's understanding of the Nation's civil rights \nlaws is sufficiently cramped and distorted to compel my opposition. The \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights must abide by the law. In \nmatters ranging from racial preferences, to proposition 209, to the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act, Mr. Lee has demonstrated a decided \nreluctance to enforce our Nation's civil rights laws as intended, and \nin some cases his litigation efforts expose an outright hostility to \nit. The Civil Rights Division requires a better approach, and our \ncourts, the Senate, and the Nation demand it. It is for that reason \nthat I must oppose this unfortunate nomination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to enter \ninto the Record several items that echo my concerns about Mr. Lee's \nrecord. I would like to enter a letter from 16 Republican members of \nthe California congressional delegation; a statement from California \nGov. Pete Wilson; and letters from Mr. Ward Connerly of the American \nCivil Rights Institute in California, and Ms. Susan Au Allen, president \nof the U.S. Pan-Asian American Chamber of Commerce.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S11621]]\n\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 30, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We, the undersigned members of the \n     California Congressional delegation, wish to express our deep \n     concern regarding the confirmation of Mr. Bill Lann Lee as \n     the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. This \n     confirmation is of particular concern to California.\n       California Governor Pete Wilson said, ``All of the relevant \n     evidence suggests that Mr. Bill Lann Lee will not enforce the \n     civil rights laws as defined by the courts but as desired by \n     special interest advocates of unconstitutional and unfair \n     preferences. It is time we had a civil rights enforcer who \n     enforced the law, not distorted it.''\n       We find it very disturbing that Mr. Lee has actively \n     advocated quotas and preferences. He attempted to force \n     through a consent degree mandating racial and gender \n     preferences in the Los Angeles Police Department. The \n     Washington, DC-based Institute for Justice issued a twenty-\n     page report on Lee's litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense \n     Fund, which has furthered legal action challenging the \n     California Civil Rights Initiative and supported racial \n     preferences and forced busing. The study's author and \n     Institute director Clint Bolick stated, ``Lee's assault on \n     Proposition 209 and his support of racial preferences raises \n     serious questions about his suitability as the nation's top \n     civil rights official.'' Mr. Bolick further stated, ``Unless \n     Lee makes clear he will not transfer his personal agenda to \n     the Justice Department, the Senate should not confirm him.''\n       It appears to be fundamentally incompatible for the Senate \n     to confirm as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights \n     an individual with a record of advocating racial \n     discrimination through quotas and preferences. We \n     respectfully urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to carefully \n     and thoroughly review Mr. Lee's philosophy on basic civil \n     rights issues before voting on his confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Howard ``Buck'' McKeon.\n     Dana Rohrabacher.\n     Ken Calvert.\n     James E.

Prior to the hearing, my \n     organization hesitated in taking a formal position on his \n     nomination.\n       However, his comments of yesterday--namely, that he \n     believes Proposition 209 is ``unconstitutional'' and that he \n     disagrees with Adarand v. Pena--lead us to believe the most \n     powerful civil rights law enforcement position in the United \n     Stares belongs not to Mr. Lee, but to a nominee who respects \n     the law of the land.\n       As of today, the American Civil Rights Institute is \n     formally opposing Mr. Lee's nomination to this post and \n     encourages your leadership in rejecting this nomination. An \n     individual who neither understands or respects the people's \n     and the court's commitment to race-neutral laws and policies \n     does not deserve this important position.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ward Connerly,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              State of California,\n\n\n                             Governor's Communications Office,\n\n                                               September 25, 1997.\n\n                              [Memorandum]\n\n     To: John Kramer, Institute of Justice.\n     From: Kim Walsh.\n     Subject: Statement from Governor Wilson.\n       Summary: Below is a statement from Governor Pete Wilson \n     regarding the nomination of Bill Lann Lee as Assistant \n     Attorney General:\n       ``All of the relevant evidence suggests that Mr. Bill Lann \n     Lee will not enforce the civil rights laws as defined by the \n     courts but as desired by special interest advocates of \n     unconstitutional and unfair preferences.

Thus, he is the wrong \n     person to hold the nation's top civil rights enforcer \n     position.\n       Proposition 209 mirrors the language of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964. Mr. Lee's latest assertions during his \n     nomination hearing, of his opposition against Proposition \n     209, adds to our apprehension that he will further divide \n     America along racial lines because of his conviction that \n     civil rights are not for all Americans, but select Americans \n     based on their race and gender. Should he become the nation's \n     top civil rights enforcer, he will have 250 lawyers to help \n     him do the job. This must not happen. America cannot afford \n     it.\n       I ask you to vote against his nomination as the Assistant \n     Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Susan Au Allen.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, yesterday those who cover national \nsecurity policy and issues within our Nation's press reported the best-\nkept nonsecret in Washington; namely, what has already been discussed \nor leaked or trial ballooned or decided upon and reported for weeks in \nthe United States and the international media has finally become \npublic--sort of.\n  In the last days of this session, the administration apparently will \nnow consult with the Congress and today announce what has been obvious, \nand that is, Mr. President, that the United States has no intention of \nleaving Bosnia by the once stated deadline of the 8th of June of next \nyear.\n  President Clinton has not said this outright. The position to date is \nthat he has not ruled out staying beyond June 8. However, given the \noverall goals of the Dayton accords in juxtaposition with the ongoing \nethnic apartheid reality in Bosnia, the concern of our allies, the \ncoming of winter in Bosnia, and the crucial and obvious need for U.S. \nand allied commanders to have enough time for central planning have all \nforced the administration's hand.\n  Simply put, the clock is moving toward the stated deadline to have \nthe SFOR mission in Bosnia completed. And simply put, whatever that \nmission is and despite recent and obvious changes under our stated \nmission, it is not complete.\n  It is long past the time for the President and his national security \nteam to simply tell it like it is. Despite the past promises to limit \nour engagement to 1 year, and then 2 years, and now indefinitely--I \nmight add, promises that should not have been made and could not be \nkept--we are in Bosnia, for better or worse, for the long haul.\n  First of all, our commanders and troops in the field know there are \nmany actions that need to take place now or should have already taken \nplace if, in fact, we are serious about ending the commitment in Bosnia \nin June 1998. From a military point of view, we have established \nsignificant infrastructure in Bosnia to support the SFOR troops, and \nunless we just intend at great cost to abandon what we have \nestablished--and we are not going to do that--the military needs a plan \nand time to remove equipment, to disassemble buildings, to conduct the \nenvironmental cleanup and a myriad of other tasks.\n  Several months ago, I visited Bosnia, and I saw firsthand the extent \nof our involvement and developed an understanding of the complexity \nrequired to extract the SFOR troops should that decision be made. On \nthat same trip, I visited Taszar, Hungary, the staging base for U.S. \ntroops going into and coming out of Bosnia. Taszar also provides \noperational support for logistics in Bosnia.\n\n  I asked the commanding general in Taszar, what is the drop dead time \nto support an orderly withdrawal from Bosnia and fully restore the \nfacilities in country? And his answer was, 9 to 10\n\n[[Page S11622]]\n\nmonths to do the job right. Guess what? We are already past that \ndeadline. We should have already made the decision and started to work. \nBut apparently we have not because the President has not publicly \nadmitted what is obvious to most people--we have no intention of \nleaving Bosnia in June 1998. All I am asking of the President and the \nadministration is to be candid, come before the people and explain his \nintention concerning our commitment in Bosnia.\n  Even a casual reading, Mr. President, of U.S. and European newspapers \nreveals numerous stories spelling out the need for continued presence \nof NATO forces past June 1998. These stories frequently quote U.S. \nadministration and NATO ally decisionmakers. Let me give you an example \nof what I am talking about.\n  New York Times, just last week: ``Policymakers Agree on Need to \nextend U.S. Mission in Bosnia.''\n\n       The Clinton administration's top foreign policymakers have \n     reached a broad consensus on the need to keep some American \n     troops in Bosnia after their mission ends in June of next \n     year.\n\n  The article further quoted the White House National Security Adviser, \nSandy Berger: ``We must not forget the important interests that led us \nto work for a more stable, more peaceful Bosnia'' including European \nstability and NATO's own credibility, he said at Georgetown University. \n``The gains are not irreversible, and locking them in will require that \nthe international community stay engaged in Bosnia for a good while to \ncome.''\n  In the Great Britain Guardian, also last week; ``Bosnia forces await \nUS Green light.''\n\n       Although the multinational NATO-led Forces are supposed to \n     disband next June, plans for a follow-on force--unofficially \n     the Deterrent force (D-Force)--\n\n  We are going from IFOR to SFOR to DFOR--\n\n       have already begun.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       But senior military officials are reluctant to talk \n     openly--\n\n  Let me repeat this, Mr. President--\n\n       But senior military officials are reluctant to talk openly \n     until a skeptical United States Congress has been convinced \n     there is no alternative to staying on.\n\n  The Financial Times as of Tuesday, October 14: ``Solana plea over \nBosnia support.''\n\n       Javier Solana, the NATO secretary general, made his \n     strongest plea to date for ``a long-term commitment'' by the \n     alliance to peacekeeping in Bosnia.\n\n  Continuing, the article states:\n\n       Following the lead of US administration officials who have \n     recently started to prepare public opinion for some residual \n     US role in Bosnia after the middle of next year, Mr. Solana \n     said: ``NATO troops cannot and will not stay indefinitely, \n     but NATO has a long-term interest in and commitment to \n     Bosnia.''\n\n  The French Press Agency, 3 weeks ago: ``A `dissuasion' force to \nreplace SFOR in Bosnia.''\n\n       A ``dissuasion'' force will take over from the NATO-led \n     Stabilization Force in Bosnia. . ., Defense Minister Volker \n     Ruehe told the weekly Der Spiegel. The new ``Deterrent \n     Force'' will be significantly smaller than SFOR, which [now] \n     numbers 36,000 men. . .\n\n  These, Mr. President, are but a few examples of reports of a debate \nand subsequent decisions that apparently have taken place on future \nactions in Bosnia involving NATO and United States forces. But the sad \ncommentary is that the Congress and the American people have been left \nout of this important discussion.\n  All I am asking, Mr. President,--I am referring to President \nClinton--is for you to be candid. Let us have straight talk. Come \nclean. Come to the Congress. Tell us your plan. Let us know what your \nthoughts are and the forces required after June 1998.\n  It is my understanding that this afternoon, at approximately 4:30, \nthat many Members of Congress, the Senate, will go to the White House \nto enter into a discussion finally on the administration's decision in \nregard to Bosnia.\n  I have tried to understand why the President is reluctant to directly \nengage the Members of this body on this vital foreign policy matter. \nPerhaps it is because there has been some misunderstanding or maybe \neven he has misled us on his intent in Bosnia for the past 3 years.\n  ``We'll be out in just 1 year.'' That was the first statement that is \nstarting to ring a little hollow on the Hill. Does he think that we are \nso naive that we will not notice that the term ``SFOR'' has been \nreplaced by ``DFOR,'' and we will think he has kept his commitment to \nend SFOR in June 1998? I think not. Mr. President, the issue is not the \nname of the commitment but the commitment itself. The use of United \nStates forces in Bosnia is what we are concerned about.\n  Some have suggested that the reluctance on the part of the President \nis the concern of two events: NATO enlargement and the decision on \nBosnia will happen at about the same time next year and that both will \nbe negatively impacted in the debate in Congress. That certainly could \nhappen.\n  He could be right, if an examination into the commitment in Bosnia \nand the debate on enlarging NATO occurs at the same time--that debate \nshould take place at about the same time-- and there will be troubling \nquestions raised.\n  But the fact remains that we are in Bosnia, SFOR ends in June 1998, \nand the administration has done much work on the follow-on forces in \nBosnia. Again, however, the administration has failed to include the \nCongress in its decision process. That time is now.\n  These questions are not difficult. They are challenging, but they are \nobvious.\n  I would like to review the requirement added to the defense \nappropriations bill that requires the President to provide certain \ninformation on our Bosnian policy. This is a matter of law. These \nprovisions are about being honest with the American public.\n  I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee for referring to these amendments as the \nRoberts amendment. We have had long talks about the need to become \ncandid.\n  Specifically, these provisions require the President to certify to \nCongress by May 15 that the continued presence of United States forces \nin Bosnia is in our national security interest and why. He must state \nthe reasons for our deployment and the expected duration of deployment.\n  He must provide numbers of troops deployed, estimate the dollar costs \ninvolved, and give the effect of such deployment on the overall \neffectiveness of our overall United States forces.\n  Most importantly, the President must provide a clear statement of our \nmission and the objectives.\n  And he must provide an exit strategy for bringing our troops home.\n  If these specifics are not provided to the satisfaction of Congress, \nfunding for military deployment in Bosnia will end next May. Let me \nrepeat: We are requiring the administration to clearly articulate our \nBosnia policy, justify the use of military forces, and tell us when and \nunder what circumstances our troops can come home.\n  I do not think that is asking too much.\n  In my view, events of recent weeks make this an urgent matter, Mr. \nPresident. It has become increasingly clear that in the wake of the \nDayton accords this administration has, to some degree, lost focus and \npurpose in Bosnia.\n  Just consider the following:\n  After drifting for months, and with elections on the near horizon, \nand the crippling winter only days away, I believe the mission has been \nchanged. We have gone from peacekeeping, which is the stated goal, to \npeace enforcement with very dubious tactics.\n  Item. Troop protection, refugee relocation, democracy building, and \neconomic restoration and, the other policy goal, ``Oh, by the way, if \nwe run across a war criminal, well, let's arrest him''--that has all \nbeen replaced.\n  Today, we see increased troop strength--we are not revolving the \ntroops home--have picked a United States candidate for president of \nBosnia--we are no longer neutral--we have embarked upon aggressive \ndisarmament and the location, capture and prosecution of war criminals.\n  Is this mission creep or long overdue action? We do not know.\n  The world was treated to the spectacle of American troops, the symbol \nof defenders of freedom, taking over a Bosnian television station in an \neffort to muzzle its news. And the troops were then stoned by angry \ncitizens.\n  In our new role as TV executives in Bosnia, we actually suggested \nwhat kind of programs could be run and what kind of programs could not \nbe\n\n[[Page S11623]]\n\nrun. We ordered TV stations to read an apology concerning their \ninaccurate and unfair broadcasting. We wrote the message for them and \nrequired they read it every day for 5 days.\n  Gen. Wesley Clark is now a new TV executive in determining what goes \non television and what does not.\n  The Washington Times reported United States troops have become the \nbutt of jokes in Bosnia because of pregnancies. It seems the pregnancy \nrate among our female soldiers is between 7.5 to 8.5 percent. The \nBosnia media joked that the peacekeepers are breeding like rabbits \nwhile turning a blind eye to war criminals on the lam.\n  In a country where any benevolent leader is very scarce, we have \nchosen up sides, we have picked our candidates, supporting the cause of \none candidate over another. I might add, that candidate has lost \nsupport as a result.\n  Elections were conducted, but to cast ballots, many citizens had to \nbe bussed back to their homes, which they now cannot live in or may \nnever occupy, and then bussed out.\n  NATO forces, which include U.S. troops, have been cast into the role \nof cops on the beat, chasing war crimes suspects. Just to arrest Mr. \nKaradzic, we are told, try him for war crimes and our problems will be \nsolved. But as the New York Times recently pointed out: ``[Mr.] \nKaradzic reflects widely held views in Serbian society.'' If you bring \nhim to trial in The Hague, somebody else will take his place.\n  Do these events reflect a sound and defensible Bosnian policy that is \nin our national interest? Or do they sound an ominous alarm as America \nis dragged down into a Byzantine nightmare straight out of a Kafka \nnovel?\n  Ask the basic question, ``Who's in charge and where are we heading?'' \nand to date there has been silence from the administration. But that \nsilence speaks volumes, Mr. President, about the lack of direction and \nfocus of our Bosnian policy.\n  If the provisions of the defense appropriations bill do nothing else, \nthey should force a major reexamination of our Bosnian involvement from \ntop to bottom.\n  As Chairman Stevens, the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, will tell you, our involvement in Bosnia has \ncome at a large price. There are approximately 9,000 American troops in \nBosnia. That is closer to 15,000 today. That is nearly one-third of the \nNATO troops involved.\n  Dollar costs are escalating. From 1992 until 1995, the United States \nspent about $2.2 billion on various peacekeeping operations in the \nBalkans. From 1996 through 1998, costs are estimated to be $7.8 \nbillion. That figure, too, is escalating.\n  In justifying our policy in Bosnia, the administration must include a \nplan to fund the costs. Do they intend to take these rising costs out \nof the current defense budget, money we need for modernization, \nprocurement, quality of life for the armed services to protect our \nvital national security interests? Or is the administration prepared to \ncome clean and ask for the money up front?\n  Finally, I offer these thoughts, Mr. President. All of us in this \nbody desperately want lasting peace in Bosnia. I know it is easy to \ncriticize, but we want the killing to stop. We all want that. We want \nstability in that part of the world. We do not want a Palestine in the \nmiddle of Central Europe. Permanent peace, permanent stability, but \nwishing--wishing--it does not make it so.\n  Richard Grenier, writing for the Washington Times, put it this way:\n\n       . . . generally speaking, Serbs didn't love Croats, Croats \n     didn't love Serbs, nor did either of them love Muslims. \n     Reciprocally, Muslims loved neither Croats or Serbs.\n       What happened to the lessons we're supposed to have learned \n     in Beirut and Somalia? What happened to our swearing off of \n     mission creep? In Beirut we were intervening in Lebanese \n     domestic affairs, which led to the death of 241 U.S. Marines. \n     Our mission in Somalia, originally purely humanitarian, \n     expanded like a balloon as we thought, given our great \n     talent, we could build a new Somali nation. [We all saw] what \n     happened.\n       But here we go again in Bosnia. Once again our goal was at \n     first laudably humanitarian: to stop the killing.\n\n  We have done that, thank goodness.\n\n       But it expanded as we thought how wonderful it would be if \n     we could build a beautiful, tolerant, multi-ethnic Bosnia, on \n     the model of American multiculturalism. . .\n\n  Gen. John Sheehan, a Marine general, just stated in the press--and a \nremarkable candidate interviewed just this past week--we can stay in \nBosnia for 500 years and we would not solve the problem. It is a \ncultural war. It is an ethnic war.\n  The Bosnian situation is complex. And it is shrouded by centuries of \nconflict that only a few understand. They have had peace and stability \nand order and discipline only a few times in their history--the latest \nbeing with an iron fist by Marshal Tito.\n  Is that what NATO is going to be all about? What we have seen in \nrecent months is a lull in the fighting, unfortunately not its end. It \nis a fragile peace held together only by continued presence of military \nforce. How long can that continue? Are we prepared to pay the price?\n  National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the United States must \nremain engaged in Bosnia beyond June of next year, but that continued \nAmerican troop presence has not been decided.\n  This afternoon, when Members of Congress meet at the White House, it \nis time to decide what the specifics of our Bosnian policy will be.\n  Compare that statement of our National Security Adviser, Sandy \nBerger, with that of the advice of former Secretary of State Dr. Henry \nKissinger, who wrote just this past week: ``America must avoid drifting \ninto crisis with implications it may not be able to master'' and that \n``America has no [vital] national interest for which to risk lives to \nproduce a multiethnic state in Bosnia.''\n  Mr. President, no more drift. It is time for candor and clear \npurpose. Let the debate begin when the White House meets, finally, with \nMembers of Congress this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11621-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11623-S11626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know we have a vote at about 11 o'clock \nand my colleague from Georgia wants to be heard before that time. I \nwill try and move this along.\n  Mr. President, the vote around 11 o'clock is on a cloture motion \ndealing with a proposal that has been offered by my colleague from \nGeorgia, whom I respect greatly and agree with on many issues. On this \none we disagree, not because of his intent at all, but rather because I \nam concerned it is not the best use of scarce resources. Even though \nour budget situation is vastly improved from what it was even a few \nmonths ago--with the deficit now down around to unimaginably low \nlevels--still we must make careful decisions about how to best invest \nthose dollars.\n  When you are trying to help out working parents with the costs of \nraising children, the question becomes one of priorities in allocating \nresources. As I understand it, if the cloture motion that will be \noffered shortly were to be agreed to, an amendment that I would like to \noffer would be foreclosed because it would probably not pass the \nprocedural test of being germane. I am concerned about that, and for \nthat reason will oppose the cloture motion.\n  The amendment I would offer, Mr. President, would propose a \nsubstitute to what our colleague from Georgia has offered. My proposal \nwould allow for a refundable tax credit for child care. As it is right \nnow, we have some 2 million American families--working families; not on \nwelfare, but working--who don't have any tax liability at all and, \ntherefore, cannot claim the current child care tax credit.\n  The affordability and quality of child care, Mr. President, is an \narea in which most Americans are developing a growing sense of concern. \nThe recent tragedy in Massachusetts that we have all been witness to \nover the last several days, highlights the concerns that millions and \nmillions of American families have today about who will care for their \nchildren and whether they can afford to place them in a quality \nenvironment.\n  In contrast, when we are talking about education, choices do exist \nfor parents. There are 53 million American children who are in our \nelementary and secondary schools at this very hour. About 90 percent of \nthem are in public\n\n[[Page S11624]]\n\nschools, about 10 percent in private and parochial schools. There is a \nchoice, Mr. President. Parents have a choice. Now, it is expensive in \nsome private and parochial schools, but the choice of free public \nschooling is there. It is not a great choice in many areas because of \nthe condition of our public schools, but at least affordability is not \nan issue.\n  When it comes to child care, Mr. President, there really are not many \nchoices available to parents. If you are coming off welfare, if you are \nworking, you have to place your children someplace. The issues of \nquality and accessibility are obviously important, but if you can't \nafford it at all, if you can't afford the $4,000 to the $9,000 a year \nthat it costs to place your child in a child care setting, you have no \nchoices.\n  Today, when we have working families out there that are barely making \nit and we have about $2 billion in tax credits we can offer, I ask the \nquestion of my colleagues of whether we can't do something to help. \nWhile we might like to do everything for everyone if we could, given \nthe choice of providing a tax credit to someone making $85,000 a year \nto send their child to a private school or saying to a working family \nthat is barely making it, here are some resources that will allow you \nto place your child while you work in a decent child care setting, what \nchoice do we make? Do we provide a tax break, with all due respect, to \npeople who have a choice? Or do we offer a refundable tax credit of \nroughly the same cost as Senator Coverdell's amendment to working \nfamilies, struggling to hold body and soul together--people who have no \nchoices.\n\n  Mr. President, the other day there was an article in the Hartford \nCourant about a woman who has three children, making $6.50 an hour. She \nhas a small apartment and a 1981 automobile. Now she is about to leave \nwelfare. She will lose her welfare benefits of $500 or $600 a month. \nThat ends this week. Now, at $6.50 an hour, with three kids, trying to \nkeep an apartment, trying to keep her family going, I would like to say \nto her I can't do everything for you with regard to your children as \nyou go to work. But I would at least like to say that I can offer you a \nrefundable tax credit--because at $6.50 an hour you are not paying \ntaxes--and give you a break to see that your three children can be in a \nchild care setting where they may be safe.\n  The question is, do I try to help her? Or, with all due respect, do I \ninstead help someone making--$50,000, $60,000, or $70,000 a year to go \nto a private school in Washington, Maryland or Virginia? Those are the \nkind of choices we have to make.\n  I argue very strongly that when you have limited resources, let's put \nthem to work for people who are struggling out there, who need the help \nthe most. Because I can't offer an amendment that I think would make \nthe right choice if cloture were adopted, with all due respect to the \nauthors of the amendment, I will oppose cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to complete my remarks prior to the scheduled 11 a.m. vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, originally we were allocated some 15 \nminutes for comments prior to the vote. Under this unanimous consent, I \nyield up to 7 minutes of my time to my distinguished colleague from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding.\n  Mr. President, through the years there has been no more compelling \nvoice on the floor of this Senate for the interests of children and \nfamilies than Senator Dodd. Today is no exception. Senator Dodd has \nmade a compelling case for the need for child care in America. I could \nnot agree more strongly. I wish he had a chance on this day to have his \namendment offered, and I would join in voting with him.\n  The choice before the Senate today is not a choice between Senator \nCoverdell's proposal and Senator Dodd. Both have merit. I would support \neach. Senator Coverdell's proposal is fully paid for by offsetting the \nelimination of a corporate deduction. It has no negative impact on the \nbudget. It is paid for, as Senator Dodd's amendment, indeed, can also \nbe paid for.\n  What the Senate has before it today is a chance to escape this \ncontinuing nonproductive dialog about whether or not we will engage in \nvouchers for private school or leave the plight to private school \nstudents unanswered. Senator Coverdell has offered an imaginative \nanswer by expanding what is indeed a proposal that the Senate adopted \nearlier in the year for HOPE scholarships offered by President Clinton. \nBy that same concept of allowing families to save their own money to \nmake their own choices for the education of their families, Senator \nCoverdell's proposal would be expanded to high school and grade school.\n  It is an economic sense and a compelling answer to a real national \ndilemma. First, that the education of a child and some of those \ndecisions be retained by families, where families use their own \nresources--not just mothers and fathers but aunts, uncles, sister and \nbrothers--who may not be able to put away $2,000 or $2,500 in a year \nwith limited resources, but can on every birthday and every anniversary \nand every holiday put away $10, $20, and $100 so that during the course \nof a child's life those resources are available, families are involved, \nusing their money.\n  Second, it isn't just a question of whether this money would be \navailable for private school students. The Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimates that 70 percent of the families who would avail themselves of \nthese resources would be public school students because under the \nproposal that money is available to buy home computers or \ntransportation for extracurricular activities, school uniforms or, most \nimportantly in my mind, after-school tutors to help with the advancing \nmath and science curriculum in our schools.\n\n  Third, also a compelling aspect of this case is not only is it \nprivate money, not only would much of it go to public school students, \nbut it will also stop potentially the hemorrhaging loss of private \nschools in this country. A parochial school in America closes every \nweek. We are not opening up enough public schools to make up the \ndifference. At a time when education is the Nation's principal \nchallenge to our economic well-being, the number of classrooms and \nchairs for American students is declining. This is the use of private \nsavings, private resources, to stop that hemorrhaging loss.\n  Critics argue this is money that is going to help the wealthiest \nfamilies in America when we should be doing more for working families. \nOn the contrary. First, there is a cap in the legislation of $95,000 \nfor single filing taxpayers. Overwhelmingly, three-quarters of this \nmoney is going to families that earn less than $70,000 a year. This is \nthe answer to giving working families a chance to get involved in the \neducation of their children.\n  Mr. President, I make no case for the procedures involved in this. \nThere are worthwhile additions to this bill I would like to support. \nSenator Landrieu and Senator Graham have a worthwhile proposal for \nprepaid tuitions. I believe in Senator Dodd's proposal for day care and \nchild care. I would like to see the Senate address both. Indeed, in \ntime, I hope and I trust that we will.\n  But on this day we address the question of whether or not families \nwill be able to use their own resources to become involved in their own \nplanning for their children's public or private education. This \nCongress has been presented with a series of challenges by the \nPresident. One was to address new resources to education. We do it. \nSecond, to get families back involved. We do it. Third, he has stated a \ngreat national goal to get every school in America online into the new \ncentury. We go beyond it. Sixty percent of American families and 85 \npercent of minority students have no access to a home computer. They \nare not going to school on an equal basis with all other American \nstudents. They don't have it for their homework, they don't have it for \ncomposition, they don't have it for research. The Internet and those \ncomputers are the principal tool for American students in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Under the Coverdell-Torricelli proposal not only will America schools \nbe online but so will American families at home because these students \ncan use these A-plus accounts to buy that equipment for home.\n  Mr. President, I join with Senator Coverdell on this day, asking that \nthis be a genuinely bipartisan answer\n\n[[Page S11625]]\n\nfor a genuinely bipartisan problem. Education is the American issue of \nthese last years of the 21st century. It is the question of whether or \nnot America maintains our standard of living and is economically \ncompetitive. Education is an issue without par in this Congress and in \nthis country. This may not be a total answer. It is certainly not the \nlast of the answer but it is an important addition for the labyrinth of \nissues and questions we must walk through in answering the education \nquestion.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding the \ntime.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to compliment the Senator from \nNew Jersey for his remarks, and more importantly, for his steadfast \nsupport of this proposal, and not always under the easiest of \ncircumstances. He has been a great colleague and advocate and I have \nenjoyed working with him on this proposal.\n  Where we find ourselves, moments away from this vote, Mr. President, \nis that the filibuster could not be broken last week and it was \nsuggested that if we could just iron out a few amendments that both \nsides would come together.\n  Over the weekend we suggested that we would agree to two or three \namendments on both sides and try to proceed. That would require a \nunanimous consent, or for those listening, a unanimous agreement--\neverybody will have to agree. The other side of the aisle cannot secure \nthat.\n  Given the hour of this session, this is no time to open it up to a \nfree-for-all. So the filibuster will probably continue and my \nprediction is, fall a vote or two short of ending the filibuster and \nproceeding with what would be easy passage of the education savings \naccount. It is unfortunate, because every time we delay these ideas \nanother week, another month, we just slow down the great need to get at \nthe problems in education in grades kindergarten through high \nschool. Every time we delay, we create another student whose economic \nopportunity, whose challenges in this society will be inhibited because \nof a lack of resources that might have been made available to that \nchild.\n\n  However, the adoption of this concept is inevitable. The status quo, \nwhich has fought from day one and continues to do everything it can to \nblock almost any new idea, will not prevail. The American people will \noverride the status quo, and ideas like the education savings account \nare going to become law. My prediction is that, come February 1998, \nthis proposal will be back before us and we will ultimately secure \npassage of it.\n  Just a reminder. Mr. President, the education savings account will \nallow families to save up to $2,500 a year of their own aftertax money, \nand the interest buildup would not be taxed if the proceeds of the \nprincipal and interest are used to help an education purpose--\nessentially, grades kindergarten through high school, which is where \nour problems are; although it could be used in college.\n  Senator Dodd, in his remarks, inferred that these were resources that \nwere going to allow somebody to enjoy private education. I think it's \nimportant that we take an overview of the entire proposal. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation says that the education savings account will be \nused by 14 million American families. That probably equates to 20 to 25 \nmillion children that would be the beneficiaries of this concept. That \nis almost half the school population in the United States that would \nbenefit from this new structure, this education savings account. And \n10.8 million of these families would be families with children in \npublic schools. Seventy percent of all the value of these savings \naccounts will go to augment public schools. Thirty percent will augment \nthose that are in a private school.\n  It is statistically insignificant, but it is a fact that some \nfamilies will use the account to change schools. But in the overall \npicture, you are essentially bringing new dollars that don't have to be \ntaxed, new dollars that people are saving themselves and, as Senator \nTorricelli said, families becoming involved, families setting aside \nmoney to augment the child's education deficiency.\n  Now, I call these dollars smart dollars. They are smart dollars \nbecause the family is directing their expenditure, and we know that it \nwill, therefore, go to the exact child deficiency, which may be the \nfact that the child does not have a home computer; it may be that the \nchild needs a math tutor; it may be that the child is experiencing \ndyslexia or some medical problem and the family will be able to augment \nand help support a learning disability. Well, the list goes on and on \nand on, as to the kind of particular or peculiar deficiencies that the \nchild may suffer. This allows a resource to be gathered together to be \nput right on the problem. Unfortunately, you can't get that kind of \nutility for most public dollars.\n  As Senator Torricelli said, 70 percent of all these resources will \nassist families making $75,000 or less. So it's going right to the \nhardest pressed, the middle class. It's right on target.\n  Mr. President, there is another unique feature about the education \nsavings account. The education savings account, which for most people \nwould resemble an IRA, is different in that it would allow sponsors to \ncontribute to the account. That could be an extended family member, an \nuncle, aunt, cousin, grandparent. More importantly, it could be a \nchurch, it could be an employer, it could be a community assistance \norganization, it could be a labor union. The imagination can't even \nperceive the kinds of community activities. How often have we seen a \nlaw enforcement officer fall in the line of duty and the community \nwants to come forward to help? This is the kind of tool that would be \nused. That community could set up an education savings account for the \nsurviving children so that they would be more able to deal with their \neducational needs as they grow older without their father or mother.\n  I can envision a company saying, well, we will put $50 a month in the \naccount for the children that work for our employees if the employee \nwill match it. By the end of the year, that would be half of the amount \nof money that is legally available; that would be $1,200. So it's an \ninstrument that allows the entire community, the entire family to bring \ntogether resources to help with whatever problem that child may \nconfront when they get to school.\n  The other side has tried to describe it as a voucher. It's not. A \nvoucher is public money given to the parents to decide what to do with. \nThis is the parents' money. This is private money. We are allowing the \nparents an opportunity to get focused on that child's education, and \njust with the attention alone in creating 14 million family accounts \nlike this, there will be an attitude change. You know, they can get \nfocused on it and they think of their child and what that child needs, \nand they will have an exhilarated feeling of putting a resource in that \naccount once a month, or every quarter, or on holidays, as Senator \nTorricelli said.\n  They have said this goes to the wealthy. It does not. It goes to the \nmiddle class. They have even said, at one point, well, it doesn't \namount to much. If it doesn't, I can't imagine why in the devil I am \nfacing this filibuster and why the President said he would veto the \nentire tax relief plan if this proposal were in the tax relief bill.\n  Mr. President, this is an idea whose time has come. The education \nsavings account is going to become law. It is just a matter of time. I \nhoped we could do it in this session, but I think the filibuster is, \nonce again, going to deny a good idea. America, as Senator Torricelli \nsaid, is focused on education. It will not accept the status quo. It is \ngoing to force new ideas. We cannot afford to have a failed elementary \neducation system in place as we come to the new century.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle that have stood up to the special interests and have said we are \ngoing to change the status quo. I appreciate all the assistance from \nthe colleagues on my side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS Mr. President, today we will vote on whether to invoke \ncloture on a bill--H.R. 2646--that would allow parents to save money \nfor their children's education without incurring tax liability.\n  The proposed new education savings account, which expands existing \nlaw, would allow families to contribute up to $2,500 per year in a \nsavings account for a variety of public or private education-related \nexpenses. Congress had\n\n[[Page S11626]]\n\nearlier voted to support the Coverdell amendment 59 to 41, on June 27.\n  Currently, the reconciliation law we passed this year as part of the \nbudget agreement, allows parents to save up to $500 per year for their \nchildren's college education without penalty.\n  The new education savings accounts are more expansive in that they \nallow the money to be used for children's kindergarten through 12th \ngrade education expenses as well as college.\n  Our adoption of this bill without further delay comes at a notable \ntime, a time of increasing focus on the future of America's children. \nJust over a week ago, the White House held a summit intended to bring \nchildren's issues into the forefront as a national priority.\n  What better way to turn consensus-building into action than to give \nparents the practical tool which the Coverdell bill supplies; a tool \nwhich allows parents to better provide options for their children's \neducation.\n  The education savings accounts help working families. They are a good \ncomplement to the $500 per child tax credit I have long championed, \nwhich was included in the tax bill this year. They encourage savings \nand allow families to make plans which shape a child's future.\n  This provision is directed at low and middle income families, not \nwealthy families who currently have education options. All families \nshould have a better opportunity to choose the best education for their \nchildren.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the great majority of \nfamilies expected to take advantage of the education savings accounts \nhave incomes of $75,000 or less.\n  In other words, in families where both parents are working, \nindividual parent income is at the very most an average of $37,500 in \nmore than two-thirds of the families expected to take advantage of this \nlegislation. Clearly, these are the families who need our help the \nmost.\n  Mr. President, this important legislation offers a real solution for \nAmerica's working families. We must act now to help families best \nprovide for one of life's most basic necessities--a child's education.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the Coverdell bill because it \nuses regressive tax policy to subsidize vouchers for private schools. \nIt does not give any real financial help to low-income, working- and \nmiddle-class families, and it does not help children in the nation's \nclassrooms. What it does is undermine public schools and provide yet \nanother tax giveaway for the wealthy.\n  Public education is one of the great successes of American democracy. \nIt makes no sense for Congress to undermine it. This bill turns its \nback on the Nation's long-standing support of public schools and \nearmarks tax dollars for private schools. This bill is a fundamental \nstep in the wrong direction for education and for the Nation's \nchildren.\n  Senator Coverdell's proposal would spend $2.5 billion over the next 5 \nyears on subsidies to help wealthy people pay the private school \nexpenses they already pay, and do nothing to help children in public \nschools get a better education.\n  It is important to strengthen our national investment in education. \nWe should invest more in improving public schools by fixing leaky roofs \nand crumbling buildings, by recruiting and preparing excellent \nteachers, and by taking many other steps.\n  If we have $2.5 billion more to spend on elementary and secondary \neducation, we should spend it to deal with these problems. We should \nnot invest in bad education policy and bad tax policy. We should \nsupport teachers and rebuild schools--not build tax shelters for the \nwealthy.\n  Proponents of the bill claim that it deserves our support because the \nJoint Committee on Taxation estimates that almost 75 percent of funds \nwill go to public school students.\n  But they're distorting the facts. According to the Department of \nTreasury, 70 percent of the benefit of the bill would go to those \nfamilies in the highest income brackets. An October 28, 1997, Joint Tax \nCommittee memorandum states that 83 percent of families with children \nin private schools would use this account, but only 28 percent of \nfamilies with children in public schools would make use of it. It is a \nsham to pretend that the bill is not providing a subsidy for private \nschools. The overwhelming majority of the benefits go to high-income \nfamilies who are already sending their children to private school, and \ndoes nothing to improve public education.\n  In fact, the Joint Tax Committee memorandum clearly confirms this \nbasic point that the bill disproportionately benefits families who send \ntheir children to private schools. As the committee memorandum states, \n``The dollar benefit to returns with children in public schools is \nassumed to be significantly lower than that attributable to returns \nwith children in private schools.''\n  Proponents of the bill claim that 70 percent of the benefits from the \nCoverdell accounts would go to families that earn under $70,000 a year.\n  But again, they're distorting the facts. The facts are that the \nmajority of the benefits under the proposal go to upper income \nfamilies. Only about 10 percent of taxpayers have incomes between \n$70,000 and the capped income levels. Therefore, 30% of the benefits \nwould go to just 10 percent of the taxpayers. In addition, the majority \nof the benefits for families who earn under $70,000 a year go to those \nearning between $55,000 and $70,000 a year.\n  Other families will get almost no tax break from this legislation. \nFamilies earning less than $50,000 a year will get a tax cut of $2.50 a \nyear from this legislation--$2.50. You can't even buy a good box of \ncrayons for that amount. Families in the lowest income brackets--those \nmaking less than $17,000 a year--will get a tax cut of all of $1--$1. \nBut, a family earning over $93,000 will get $97.\n  Proponents also claim that these IRA's do not use public money. The \nmoney invested in the accounts, whether by individuals, their employer, \nor their labor union is their own money, not public funds.\n  But the loss to the Treasury is clear. This proposal will cost the \nTreasury $2.5 billion in the first 5 years. It is nonsense to pretend \nthat these funds are not a Federal subsidy to private schools.\n  Scarce tax dollars should be targeted to public schools, which don't \nhave the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose special \nchallenges, such as children with disabilities, limited English-\nproficient children, or homeless students. Private schools can decide \nwhether to accept a child or not. The real choice under this bill goes \nto the schools, not the parents. We should not use public tax dollars \nto support schools that select some children and reject others.\n  We all want children to get the best possible education. We should be \ndoing more--much more--to support efforts to improve local public \nschools. We should oppose any plan that would undermine those efforts.\n  This bill is simply private school vouchers under another name. It is \nwrong for Congress to subsidize private schools. We should improve our \npublic schools--not abandon them.\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, last week I was pleased to join with my \ncolleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing S. \n1345, the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act which is intended \nto improve the way we care for people at the end of their lives.\n  Noted health economist Uwe Reinhardt once observed that ``Americans \nare the only people on earth who believe that death is negotiable.'' \nAdvancements in medicine, public health, and technology have enabled \nmore and more of us to live longer and healthier lives. However, when \nmedical treatment can no longer promise a continuation of life, \npatients and their families should not have to fear that the process of \ndying will be marked by preventable pain, avoidable distress, or care \nthat is inconsistent with their values or wishes.\n  The fact is, dying is a universal experience, and it is time to \nreexamine how we approach death and dying and how we care for people at \nthe end of their lives. Clearly there is more that we can do to relieve \nsuffering, respect personal choice and dignity, and provide \nopportunities for people to find meaning and comfort at life's \nconclusion.\n  Unfortunately, most Medicare patients and their physicians do not \ncurrently discuss death or routinely make advance plans for end-of-life \ncare. As a result, about one-fourth of Medicare funds are now spent on \ncare at the end of life that is geared toward expensive, high-\ntechnology interventions, and rescue care. While four out of five \nAmericans say they would prefer to die at home, studies show that \nalmost 80 percent die in institutions where they may be in pain, and \nwhere they are subjected to high-technology treatments that merely \nprolong suffering.\n  Moreover, according to a Dartmouth study released earlier this month, \nwhere a patient lives has a direct impact on how that patient dies. The \nstudy found that the amount of medical treatment Americans receive in \ntheir final months varies tremendously in the different parts of the \ncountry, and it concluded that the determination of whether or not an \nolder patient dies in the hospital probably has more to do with the \nsupply of hospital beds than the patient's needs or preference.\n  The Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act is intended to help \nus improve the way our health care system serves patients at the end of \ntheir lives. Among other provisions, the bill makes a number of changes \nto the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 to facilitate appropriate \ndiscussions and individual autonomy in making difficult discussions \nabout end-of-life care. For instance, the legislation requires that \nevery Medicare beneficiary receiving care in a hospital or nursing \nfacility be given the opportunity to discuss end-of-life care and the \npreparation of an advanced directive with an appropriately trained \nprofessional within the institution. The legislation also requires that \nif a patient has an advanced directive, it must be displayed in a \nprominent place in the medical record so that all the doctors and \nnurses can clearly see it.\n  The legislation will expand access to effective and appropriate pain \nmedications for Medicare beneficiaries at the end of their lives. \nSevere pain, including breakthrough pain that defies usual methods of \npain control, is one of the most debilitating aspects of terminal \nillness. However, the only pain medication currently covered by \nMedicare in an outpatient setting is that which is administered by a \nportable pump.\n  It is widely recognized among physicians treating patients with \ncancer and other life-threatening diseases that self-administered pain \nmedications, including oral drugs and transdermal patches, offer \nalternatives that are equally effective in controlling pain, more \ncomfortable for the patient, and much less costly than the pump. \nTherefore, the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act would expand \nMedicare to cover self-administered pain medications prescribed for the \nrelief of chronic pain in life-threatening diseases or conditions.\n  In addition, the legislation authorizes the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to study end-of-life issues for Medicare and Medicaid \npatients and also to develop demonstration projects to develop models \nfor end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries who do not qualify for \nthe hospice benefit, but who still have chronic debilitating and \nultimately fatal illnesses. Currently, in order for a Medicare \nbeneficiary to qualify for the hospice benefit, a physician must \ndocument that the person has a life expectancy of 6 months or less. \nWith some conditions--like congestive heart failure--it is difficult to \nproject life expectancy with any certainty. However, these patients \nstill need hospice-like services, including advance planning, support \nservices, symptom management, and other services that are not currently \navailable.\n  Finally, the legislation establishes a telephone hotline to provide \nconsumer information and advice concerning advance directives, end-of-\nlife issues and medical decision making and directs the Agency for \nHealth Care Policy and Research to develop a research agenda for the \ndevelopment of quality measures for end-of-life care.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important in \nlight of the current debate on physician-assisted suicide. As the \nBangor Daily News pointed out in an editorial published earlier this \nyear, the desire for assisted suicide is generally driven by concerns \nabout the quality of care for the terminally ill; by the fear of \nprolonged pain, loss of dignity and emotional strain on family members. \nSuch worries would recede and support for assisted suicide would \nevaporate if\n\n[[Page S11628]]\n\nbetter palliative care and more effective pain management were widely \navailable. I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, patients and their families should be \nable to trust that the care they receive at the end of their lives is \nnot only of high quality, but also that it respects their desires for \npeace, autonomy, and dignity. The Advanced Planning and Compassionate \nCare Act that Senator Rockefeller and I have introduced will give us \nsome of the tools that we need to improve care of the dying in this \ncountry, and I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11627-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11628-S11629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EXPLOITATIVE CHILD LABOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes about a \nvery troubling shortcoming in the legislation to grant the President \nfast-track authority, and that is its failure to adequately address the \nissue of abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  First, let me discuss what I mean by exploitative child labor. It is \na term well known in international relations. We are not talking about \nchildren who work part time after school or on weekends. There is \nnothing wrong with that. I worked in my youth. I bet the occupant of \nthe Chair worked in his youth. There is nothing wrong with young people \nworking. That is not the issue.\n  Exploitative child labor involves children under the age of 15, \nforced to work, many times in hazardous conditions, many under slave-\nlike conditions, who sweat long hours for little or no pay. They are \ndenied an education or the opportunity to grow and develop. It is the \nkind of work that endangers a child's physical and emotional well-being \nand growth. The International Labor Organization estimates that there \nare some 250 million children worldwide engaged in this sort of \neconomic activity.\n  These are the kind of kids we are talking about. We are talking about \nthis young Mexican girl, harvesting vegetables in the fields of Hidalgo \nState. They are out there working long hours, all day long. They are \nnot in school. You know, my farmers in Iowa can compete with anybody \naround the world. That is why we have always believed in free trade. \nBut we believe in a level playing field. My farmers cannot compete with \nthis slave. That is what she is. You can dress it up in all kinds of \nfancy words and cover it up, but that girl out in that field is working \nunder slave-like conditions because she has no other choice. And isn't \nthat the definition of slavery?\n  She is not alone. It is in Pakistan and India, Bolivia, Southeast \nAsia, all around the world--children working under these kinds of \nconditions. I am not talking about after school. I am talking about \nkids who are denied an education, forced to work in fields and \nfactories under hazardous conditions for little or no pay.\n  I have been working on this issue for a long time. In 1992 I \nintroduced the Child Labor Deterrence Act, to try to end abusive and \nexploitative child labor. It would have banned the importation of all \ngoods into the United States made by abusive and exploitative child \nlabor.\n  Some have said this is revolutionary, but I don't believe so. I \nbelieve it is written in the most conservative of all ideas that this \ncountry stands for; that international trade cannot ignore \ninternational values.\n  Would the President of the United States ever send a bill to Congress \ndealing with free trade or opening up trade with a country that \nemployed slave labor? Of course not; he would be laughed off the floor. \nBut what about this young girl? What about the millions more like her \naround the world? They are as good as slaves because they don't have \nany other choice and they are forced to do this under the guise of free \ntrade.\n  We, as a nation, cannot ignore, this. In 1993, this Senate put itself \non record in opposition to the exploitation of children by passing a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that I submitted.\n  In 1994, as chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I requested the Department of Labor to \nbegin a series of reports on child labor. Those reports, now three in \nnumber, represent the most thorough documentation ever assembled by the \nU.S. Government on this issue. They published three reports; the fourth \nwill be completed shortly.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced a bill called the Child Labor Free \nConsumer Information Act, which would give consumers the power to \ndecide through a voluntary labeling system whether they want to buy an \narticle made by child labor or not. Every time you buy a shirt, it says \non the shirt where it was made. It tells you how much cotton, how much \npolyester and how much nylon, et cetera, is in that shirt. It has a \nprice tag on it and tells you how much it cost to buy. But it won't \ntell you what it may have cost a child to make that shirt or that pair \nof shoes or that glassware or that brass object or that soccer ball or \nany number of items, including the vegetables that this girl is \nharvesting in Mexico.\n  So we said, let's have a voluntary labeling system, and if a company \nwanted to import items into the United States, they could affix a label \nsaying it was child labor free. In exchange for that label, they would \nhave to agree to allow surprise inspections of their plants to ensure \nthat no children were ever employed there.\n  To me, this puts the power in the hands of consumers. It gives us the \ninformation that we need to know. I still think this is the direction \nin which we ought to go, a labeling system, and we have experience in \nthat.\n  Right now ``RUGMARK'' is being affixed to labels on rugs coming out \nof India and Nepal that verifies that rug was not made with child \nlabor, and it is working. It is working well, because now the people \nauthorized to use the ``RUGMARK'' label have to open up their plants \nfor people to come in and make sure no children are employed there, and \nthey get the label ``RUGMARK,'' which certifies it was not made with \nchild labor. The ``RUGMARK'' program also provides funds to build \nschools and provides teachers to educate these children so that they \nare not displaced. So if I, as a consumer, want to buy a nice hand-\nknotted rug, if I see that ``RUGMARK'' label, I know it was not made by \nchild labor. More and more importers are importing ``RUGMARK'' rugs \ninto this country. It has worked well in Europe, and now it is in the \nUnited States.\n  In October of this year, Congress passed into law another provision \nthat I had worked on with Congressman Sanders in the House. It is \nregarding section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which makes it clear \nthat goods made with forced or indentured labor are to be barred from \nentry into the United States. Section 307 of the tariff law of 1930 \nbanned articles made by prison labor and forced labor from coming into \nthis country. That has been on the books since 1930. What Congress \npassed was a clarification of that law or an explanation of that law to \nsay that it also covers goods made by forced or indentured child labor. \nCongress passed it as part of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill.\n  So you might say, Well, if you have done that, then there is nothing \nelse to do. But that is only an appropriations bill, and it is only \ngood for 1 year. We are now working with Customs officials to try to \ndecide how they find those articles made by exploitative child labor. \nAgain, it is only good for 1 year. Will we be able to put this into \npermanent law next year? I don't know. And that still does not address \nthe issue of children who don't make goods bound for the U.S. market.\n\n  Right now, Mr. President, it is estimated somewhere in the \nneighborhood of 12.5 million kids around the world are involved in this \nkind of exploitative child labor, making goods that go into foreign \ntrade that come into this country; 12.5 million kids, a large number \nbeing exploited for the economic gain of others.\n  Make no mistake about it, their economic gain is an economic loss for \nthis child and their country and for the United States. Every child \nlost to the workplace in this manner is a child who will not learn a \nvaluable skill to help their country develop economically or becoming a \nmore active participant in the global markets.\n\n[[Page S11629]]\n\n  We have done much to address the issue of exploitative child labor, \nbut I am sorry to say that one of the most important measures that we \nwill be asked to vote on this year or perhaps next year, depending on \nwhen it comes here for a vote--this bill, S. 1269, the so-called fast-\ntrack bill--does not recognize the depths of the problem of \nexploitative child labor and does little to help protect them from \nexploitation.\n  This bill protects songs. It protects computer chips. Let me read. \nIntellectual property. This bill, under part B, says, ``the principal \ntrade negotiating objectives.'' There are 15. Principal trade \nnegotiating objectives. The first is reduction of barriers to trade in \ngoods. The second is trade in services. The third is foreign \ninvestment. Fourth is intellectual property, and it says:\n\n       The principal negotiating objectives of the United States \n     regarding intellectual property are--\n\n  And it has a bunch of things here. It says:\n\n       . . . to recognize and adequately protect intellectual \n     property, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, \n     semiconductor chip layout designs. . .\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes to finish up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Three more minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know people are here to speak. I just \nwant to finish.\n  We are protecting semiconductor chip computer design layouts. If we \ncan protect a song, we can protect a child. That is my bottom line on \nthis. What do they do with child labor? Oh, it is back here on page 18, \n``It's the policy of the United States to reinforce trade agreements \nprocess by seeking to establish in the International Labor \nOrganization''--the ILO--``a mechanism for the examination of, \nreporting on''--et cetera, and includes exploitative child labor. It \ndoesn't mean a thing. I know all about the ILO. It is a great \norganization. It has absolutely zero enforcement powers.\n  If we can protect a song, why can't we protect a child? Why don't we \nelevate exploitative child labor to the same status as intellectual \nproperty rights? Let's make it a separate principal trade negotiating \nobjective of this Government that when we negotiate a trade agreement \nwith a country, yes, we will negotiate on trade in services and on \nforeign investment and intellectual property. But let's also put child \nlabor right up there as one of the principal negotiating objectives of \nour Government.\n  I have an amendment drafted to that extent. It mirrors exactly what \nis done in intellectual property. We make this young girl the \nequivalent of a song or a computer chip layout design. Anything less \nthan that means that this fast-track legislation ought to be consigned \nto the trash heap of history. If we are not willing to take that kind \nof a step to announce it loudly and forcefully to the White House and \nto instruct the people who are involved in negotiating our trade \nagreements, then this body has no reason at all to pass fast-track \nlegislation. We must elevate the issue of exploitative child labor to \nthat level. Anything less will not do.\n\n  I yield the floor and thank my friend from Missouri for giving me the \nopportunity to finish my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11628-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11629-S11630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to present to my colleagues \nwhat I think is a compromise that will help us get over a very \ndifficult situation. I am very proud to be a member of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee and to have joined with the leadership of \nthat committee--Chairman Chafee, Senator Warner, Ranking Member Baucus, \nand the other members of the committee, in reporting out what I believe \nis an excellent transportation reauthorization bill.\n  I think this is a bill that we need for the next 6 years. We need it \nfor transportation, for safety, for economic development. The simple \nfact of the matter is, without discussing the whys, the ``where we \nare'' is we are not going to get that passed this year. There, in my \nview, is no way that we can get agreement, get it passed on the floor \nof the Senate, and agree with the House on a very different approach \nthey are taking prior to the time we adjourn for the remainder of the \nyear.\n  If we don't--and we had a hearing today in Environment and Public \nWorks--No. 1, the Department of Transportation operations cannot \ncontinue, vitally needed safety programs cannot continue, transit \nprograms cannot continue, and many States will not be able to let the \ncontracts they need for major construction projects in the coming \nmonths because they will not have the obligational authority.\n  There is a lot of money in the States--over $9 billion--that is \nunobligated that has been authorized, but the problem is very often it \nis in the wrong category. The States have money, but it may be in CMAQ \nwhen they need it in STP or the various different programs.\n  The question is, what are we going to do about it? Some in the House \nhave presented a proposal that is sort of a 6-month extension. It keeps \nthe old formula and tries to jam everything into 12 months. Frankly, \nthat is very unfair to my State and quite a few other States that are \nknown in this body as donor States.\n  I can assure you that any time we try to do something in the highway \nand transportation area that gets us into a formula discussion, we are \ngoing to spend some time at it. I feel very strongly about the \nformulas, and I intend to express myself about them, as other Members \nshould.\n  What are we going to do about it? What are we going to do about the \nfact that safety and transit programs run out and many States will not \nbe able to let contracts they need for major projects at the end of the \nwinter when they have to get ready for the summer construction season?\n  Today I presented to my colleagues in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee a compromise which I think enables us to continue these \nvitally important operations. Certainly highways and transportation are \nright at the top of the list of things that my constituents in Missouri \nwant to see us do. It will enable us to come back after the first of \nthe year, pass a 6-year reauthorization and do so without penalizing \nthe States and the transit and the safety programs.\n  What we would do under my bill is provide 6 months of funding for the \nsafety programs, the Department of Transportation operations and \ntransit. For the unobligated balances, we would give the States \ncomplete flexibility. If they want to put surface transportation money \ninto construction mitigation, they could do so, and they would be able \nto continue their operations and issue contracts through March 31.\n  Some States do not have enough unobligated balances to be able to \ncontinue their contracting authority through March 31 at the same rate \nthey had done in this year or the previous year. So for those States, \nmy measure would provide them an advance, an advance against what we \nare going to authorize in the bill that we must pass and that the \nPresident must sign so transportation can go forward in this country.\n  For most States, it means a small amount, but we would advance fund \nthat money without regard to the formula. Say, for example, you had \n$250 million in unobligated balances, but in the first 6 months in one \nof those years you obligated $290 million. We would have the Department \nof Transportation advance $40 million to that State so that between now \nand March 31, the State would be able to obligate $290 million for \ntransportation purposes.\n  Later on in the year, when that State's allocation is determined and, \nsay, under the formula that State would get $500 million from probably, \nsay, $800 million for the year, that $40 million would be deducted from \nthe allocations under the new authorization, and they would get $760 \nmillion.\n  What this does, Mr. President, is allow us to keep things operating, \nkeep contracts being let, keep transit programs and safety programs \noperating without getting bogged down in the formula fight.\n  As I said earlier, when I say ``bogged down,'' I look forward to the \nvery active discussion of the funding formula.\n\n[[Page S11630]]\n\nIt is one of the most important things that we need to do around here \nin terms of economic development, transportation and safety. But it \nwill take some time. I would envision that whenever the majority leader \nwants to schedule it, it would take at least a couple of weeks and \nmaybe more. So while we are doing that, we should not cut off the \ntransit, the safety, or the contracting obligation that the States \nwould normally do.\n  As I said, we presented this at the EPW hearing this morning. We had \na very good discussion with representatives of the National Governors' \nAssociation and the Department of Transportation.\n  Mr. President, the National Governors' Association has sent a letter \nsigned by 39 Governors. Getting 39 Governors--having been one--I can \ntell you, to sign on a letter is not easy. But the Governors very \nsimply said:\n\n       . . .it is imperative for the Senate to consider and pass \n     short-term legislation providing funding for highway, \n     transit, and safety programs and to complete a conference on \n     that legislation with the House of Representatives. Such \n     legislation would minimize the interruption in funding to \n     State and local governments.

Such \n     legislation would minimize the interruption in funding to \n     state and local governments.

Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say that we have had \ngood ideas from both sides of the aisle in the EPW Committee. We look \nforward to working with Chairman Warner, Senator Baucus, Chairman \nChafee, the other members of the committee.\n  I hope this is something that we could agree on and move forward on \nquickly so that our States and the traveling public will not suffer \nwhile we go through the very important discussions on coming up with a \nnew highway funding formula.\n  I invite comments. I look forward to working with my colleagues. This \none I hope we can do on a bipartisan basis without the regional \ndifferences that will inevitably arise when we begin discussion of the \nfunding formula.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11629-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise to express my support for H.R. \n2464, legislation to exempt internationally adopted children under age \n10 from the immunization requirement that was contained in last year's \nimmigration bill.\n  Mr. President, in my view it is important that the Federal Government \nnot unnecessarily burden American parents who adopt foreign born \nchildren. The process of adopting a child abroad is already quite \narduous and involves great emotional risk. The Federal Government \nshould not make that process yet more difficult. It is particularly \nimportant that we not endanger the health of these children.\n  Last year's immigration bill unnecessarily and unintentionally made \nthe process of adopting foreign born children more difficult.\n  I am, however, concerned that this bill did not go far enough. There \nare adopted children 10 years of age and older who do not need to be \ntreated differently than those under 10 years old. Moreover, the \nproblems with infected needles in many countries should give us serious \npause as to whether immigrant children who are not adopted are \nundergoing undue risk.\n  I also want to call attention to a provision that I would have \npreferred not be in this bill--the provision requiring that parents of \nthe exempted adopted children must sign an affidavit promising to \nvaccinate their children within 30 days or when it is medically \nappropriate. I think we do not want to imply in this or other \nlegislation that the Federal Government cares more about children than \nparents do and, unfortunately, I think that is what this provision \nsays.\n  Despite these reservations, I think that this is a good bill and it \nis an important bill for the many Americans who will be adopting \nchildren internationally both this year and in the years to come. I \nwant to commend the sponsors of the bill and commend the leadership on \nthis issue of the two Senators from Arizona, Senator Kyl and Senator \nMcCain, who have helped see to it that this important correction in law \nwill become a reality and thus help ensure the safe adoption of \nforeign-born children by American citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11630-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11630-S11631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I would like to clarify the intent of the Commerce \nCommittee's   ISTEA   transportation safety amendment as it relates to \nState one-call--call-before-you-dig--programs. It is my understanding \nthat the one-call provisions of this amendment are the same as the \nprovisions of S. 1115, the Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of \n1997.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator is correct. The minority leader and I \nintroduced as S. 1115 on July 31. Thirteen of our colleagues have \njoined us as cosponsors to the bill, and the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation held a hearing on the bill on September\n\n[[Page S11631]]\n\n17. I will be happy to respond to the Senator's questions.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I have received a number of calls and letters from \nNorth Carolina contractors concerned about this bill and its inclusion \nin ISTEA. As the leader knows, these companies are overwhelmingly small \nbusinesses, and they provide a large number of jobs for people in our \nStates. However, when they think of the Federal Government and its \nregulators, they think of the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration. Their experience with OSHA has not been good. The \ncontractors are definitely not interested in seeing a toehold \nestablished for further regulation of this type under the guise of one-\ncall notification. Can the leader tell me that the provisions we are \ntalking about here will not be converted into a Federal regulatory \nprogram effecting small business?\n  Mr. LOTT. I can assure the Senator, most emphatically, that this will \nnot happen. This is not a regulatory bill. The Lott-Daschle bill \npresumes that each State provides the legislative foundation for the \none-call notification program in that State. Remember, all one-call \nprograms are currently State programs, and this will remain unchanged. \nThe sole aim of the bill is to encourage States to act voluntarily to \nimprove their own State one-call programs by providing fiscal \nassistance for those States who want to do more.\n  Furthermore, this legislation does not regulate through the back door \nby imposing a Federal mandate on the States to modify their existing \none-call programs. Rather, it makes funding available to improve these \nprograms. To be eligible for the funding, the programs must meet \ncertain minimum standards, but even those standards are performance-\nbased, not prescriptive. And States will be involved in the rulemaking \nwhich establishes these standards. No State has to apply for these \nfunds if it doesn't wish to.\n  The bill does not preempt State law. Let me repeat that; no State law \nwill be preempted. States continue to their responsibility for the \nregulations for notification prior to excavation and for location and \nfor marking of underground facilities. Nothing in this bill changes \nthis. States prescribe the details of one-call notification programs. \nThis not something the Federal Government should do or is able to do \neffectively.\n  This bill is not intended to lead to a Federal regulatory program on \nthe backs of small business. It is not intended to do this, and it will \nnot do this.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank leader for that assurance.\n  Among the minimum standards required for a one-call notification \nprogram to be eligible for Federal assistance is the requirement for \n``appropriate participation'' by all excavators and underground \nfacility operators. ``Appropriate participation'' would be determined \nbased on the ``risks to public safety, the environment, excavators and \nvital public services.''\n  Contractors who visited my office see this as a loophole that could \nactually weaken State programs. The contractors are very concerned that \nthe Federal Government would declare some situations to be low risk, \nand this would in turn encourage facility operators to seek exemptions \nfrom one-call requirements because their participation would be deemed \nno longer ``appropriate''.\n  Mr. LOTT. First, let me say to my colleague that I am very much in \nfavor of encouraging Federal and State agencies put regulatory effort \nwhere the real risks are. We don't have so much money and so much \ndesire to regulate that we can afford to spend our time and money \nregulating nonexistent risks. There is far too much regulating of \nfictitious risks going on in our economy today. So I think the emphasis \non looking at actual risk is desirable. And the other side of it is \nthat situations that pose a real risk should be covered, absolutely \nshould be covered. We think the Lott-Daschle bill will encourage the \nStates to look at risks that are not now covered and increase \nparticipation in one-call notification programs accordingly.\n  In answer to the contractors' contention, I would reply to them that \nthe intent of this bill is to strengthen State one-call programs and \nnot to weaken them. This is what the Congress is saying to the States \nwith the Lott-Daschle bill: ``Strengthen your programs. Strengthen your \nprograms, and you will be rewarded.''\n  And the Department of Transportation, which will administer this \nprogram, is saying the same thing. I recently received a letter from \nSecretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater supporting the Lott-\nDaschle one-call notification bill. I put that letter in the Record of \nOctober 22. In his letter, Secretary Slater says, ``safety is the \nDepartment of Transportation's highest priority.''\n  Secretary Slater is not interested in weakening State one-call \nnotification programs. A State that submits a grant application to the \nDepartment of Transportation with a weakened State one-call program is \nnot going to see that application approved. The Department of \nTransportation will make sure of that.\n  Finally, the Lott-Daschle bill does not provide for a one-size-fits-\nall Federal determination of what constitutes a risk. Under the bill \nthe intent is that the determination of risk will be made at the State \nlevel, where local conditions and practices can be taken into account.\n  This is another reason that I'm sure we don't need to be concerned \nabout weakening State laws. States with strong laws are not going to \nundertake to weaken them in order to apply for a grant from the DOT \nunder this bill. They know that DOT is trying to strengthen these laws. \nIt just wouldn't make any sense.\n  A State which successfully confronted special interests and enacted a \nstrong one-call program would be both unlikely and foolish to try to \nuse this bill to weaken these programs. If a State were that misguided, \nthe DOT is certain to reject their application.\n  This bill will mean stronger State one-call notification laws, more \nparticipation and better enforcement. That's why 15 Senators want to \nadvance this legislation.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. The contractors who visited my office felt that the \nbill is a dagger pointing at them, and that it unfairly singles out \nexcavators as the cause of accidents at underground facilities. Can the \nbill be made more evenhanded?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the bill does attempt to be evenhanded. For \nexample, finding (2) of the bill points to excavation without prior \nnotice as a cause of accidents, but in the same phrase it includes \nfailure to mark the location of underground facilities in an accurate \nor timely way as a cause as well. In truth, these are both causes of \naccidents, and the bill proposes to deal with both.\n  Both excavators and underground facilities can stand to improve \nperformance in the area of compliance with one-call requirements. There \nis no intent in this bill to blame one side or the other. If the \nSenator believes that the bill unfairly stigmatizes contractors, I \nwould want to right the balance, because that is not what is intended.\n  What we are trying to do is to set up a process where the States can \naddress problems we all know are there. There are too many accidents at \nunderground facilities. Let's see what we can do to improve that \nsituation. Let's see what we can do cooperatively, underground facility \noperators and contractors, Federal agencies and State agencies. Let's \nuse incentives rather than preemption and regulation. That is what this \nbill is trying to do.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the leader for these clarifications.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11630-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11631-S11632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BEING ON TIME\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in the spirit of legislation I am \nsponsoring with Senator Wyden, I want to make something clear. I want \nto make it a matter of public record that I am putting a hold on the \nnominations for ambassador of individuals being considered for posts in \nBolivia, Haiti, Jamaica, and Belize. I am also asking to be consulted \non any unanimous-consent agreements involving the Foreign Service \npromotion list if it should come up for consideration.\n  I am taking this step to make it clear to the State Department and \nthe administration that the Congress takes the law seriously. Something \nthe administration appears not to do. Under the law, the administration \nis required to submit to the Congress on November 1 of each year the \nnames of countries that the administration will certify for\n\n[[Page S11632]]\n\ncooperation on drugs. Last year, the administration was late in \nsubmitting that list. The administration had asked for more time and we \ngave it to them. Although I believe 6 weeks was pushing it.\n  The Congress made it clear then, however, that being late was not a \nprecedent. We gave the administration an extra month in law. And they \nmissed that deadline. They asked for more time last year and we gave it \nto them. We made it clear, though, that giving more time last year was \nnot to become an excuse for being tardy in the future.\n  This point seems to have gotten lost. This year, again, the \nadministration has not submitted the list as required by the law on the \ndate specified. And there is no indication just when or if it may \narrive. This is simply not acceptable. This leisurely approach and \nirresponsible attitude needs an appropriate response.\n  It appears we need to get the administration's attention so that they \nwill abide by the law. This needs to be done especially on a law \ninvolving drug control issues at a time of rising teenage use. In the \nspirit, then, of reminding the administration that we in Congress \nactually do mean the things we say in law, I am putting a hold on these \nnominations.\n  The countries in question have been on past lists, and therefore \nthere is a link to my hold now. That hold will remain in place until \nsuch time as we receive the list in question. If we do not receive a \ntimely response, I may consider adding to my list of holds.\n  Let me note, also, that by ``timely response'' I do not mean a \nrequest for more time. I mean having the list in hand. The November 1 \ndeadline is not a closely held secret. The fact that the list is due is \nnot an annual surprise. Or it shouldn't be. I hope that the \nadministration will find it possible to comply with the law, late \nthough this response now is. And that they will do the responsible \nthing in the future. I thank you.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A maximum of 1 hour.\n  Mr. DORGAN. With the exception being that time can be provided, up to \n3 hours, to managers of the bill, is that correct, if another Senator \nwould yield his or her hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Each manager and each \nleader may receive up to 2 hours from other Senators, and then of \ncourse with their own hour the total would be 3.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would I be correct to say that in a postcloture \nproceeding of this type, that the manager on each side can be a manager \non the same side of the issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That could occur.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So I then ask the managers, if I might yield to them for \na response, because we will be involved here in a period of discussion \nprior to the vote on the motion to proceed, and that discussion is a \nperiod provided for\n\n[[Page S11633]]\n\nup to 30 hours, I would like to ask my colleagues how we might decide \nthat all sides will have an opportunity for full discussion of this?\n  I guess what I would ask the ranking manager, and the chairman of the \nFinance Committee as well, is how they would envision us proceeding in \nthis postcloture period? I will be happy to yield to the chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No. I do not. As I understand it, the Presiding Officer \nwas intending to move to put the question on the motion to proceed. \nBecause the Presiding Officer was intending to do that, I sought \nrecognition and the Presiding Officer recognized me. My understanding \nis we are now in a postcloture period providing up to 30 hours of \ndiscussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The 30 hours of \nconsideration.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Consideration. Then I seek to be recognized, inasmuch as \nno one else was intending to be recognized and inasmuch as I certainly \nwant time to be used to discuss this issue. I was simply inquiring of \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee the process they might engage in, in terms of using \nthis time that we are now in, in postcloture. I was intending to \nyield--not yield the floor, but I was intending to ask a question so we \nmight have a discussion about how we use this time.\n  If I am unable to do that, I will just begin to use some time, I \nguess, if that would be appropriate.\n  I invite again--I didn't seek the floor for the purpose of intending \nto speak ahead of those who perhaps should begin this discussion. But \nneither did I want the Presiding Officer to go to the question, which \nthe Presiding Officer was intending to do.\n  Is the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator presumes to know what the \nPresiding Officer was intending to go do. He may or may not be correct \nin that assertion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Presiding Officer announced his intention, which was \nthe reason I sought the floor. If it is not inappropriate, then, I \nwould simply begin a discussion. But I don't want to do that if the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, who I think should certainly have \nthe opportunity to begin the discussion, or the ranking member, wish to \ndo that. I was simply inquiring about the opportunity on how we might \ndivide some of the time as we proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, having invited that response, if there is \nno response I will be happy to begin a discussion in the postcloture \nperiod. But again I certainly want to----\n  Mr. ROTH. Parliamentary inquiry, doesn't he have to yield the floor \nto get a response?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would advise, in response to the \nquestion of the Senator from Delaware, that the Senator who has the \nfloor has no right to pose the question to another Senator unless he \nyields the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make the point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it is unthinkable that the Senate would not \nrevive the fast-track trade negotiation authority enjoyed by previous \nPresidents.\n  Since its inception, the United States has been a trading state, and \nfrom the Jay treaty that ended the Revolutionary War to the Uruguay \nround agreements that established the World Trade Organization, we \nhave, in the main, pursued a policy of free and open commerce with all \nnations.\n  That legacy has helped bring us unrivaled prosperity. We are in the \nseventh year of sustained economic expansion, and during that same \nperiod, the United States has registered the greatest rise in \nindustrial production of any developed nation, an increase over the \nlast decade of 30 percent.\n  It is no coincidence that our economic growth has taken place at a \ntime when we have struck a series of international agreements that have \nsharply lowered barriers to American trade abroad. The opponents of \ntrade and economic growth do not want you to hear that the United \nStates has been a significant winner in those agreements.\n  In the Uruguay round, we cut our tariffs an average of 2 percentage \npoints, while trading partners cut theirs between 3 and 8 percent.\n  In NAFTA, while we eliminated the average 2-percent tariff on Mexican \nimports, Mexico eliminated its 10-percent average tariffs, as well as a \nhost of nontariff barriers that inhibited United States market access.\n  That job is not done. In most developing countries which represent \nthe markets of the future for U.S. goods and services, tariffs on many \nproducts range up to 30 percent and higher. Developed countries \ncontinue to maintain high barriers in sectors where the United States \nhas a tremendous comparative advantage. In Europe, for example, tariffs \non our dairy products exceed 100 percent. In Japan, the tariffs on \nUnited States dairy products exceed 300 percent, and tariffs on our \nwheat exports, most of it grown in Midwestern States such as North \nDakota, remain above 150 percent. In other words, we have vastly more \nto gain from trade than we do to lose.\n  Let's agree on this much: We cannot legislate reduction in foreign \ntariffs or market access. That has to be done at the negotiating table. \nFor that, the President needs negotiating authority. Simply put, a vote \nfor fast track recognizes the fact that today, more than ever, our \neconomic well-being is tied to trade.\n  Exports now generate one-third of all economic growth in the United \nStates. Export jobs pay 10 to 15 percent more than the average wage. In \nthe last 4 years alone, exports have created 1.7 million well-paying \njobs and, by some estimates, as many as 11 million jobs, and this \ncountry now depends directly on exports.\n  As a result, when asked why the Senate would extend fast-track \nauthority to the President, I offered a very practical answer. In 1989, \nGeneral Motors exported three automobiles to Mexico. This past year, \nthe third full year after we reached a trade agreement with Mexico that \nmany have criticized, General Motors exported over 60,000 vehicles. \nThat amounts to $1.2 billion in sales and paychecks for workers in \nGeneral Motors' facilities and those of their U.S. suppliers.\n  I also explained that trade benefits all of us in many other ways. By \nproducing more of what we are best at and trading for those goods in \nwhich we do not have a comparative advantage, we ensure that every \nworking American has access to a wider array of higher quality goods at \nlower prices. In that respect, using the fast-track authority to \nliberalize trade acts just like a tax cut; we leave more of each \nconsumer's paycheck in their pocket at the end of each month by \nensuring that they get the highest quality goods at the lowest price.\n  I think it is also worth underscoring that trade does not mean fewer \njobs. By increasing the size of the economic pie, trade means more jobs \nand better pay, as the figures I noted attest. Higher wages depend on \nrising productivity, a growing economy and rising demand for labor. \nEach of those factors depend on expanding our access to foreign \nmarkets, and to expand our access to foreign markets, the President \nneeds fast-track authority.\n  I do not, therefore, view the question before this body as simply \nwhether another, in a long line of bills, will pass. The question \nbefore this body is whether the United States will maintain its \nleadership role as the world's foremost economic power and assure our \nfuture economic prosperity.\n  Some might ask why the United States should continue to bear that \nresponsibility. The answer lies in our own history. It relates those \ntimes when we have forsaken our traditional policy of open commerce in \nfavor of protectionism, as some would have us do now.\n\n[[Page S11634]]\n\n  The Smoot-Hawley tariff and the retaliation it engendered among our \ntrading partners gravely deepened the Great Depression. Economic \ndeprivation left citizens in many countries easy prey for the political \nmovements that led directly to the Second World War. And it is worth \nremembering that the foundations of the current international trading \nsystem were built on the ashes of that great conflict. America led the \nway in establishing the current economic order as a means of ensuring \nthat the trade policies of the past would not--and I emphasize would \nnot--lead to similar devastating conflicts in the future.\n  It was, in fact, the effects of the Smoot-Hawley tariff and the \nDepression that led to the original grant of tariff negotiating \nauthority and the namesake of this bill: Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act \nof 1934.\n  On the strength of that grant of negotiating authority, President \nRoosevelt and his Secretary of State Cordell Hull, a distinguished \nformer Member of this body and a member of the Finance Committee, \ncreated the trade agreements programs that reversed the protectionist \ncourse of trade relations and laid the groundwork for the post-war \neconomic order. Five decades and eight multilateral rounds of trade \nnegotiations have helped us to build this burgeoning economy.\n  The lessons of the postwar years are easy to forget. It is easy to \nforget that Congress' grant of trade negotiating authority to the \nPresident was one of the key components of our economic success, and \nled to reduction in tariffs among developed countries from an average \nof over 40 percent to just 6 percent at the end of the Uruguay Round.\n\n  It is easy to forget that on the strength of those grants of \nnegotiating authority, Democratic and Republican Presidents alike \nhelped forge economic relationships with our allies that have seen us \nthrough the succeeding decades to the dawn of a new era.\n  American firms and American workers now compete in a global \nmarketplace for goods and services, and the economic future of each and \nevery American now depends on our ability to meet that challenge. The \nchanges we see in the marketplace and in our daily lives represent the \nbenefits and costs of technological change. We should not make trade a \nscapegoat, as some do, for that process.\n  Progress brings dislocation and requires adjustment. Indeed, with \nevery expansion of our economy there are dislocations. This is an \ninevitable part of the economic process. Every expansion exposes \ninefficiency.\n  At its most basic and personal level, economic progress occurs when \nan individual worker shifts from an inefficient way of doing things to \na more efficient one, from stage coach driver, the original teamster, \nto railroad engineer, to truck driver, to pilot for an overnight air \ndelivery system.\n  Such transitions, of course, are not always easy. I firmly believe \nthat the many who benefit from expanding trade and economic growth must \nhelp those who do not. But that adjustment is the inevitable effect of \ntechnological progress and economic growth, not the grant of fast-track \nauthority.\n  There are some who argue that the cost of these transitions is too \nhigh, that we are doing just fine economically without further trade \nagreements, and that there is no need for fast-track negotiating \nauthority. My reply is simple and straightforward. We need fast-track \nauthority now more than ever. Without the ability to take a seat at the \nnegotiating table, we will be giving up the ability to shape our own \neconomic destiny. If we leave it to others to write the rules for the \nnew era of international competition, we will be leaving our economic \nfuture in their hands, and we will lose the ability to shape the rules \nof the new global economy to our liking.\n  The evidence of that is already mounting. Our trading partners are \nproceeding without us and giving their firms a competitive advantage \nover American businesses in the process. Canada and Mexico have, for \nexample, negotiated free-trade arrangements with Chile while we have \ndebated the merits of fast track. And because Chilean tariffs average \n11 percent, our firms now compete at an 11-percent disadvantage against \nCanadian and Mexican goods in the Chilean market.\n  The same holds true more broadly in the rest of the rapidly growing \nmarkets of Latin America and Asia. A recent article in the Wall Street \nJournal described the efforts of European trade negotiation to steal a \nmarch on the United States and Latin America while the debate on fast-\ntrack authority continues here.\n  There is even more at stake in upcoming negotiations in the World \nTrade Organization. We are scheduled to complete talks on opening \nforeign markets to our financial services, a sector in which the United \nStates has a strong comparative advantage.\n  Without fast-track authority, the President is unlikely to be able to \nconclude these terms or these talks on terms most favorable to the \nUnited States. In a little over a year, the World Trade Organization \nwill once again take up the difficult and contentious issue of barriers \nto trade and agriculture.\n  I know of no one in the agricultural sector who was entirely \nsatisfied with the outcome of the Uruguay round talks. It is difficult, \nas a consequence, to conceive of a more harmful message to send our own \nagricultural community than derailing fast-track negotiating authority \nthat will allow the United States to participate fully in those talks.\n  Thus, we in this body face a simple choice--we can reject our \nheritage as the world's greatest trading state, or we can vindicate the \nfaith of our forefathers and America's ability to compete anywhere in \nthe world where the terms of competition are free and fair. We can \nfocus only on the possible economic dislocations that occur when trade \nbarriers are lowered, or we can look at the common good that results \nfrom economic growth. We can leave our economic fate in the hands of \nothers, or we can step forward to shape our own economic destiny.\n  For me, the choice is clear. We must move forward to maintain our \neconomic leadership in the eyes of the world, as well as provide the \nfruits of an expanding economy to our citizens. Enacting the pending \nlegislation is indeed essential to that effort. Our trading partners \nwill not negotiate trade agreements with us unless we as a nation can \nspeak with one voice.\n  That is what this bill does. It allows two branches of the \nGovernment, the President and the Congress, to speak with one voice on \ntrade. This bill creates a partnership between two branches that allows \nus to speak with one voice and does so to a degree greater than \nprevious fast-track bills.\n  As it has since the original grant of fast-track authority, Congress \nestablishes the negotiating objectives that will guide the President's \nuse of this authority. The negotiating objectives also serve as limits \non the Executive, since the bill ensures that only agreements achieving \nthe objectives set out in the bill will receive fast-track treatment.\n  In that regard, I want to emphasize the effort we have made to ensure \nthat the negotiating objectives restore the proper focus of the fast-\ntrack authority. This authority is granted for one reason alone, to \nallow the President to negotiate the reduction or elimination of \nbarriers to U.S. trade.\n  Authority granted in this bill is not designed to allow the President \nto rewrite the fundamental objectives of our domestic laws. Rather, the \nfast-track process applies solely to those limited instances in which \nlegislation is needed to ensure that U.S. law conforms to our \ninternational obligations.\n  There is one trade negotiating objective that has drawn particular \nattention. It relates to foreign government regulations. It includes \nlabor and environmental rules that may impede U.S. exports and \ninvestments in order to provide a commercial advantage to locally \nproduced goods and services.\n  Indeed, in this provision is the concern that foreign governments \nmight lower their labor, health and safety or environmental standards \nfor the purpose of attracting investment or inhibiting U.S. exports. I \nwant to emphasize that this negotiating objective is limited to \naffecting conduct by foreign governments in these areas. It does not \nauthorize the President to negotiate any change in U.S. labor, health, \nsafety or environmental laws at either the Federal or State level, nor \ndoes it authorize a negotiation of any rules that would otherwise limit \nthe autonomy of our Federal or State governments to set their own \nhealth, safety, labor or\n\n[[Page S11635]]\n\nenvironmental standards as they see fit.\n  I view these provisions of the bill as protecting everyone's \ninterests in these areas. I know of no one who is an advocate of labor \nor environmental interests that would want the President to be able to \nnegotiate international trade agreements that effectively weaken U.S. \nstandards and then submit the implementing legislation on a fast-track \nbasis. Under this bill, no President can negotiate an agreement that \nraises or lowers U.S. labor or environmental standards and then submit \nan implementing bill for consideration on a fast-track basis.\n  Beyond setting the specific negotiating objectives, we have also \nstrengthened Congress' role in the trade agreement process in several \nways.\n  First, we have ensured the right of the two committees of the \nCongress that have general trade jurisdiction to veto at the outset any \nnegotiation that might ultimately rely on fast-track authority if those \ncommittees disagreed with the President's objective. This check on the \nExecutive applies to all negotiations, not merely bilateral free trade \nnegotiations as under prior law. The only exceptions are for \nnegotiations already underway, such as financial services negotiations \nin the World Trade Organization, those anticipated with Chile.\n  Second, the bill strengthens Congress' role and the partnership with \nthe President by requiring greater consultation by our trade \nnegotiators than has ever occurred in the past.\n  The bill requires the U.S. Trade Representative to consult closely \nand on a timely basis throughout the process and even immediately \nbefore the agreement is initialed. The bill obliges the President to \nexplain the scope and terms of any proposed agreement, how the \nagreement would achieve the policy purposes and objectives set out in \nthis bill, and whether implementing legislation on nontrade items would \nalso be necessary since only trade provisions are entitled to fast-\ntrack treatment.\n  Any nontrade items would be handled under the regular practices and \nprocedures of the Senate, which allow for amendment and unlimited \ndebate. Clearly, many in the Congress have been displeased in the past \nwith cursory and nontimely consultation. The legislation in our report \nmakes clear that this will no longer do.\n  The bill provides an explicit provision allowing Congress to withdraw \nthe fast-track procedures with respect to any agreement for which \nconsultation has not been adequate. So not only does the legislation \nexhort the trade negotiators to consult; it provides sanctions if they \ndo not adequately do so.\n  Third, the bill carefully circumscribes the scope of the implementing \nlegislation that can be considered under fast-track procedures. \nBasically, to qualify, the implementing legislation must be a trade \nbill. It must be limited to approving a trade agreement, which is \ndefined to include only, one, reducing or eliminating duties and \nbarriers and, two, prohibiting or limiting such duties or barriers.\n  Moreover, the implementing legislation may only include provisions \nnecessary to implement such trade agreement and provisions otherwise \nrelated to the implementation, enforcement, and adjustment to the \nefforts of such trade agreement that are directly related to trade.\n  Examples of such provisions would include amendments to our \nantidumping laws and extensions of trade adjustment assistance such as \nthose reauthorized with this bill.\n  Finally, the implementing bill may include pay for provisions needed \nto comply with budget requirements. Since this component of the \nimplementing legislation does not address the agreement and its \nimplementation but is included only to satisfy interim budget \nrequirements, some have suggested that this portion of the implementing \nlegislation be fully amendable.\n  The Finance Committee decided to follow previous fast-track \nlegislation out of concern that allowing amendments to this portion \nwould make passage of the implementing bill more difficult. There was \nconcern about turning every implementing bill into a general tax bill, \nthat pay for provisions might be offered by opponents to cause \nmischief, and that adopting amendments would create the need for \nconference with the House and would invite deadlock over nontrade \nissues.\n  In sum, the terms of the partnership between Congress and the \nPresident are these: If the President adheres to the trade objectives \nexpressed in the bill to which fast-track procedures apply, if he \nprovides us an opportunity to disapprove of a specific negotiation at \nthe outset, if he consults with us closely throughout the negotiation \nright up to the time the agreement is to be initialed, if the agreement \nis a trade agreement as defined in the bill, and if the implementing \nlegislation contains only the trade-related items I noted, Congress \nagrees to allow an up-or-down bill after 30 hours of debate on the \nimplementing legislation.\n  Now, I think for Congress that is a very good deal. I fully \nappreciate the important role and responsibility this body has in \nAmerican Government: The right to offer amendments, to debate the \nmerits of an issue as long as necessary, are rights not to be laid \naside lightly. That is why at every juncture we have sought to refocus \nthe fast-track procedure on reducing trade barriers.\n  We have done our best to make sure that matters of domestic policy \nremain outside the limited scope of the fast-track procedure. Such \nmatters of domestic policy should and will remain subject to the \ntraditional practices and procedures of the U.S. Senate. I would not \nsupport this limited exception to our Senate traditions were it not \nabsolutely essential to our continued economic leadership around the \nworld. This is a critically important accommodation. It is not \nunprecedented. Grants of similar authority for the President, in \neffect, exceptions to our Senate rules, have been provided in the past, \ndating back to the Trade Act of 1974.\n  As recently as 1988 a Democrat-controlled Congress provided a \nRepublican President the legal assurance that America would speak with \none voice on trade. I hope that a similar spirit of bipartisanship \nenvelops us today.\n  Let me say in conclusion that if in 1988 my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle do, for the good of this country, see fit to entrust \na President from another party with this authority, that today it would \nhelp us in extending this authority to President Clinton.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with a measure of ebullience. By \na solid majority of both sides of the aisle, we have just voted to do \nexactly what our revered chairman said ought to be done, and reported \nhow in the past it has been done. The vote was 69 to 31. I think that \naugurs well.\n  I would particularly like to note a fact about this legislation which \nhas been little remarked, the fact that with great felicity and sense \nof historic importance, the chairman has given to the bill the title \nthe Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1997. The Reciprocal Trade \nAgreements Act, hearkening back almost two-thirds of a century to 1934 \nwhen Cordell Hull, a former member of the Finance Committee, as \nSecretary of State helped the Nation out of the ruin that had been \nbrought about by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, a tariff meant to \nraise living standards and do all the things that seem so easy if you \ndon't think them through.\n  If you were to make a list of five events that led to the Second \nWorld War and the horror of that war, that tariff bill of 1930 would be \none of them. If there was a harbinger of the reemergence of the \ncivilized world and the reinstitution of intelligent analysis of public \npolicy, it was the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.\n\n  I might like to take a preliminary effort to note that in 1934 the \nUnited States, in fact, did two things of note regarding legislation \nbefore the Senate today. We passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, \nand the President proposed and Congress agreed to our membership in the \nInternational Labor Organization, two parallel but distinct measures. \nWe began opening our trade and in the same year, same Congress, moved \nto join the International Labor Organization for purposes not different \nthan ones we have expounded in this legislation, which speaks directly \nto that issue. Now, the matter before the Senate is of the highest \nportent and urgency. Just yesterday in the Washington Post our--how do \nI say it? Has Bob\n\n[[Page S11636]]\n\nDole been gone long enough to be called fabled, legendary? Certainly \nvastly embraced by this institution on both sides of the aisle. Senator \nDole, Republican candidate in the last election, wrote in yesterday's \nPost, ``the fate of fast-track legislation this fall may determine \nwhether the President ever will negotiate another free trade \nagreement.'' He urged that we give the President this power, a power \nwhich every President since President Ford has had and which under the \noriginal Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act has been in place for two-\nthirds of a century.\n  Since the fast-track authority lapsed, as it did 3 and one half years \nago, the United States has effectively been reduced to the status of an \nobserver as unprecedented new trading arrangements, bilateral and \nmultilateral, have been put in place. The changes in trade and patterns \nand arrangements that you see very much correspond to the change in \ntechniques of production, in modes of manufacture and in the \ninformation age of which we have heard so much. They reflect the \ntechnological underpinnings which have changed the economies of the \ndeveloped world, are changing the developing world, and in consequence, \nchange the economy.\n  For example, as the chairman remarked, Mexico and Chile negotiated a \nfree trade agreement in 1991 and now are engaged in talks to expand the \nscope of that agreement by the end of this year. On July 2 of this \nyear, Canada's free trade agreement with Chile entered force, giving \nCanadian exports just that advantage, the 11-percent tariff advantage, \nthat the chairman has spoken of. Remember, the pattern of Canadian \nproduction and exports is very like ours. We are in a competing world \nwith them. We wish them every success. But there is no point in \nhindering our own ability to negotiate and trade in the same way.\n  If I may remind the Senator, we have been here before. On March 4, \n1974, President Nixon's Special Trade Representative, William D. \nEberle, testified before the Finance Committee in support of the \nlegislation that established the first fast-track procedures for non-\ntariff matters. He said, ``Without the fast-track authority, our \ntrading partners will continue to negotiate but they will do so \nbilaterally and regionally, to the probable exclusion of the United \nStates.''\n  Do not suppose that cannot happen again. The United States is at a \nposition of unparalleled influence and importance in the world. That \ncan produce an unparalleled resentment with consequences that will move \nthrough the generations to come. Do not be overconfident in a moment \nsuch as this, and certainly do not be fearful. We have nothing to fear \nfrom world trade. We gain from it. We have gained from it. And now I am \nconfident with that resounding bipartisan vote, we will.\n  Of course, in 1994 we created the World Trade Organization. It took \nus a long time. In the aftermath of World War II it had been understood \nwe would have an international trade organization to correspond with \nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. That never came to \npass. It came to grief, in point of fact, in the Finance Committee.\n  The WTO, the World Trade Organization, is beginning negotiations on \nagricultural trade, protection of intellectual property. By \nintellectual property, think Silicon Valley, think Microsoft, think of \nall the innovations we have made in the world, and the innovators have \nthe right to see their work protected. And, again, international trade \nin services, think banking, insurance, all those areas in which we have \nbeen particularly excluded in the developing world and which we can now \nnegotiate.\n  The Uruguay round of negotiations represented the first serious \nattempt to address barriers to American farm products, but a great deal \nneeds to be done. The last area of economic activity which is freed \nfrom protection will always be farm matters. It is one of the great \nevents of our age that the great agricultural States in this Nation \nhave seen what trade can do for them and are supporting these measures. \nAgriculture is always protected, always subsidized, but in 1999, the \nWorld Trade Organization on that matter will begin and we ought to take \nthese negotiations seriously. We ought to be part of them and now we \nwill be.\n  American farm exports in 1996 reached $60 billion in an overall \nglobal market estimated at something more than half a trillion. So we \nhave something like 10 percent of that trade. This export sector alone \nrepresents about 1 million American jobs.\n  A similar situation exists with respect to services trade, which was \naddressed for the first time in the Uruguay round, and the financial \nservices, banking, insurance, securities, are scheduled to wrap up in \nDecember in an important round of talks. Another round will begin on \nJanuary 1 of the year 2000 involving a full range of services, \nincluding such sectors as health care, motion pictures, and \nadvertising, where American companies are among the strongest in the \nworld. I don't think it would be in any way inappropriate to recall the \nremarks of President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China just \na few feet off the floor here a week ago, in which he described the \nformative experience of his college years when he watched the film \n``Gone With the Wind.'' It is America that makes the movies for the \nworld to see. Getting them in is a matter of negotiation. Now we can do \nit.\n\n  I would like to make a point of particular importance to the matter \nbefore us. First of all, this is not a new authority, untested or \nuntried. We have been with it for two-thirds of a century. The Smoot-\nHawley Act, in which Congress, line by line, set more than 20,000 \ntariffs, resulted in an average tariff rate, by the estimate of the \nInternational Trade Commission, of 60 percent. The result was ruinous, \nnot only to us, but to our trading partners. The British abandoned \ntheir free trade policy and went to empire preferences. The Japanese \nwent to the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. In that year, \nAdolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in a free election. Such was \nthe degree of unemployment and seeming despair that the consequences of \nthe First World War would never be over.\n  Next came one of the largest trade events of the postwar period, the \nKennedy round, which came about because of the Trade Expansion Act of \n1962. I make the point, sir, that there were persons at that time, as \nnow, concerned about the impact of expanding trade on American workers \nand American firms. As a condition of a Senate vote on giving the \nPresident the power to negotiate what became the Kennedy round--it was \nnamed for the President who began it--we had to negotiate a separate \nagreement, the Long-Term Cotton Textile Agreement, and three persons \nwere sent to do this negotiation: W. Michael Blumenthal, Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of State; Hickman Price, Jr., an Assistant \nSecretary of Commerce; and myself, then an Assistant Secretary of \nLabor. We negotiated to limit surges of imports that might come about \nfrom drops in tariffs. It was meant to be a 5-year matter, as I recall. \nThat was 35 years ago, and it's still in place. It was succeeded by the \nMulti-Fiber Agreement. We have not been unattending to the needs of our \nworkers in these matters. To the contrary. We began Trade Adjustment \nAssistance in the 1970's. We have more Trade Adjustment Assistance in \nthis legislation. We negotiate these matters with the interests of the \nAmerican worker in mind, and the evidence is the standard of living we \nhave achieved in this country, of which there is no equal.\n  With that point, sir, I would like to call attention to a very \nspecial issue. We are asked by some to include in this legislation a \nrequirement that trade agreements include provisions, in effect, \nstatutory requirements, concerning labor and the environment. At first, \nit seems a good idea. Why not? But let me tell you why not, and if I \ncan just presume on age at this point, which is getting to be a factor \nin my perspective. I have been there and it doesn't happen, it doesn't \nwork.\n  If you go to a developing country and say to them, ``We would like to \nenter into a trade arrangement whereby you will reduce your tariffs and \nbarriers--non-tariff barriers--we will do the same, so we can have more \ntrade,'' and at the same time, in the same setting, say, ``We want you \nto adopt higher environmental standards and higher labor standards,'' \nright or wrong, the negotiating partners will say, ``Oh, you want us to \nlower our tariff barriers and\n\n[[Page S11637]]\n\nraise our costs.'' Well, they won't do it. ``You are asking that we be \nput at a double disadvantage. We put those tariffs in to protect \nourselves against you, and our environmental and labor standards are \nthose of a developing nation. Now you want to put us at a double \ndisadvantage.'' It won't happen. There will be no such agreements.\n  I can speak to this. I was Ambassador to India when our trade was at \na very, very low level. The great anxiety of the Government of India \nwas that we would somehow use trade in a way that would disrupt their \ninternal affairs, which was never our intention, but it was a \nperception, and will be even more so now. That is why I point to the \nserendipity, if you would like, of the provisions in this bill. I made \nthe point that the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act--the original one--\nwas enacted in 1934, and the United States joined the International \nLabor Organization in 1934--a measure of great importance at that time. \nPresident Roosevelt was very firmly in favor of it, and Frances \nPerkins--and I talked to her about it--thought it was one of the \ncentral initiatives. They saw it as parallel to trade--parallel.\n\n  Over the years, the International Labor Organization has developed a \nseries of what are called the ILO Core Human Rights Conventions. There \nare a great many important conventions, but they tend to be on \ntechnical matters. These go right to the rights of working people. And \nthere are not many. They are the Forced Labor Convention of 1930; \nFreedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize \nConvention of 1948; Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining \nConvention of 1949; Equal Remuneration Convention, equal pay for men \nand women, of 1951; Abolition of Forced Labor Convention of 1957.\n  In 1991, I stood on the floor of this Senate, with Claiborne Pell, \nthen chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and we called that \nup, and it passed the U.S. Senate unanimously. It is our law now \nbecause we chose to make it our law. We passed it. It is a treaty and \nwe passed it as such. And then there was the Discrimination (Employment \nand Occupation) Convention of 1958, and the Minimum Age Convention--a \nchild labor convention--of 1973.\n  Now, in this bill before you is an extraordinary initiative. We \nfought for an initiative by the United States to promote respect for \nworkers' rights by seeking to establish in the International Labor \nOrganization a mechanism for the systematic examination of and \nreporting on the extent to which ILO members promote and enforce the \nfreedom of a subsidization, the right to organize and bargain \ncollectively, prohibition on the use of forced labor, prohibition on \nexploitive child labor, and a prohibition on discrimination in \nemployment.\n  We have never before made such a proposal. It has enormous \npossibilities. The ILO is the oldest of our international \norganizations. But it comes from an era when the idea of sending \ninspectors into a country to see whether that country was keeping an \nagreement would have been thought much too radical. That all changed in \nthe aftermath of World War II.\n  Just this moment, we are going through something of a crisis with \nIraq over the right of American members of the inspection team from the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to look into Iraqi production of \nnuclear power and the possibility of nuclear weapons. That begins with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, which is part of the United \nNations system. You send inspectors in to see what they are doing. It \nis now a common practice over a whole range of international concerns.\n  What we propose is that the International Labor Organization bundle, \nif you like, the core labor standards, and then set about an inspection \nsystem, to see to it how China is doing on prison labor, or child \nlabor, or how the United States is doing--we will be looked into, too--\nand how countries around the world have done. Now, this will take \nenergy. I would like to think that, somewhere in the executive branch, \nsomeone is listening to this debate because these measures were \nproposed by the President. But it takes energy in the executive to get \nthis done. Come to think of it, Alexander Hamilton's definition of good \ngovernment was ``energy in the executive.''\n  I would like to think that our Trade Representative, our Department \nof Labor, our Department of Commerce, will be actively involved. I say \nthe Department of Commerce because business is involved. The ILO is a \ntripartite group. Business has a vote, the U.S. Council for \nInternational Business, as does the AFL-CIO. They each have a vote, and \nthe U.S. Government has two votes. This is a business-labor enterprise. \nWe have been involved with it for a very long time. Herbert Hoover, as \nSecretary of Commerce under President Harding, sent delegates to the \nILO conference in Geneva from the Chamber of Commerce and from the AFL-\nCIO. So we are addressing concerns about the environment and labor \nstandards in their proper context and setting. If you want them, you \nhave to do it there.\n  If you only want not to have more open trade, you can try it in \nnegotiations. But Mr. President, it won't work. The trading partners \njust will not agree. And if you want to take the time to find it out, \nvery well, but for the moment, I think you will find that the \noverwhelming judgment of economists is that what we have here is a \nclean measure. That is the way to go. And this is what we now need to \ndo--give the President fast-track authority, which will enable him to \nenter negotiations that will result in agreements, and with those \nagreements in place, we will go into the 21st century proud of what we \nbegan in the 20th.\n  Mr. President, I again thank my chairman for the felicity with which \nhe chose to give the name Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1997 to \nthis legislation.\n  For the purpose of the Record, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndescription of the ILO Core Human Rights Conventions be printed in the \nRecord at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  ILO Human Rights (Core) Conventions\n\n       The ILO's human rights conventions, commonly referred to as \n     ``core'' conventions, are receiving more attention as the \n     debate on trade and labor standards continues after the World \n     Trade Organization's ministerial meeting last December.\n       Informal agreement on which ILO conventions are human \n     rights standards dates at least as far back as 1960. Formal \n     recognition was achieved when the Social Summit in Copenhagen \n     in 1995 identified six ILO conventions as essential to \n     ensuring human rights in the workplace: Nos. 29, 87, 98, 100, \n     105, and 111. In addition, the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights now includes these conventions \n     as the list of ``International Human Rights Instruments.''\n       The Governing Body of the ILO subsequently confirmed the \n     addition of the ILO Convention on Minimum Age, No. 138 \n     (1973), in recognition of the rights of children. An ILO \n     convention banning intolerable forms of child labor is in \n     preparation and is scheduled for a vote on adoption in 1998.\n       Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 form the cornerstone of the \n     ILO's international labor code. They embody the principle of \n     freedom of association, which is affirmed by the ILO \n     Constitution and is applicable to all member states. A \n     complaint for non-observance of this principle may be brought \n     against a member state under a special procedure, whether or \n     not the member state has ratified these two conventions.\n       The following list presents the seven core conventions and \n     their coverage. The chart on the reverse side of this sheet \n     shows which countries have ratified them as of December 31, \n     1996.\n\n\n                 No. 29--Forced Labor Convention (1930)\n\n       Requires the suppression of forced or compulsory labor in \n     all its forms. Certain exceptions are permitted, such as \n     military service, convict labor properly supervised, \n     emergencies such as wars, fires, earthquakes . . .\n\n\nNo. 87--Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize \n                           Convention (1948)\n\n       Establishes the right of all workers and employers to form \n     and join organizations of their own choosing without prior \n     authorization, and lays down a series of guarantees for the \n     free functioning of organizations without interference by the \n     public authorities.\n\n\n No. 98--Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention (1949)\n\n       Provides for protection against anti-union discrimination, \n     for protection of workers' and employers' organizations \n     against acts of interference by each other, and for measures \n     to promote collective bargaining.\n\n\n             No. 100--Equal Remuneration Convention (1951)\n\n       Calls for equal pay and benefits for men and women for work \n     of equal value.\n\n\n          No. 105--Abolition of Forced Labor Convention (1957)\n\n       Prohibits the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor \n     as a means of political coercion or education, punishment for \n     the expression of political or ideological views,\n\n[[Page S11638]]\n\n     workforce mobilization, labor discipline, punishment for \n     participation in strikes, or discrimination.\n\n\n No. 111--Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention (1958)\n\n       Calls for a national policy to eliminate discrimination in \n     access to employment, training and working conditions, on \n     grounds of race, color, sex, religion, political opinion, \n     national extraction or social origin and to promote equality \n     of opportunity and treatment.\n\n\n                 No. 138--Minimum Age Convention (1973)\n\n       Aims at the abolition of child labor, stipulating that the \n     minimum age for admission to employment shall not be less \n     than the age of completion of compulsory schooling.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, without further comment, I yield the \nfloor once again with a sense of ebullience. We are going to do this. \nWe kept the faith. We followed the convictions and the experience of \nPresidents going all the way back to the 1930's.\n  So I close simply by quoting again, Senator Dole in his fine op-ed \npiece in yesterday's Washington Post:\n\n       The decision to give the President fast-track authority is \n     urgent and must be made now. Very simply, passing fast track \n     is the right thing to do. Our Nation's future prosperity, the \n     good jobs that will provide a living for our children and \n     grandchildren, will be created through international trade. \n     Today it is more important than ever that the debate between \n     advocates of free trade and protectionism is over. Global \n     trade is a fact of life rather than a policy position. That \n     is why we cannot cede leadership in developing markets to our \n     competitors through inaction, thereby endangering America's \n     economic future and abandoning our responsibility to lead as \n     the sole remaining superpower.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his courteous attention and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the two \npresentations. They are thoughtful Senators, but Senators with whom I \ndisagree. I would like to spend some time describing my view of where \nwe are. Let me start by saying what this debate is not about.\n  This debate is not about whether we should be involved in global \ntrade. Nor is it about whether expanded global opportunities are going \nto be part of this country's future. That is not what this debate is \nabout. There are some who will always say, the minute you start talking \nabout trade, that there are those of us who believe in free trade and \nthen there are the rest of you who don't understand. They say that \nthere are those of us who believe in the global economy and the \nbenefits and fruits that come from being involved in expanded trade in \na global economy, and then there are the rest of you who are xenophobic \nisolationists who want to build a wall around America. That is the way \nit is frequently described when we discuss trade.\n  But that is not what this discussion is about; not at all. It is \nabout our trade strategy and whether it works. When I think of our \ntrade strategy I think of watching a wedding dance when I was a little \nboy. A man and woman were trying to dance. One was dancing the waltz \nand the other was dancing the two-step. Needless to say, it didn't work \nout.\n  We have a trade strategy that is a unilateral free trade strategy \nthat says we are going to confront others, who have managed trade \nstrategies, with our trade strategy. Somehow this strategy is going to \nwork out. We are going to open our markets but we are not going to \npressure other countries to do the same. We are going to pass free \ntrade agreements and we are going to move on to the next agreement \nwithout enforcing the agreement we had.\n  I would like to just take inventory, if I might. Let's take some \ninventory about what we have experienced in trade. For those who are \ncolor conscious, the red in this chart would not be considered good. \nRed represents deficits. This chart represents this country's \nmerchandise trade deficit. We have had 21 straight years of trade \ndeficits. The last 3 years have been the worst three in the history of \nthis country, and we will set a new record again this year. In 36 out \nof the past 38 years we had current account deficits. We had 21 \nmerchandise trade deficits in a row. This year will mean 4 years of \nhigher record trade deficits.\n  I want to ask a question. When you suffer these sort of merchandise \ntrade deficits every year--and they are getting worse, not better--is \nthis a country moving in the right direction? Is this a trade strategy \nwe want more of? Or should we, perhaps, decide that something is wrong \nand we ought to stop and evaluate what doesn't work and how do we fix \nit?\n  We are choking on red ink in international trade. This trade strategy \ndoesn't work. So the debate is going to be between those of us who want \nchange and those who want to cling to the same old thing. There are \nthose of us who believe this policy isn't working and we want to change \nthat policy. We want to reduce and eliminate these trade deficits and \nexpand this country's trade opportunities. We want to do it in a way \nthat is fair to this country and improves this country's economy. Then \nthere are those who say no, and who are against change. They are for \nthe same old thing. They support the same, tired, shopworn strategy \nthat I say doesn't work. That is what this debate is about.\n\n  The last debate we had about trade was a few years ago. It was on \nNAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. And you had fast track \nfor that. It is a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Before we \nadopted that trade agreement we had an $11 billion trade deficit with \nCanada and we adopted that agreement and the trade deficit has doubled. \nBefore we adopted this trade agreement we had a $2 billion trade \nsurplus with Mexico and that has collapsed to a $16 billion trade \ndeficit.\n  According to an Economic Policy Institute recent study, 167,000 jobs \nwere lost to Canada, 227,000 jobs lost to Mexico, 395,000 jobs lost as \na result of NAFTA. The combined accumulated deficit as a result of \nNAFTA cannot possibly be anything that anyone around here wants to \nstand up on the floor and raise their hand about and say, ``Yes, that's \nwhat I envisioned. I voted for that. That's what I was hoping would \nhappen.''\n  Surely we must have someone who will come to the floor and say I \nvoted for this but boy, this turns out to be a pretty sour deal. We \ndidn't expect the deficits to expand and mushroom. Is there someone who \nwill suggest that somehow this hasn't worked out the way we expected? \nOr is this, in fact, the kind of thing that we embrace? Do we have a \ntrade strategy that no matter how bankrupt, we continue to say, ``Yes, \nwe are the parents. This is ours. This is our conception.'' I am \nwondering when enough is enough?\n  Let's look at the trade treaty tally. We are told that if you don't \nhave fast-track procedures given to this President, he can't do \nanything about trade. They ask who on Earth would negotiate with him? \nWell, there have been countries apparently that will negotiate, because \nthere have been 220 some separate trade agreements negotiated by the \nUSTR since 1993. That is the President's own statement. He has \nnegotiated 220 agreements . Only two of them have used fast track. He \ndidn't need fast track on the rest of them. So why would they have \nnegotiated with him if he didn't have fast track?\n  Fast track has been used five times in this country's history: The \nTokyo round in 1975; United States-Canada, 1988; United States-Israel, \n1989; NAFTA, 1993 and the Uruguay round and WTO--GATT, in 1994.\n  Let me show you what has happened with respect to each of these \nareas. When the Tokyo round took effect, we had a $28 billion annual \nmerchandise trade deficit. Then we had a United States-Canada free \ntrade agreement. By that time the trade deficit was $115 billion. Go to \nNAFTA, $166 billion. Then the Uruguay round it was $173 billion. We now \nare up to a $191 billion merchandise trade deficit and it is getting \nworse, not better. Does anybody here think we are moving in the right \ndirection? If you do, tell us we need more of this. I guess that is \nwhat we are hearing. This is working so well. Let's have more of this \nred ink. Let's accumulate more of these deficits.\n  Let me describe this here. I mentioned the trade agreements, NAFTA, \nand others. We have bilateral trade arrangements with Japan and China \nthat also yield huge deficits for this country. One of our problems in \nthis trade strategy that doesn't work is that we negotiate bad \nagreements, No. 1; and then, No. 2, we don't enforce the agreements we \nnegotiated.\n\n[[Page S11639]]\n\n  The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan said the following:\n\n       Indeed, the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan was \n     astonished to learn that no U.S. Government agency has a \n     readily accessible list of US-Japan agreements or their \n     complete texts. This may indicate it has often been more \n     important for the two Governments to reach agreement and \n     declare victory than to undertake the difficult task of \n     monitoring the agreements to ensure their implementation \n     produces results.\n\n  My point is this. We go out and negotiate trade agreements and don't \neven keep track of them let alone enforce them. We can't even get a \nlist of them. No Federal agency had a list of the trade agreements we \nhad with Japan. Does that tell you they are probably not being \nenforced, aside from the fact they were not negotiated well? I can give \nchapter and verse on negotiations with Japan on which we are able to \nlose almost in a nanosecond.\n  Senator Helms reminded me the other day of something I read \npreviously by Will Rogers. He said many years ago, ``The United States \nhas never lost a war and never won a treaty.'' That is certainly true \nwith respect to trade. Take a look at these records and tell me whether \nyou think this country is moving in the right direction in trade.\n  So, what is this about? One of the columnists for whom I have very \nhigh regard in this town is David Broder. I think he is one of the best \njournalists in Washington, DC, and he writes a column today that could \nhave been written by virtually anybody in this town because they all \nsay the same thing: If Clinton fails to win fast-track negotiating \nauthority, ``it would threaten a central part of his overall economic \npolicy, it would signal a retreat by the United States from its \nleadership role for a more open international marketplace.''\n  I have great respect for him. I think he is one of the best \njournalists in town. Yet my point is that he says what they all say. \nThere becomes a ``speak'' in this town, about these issues. Then \nbecause everybody says it, they think it is true.\n  It is not the case that if this Congress doesn't give fast-track \ntrade authority to this President, that we will not be able to have \nfuture trade agreements and will not be able to expand our \ninternational trade. It is the case that some of us believe we ought to \nstand up for the economic interests of this country.\n  Let me go through a few points because we are going to deal with this \nissue in macroeconomic terms. We are going to be hearing the debate \nabout theory, and all of the trade concepts that people have. Then we \nnegotiate trade agreements and then the jobs leave and people lose \ntheir jobs and it doesn't matter, I guess, to some because these are \njust the details.\n  Jay Garment Corporation had two plants with 245 jobs in Portland, IN \nand Clarksville, TN. They produced blue jeans. They moved the plants to \nMexico where they could get people to work for 40 cents an hour.\n  For the past 75 years in Queens, NY, workers have been making \nsomething called Swingline brand staplers. They had 408 workers. They \nare now moving the plant to Mexico. Nancy Dewent is 47 years old. She \nhas been working at that plant for 19 years and was making $11.58 an \nhour. Manufacturing jobs are often the better jobs, paying better wages \nand better benefits. That assembly job, now, making staplers, will be \nin Mexico at 50 cents a hour. That plant owner expects to save $12 \nmillion a year by moving that plant to Mexico and selling the products \nback into the United States.\n  Borg Warner is closing a transmission plant in Muncie, IN. That means \n800 people will lose their jobs, jobs that were paying an average of \n$17.50 an hour. Production is moving to Mexico.\n  Atlas Crankshaft, owned by Cummins Engine, literally put its plant on \ntrucks and moved the plant from Fostoria, OH, to San Luis Potosi in \nMexico; 200 jobs gone south.\n  In North Baltimore, OH, the Abbott Corporation produces wiring \nharness for Whirlpool appliances, closed its plant; 117 jobs moved to \nMexico.\n  Bob Bramer, who worked 31 years at Sandvik Hard Metals in Warren, MI, \nwatched his plant closed down. The equipment was put on trucks and \nmoved to Mexico. Another 26 American jobs gone south.\n  People say you don't understand. That is the natural order of things. \nIf we can't compete, tough luck for us. If we can't compete we lose our \njobs.\n  The question we ought to ask ourselves in this discussion is not \nwhether this is a global economy. It is. Not whether we are going to \nhave expanded trade, we should. We are a recipient for massive \nquantities of goods produced in China, massive quantities of goods \nproduced in Japan and in Mexico and elsewhere. The question is not \nwhether our economy is going to assimilate and purchase much of those \ngoods. The question is what is fair trade between us and these \ncountries? I hope, in this discussion, we might get to this question. \nIs there anything--is there anything that would concern Members of \nCongress about what is called the free market system and accessing the \nAmerican marketplace with foreign production?\n  For example, is it all right to hire 12-year-old kids and pay them 12 \ncents an hour and work them 12 hours a day and have them produce garage \ndoor openers? Is that all right? Is that fair trade? And then ship \nthose garage door openers to Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Fargo, and Denver \nand then compete with someone in this country who produces the same \ngarage door openers, hires American workers, has to abide by safety \nlaws, by child labor standards, by workplace safety laws, and pay \nminimum wages? Is that fair trade? Is it fair competition?\n  The answer clearly is no. If we allow producers to decide that in the \nworld marketplace you can pole vault over all the discussions we have \nhad for 50 years and you can produce where there is a lot less hassle, \nyou can move your plant and move your jobs to a foreign land, and you \ncan dump the chemicals in the water, you can pollute the air, hire kids \nand pay a dime an hour and you can bloat your profits and ship that \nproduct to Delaware, to North Dakota, to Colorado, and to New York, is \nthat fair trade?\n  It is not fair trade where I come from. That is not fair trade. This \ncountry ought to be concerned about the conditions of trade and about \nthe circumstances of trade that we are involved with. That is why we \nhave these swollen trade deficits year after year after year. I know \nthose who push fast track and push the current system, the same old \nthing, say, ``We are the ones for expanded trade.'' I don't think so at \nall.\n  The reason we have not gotten our products into foreign markets, at \nleast not with the success we should have, is this country doesn't have \nthe nerve and the will to require it, and the other countries know it. \nThey know there are going to be enough in the Senate and enough in the \nHouse to stand up and make these claims that if you don't support the \ncurrent trade strategy and you don't support expanded trade, that you \nare a protectionist. Other countries know that. This country doesn't \nhave the nerve and the will to say to Japan and China, Mexico, and \nothers that if our market is open to you, you had better understand \nthat your market is required to be open to us. Our country simply has \nnot required that of our trading partners. Until it does, we will \ncontinue to run these huge swollen trade deficits.\n  The question that we will get to soon will be a narrower question of \nfast-track trade authority. Very simply, for those who don't know what \nthat means, it means that the President will go off and negotiate a \ntrade treaty through his trade negotiators, bring it back to the \nCongress, and then fast-track authority means no one in Congress may \noffer any amendments.\n  I have been through this with the United States-Canada trade \nagreement. I want to describe for my colleagues why I feel so \npassionate about this.\n  The United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement passed the Congress. I \nwas in the House of Representatives at the time and on the Ways and \nMeans Committee, where it passed by a vote of 34 to 1. I was told just \nbefore the vote, ``We have to have a unanimous vote here in the House \nWays and Means Committee. We need to get everybody voting for this. You \ncan't be the only holdout. How would you feel about 34 to 1? What does \nthat say, 34 to 1?''\n  I said, ``No, that is not a source of trouble to me, that is a source \nof enormous pride, because you are engaging in a trade agreement with \nCanada that\n\n[[Page S11640]]\n\nfundamentally sells out the interests of the American farmers.''\n  ``We don't do that,'' they said. ``In fact, we'll provide you \npaper,'' and they shoved all this paper at me saying that we guarantee, \nwe promise and they made all the promises in the world, and I still \nvoted against it.\n  Guess what is happening? The United States-Canada trade agreement \nwent into effect and our farmers, especially in North Dakota and the \nnorthern part of this country, have seen a virtual deluge of Canadian \ngrain coming into our country undercutting our markets, taking $220 \nmillion a year out of the pockets of North Dakota farmers--durum wheat, \nbarley. So we complain about it and say this is unfair trade. It is \nclearly and demonstrably unfair trade.\n  It comes in from a state trading enterprise in Canada called the \nCanadian Wheat Board, which would be illegal in our country. It is \nclearly unfair trade. Just as clearly to me, it violates our \nantidumping laws because every bushel that comes in comes in with \nsecret prices. In our country, when you sell grain, prices are fully \ndisclosed. With the Canadian Wheat Board those are secret prices by a \nstate trading enterprise that would be illegal in this country.\n  For 8 years this has gone on, and we can't correct it. Why? Because \nthis trade agreement was so incompetently negotiated that we traded \naway our ability to solve the trade problems resulting from it.\n  I come here to say this. I have great respect for this President. \nThis President has taken some of the few enforcement actions that have \never been taken with respect to some of our trading partners. But, \nuntil this President and until these trade negotiators and others \ninvolved in our current trade strategy in our country demonstrate the \nnerve, the will and the interest to stand up for the interests of \nAmerican producers and, yes, farmers and manufacturers and workers; \nuntil they demonstrate a willingness and ability to stand up for the \ninterests of this country, I do not intend to vote for fast-track trade \nauthority.\n  Once we decide as a country we are willing to stand up for our \neconomic interests and say to China, ``You cannot continue to run up a \n$50 billion trade surplus with us; we cannot continue to stand a $50 \nbillion trade deficit with you,'' or say to Japan, ``We will not allow \nyou year after year after year every year to have a $50 to $60 billion \ntrade surplus with this country''--we have a deficit with them; they \nhave a surplus with us.\n  What does that mean. The past 21 years of merchandise trade deficits \ncontribute a combined nearly $2 trillion to our current accounts \ndeficit? It means somebody has to pay the bill some day. When we pay \nthe bill, we will pay it with a lower standard of living in this \ncountry, all because we had a trade strategy that did not stand up for \nthe economic interests of this country's producers.\n  I know there are people here who say, ``Gosh, look how well things \nare going in this country; things are going so well.'' In fact, we have \na proclivity in this country to measure how well we are doing every \nmonth by what we consume. If we have good consumption numbers, boy, we \nare doing well.\n  It is not what we consume that measures the economic health of a \nnation, it is what we produce. No country will long remain a strong \neconomically healthy country, a country with a strong economy, unless \nit retains a strong, vibrant and growing manufacturing base. That is \nnot the case in this country, because we have decided with trade \nagreements that it is fine for American producers to get in a small \nplane, circle the globe, find out where they can relocate their plant \nand pay pennies an hour and not be bothered by child labor laws or by \nenvironmental restrictions or by minimum wages or all the other things \nwe fought about for 50 to 75 years in this country, move the production \nthere, produce the same product and ship it back here. The net result \nis a trade loss for this country, a loss of good-paying, important \nmanufacturing jobs for this country, and a continued erosion of this \ncountry's manufacturing base. That, I think, is moving in the wrong \ndirection.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take the full hour allotted to me at \nthis point. I intend to, at another point in this process, speak more \nabout the issue, but I want to finish by saying, once again, that we \nwill have, I assume, a discussion that represents the same old \ndiscussion, and that is an attempt to portray those who don't support \nthis fast-track proposal as those who don't support expanded \ninternational trade.\n  Let me portray it the way I think it really is. We have some people \nclinging to a failed trade strategy that has produced the largest trade \ndeficits in the history of this country, clinging to it with their life \nbecause they resist change at every turn. There are those of us who \nunderstand that this trade strategy does not strengthen this country. \nIt weakens this country. Increasing deficits don't strengthen this \ncountry. They undermine this country. Those of us who believe that it \nis time to change our trade policies.\n\n  Do we want to change by keeping imports out? No. Do we want to change \nby retreating from the international economy? No. We want to change by \ninsisting and demanding that it should be fashionable for a while to \nstand up for the economic interests of this country and that those who \ndo so should not be called protectionists. Those of us who stand up, do \nso in a way that is designed to strengthen and to expand our country's \neconomic opportunity in the years ahead.\n  So, Mr. President, we will have many hours this week to talk about \ntrade. I come from a State that needs to find a foreign home for much \nof what it produces. I am not someone who wants to retard trade. I want \nto expand trade. But I am someone who believes our Nation's trade \nstrategy has not worked. Instead, we need a new trade strategy to \nexpand exports, to expand opportunity and to diminish and eliminate \nthese bloated trade deficits that threaten, in my judgment, this \ncountry's economic future. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in the trial of a case, when you present \na witness such as a doctor or an engineer, you qualify the witness by \nproviding his background and experience. I am in the same position of \nhaving to qualify myself--not that I am expert on any particular \nthing--because only yesterday in a discussion on the floor, one of my \nesteemed colleagues said, ``I know how you are going to vote with \nrespect to fast track because you are against trade.'' Mr. President, \nnothing could be further from the truth.\n  Let me say at the very beginning that I was raised and still live in \na port city. I worked in that port two summers, paying my way through \ncollege with a coastal geodetic survey before World War II, when we \nwere laying submarine nets in the harbor.\n  I also was a lawyer later on in life, practicing before the U.S. \nCustoms Court with the Honorable Judge Paul Rayall of New York. As an \nattorney, I also represented the South Carolina Port Authority. So I am \nfamiliar with the field of trade law.\n  Later, as Governor of South Carolina, I had the privilege of putting \nin all the expanded facilities for our State ports, such as grain \nelevators for our farmers so that they could compete, but more \nparticularly. During my tenure as Governor, I also was one of the first \nelected representatives to take trips abroad to promote trade and to \nencourage foreign companies to open plants in the United States.\n  I was just thinking the other day, when the President was going for \nthe first time to Latin America, that I took that trip to Buenos Aires, \nArgentina, back in 1960. I have been there a half dozen times since \nthen. And I have been not just to Sao Paulo but to the port of Santos \nin Brazil and to Caracas, where we buy now a majority of our oil.\n  I learned early on in looking for trade opportunities that my \nhometown of Charleston is 350 miles closer to Caracas, Venezuela, and \nthe Latin American markets than New Orleans. Look at it sometimes--the \noffset of the South American continent--and you will see that my \nhometown of Charleston is about on the same latitude as the Panama \nCanal.\n  So I went after trade and have been working on trade for at least 40 \nyears, as an attorney and as Governor. Today,\n\n[[Page S11641]]\n\nmy office in Charleston is in the Customs House.\n  I have participated in the various trade debates in my 30 years in \nthe U.S. Senate. I have heard the same things come up time and time \nagain without any understanding of the fact that we do not have a trade \npolicy. We have a foreign policy.\n  A friend who says you are against trade and he is for foreign aid is \nnot for trade. We were fat, rich, and happy after World War II, and, \nyes, we taxed ourselves to the tune of what would be equal to some $80 \nbillion in today's amounts. We couldn't even get taxes to pay our own \nbills, much less the vanquished enemy in Europe and in the Pacific, but \nwe taxed ourselves and we sent over not just the best expertise to tell \nthem how to develop industrially, but more particularly, Mr. President, \nthe best machinery.\n  I have always heard people talk about textile fellows. According to \ncritics, we want subsidies and protectionism. Now, we have asked for \nenforcement of and protection under U.S. international trade \nagreements, but we never have asked for subsidies like the airline \nmanufacturers receive, for example.\n  And of course, much of our technology comes from Defense. Then we \nmake sure that it is financed under the Export-Import Bank. And \nincidentally, the $3 billion contract with China, you might as well \ncount on only a percentage of that--China is in part trading with \nitself, because it has Boeing China where they make the tail \nassemblies, and they make the electronic parts in Japan, and everything \nelse of that kind, so we can look at really where the contract is being \nsourced.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, we are exporting our most precious \ntechnology. General Motors, for example, has agreed not only to produce \ncars in the People's Republic of China, but also China has required, \nMr. President, that they design the automobiles. So the new cars that \nwe in America will be buying here at the turn of the century will be \ndesigned in downtown Shanghai with the finest computerization and \nmachinery being installed there now by American companies.\n  So we watch this particular trend. And we understand that the \nadministration and those championing fast track are totally off-base \nwith respect to the welfare of the United States of America, with \nrespect to the security of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, the Nation's security rests on a three-legged stool. \nThe three legs comprise our defense, values, and economy. And we have \nthe one leg that is military power, which is unquestioned. Our troops \nand our military technologies are without equal in the world today. \nThis leg is sound.\n  The second leg is that of our Nation's values. This leg, too, is \nsound, our values unquestioned. We commit ourselves to freedom, \ndemocracy, and individual rights the world around--from Haiti and \nBosnia. We work hard in all the councils of the world to promote the \nhealth and welfare of the free world. Our commitment to democracy and \nhuman rights is unwavering and our democratic values still are strong, \nas was noted here just last week on the visitation of Jiang Zemin.\n  But, Mr. President, the third leg of our Nation's security--and this \nmust be emphasized--is the economic leg. Unfortunately, the economic \nleg has been fractured over the last 50 years, somewhat in an \nintentional manner.\n  I mentioned the Marshall plan. I mentioned the expertise we supplied \nto our vanquished foes. I mentioned the attempt to build up freedom and \ncapitalism around the world, continuing today with the fall of the wall \nin Europe and the capitalistic trends even in People's Republic of \nChina. And we have succeeded in this policy, so we do not regret it. \nBut too often over the last 50 years we have given in to our \ncompetitors.\n  When 10 percent of U.S. textile consumption was provided by imports, \nPresident John F. Kennedy declared an emergency, and under the law he \nappointed a cabinet commission. And he had the Secretaries of Treasury, \nAgriculture, Commerce, Labor and State meet. In May, 1961, complying \nwith national security provisions, they determined that before \nPresident Kennedy could move, he was required to find that the \nparticular commodity was important to our national security.\n  At the Department of Defense, this particular commission found that \nnext to steel, textiles were the commodity most important to our \nnational security. After all, our Government could not send our \nsoldiers to war in a Japanese-made uniform. So President Kennedy took \naction and formulated a 7-point program with respect to textiles. But \nthis program has never been enforced.\n  I continue to say that if we were to go back to our dumping laws and \nenforce them, we wouldn't have to have a debate of this kind on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. But they are not enforced, Mr. President, and \nnow two-thirds of the clothing worn here on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate is imported. And 86 percent of the shoes are imported.\n  While I am on this subject, Mr. President, we have gradually gone out \nof the role of a productive United States of America to a become a \nconsuming people.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a ratio of \nimports to domestic consumption of various items.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               1996 Data\n\n\n        Industry/commoRatio imports to domestic consumption in percents\nMetals:\n

Mr. President, my time is limited. It is unfortunate we \nhave forced cloture. We have had no debate. This is an arrogant \nprocedure: on a Friday afternoon, late on Friday when everyone was \ngone, they put in the so-called bill with the cloture motion, and now \nthe world's most deliberative body is not going to have a chance in the \nworld to deliberate. We had no debate on Monday, and now after forcing \na vote on Tuesday they say, ``All right. You've got an hour.'' Oh, \nisn't that fine. Isn't that polite? Isn't that courteous? Isn't it \nSenatorial? Not at all. Not at all.\n  What we really need is an extended debate on the most important item \nthat faces this country--our economic security.\n  Today we practically are out of business in manufacturing. People \ntalk about the manufacturing jobs that have been created, but 10 years \nago we had 26 percent of our work force in manufacturing. We are down \nto 13 percent of jobs now in manufacturing.\n  I go right to one of our adversaries, who is one of the finest \nindustrialists in the history of man, Akio Morita of Sony Corp. And on \na seminar in the early 1980's, in Chicago, we were talking about the \ndeveloping Third World countries. And he said, ``Oh, no. They cannot \nbecome a nation state until they develop a strong manufacturing \ncapacity.'' And later on in that seminar he pointed to me and said, \n``By the way, Senator, that world power that loses its capacity of \nmanufacturing will cease to be a world power.''\n  We are going to have Veterans Day here very shortly. And I think back \nto my the 3-year jaunt overseas in World War II and the invasion of \nNorth Africa, and Corsica, and Southern France. And I remember well how \nvaliant our fighting men were. And I take pride in average citizens \nfrom the main streets and farms of America volunteering to fight and \ndie for our Nation.\n  In those days, when we looked up at the skies we saw our wonderful \nAir Force. And we saw them bombing the adversary into smithereens, to \nthe point where they had no productive industrial manufacturing \ncapacity. We, in contrast, were turning out five B-29's a day at the \nMarietta plant just outside of Atlanta. They were not turning out any \nplanes at all. Their plants had been destroyed. And so we had a \nsuperiority of equipment and everything else as we moved forward \nthrough Alsace and across the Rhine.\n  And as much as congratulating all the veterans on Veterans Day, I \nwill be making talks like other politicians. I want to emulate Rosy the \nRiveter who, back home, kept things going. It was the wonderful \nproductive capacity of the United States of America that kept this \nworld free. Let us never forget it. So when we talk of trade, we are \ntalking of something of historic proportions here.\n  I will go to the history here in the unlimited time because in a few \nhours--in an hour and a half, to be exact--the Commerce Committee, with \nthe Capitol Historical Society, will celebrate the 181st anniversary of \nthe Committee of Commerce, Space, Science, and Transportation.\n  That brings us back to our earliest days and the mistaken idea that \nthere is somewhere, somehow, other than here in the United States, free \ntrade, free trade, free trade, free trade. There is absolutely no free \ntrade in the world. Trade is reciprocal and competitive. The word \n``trade'' itself means something for something. If it is something for \nnothing, it is a gift.\n  I know some people talk about different subsidies and different \nnontariff trade barriers, and that is what they mean. But what has come \nabout, as we have been setting the example by just that, with free \ntrade with Chile, our average tariff was 2 percent. The average tariff \nin Chile is 11 percent. So the people in Chile now almost have free \ntrade. We have almost nothing left to swap in order to bring them to \nterms to open their markets.\n  As long as we cry and moan and grown, ``free trade, free trade,'' \nlike the arrogant nonsense that somehow our way is the only way, we are \ngoing to wake up in America like the United Kingdom. They told Great \nBritain at the end of World War II, ``Don't worry, instead of a nation \nof brawn, you're going to be a nation of brains. And instead of \nproducing products, you're going to provide services. And instead of \ncreating wealth, you're going to handle it and be a financial center.'' \nAnd England has gone to hell in an economic handbasket; downtown London \nis an amusement park. Poor Great Britain: it is not great any longer. \nAnd that is the road that we are on here in the United States.\n  I want to get off that road and sober these folks up and let them \nstop, look, and listen to what they are talking about. I would like, \nMr. President, to emphasize what the global competition is. Some act as \nif it's something new, and we have just come into it. No. We started \n220-some years ago, in the earliest days of our republic.\n  Thinking today about this particular celebration we are going to have \nthis evening, I realized that in 1816, when the Commerce Committee was \nfirst started, it was started as the Committee of Commerce and \nManufacturing. Commerce and Manufacturing was the name of it.\n  That was foremost in the minds of the Founding Fathers when they \nthought about our relations with Great Britain, the mother country, \nonce we had won our freedom and were a fledgling colony. The British \nwanted to trade with us under the doctrine of competitive advantage. \nThey said at that particular time that what you ought to do back in the \ncolony is trade with what you can produce best and we will trade back \nwith the little fledgling colony from the United Kingdom what we \nproduce best--free trade, free trade, Adam Smith, Adam Smith, free \ntrade, consumption.\n  Well, Alexander Hamilton wrote ``Report on Manufactures,'' and there \nis one copy left that I know of over at the Library of Congress under \nlock and\n\n[[Page S11643]]\n\nkey. I won't read it--I would if we had extended time where we can \ndebate this and begin to understand the Founding Members. In a line in \nthat booklet, Alexander Hamilton told Great Britain essentially, bug \noff, we are not going to remain your colony. The second act ever \nenacted by Congress--which had a mindset of competition and building, \nrather than buying votes with consumption and tax cuts and free trade \nand all that kind of nonsense--passed a tariff of 50 percent on some 60 \narticles, which included textiles, iron, and just about everything \nelse.\n  What we said was ``no, thank you.'' We are going to follow Friedrich \nList, who said that the strength of a nation is measured not by what it \ncan consume but rather by what it can produce. And the Founders said \nthat they we going to produce our own industrial backbone, beginning \nwith tariffs and instituting a Committee of Commerce and Manufactures.\n  This mindset continued through President Lincoln. His advisors told \nthe President during the construction of the transcontinental railroad, \n``Mr. President, we ought to get that steel cheap from England.'' And \nhe said ``No, we are going to build the steel mill, and when we get \nthrough we not only will we have the transcontinental railroad but we \nwill have a steel capacity to make the weapons of war and the tools of \nagriculture.''\n  And in the darkest days of the Depression we passed price supports \nfor America's agriculture which this Senate supports. It is not like we \nare against the farmer. I have had the pleasure of being elected six \ntimes, and each time the farm vote has either put me over the top or \nsaved me. I have been elected six times. I have the greatest respect \nand we had not only the price supports but protective quotas, import \nquotas.\n  Eisenhower, in 1955, put in oil import quotas so we could build up \nour own capacity of oil production. So we have been practicing that \nuntil we have been overcome, so to speak, with the multinational \nsingsong.\n  You see the policy of building up capitalism the world around has \nworked. I was with the manufacturers in the early 1950's. They hated to \nfly all the way to the Far East and come back. But after a while they \nfound out they could produce cheaper by producing overseas.\n  We had this testimony and we had the hearing before the Finance \nCommittee which is a procedure of parliamentary fix. We had hearings \nthat proved that 30 percent of the cost of manufacturing is in labor \nand you can save as much as 20 percent of your labor costs by moving \noffshore to a low-wage country. In other words, if you have a volume or \nsales of $500 million, you can keep your headquarters and sales force \nhere but move your production overseas and save tens of millions of \npretax dollars; or you can continue to stay home and work your own work \nforce and go bankrupt.\n  That is the jobs policy of this Congress. That is the jobs policy of \nthis fast track. That is the jobs policy of President Clinton and his \nadministration. That is why I am so strongly opposed to this kind of \nnonsense.\n  They come around here with talking about consulting and retraining \nand everything else of that kind but the truth of the matter is, I will \ntake them down to Andrews or some other towns in my State of South \nCarolina. We have lost, since NAFTA, some 23,500 jobs when counted last \nMay and over 25,000 jobs easily since then.\n  Go to where they make simple T-shirts, in Andrews, SC, where they had \n487 workers. The age average is 47 years. And let's do it Washington's \nway, let's retrain the 487 workers so tomorrow morning they are all \ncomputer operators. Are you going to hire the 47-year-old computer \noperator or the 21-year-old computer operator? You are not going to \ntake on the health care costs, the retirement costs of the 47-year-old. \nAndrews is drying up. They are gone with all this retraining. We don't \nneed retraining. I have the best training facilities. That is how I get \nHoffmann-La Roche, BMW and all the sophisticated plants, Honda and \notherwise, that are coming into my State.\n  So we say with knowledge that we are not against trade; we have \nexperience in this field. In South Carolina, we have the best \nindustries on the one hand, 2.8 percent unemployment in Greenville \nCounty. But go down to Williamsburg County and you have 14 percent \nunemployment.\n  On October 28, one week ago, the Washington Post published an \neditorial by James Glassman. Obviously, Mr. Glassman does not \nunderstanding exactly what is at issue here.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 28, 1997]\n\n                            Consumers First\n\n                         (By James K. Glassman)\n\n       We work in order to eat, not vice versa. In other words, an \n     economy should, first and foremost, benefit consumers, not \n     producers--individuals rather than the established interests \n     of business and labor.\n       This simple truth, which is regularly ignored by \n     politicians and the media, is at the heart of many of our \n     current debates--over free trade, taxes and, most recently, \n     the antitrust action against Microsoft.\n       Adam Smith said it best in 1783: ``Consumption is the sole \n     end and purpose of all production, and the interest of the \n     producers ought to be attended to, only in so far as it may \n     be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.''\n       That's why free trade is so beneficial. If we make it easy \n     for Italy to export inexpensive shoes to us, then U.S. \n     shoemakers may have to find jobs in other fields. But, \n     meanwhile, the 260 million Americans who wear shoes every day \n     get a bargain. The money they save can be used to buy other \n     things and start businesses, such as software, in which \n     Americans have a clear advantage.\n       In its defense of fast-track to boost trade deals, the \n     Clinton administration has completely ignored this approach: \n     that the main reason we trade is to get good, low-priced \n     imports, which, incidentally, help keep down inflation. \n     Politicians have spent so much of their time helping producer \n     interest groups (a term that always includes big labor) that \n     they've forgotten the best argument for free trade--that it's \n     a tremendous boon to consumers.\n       But consumers, who, by their very nature, are unorganized, \n     are consistently given short shrift--even by groups, such as \n     Ralph Nader's, that purport to represent them. Take Attorney \n     General Janet Reno's million-dollar-a-day fine against \n     Microsoft, hailed by Nader and based on her claim that the \n     company is ``forcing PC manufacturers to take one Microsoft \n     product as a condition of buying a monopoly product like \n     Windows 95.''\n       Yes, producers are forced to do something they may not \n     like, but consumers get something free--a browser that helps \n     them move around the Internet. It's difficult to see how the \n     aggressive, even vicious, competitive tactics of companies \n     like Microsoft and Intel have hurt consumers, who now enjoy \n     more and more computer power for less and less money.\n       It's nonsense to believe that a computer industry in a \n     constant state of revolution will thwart individuals unless \n     government steps in. It's consumers who determine whether a \n     product succeeds or fails. For an economy to reward the best \n     producers, consumers have to be given free rein to make \n     choices and send signals about what they really want.\n       Unfortunately, the history of antitrust--not to mention \n     trade policies like high tariffs, quotas and anti-dumping \n     rules--reveals a pattern of enforcement that benefits \n     politically powerful producers, while paying only lip service \n     to consumers.\n       If I seem overly agitated about producer-favoritism, it's \n     because I've seen the deadly results. I just returned from a \n     trip to Germany, a country which, only a few years ago, U.S. \n     politicians held up as an ideal. Today, there's a complacency \n     and hopelessness about the economy. Unemployment is 11.7 \n     percent. ``This has little to do with the business cycle,'' \n     Otto Graf Lambsdorff, the respected former economics \n     minister, told me. ``It is structural unemployment.''\n       Germans are--stereotypically and actually--precise, \n     diligent, well-educated and technically proficient. But \n     between 1990 and 1996, their total industrial output actually \n     declined by 3 percent while that of the United States rose 17 \n     percent. (Output in Japan, another producer-oriented economy \n     that's in the dumps, fell 5 percent.)\n       Why? One reason is the drag imposed by the sheer size of \n     the German welfare state, but at least as important is an \n     economic policy that consistently stymies the interests of \n     consumers.\n       For instance, wage agreements, enshrined in law, are set by \n     the big manufacturers and their unions, then imposed on \n     smaller companies--a process that prevents serious \n     competition that would drive down prices and help Germans \n     live better.\n       German regulations also keep new entrants out of the \n     marketplace. The medieval guild system still rules, and it's \n     hard to start a business without the certification of \n     companies that are already in it. Three people told me the \n     same story: Bill Gates never could have launched Microsoft in \n     Germany because it's illegal to work in a garage--no windows.\n       The most glaring example of producers-first is the law that \n     sets nationwide operating hours for retail businesses. \n     Exactly a\n\n[[Page S11644]]\n\n     year ago, those hours were finally extended--for just 90 \n     minutes. Now, businesses have to close Monday through Friday \n     at 8 p.m. and on Saturdays at 4 p.m. On Sundays, only \n     bakeries can open.\n       Why have such a law at all? While some in the Bundestag \n     argued that longer hours hurt family life and church-going \n     (then why not ban telecasts of soccer games?), the main \n     opposition came from producers themselves (and their \n     attendant unions). Cartels love the status quo. Allow \n     innovation, and new firms might drive us out of business. In \n     other words, the consumer be damned.\n       Economic policy really isn't as complicated as it seems. \n     Since, as Adam Smith pointed out, the consumer comes first, \n     then the first question should always be: Does this help \n     consumers, not in some imagined future but in the here and \n     now? Free trade does. Microsoft's free browser does. A tax \n     system that stresses low rates, simplicity and no breaks for \n     special interests does.\n       The people who run Germany may never learn this important \n     axiom, but most Americans know it instinctively. Now, if only \n     the politicians and the press would catch on.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. ``Since as Adam Smith pointed out, the consumer comes \nfirst.''\n  Come on, that is historically inaccurate. If we would have done that, \nwe would still be a colony. He doesn't know what he is talking about. \nThey didn't land here from the Mayflower looking for consumption and a \ncheap T-shirt. They came here to build a nation. You don't build it \nwithout a strong manufacturing capacity and you can find more silly \narticles running around loose. There is one by David Broder. He was \nquoted by my distinguished colleagues from New York and from North \nDakota on both sides of the issue, but I want to read one paragraph, \nand I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 4, 1997]\n\n                       Fast Track, Heavy Freight\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       For President Clinton, the big trade vote scheduled later \n     this week represents ``Double Jeopardy.''\n       If Clinton fails to win the same ``fast track'' negotiating \n     authority that previous presidents have carried into \n     international bargaining, it would threaten a central part of \n     his overall economic policy and rattle already jumpy world \n     stock markets. It would signal retreat by the United States \n     from its leadership role for a more open international \n     marketplace and--by the sober judgment of the embassies of at \n     least two key allies--could set off serious trade wars.\n       Chances are, it won't come to that. The Senate, which is \n     scheduled to vote first, seems likely to approve the fast-\n     track procedure in which trade agreements are voted up or \n     down by Congress but are not subject to amendment. In the \n     House, which is slated to follow on Friday, Clinton faces an \n     uphill struggle, but one he might still win.\n       The cost of victory may be high, however. By every \n     calculation, more than two-thirds of the affirmative votes \n     will have to come from Republicans. The more Clinton has to \n     turn to Speaker Newt Gingrich and his allies, the higher the \n     price they can extract on other issues. Gingrich, still \n     trying to shore up his own shaky position after last summer's \n     failed coup, simply cannot afford to be altruistic.\n       The reason Clinton may have to pay a high price is that he \n     has signally failed to persuade his own party of the \n     rightness of his trade policy. In 1993, after a vigorous \n     campaign by Clinton, only 40 percent of House Democrats \n     supported NAFTA--the free trade agreement with Mexico and \n     Canada. ``On fast track, he will lose 20 or more people who \n     voted for NAFTA,'' House Democratic Whip David Bonior of \n     Michigan, an ardent opponent, told me over the weekend. A key \n     House Democratic Supporter conceded that Clinton is unlikely \n     to get many more than 30 percent of the 206 Democrats to go \n     along--a figure low enough that it could prove fatal.\n       Clinton aides blame the problem on organized labor, which \n     has led the fight against ``fast track,'' just as it did \n     against NAFTA. ``This is the most blatant example of the \n     corrupting effect of campaign finances on Washington policy-\n     making I know,'' one high administration official said.\n       Even if you accept AFL-CIO lobbyist Peggy Taylor's \n     assurance that ``we have not threatened to cut off \n     contributions to anyone,'' there is no doubt the dependence \n     of most congressional Democrats on unions for their bedrock \n     financing makes them receptive to the arguments Taylor and \n     other labor lobbyists offer.\n       But there's more than money involved. In the 1994 midterm \n     election, a year after the NAFTA vote, union activists, stung \n     by losing that fight to Clinton and by the president's \n     failure to get a Democratic Congress even to vote on his \n     promised health care reform, deserted their posts. Phone \n     banks went unmanned; the turnout of union families plummeted; \n     40 percent of those who bothered to vote backed GOP \n     candidates, and the Democrats lost the House for the first \n     time in 40 years.\n       In 1996, by contrast, labor, under new leadership, targeted \n     Gingrich and the GOP early, boosted its share of the \n     electorate and helped the Democrats to a 10-seat gain. \n     Understandably, its arguments are heeded.\n       Labor is less monolithic than it appears, however. The \n     growing unions--notably those representing public employees \n     and service industries--care much less about the trade issue \n     than do the teamsters or the big industrial unions. Vice \n     President Al Gore, despite his pro-NAFTA and pro-fast-track \n     stance, has at least as many allies among top unionists as \n     his prospective opponent for the 2000 nomination, Minority \n     Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who is leading the fight \n     for labor.\n       What Clinton and the White House have been slow to realize \n     is that Gephardt has convinced many of his colleagues that \n     demanding stronger worker and environmental protections as \n     part of future trade agreements is a way of helping their \n     constituents--not undercutting a successful Clinton economic \n     policy. Until very recently, the president let the opposition \n     dominate the public debate.\n       As a result, Cliton will not get the votes of such \n     thoughtful Democrats as Rep. Ron Kind, a moderate freshman \n     from a marginal district in Wisconsin, who concedes he is \n     adopting the ``parochial concern'' of dairy farmers \n     frustrated by their post-NAFTA dealings with canada. ``Very \n     few of us oppose giving the president the authority to \n     negotiate,'' he said, ``but he should have elevated this to a \n     national debate on what the rules of trade should look like \n     in the 21st century. That is what Ronald Reagan would have \n     done.''\n       As a result of that failure, Clinton will pay Gingrich a \n     high price if he is to avoid a truly devastating defeat.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The article reads in part:\n\n       Clinton aides blame the problem on organized labor which \n     has led the fight against fast track just as it did against \n     NAFTA. ``This is the most blatant example of the corrupting \n     effect of campaign finances on Washington policy-making I \n     know,'' one high administration official said.\n\n  Boy, oh boy, is it. Is it one of the most scandalous, corrupting \neffects of campaign finances. Why? Mr. President, 250 of these \nmultinational corporations are responsible for 80 percent of the \nexports. That is the moneyed crowd that came with the white tent on the \nlawn for NAFTA. That is the moneyed crowd and the Business Advisory \nCouncil that sent around a month ago, ``We are allocating $50,000 for \nthis debate.'' Each of your corporate entities, send the money in so we \ncan buy the TV to bamboozle those silly Senators in Congress.\n  It is one of the most corrupting--not labor. God bless labor. At \nleast they are fighting for what Henry Ford said: ``I want to make sure \nthat the man that produces the car can buy the car.'' And he brought in \ngood, responsible wages. That is what labor is trying to get--a \nresponsible wage and working conditions and no child labor and no \nenvironmental degradations.\n  Since I'm talking, I want everyone to know I'm just not reading \nthings. I have been there and I have seen, as Martin Luther King, Jr. \nsaid, the other side. So at Tijuana, Mr. President, you go there and \nyou think you are in Korea. Go across from San Diego into Tijuana--\nbeautiful industries, mostly Korean, and what happens? Then you go out \nto the living conditions, some 150,000 to 200,000 people in that dust \nbowl. The mayor comes up and he says, ``Senator, I want you to meet \nwith 12 people if you don't mind.'' I said I would be glad to. ``I \nwould like you to listen to what they are talking about.''\n  It so happens that in that area, the mills have the flag, whether \nAmerican or Korean, they have a beautiful lawn, a nice, clean factory \non the outside and the living conditions are squalid--literally, five \ngarage doors put together as a hovel to live in, no running water, the \nelectric power is one little electric line where I was visiting and the \nfellow had a car battery to turn on his TV because if he turned on the \nlight and TV everything blew up.\n  There wasn't any sewage, there weren't any roads or streets. When \nthey had a heavy rain and when the rains came at the turn of the year, \nit washed down all that mud, dust and what have you, and their homes \nwere literally being washed away. Trying to save them, they missed a \nday's work, these 12 workers. Later in February, one of the workers in \na plastic coat hanger factory--a factory that had moved down from Los \nAngeles, CA, to Mexico, a low-wage thing, maquiladora is the word for \nit--had lost his eyesight from the dust flicked up in his eyes by the \ncoat hangers. That caused real concern because they had been docked \nhaving missed 1 day's work. They were docked under the work rules. They \nlost\n\n[[Page S11645]]\n\n4 days' pay. And now they were losing one of their companion workers \nand his eyesight, and around the first of May the most popular \nsupervisor was expecting childbirth and she went to the front office \nand said, ``I'm feeling badly and I have to go home this afternoon,'' \nand the plant managers said, ``Oh, no, you are not, you are working out \nthere,'' and she stayed that afternoon and miscarried.\n  So these 12 that the mayor had me meet said they were going to get a \nunion and they went up to Los Angeles. You know what they found, Mr. \nPresident? These are labor rights they have down in Mexico. They found \nthey already had a union. When the plants had moved down there 3 years \nbefore they had signed a legal document back there in Los Angeles \nbetween lawyers for the so-called union that they never saw, never saw. \nThe union master or anything else of that kind never visited the plant, \nand under Mexican law, since they had a union, these workers were fired \nbecause you are not allowed to try to organize a union when you have \none. That is labor rights in Mexico. So they lost their jobs. And the \nmayor was pointing them out to me.\n  Labor is there working so that the United States can go out and \nspread its values. I talked about our values as a Nation, the strength \nof them, and it isn't to get a cheap T-shirt or cheap production. It is \nto extend those rights. We had the highest standard of living here in \nthe United States, and we are trying to extend that standard of living \nso that others can buy and purchase. If we had the time, Mr. President, \nI would go into overcapacity. I remember when Bill Greider published \nhis book a couple of years ago, ``One World, Ready or Not.'' He talked \nabout overcapacity; at the time, commentators ridiculed Greider, but \nnow they find that we in the United States have the capacity to produce \n500,000 more cars than we can sell; in the European sector, they have \nthe capacity to produce 4 to 5 million more cars than they can sell, \nand with the yen down, you can watch automobiles coming in here like \ngangbusters.\n  Now, what are we saying? They don't know what they are talking about. \nWe are trying to produce consumers to go and buy those cars. And what \ndid we get out of NAFTA? Instead of $1 an hour workers' wages have gone \ndown. Read the American Chamber of Commerce report in Mexico earlier \nthis year. Instead of $1 an hour they now make 70 cents an hour. They \ncan't buy the car. There are no consumers there; that is why there is \nthe overcapacity. They act like we have equals; they say in a naive \nfashion that 96 percent of the consumers are outside the United States, \nwhen all that they are doing is looking at population figures.\n  They don't know what they are talking about. They are not consuming. \nThey are not able. I wish I had the Boston Globe article about the shoe \nmanufacturer. I don't want to mention the name because I want to be \naccurate. But the tennis shoes were being made by three young women who \nslept on the floor, without a window, in a shack down in Malaysia, and \ntheir monthly salary was less than the cost of one pair of the shoes \nthey were making. Now, come on. These are facts we must bring out in \nthis debate. Wait a minute here, we know how to compete, how to open up \nmarkets. Via Friedrich List, we have been trying for 50 years to get \ninto Japan and we have had little success.\n  If you want to sell textile products, you have to go to the textile \nindustry of Korea and get permission or you don't get it. In Europe, \nthe VCR's shipped there--there are nontariff trade barriers. They put \nVCR's up in Dijon, France. It took a year to get up there and clear all \nthe redtape, get them released from the warehouse. Automobiles stayed \non the dock in Europe--Toyota--and are still there. If you want to buy \na 1998 model, you are going to have to wait until October 1, 1998, not \nOctober 1, 1997, because the '98 models that just came out, they have a \nyear to inspect.\n  The competition, Mr. President, out there in this global economy is \nthe Friedrich List model, not the Adam Smith model. We just need to get \nthat through the hard heads of the State Department and the White House \nand the leadership in this Congress. Labor is being derided because \nthey are trying to bring the benefits to all so they can become \nconsumers, so, yes, as a result all will be able to purchase these \nproducts. But we are roaring blindly into an overcapacity problem the \nworld around and the global economy, and we are headed for deflation. \nRemember that we said it first here in the beginning of November in \n1997.\n  Mr. President, I have the article I was mentioning earlier. It was \nReebok. My staff has just given that to me.\n  We have learned the hard way. We know our responsibility. That is \nwhat really boils me. Here comes this crowd from the White House: \n``Give the President the authority, give him the authority.'' He has \nhad the authority to negotiate since 1934 under the Reciprocal Trade \nAct. We delegated that negotiating authority on behalf of the Congress. \nI am reminded of my friend Congressman Mendel Rivers, who used to be \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. He had a seal in front of his \ndesk that said ``Congress of the United States.'' When Secretary \nMcNamara would come up, Chairman Rivers would lean over and say to \nRobert McNamara, ``Not the President, not the Supreme Court, but the \nCongress of the United States shall raise and support armies,'' article \nI, section 8. Also in article I, section 8 it says ``the Congress of \nthe United States shall regulate foreign commerce,'' not the President, \nnot the Supreme Court, but the Congress of the United States. That is \nnot only our authority, it is our responsibility. But they say: Fast \ntrack, fast track, fast track. Forget your responsibility \nconstitutionally. Take it or leave it.\n  How do they get NAFTA passed? The White House amends the treaty. Mr. \nPresident, in that particular debate, we remembered there were some 16 \namendments. One Congressman down in Texas got 2 additional C-17's and \nhe gave in his vote. Another distinguished Congressman, my good friend \nJake Pickle, got a trade center. Another group down in Florida got a \ncitrus amendment to take care of their concerns, and the Louisiana vote \nwas taken care of with sugar, and for the Midwest, up by the border, it \nwas a Durum wheat amendment. I could go down the list of the 16 \namendments. What I am saying to this body is that we, the Congress, \ncan't amend the treaties, but the White House can. It is the most \narrogant, unconstitutional assault and usurpation. Said George \nWashington in his farewell address, if in the opinion of the people the \ndistribution of powers under the Constitution be in any particular \nwrong, ``then let it be amendable in the way that the Congress \ndesignates, for in the usurpation may in the one instance be the \ninstrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which \nfree governments are destroyed.'' And so we are in the hands of the \nPhilistines, the multinationals.\n\n  As I started out saying, the program of spreading capitalism has \nworked. That is what defeated the Soviet Union and brought about the \nfall of the wall. We all glory in it. But in the meantime, those who \nhad gone abroad spreading that subsidized initiative learned that they \ncould produce cheaper overseas, that they could save one-third of their \nsales of volume cost. So they began moving overseas their offshore \nproduction. And then the banks financing this movement--Chase Manhattan \nand Citicorp, as of the year 1973--I remember that debate--made a \nmajority of their profits outside of the United States. IBM is no \nlonger an American company. They have a majority of workers outside of \nthe United States. We could go down the list. But they had the banks \nand then the nationals were becoming multinationals. Then they had all \nthe consultants and the think tanks that they financed to grind out all \nthese papers. They come around babbling, ``free trade, free trade.'' So \nyou have the multinationals, the banks, the consultants, the think \ntanks, the college campuses--oh, yes, and the retailers.\n  Every time we debated the textile bill--five times we passed it--I \nwould go down to Herman's and find a catcher's mitt, one made in \nMichigan and one made in Korea, both for $43, the same price. We went \ndown to Bloomingdale's and got a ladies' blouse made in Taiwan and one \nmade in New Jersey, both for $27.\n  My point was that they get their imports, bring it in for the large \nprofit, and only give a little bit of the overrun of the particular \nsales to Grand Rapids\n\n[[Page S11646]]\n\nin New Jersey. They are not lowering their price as a result of \ncompetition. The retailers put out all of this nonsense about Smoot-\nHawley. Paul Krugman said the best of the best--we had some quotes from \nhim. We had that debate.\n  I will ask, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record the quote \nwith respect to Smoot-Hawley because we heard that same thing here a \nlittle earlier today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point \nthe record on Smoot-Hawley made by our distinguished colleague, the \nlate Senator John Heinz, in 1983, where he made a studied report of it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        The Myth of Smoot-Hawley\n\n       Mr. Heinz. Mr. President, every time someone in the \n     administration or the Congress gives a speech about a more \n     aggressive trade policy or the need to confront our trading \n     partners with their subsidies, barriers to import and other \n     unfair practices, others, often in the academic community or \n     in the Congress immediately react with speeches on the return \n     of Smoot-Hawley and the dark days of blatant protectionism. \n     ``Smoot-Hawley,'' for those uninitiated in this arcane field, \n     is the Tariff Act of 1930 (Public Law 71-361) which among \n     other things imposed significant increases on a large number \n     of items in the Tariff Schedules. The act has also been, for \n     a number of years, the basis of our countervailling duty law \n     and a number of other provisions relating to unfair trade \n     practices, a fact that tends to be ignored when people talk \n     about the evils of Smoot-Hawley.\n       A return to Smoot-Hawley, of course, is intended to mean a \n     return to depression, unemployment, poverty, misery, and even \n     war, all of which apparently were directly caused by this \n     awful piece of legislation. Smoot-Hawley has thus become a \n     code word for protectionism, and in turn a code word for \n     depression and major economic disaster. Those who sometimes \n     wonder at the ability of Congress to change the country's \n     direction through legislation must marvel at the sea change \n     in our economy apparently wrought by this single bill in \n     1930.\n       Historians and economists, who usually view these things \n     objectively, realize that the truth is a good deal more \n     complicated, that the causes of the Depression were far \n     deeper, and that the link between high tariffs and economic \n     disaster is much more tenuous than is implied by this \n     simplistic linkage. Now, however, someone has dared to \n     explode this myth publicly through an economic analysis of \n     the actual tariff increases in the act and their effects in \n     the early years of the Depression. The study points out that \n     the increases in question affected only 231 million dollars' \n     worth of products in the second half of 1930, significantly \n     less than 1 percent of world trade; that in 1930-32 duty-free \n     imports into the United States dropped at virtually the same \n     percentage rate as dutiable imports; and that a 13.5 percent \n     drop in GNP in 1930 can hardly be blamed on a single piece of \n     legislation that was not even enacted until midyear.\n       This, of course, in not to suggest that high tariffs are \n     good or that Smoot-Hawley was a wise piece of legislation. It \n     was not. But it was also clearly not responsible for all the \n     ills of the 1930's that are habitually blamed on it by those \n     who fancy themselves defenders of free trade. While I believe \n     this study does have some policy implications, which I may \n     want to discuss at some future time, one of the most useful \n     things it may do is help us all clean up our rhetoric and \n     reflect a more sophisticated--and accurate--view of economic \n     history.\n       Mr. President, I ask that the study, by Don Bedell of \n     Bedell Associates, be printed in the Record.\n       The study follows:\n\n\n                                            Bedell Associates,\n\n                                   Palm Desert, Calif., April 1983\n\n   Tariffs Miscast as Villain in Bearing Blame for Great Depression--\n                        Smoot/Hawley Exonerated\n\n                         (By Donald W. Bedell)\n\n\n             smoot/hawley, depression and world revolution\n\n       It has recently become fashionable for media reporters, \n     editorial writers here and abroad, economists, Members of \n     Congress, members of foreign governments, UN organizations \n     and a wide variety of scholars to express the conviction that \n     the United States, by the single act of causing the Tariff \n     Act of 1930 to become law (Public Law 361 of the 71st \n     Congress) plunged the world into an economic depression, may \n     well have prolonged it, led to Hitler and World War II.\n       Smoot/Hawley lifted import tariffs into the U.S. for a \n     cross section of products beginning mid-year 1930, or more \n     than 8 months following the 1929 financial collapse. Many \n     observers are tempted simply repeat ``free trade'' economic \n     doctrine by claiming that this relatively insignificant \n     statute contained an inherent trigger mechanism which upset a \n     neatly functioning world trading system based squarely on the \n     theory of comparative economics, and which propelled the \n     world into a cataclysm of unmeasurable proportions.\n       We believe that sound policy development in international \n     trade must be based solidly on facts as opposed to \n     suspicious, political or national bias, or ``off-the-cuff'' \n     impressions 50 to 60 years later of how certain events may \n     have occurred.\n       When pertinent economic, statistical and trade data are \n     carefully examined will they show, on the basis of \n     preponderance of fact, that passage of the Act did in fact \n     trigger or prolong the Great Depression of the Thirties, that \n     it had nothing to do with the Great Depression, or that it \n     represented a minor response of a desperate nation to a giant \n     world-wide economic collapse already underway?\n       It should be recalled that by the time Smoot/Hawley was \n     passed 6 months had elapsed of 1930 and 8 months had gone by \n     since the economic collapse in October, 1929. Manufacturing \n     plants were already absorbing losses, agriculture surpluses \n     began to accumulate, the spectre of homes being foreclosed \n     appeared, and unemployment showed ominous signs of a \n     precipitous rise.\n       The country was stunned, as was the rest of the world. All \n     nations sought very elusive solutions. Even by 1932, and the \n     Roosevelt election, improvisation and experiment described \n     government response and the technique of the New Deal, in the \n     words of Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. in a New York Times article \n     on April 10, 1983. President Roosevelt himself is quoted in \n     the article as saying in the 1932 campaign, ``It is common \n     sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it \n     frankly and try another. But above all, try something.''\n       The facts are that, rightly or wrongly, there were no major \n     Roosevelt Administration initiatives regarding foreign trade \n     until well into his Administration; thus clearly suggesting \n     that initiatives in that sector were not thought to be any \n     more important than the Hoover Administration thought them. \n     However, when all the numbers are examined we believe \n     neither. President Hoover nor President Roosevelt can be \n     faulted for placing international trade's role in world \n     economy near the end of a long list of sectors of the economy \n     that had caused chaos and suffering and therefore needed \n     major corrective legislation.\n       How important was international trade to the U.S.? How \n     important was U.S. trade to its partners in the Twenties and \n     Thirties?\n       In 1919, 66% of U.S. imports were duty free, or $2.9 \n     Billion of a total of $4.3 Billion. Exports amounted to $5.2 \n     Billion in that year making a total trade number of $9.6 \n     Billion or about 14% of the world's total.

When account is taken of the fact \n     that only 33%, or $1.5 Billion, of U.S. imports was in the \n     Dutiable category, the entire impact of Smoot/Hawley has to \n     be focused on the $1.5 Billion number which is barely 1.5% of \n     U.S. GNP and 4% of world imports.\n       What was the impact? In dollars Dutiable imports fell by \n     $462 Million, or from $1.5 Billion to $1.0 Billion, during \n     1930. It's difficult to determine how much of that small \n     number occurred in the second half of 1930 but the \n     probability is that it was less than 50%. In any case, the \n     total impact of Smoot/Hawley in 1930 was limited to a \n     ``damage'' number of $231 Million; spread over several \n     hundred products and several hundred countries.\n       A further analysis of imports into the U.S. discloses that \n     all European countries accounted for 30% or $1.3 Billion in \n     1929 divided as follows: U.K. at $330 Million or 7\\1/2\\%, \n     France at $171 Million or 3.9%, Germany at $255 Million or \n     5.9%, and some 15 other nations accounting for $578 Million \n     or 13.1% for an average of 1%.\n       These numbers suggest that U.S. imports were spread broadly \n     over a great array of products and countries, so that any \n     tariff action would by definition have only a quite modest \n     impact in any given year or could be projected to have any \n     important cumulative effect.\n       This same phenomenon is apparent for Asian countries which \n     accounted for 29% of U.S. imports divided as follows: China \n     at 3.8%, Japan at $432 Million and 9.8% and with some 20 \n     other countries sharing in 15% or less than 1% on average.\n       Australia's share was 1.3% and all African countries sold \n     2.5% of U.S. imports.\n       Western Hemisphere countries provided some 37% of U.S. \n     imports with Canada at 11.4%, Cuba at 4.7%, Mexico at 2.7%, \n     Brazil at 4.7% and all others accounting for 13.3% or about \n     1% each.\n       The conclusion appears inescapable on the basis of these \n     numbers; a potential adverse impact of $231 Million spread \n     over the great array of imported products which were \n     available in 1929 could not realistically have had any \n     measurable impact on America's trading partners.\n       Meanwhile, the Gross National Product (GNP) in the United \n     States had dropped an unprecedented 13.5% in 1930 alone, from\n\n[[Page S11647]]\n\n     $103.4 Billion in 1929 to $89 Billion by the end of 1930. It \n     is unrealistic to expect that a shift in U.S. international \n     imports of just 1.6% of U.S. GNP in 1930, for example ($231 \n     Million or $14.4 Billion) could be viewed as establishing a \n     ``precedent'' for America's trading partners to follow, or \n     represented a ``model'' to follow.\n       Even more to the point an impact of just 1.6% could not \n     reasonably be expected to have any measurable effect on the \n     economic health of America's trading partners.\n       Note should be taken of the claim by those who repeat the \n     Smoot/Hawley ``villain'' theory that it set off a ``chain'' \n     reaction around the world. While there is some evidence that \n     certain of America's trading partners retaliated against the \n     U.S. there can be no reliance placed on the assertion that \n     those same trading partners retaliated against each other by \n     way of showing anger and frustration with the U.S. Self-\n     interest alone would dictate otherwise, common sense would \n     intercede on the side of avoidance of ``shooting oneself in \n     the foot,'' and the facts disclose that world trade declined \n     by 18% by the end of 1930 while U.S. trade declined by some \n     10% more or 28%. U.S. foreign trade continued to decline by \n     10% more through 1931, or 53% versus 43% for worldwide trade, \n     but U.S. share of world trade declined by only 18% from 14% \n     to 11.3% by the end of 1931.\n       Reference was made earlier to the Duty Free category of \n     U.S. imports. What is especially significant about those \n     import numbers is the fact that they dropped in dollars by an \n     almost identical percentage as did Dutiable goods through \n     1931 and beyond: Duty Free imports declined by 29% in 1930 \n     versus 27% for Dutiable goods, and by the end of 1931 the \n     numbers were 52% versus 51% respectively.\n       The only rational explanation for this phenomenon is that \n     Americans were buying less and prices were falling. No basis \n     exists for any claim that Smoot/Hawley had a distinctively \n     devastating effect on imports beyond and separate from the \n     economic impact of the economic collapse in 1929.\n       Based on the numbers examined so far, Smoot/Hawley is \n     clearly a mis-cast villain. Further, the numbers suggest the \n     clear possibility that when compared to the enormity of the \n     developing international economic crisis Smoot/Hawley had \n     only a minimal impact and international trade was a victim of \n     the Great Depression.\n       This possibility will become clear when the course of the \n     Gross National Product (GNP) during 1929-1933 is examined and \n     when price behaviour world-wide is reviewed, and when \n     particular Tariff Schedules of Manufacturers outlined in the \n     legislation are analyzed.\n       Before getting to that point another curious aspect of the \n     ``villain'' theory is worthy of note. Without careful \n     recollection it is tempting to view a period of our history \n     some 50-60 years ago in terms of our present world. Such a \n     superficial view not only makes no contribution to \n     constructive policy-making. It overlooks several vital \n     considerations which characterized the Twenties and Thirties:\n       1. The international trading system of the Twenties bears \n     no relation to the interdependent world of the Eighties \n     commercially, industrially and financially in size or \n     complexity.\n       2. No effective international organization existed, similar \n     to the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for \n     example for resolution of disputes. There were no trade \n     ``leaders'' among the world's nations in part because most \n     mercantile nations felt more comfortable without dispute \n     settlement bodies.\n       3. Except for a few critical products foreign trade was not \n     generally viewed in the ``economy-critical'' context as \n     currently in the U.S. As indicated earlier neither President \n     Hoover nor President Roosevelt viewed foreign trade as \n     crucial to the economy in general or recovery in particular.\n       4. U.S. foreign trade was relatively an amorphous \n     phenomenon quite unlike the highly structured system of the \n     Eighties; characterized largely then by ``caveat emptor'' and \n     a broadly laissez-faire philosophy generally unacceptable \n     presently.\n       These characteristics, together with the fact that 66 \n     percent of U.S. imports were Duty Free in 1929 and beyond, \n     placed overall international trade for Americans in the \n     Twenties and Thirties on a very low level of priority \n     especially against the backdrop of world-wide depression. \n     Americans in the Twenties and Thirties could no more \n     visualize the world of the Eighties than we in the Eighties \n     can legitimately hold them responsible for failure by viewing \n     their world in other than the most pragmatic and realistic \n     way given those circumstances.\n       For those Americans then, and for us now, the numbers \n     remain the same. On the basis of sheer order of magnitude of \n     the numbers illustrated so far, the ``villain'' theory often \n     attributed to Smoot/Hawley is an incorrect reading of history \n     and a misunderstanding of the basic and incontrovertible law \n     of cause and effect.\n       It should also now be recalled that, despite heroic efforts \n     by U.S. policy-makers its GNP continued to slump year-by-year \n     and reached a total of just $55.4 billion in 1933 for a total \n     decline from 1929 levels of 46 percent. The financial \n     collapse of October, 1920 had indeed left its mark.\n       By 1933 the 1929 collapse had prompted formation in the \n     U.S. of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Federal Home \n     Loan Bank Board, brought in a Democrat President with a \n     program to take control of banking, provide credit to \n     property owners and corporations in financial difficulties, \n     relief to farmers, regulation and stimulation of business, \n     new labor laws and social security legislation.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Beard, Charles and Mary, New Basic History of the United \n     States.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       So concerned were American citizens about domestic economic \n     affairs, including the Roosevelt Administration and the \n     Congress, that scant attention was paid to the solitary \n     figure of Secretary of State Cordell Hull. He, alone among \n     the Cabinet, was convinced that international trade had \n     material relevance to lifting the country back from \n     depression. His efforts to liberalize trade in general and to \n     find markets abroad for U.S. products in particular from \n     among representatives of economically stricken Europe, Asia \n     and Latin America were abruptly ended by the President and \n     the 1933 London Economic Conference collapsed without result.\n       The Secretary did manage to make modest contributions to \n     eventual trade recovery through the Most Favored Nation (MFN) \n     concept. But it would be left for the United States at the \n     end of World War II to undertake an economic and political \n     role of leadership in the world; a role which in the Twenties \n     and Thirties Americans in and out of government felt no need \n     to assume, and did not assume. Evidence that conditions in \n     the trade world would have been better, or even different, \n     had the U.S. attempted some leadership role cannot \n     responsibly be assembled. Changing the course of past history \n     has always been less fruitful than applying perceptively \n     history's lessons.\n       The most frequently used members thrown out about Smoot/\n     Hawley's impact by those who believe in the ``villain'' \n     theory are those which clearly establish that U.S. dollar \n     decline in foreign trade plummeted by 66 percent by the end \n     of 1933 from 1929 levels, $9.6 billion to $3.2 billion \n     annually.\n       Much is made of the co-incidence that world-wide trade also \n     sank about 66 percent for the period. Chart II summarizes the \n     numbers.\n\n                                CHART II.--UNITED STATES AND WORLD TRADE, 1929-33                               \n                                          [In billions of U.S. dollars]                                         \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       1929     1930     1931     1932     1933 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnited States:                                                                                                  \n    Exports........................................................      5.2      3.8      2.4      1.6      1.7\n    Imports........................................................      4.4      3.0      2.1      1.3      1.5\nWorldwide:                                                                                                      \n    Exports........................................................     33.0     26.5     18.9     12.9     11.7\n    Imports........................................................     35.6     29.1     20.8     14.0   a 12.5\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na Series U Department of Commerce of the United States, League of Nations, and International Monetary Fund.     \n\n       The inference is that since Smoot/Hawley was the first \n     ``protectionist'' legislation of the Twenties, and the end of \n     1933 saw an equal drop in trade that Smoot/Hawley must have \n     caused it. Even the data already presented suggest the \n     relative irrelevance of the tariff-raising Act on a strictly \n     trade numbers basis. When we examine the role of a world-wide \n     price decline in the trade figures for almost every product \n     made or commodity grown the ``villain'' Smoot/Hawley's impact \n     will not be measurable.\n       It may be relevant to note here that the world's trading \n     ``system'' paid as little attention to America's revival of \n     foreign trade beginning in 1934 as it did to American trade \n     policy in the early Thirties. From 1934 through 1939 U.S. \n     foreign trade rose in dollars by 80% compared to world-wide \n     growth of 15%. Imports grew by 68% and exports climbed by a \n     stunning 93%. U.S. GNP by 1939 had developed to $91 billion, \n     to within 88% of its 1929 level.\n       Perhaps this suggests that America's trading partners were \n     more vulnerable to an economic collapse and thus much less \n     resilient than was the U.S. In any case the international \n     trade decline beginning as a result of the 1929 economic \n     collapse, and the subsequent return by the U.S. beginning in \n     1934 appear clearly to have been wholly unrelated to Smoot/\n     Hawley.\n       As we begin to analyze certain specific Schedules appearing \n     in the Tariff Act of 1930 it should be noted that sharp \n     erosion of prices world-wide caused dollar volumes in trade \n     statistics to drop rather more than unit-volume thus \n     emphasizing the decline value. In addition, it must be \n     remembered that as the Great Depression wore on, people \n     simply bought less of everything increasing further price \n     pressure downward. All this wholly apart from Smoot/Hawley.\n       When considering specific Schedules, No. 5 which includes \n     Sugar, Molasses, and Manufactures Of, maple sugar cane, \n     sirups, adonite, dulcite, galactose, inulin, lactose and \n     sugar candy. Between 1929 and 1933 import volume into the \n     U.S. declined by about 40% in dollars. In price on a world \n     basis producers suffered a stunning 60% drop. Volume of sugar \n     imports declined by only 42% into the U.S. in tons. All these \n     changes lend no credibility to the ``villain'' theory unless \n     one assumes, erroneously, that the world price of sugar was \n     so delicately balanced that a 28% drop in sugar imports by \n     tons into the U.S. in 1930 destroyed the price structure and \n     that the decline was caused by tariffs and not at least \n     shared by decreased purchases by consumers in the U.S. and \n     around the world.\n       Schedule 4 describes Wood and Manufactures Of, timber hewn, \n     maple, brier root, cedar from Spain, wood veneer, hubs for \n     wheels, casks, boxes, reed and rattan, tooth-picks, porch \n     furniture, blinds and clothes pins among a great variety of \n     product categories. Dollar imports into the U.S. slipped by \n     52% from 1929 to 1933. By applying our\n\n[[Page S11648]]\n\n     own GNP as a reasonable index of prices both at home and \n     overseas, unit volume decreased only 6% since GNP had dropped \n     by 46% in 1933. The world-wide price decline did not help \n     profitability of wood product makers, but to tie that modest \n     decline in volume to a law affecting only 6\\1/2\\% of U.S. \n     imports in 1929 puts great stress on credibility, in terms of \n     harm done to any one country or group of countries.\n       Schedule 9, Cotton Manufactures, a decline of 54% in \n     dollars is registered for the period, against a drop of 46% \n     in price as reflected in the GNP number. On the assumption \n     that U.S. GNP constituted a rough comparison to world prices, \n     and the fact that U.S. imports of these products was \n     infinitesimal, Smoot/Hawley was irrelevant. Further, the \n     price of raw cotton in the world plunged 50% from 1929 to \n     1933. U.S. growers had to suffer the consequences of that low \n     price but the price itself was set by world market prices, \n     and was totally unaffected by any tariff action by the U.S.\n       Schedule 12 deals with Silk Manufactures, a category which \n     decreased by some 60% in dollars. While the decrease amounted \n     to 14% more than the GNP drop, volume of product remained \n     nearly the same during the period. Assigning responsibility \n     to Smoot/Hawley for this very large decrease in price \n     beginning in 1930 stretches credibility beyond the breaking \n     point.\n       Several additional examples of price behaviour are \n     relevant.\n       One is Schedule 2 products which include brick and tile. \n     Another is Schedule 3 iron and steel products. One \n     outstanding casualty of the financial collapse in October, \n     1929 was the Gross Private Investment number. From $16.2 \n     Billion annually in 1939 by 1933 it has fallen by 91% to just \n     $1.4 Billion. No tariff policy, in all candor, could have so \n     devastated an industry as did the economic collapse of 1929. \n     For all intents and purposes construction came to a halt and \n     markets for glass, brick and steel products with it.\n       Another example of price degradation world-wide completely \n     unrelated to tariff policy is Petroleum products. By 1933 \n     these products had decreased in world price by 82% but Smott/\n     Hawley had no Petroleum Schedule. The world market place set \n     the price.\n       Another example of price erosion in world market is \n     contained in the history of exported cotton goods from the \n     United States. Between 1929 and 1933 the volume of exported \n     goods actually increased by 13.5% while the dollar value \n     dropped 48%. This result was wholly unrelated to the tariff \n     policy of any country.\n       While these examples do not include all Schedules of Smoot/\n     Hawley they clearly suggest that overwhelming economic and \n     financial forces were at work affecting supply and demand and \n     hence on prices of all products and commodities and that \n     these forces simply obscured any measurable impact the Tariff \n     Act of 1930 might possibly have had under conditions of \n     several years earlier.\n       To assert otherwise puts on those proponents of the Smoot/\n     Hawley ``villian'' theory a formidable challenge to explain \n     the following questions:\n       1. What was the nature of the ``trigger'' mechanism in the \n     Act that set off the alleged domino phenomenon in 1930 that \n     began or prolonged the Great Depression when implementation \n     of the Act did not begin until mid-year?\n       2. In what ways was the size and nature of U.S. foreign \n     trade in 1929 so significant and critical to the world \n     economy's health that a less than 4% swing in U.S. imports \n     could be termed a crushing and devastating blow?\n       3. On the basis of what economic theory can the Act be said \n     to have caused a GNP drop of an astounding drop of 13.5% in \n     1930 when the Act was only passed in mid-1930? DId the entire \n     decline take place in the second half of 1930? Did world-wide \n     trade begin its decline of some $13 Billion only in the \n     second half of 1930?\n       4. Does the fact that duty free imports into the U.S. \n     dropped in 1930 and 1931 and in 1932 at the same percentage \n     rate as dutiable imports support the view that Smoot/Hawley \n     was the cause of the decline in U.S. imports?\n       5. Is the fact that world wide trade declined less rapidly \n     than did U.S. foreign trade prove the assertion that American \n     trading partners retaliated against each other as well as \n     against the U.S. because and subsequently held the U.S. \n     accountable for starting an international trade war?\n       6. Was the international trading system of the Twenties so \n     delicately balanced that a single hastily drawn tariff \n     increase bill affecting just $231 Million of dutiable \n     products in the second half of 1930 began a chain reaction \n     that scuttled the entire system? Percentage-wise $231 Million \n     is but 0.65% of all of 1929 world-wide trade and just half \n     that of world-wide imports.\n       The preponderance of history and facts of economic life in \n     the international area make an affirmative response by the \n     ``villain'' proponents an intolerable burden.\n       It must be said that the U.S. does offer a tempting target \n     for Americans who incessantly cry ``mea culpa'' over all the \n     world's problems, and for many among our trading partners to \n     explain their problems in terms of perceived American \n     inability to solve those problems.\n       In the world of the Eighties U.S. has indeed very serious \n     and perhaps grave responsibility to assume leadership in \n     international trade and finance, and in politics as well.\n       On the record, the United States has met that challenge \n     beginning shortly after World War II.\n       The U.S. role in structuring the United Nations, the \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the \n     International Monetary Fund, the Bretton Woods and Dumbarton \n     Oaks Conference on monetary policy, the World Bank and \n     various Regional Development Banks, for example, is a record \n     unparalleled in the history of mankind.\n       But in the Twenties and Thirties there was no acknowledged \n     leader in International affairs. On the contrary, evidence \n     abounds that most nations preferred the centuries-old \n     patterns of international trade which emphasized pure \n     competition free from interference by any effective \n     international supervisory body such as GATT.\n       Even in the Eighties examples abound of trading nations \n     succumbing to nationalistic tendencies and ignoring signed \n     trade agreements. Yet the United States continues as the \n     bulwark in trade liberalization proposals within the GATT. It \n     does so not because it could not defend itself against any \n     kind of retaliation in a worst case scenario but because no \n     other nation is strong enough to support them successfully \n     without the United States.\n       The basic rules of GATT are primarily for all those \n     countries who can't protect themselves in the world of the \n     Eighties and beyond without rule of conduct and discipline.\n       The attempt to assign responsibility to the U.S. in the \n     Thirties for passing the Smoot/Hawley tariff act and thus set \n     off a chain reaction of international depression and war is, \n     on the basis of a prepondance of fact, a serious mis-reading \n     of history, a repeal of the basic concept of cause and effect \n     and a disregard for the principle of proportion of numbers.\n       It may constitute a fascinating theory for political \n     mischief-making but it is a cruel hoax on all those \n     responsible for developing new and imaginative measures \n     designed to liberalize international trade.\n       Such constructive development and growth is severely \n     impeded by perpetuating what is no more than a symbolic \n     economic myth.\n       Nothing is less worthwhile than attempting to re-write \n     history, not learning from it. Nothing is more worthwhile \n     than making careful and perceptive and objective analysis in \n     the hope that it may lead to an improved and liberalized \n     international trading system.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the crash occurred October 29, and \nSmoot-Hawley passed June 19, 8 months later. It didn't cause any crash. \nIt didn't have any affect on the economy. Neither President Hoover nor \nPresident Roosevelt had any particular concern with it, because it was \nless than 2 percent, a little over 1 percent of GNP. Trade now is 18 \npercent of the GDP. But it was less than 2 percent at that particular \ntime, and two-thirds of the trade was duty free. The two-thirds duty \nfree was affected the same as the Smoot-Hawley tariff type trade. While \nin the year 1933, under reciprocal free trade, reciprocity, we came \nback with a plus balance of trade. So we have to listen to these things \nabout we are going to start a domino effect with Smoot-Hawley again \ncoming in.\n  I can tell you that right now, I would be glad to debate Smoot-Hawley \nat any particular time.\n  Well I just read the book called ``Agents of Influence.'' This takes \nplace 7 or 8 years ago. The gentlemen was a Vice President of TRW and \nhe lost his job because he wrote the truth. He said one country, Japan, \nhad over 100 law firms, consultant firms in Washington representing \nitself, at the cost of $113 million. The consummate salary of the 100 \nSenators and 435 House Members is only $73 million. The people of \nJapan, by way of pay, are better represented in Washington than the \npeople of America.\n  When are we going to wake up? I have been sitting on the Commerce \nCommittee for 30 years and I see the front office fill up on every kind \nof trade matter that comes about. Why? Because the multinationals. Now, \nby gosh, not just 41 percent, but the majority, let's say over 50 \npercent of what they are producing has been manufactured offshore and \nbrought back in. So if they are going to lead the cheer ``free trade, \nfree trade, Japan, Korea, People's Republic of China, right on, \nbrother, you lead the way, we will follow you.''\n  Do you blame the People's Republic of China for not agreeing to \nanything? I have to note one agreement. Oh, boy, it turned everybody \nupside down in this town 2 weeks ago. We had an agreement with Japan \nrelative to our maritime services, and our ships would go into the \nports of Tokyo and the other ports in Japan. And they had finally came \naround agreeing to the same privileges that we grant them, the \nstevedores. They actually handle the goods and so forth. The Japanese \nship that comes into Charleston can have its own stevedore, but the \nAmerican ships going in to Japan could not,\n\n[[Page S11649]]\n\nup until this time. And we have been trying for years--and they have \nall kinds of controls over us in shipping that are absolutely \nburdensome. They agreed--Japan and the United States--in April. At that \nparticular time in April, when they agreed, we sat down and said, fine, \nlet's go with it. They passed four deadlines, in June, July, August and \nSeptember. Every time we added a drop-dead date, when are you going to \ndo it? Oh, we are going to do it. So we stopped the ships coming in. \nYou know what happened? My phone rang off. The 100 lawyers, the ports \nauthority lawyers, the lobbyists--Christmas wasn't going to happen, \nchildren weren't going to get any toys, the world was going to end, but \nwe had one distinguished gentlemen with his maritime commission, Hal \nCreel, the chairman, who I want to praise this afternoon. He held his \nguns. The State Department later came in, and I will credit Stuart \nEizenstat with sticking up for the United States. But it was many times \nthat they came before we got them finally to agree.\n  So, we stuck to the guns, and who was on our side? The shipping \nindustry of Japan, because organized crime had taken over, in many \ninstances, in these ports. And they, the shipping industry in Japan, \nhad been trying to do something, too. It wasn't until we stopped \nveritably the Japanese ship from coming into the American harbor that \nthey finally sat down and got to the table. The White House was \ncalling: Give in, give in. Oh, this is going to be a hard incident. \nThis is going to be terrible. Chicken Little, the sky is falling, we \nare going to start a trade war and everything else of that kind.\n  Mr. Creel stuck to his guns. That is what I am talking about on \ntrade. That is the global competition.\n  The other day former Majority Leader Dole wrote an op-ed regarding \nfast track. Don't give me Bob Dole writing the thing is a fact. The \ndistinguished gentleman should put under there that he represents the \nChilean salmon industry. Don't give me our good friend, Jay Berman. \nEveryone knows he lost out for the recording industry on the last two \nagreements. He said, I'm not going to lose out, I am going to be the \nPresident's handler, I am going to handle the Congress for the White \nHouse.\n  We are in the hands of the Philistines. The country is going down the \ntubes and all they are doing is the rich folks are hollering, give the \nPresident authority. He has the authority, but give me my \nconstitutional duty of doing just exactly what we did.\n  Come on, we have had, as the Senator from North Dakota said, in 221 \nyears hundreds of trade agreements. We had one this morning in \ncommittee. It was an OECD shipbuilding trade agreement that we approved \nbetween 16 nations at the Commerce Committee just today, without fast \ntrack. We negotiated the telecommunications agreement, an international \nagreement with 123 countries, without fast track.\n  I better stop. I don't know that I have any time left. Mr. President, \nI thank the distinguished body for yielding me this time. I hope I have \nsome time left here, because we have plenty more to debate to wake up \nthis country and start competing.\n  There is nothing wrong with the industrial worker of the United \nStates. He is the most competitive, the most productive in the world. \nLook at any of the figures. What is not producing and not competitive \nis the Government here in Washington. It has to stop.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that full floor \nprivileges be granted to Grant Aldonas during the pendency of S. 1269 \nand the House corresponding bill, H.R. 2621, during this Congress, and \nthat, too, the privilege of the floor be granted to Robert M. Baker \nwith respect to the same bills during the first session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have enjoyed listening to my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, who knows this subject up \nand down, back and forward, around and around. I thank him for the \ncontribution he has made to the debate. I wish he had another hour.\n  Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion during the \npast several months about fast track. Sadly, little of that discussion \nhas been enlightening or informative. The administration, which \nsubmitted the Export Expansion and Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of \n1997 in September, has apparently decided that misleading, exaggerated, \nand vacuous rhetoric is necessary if it is to win fast track renewal. \nThus, the U.S. Trade Representative--for whom I have great respect--has \ndescribed the President's fast track proposal to the Senate in the \nfollowing terms:\n\n       What is at stake in your consideration of this proposal is \n     nothing less than whether the United States will continue to \n     be at the forefront of nations seeking the reduction of trade \n     barriers and the expansion of more open, equitable and \n     reciprocal trading practices throughout the world.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n       What is at stake in your consideration [meaning the \n     consideration by the Congress] of this proposal is nothing \n     less than whether the United States will continue to be at \n     the forefront of nations seeking the reduction of trade \n     barriers and the expansion of more open, equitable and \n     reciprocal trading practices throughout the world . . . . \n     This is not the time to shrink from the future, but to seize \n     the opportunities it holds.\n\n  Let me assure you, Mr. President, that I am fully in favor of \n``seizing the future.'' I, too, seek the reduction of trade barriers, \nand I long for ``more open, equitable and reciprocal trading \npractices.'' That is why I am firmly and implacably opposed to fast \ntrack.\n  Mr. President, I did not come here today to add to the miasma of \nconfusion that fast track supporters have created with their murky \nlogic and overheated rhetoric. My purpose is to shed a little light, if \nI may, into the murk by exploring the institutional and practical \nproblems that fast track presents. I believe that it is my duty toward \nmy colleagues and my constituents to lay out in clear, simple and \ndirect language the reasons for my opposition to fast track.\n  I haven't been invited down to the White House. I presume that my \ngood friend from South Carolina has not had an invitation down there.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No.\n  Mr. BYRD. I haven't been invited down. I am not looking for an \ninvitation. I do not expect any invitation to change my mind. I have \nhad the master of arm twisters ahold of my arm, Lyndon B. Johnson. He \nwas the master arm twister. But I said no to him.\n  When my first grandchild was born I gave to my daughter, the mother \nof that grandchild, a Bible. In that Bible I wrote these words: ``Teach \nhim to say no.'' That's all I wrote, ``Teach him to say no.''\n  Mr. President, it doesn't make any difference if you have a \nvocabulary of 60,000 or 600,000 words. If you can't say no, then all \nthese other words at some point or another in your lifetime are going \nto find you sadly lacking--if you can't say no. I am telling this story \nin my autobiography, of how I said no to Lyndon B. Johnson on more than \none occasion. It was hard to do, because he put me on the \nAppropriations Committee when I first came here. And I felt as though I \nhad been put through a wringer after going through a 30-minute skirmish \nwith Lyndon Johnson but still saying, ``No. No, Mr. President.''\n  So, I haven't been invited down to the White House. But I can still \nsay no and would be glad to.\n  So, if the President wants to hear me say no, all he has to do is \ncall me on this. He doesn't have to invite me down to the White House. \nI'll bet the Senator from South Carolina won't get any invitation \neither.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No.\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't blame those who accept the invitation. I assume \nsome of them will say no likewise.\n  I don't expect to convince my colleagues, all of them or maybe any of \nthem. But I do hope to lay the groundwork for the healthy, open and \nhonest debate about fast track that this Chamber and this country \nsorely need.\n  So let me start by making clear that Congress has and must continue \nto have a central role in regulating trade with foreign countries. The \nConstitution--here it is, right out of my shirt pocket. Here is the \nanchor of my liberties, the Constitution. Let's see what it says.\n  Article I, section 8 assigns to the Congress the power ``to regulate \nCommerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with \nthe Indian\n\n[[Page S11650]]\n\nTribes,'' assigns the power ``to regulate Commerce with foreign \nNations,'' and to ``lay and collect * * * Duties, Imposts, and \nExcises.'' Pursuant to this authority, Congress may, for example, \nimpose tariffs, authorize reciprocal trade agreements, grant or deny \nmost-favored-nation status, and regulate international communication. \nAll this Congress can and must do according to the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  Nor is this the extent of Congress' involvement in matters of foreign \ntrade. It scarcely needs to be pointed out that Congress' central \nfunction--Congress' central function as laid out in the first section \nof the first article of the Constitution, the very first sentence--\nits central function is to make the laws of the land. This means that \nany trade agreements that are not self-executing, meaning that they \nrequire changes in domestic law, can only take effect if and when \nCongress passes implementing legislation codifying those changes.\n\n  So it should be clear from the Constitution that the framers assigned \nCongress broad authority over foreign trade agreements. Even Alexander \nHamilton, who so often championed the President's supremacy in foreign \naffairs, acknowledged in the Federalist Papers that Congress' authority \nto regulate foreign commerce was essential to prevent the President \nfrom becoming as powerful as the King of Great Britain.\n  Given the President's responsibilities in conducting relations with \nforeign powers, Hamilton argued that Congress' regulation of foreign \ntrade was a vital check upon Executive power. But look what we are \ndoing, look what we are about to do. We are, through fast track, just \nas we did with the line-item veto, handing off the few powers that we \nhave to check the Executive. Let me say that again.\n  We are, through fast track, just as we did with the line-item veto, \nhanding off the few powers that we have to check the Executive. We are \nmaking a king. He already has his castle with his concrete moat. I can \nsee it out there. The Senator from Delaware can see it. Here he has \nthis concrete moat out there, and with the king's guard standing watch \nin dark glasses--you know how they wear those dark glasses--with ears \nglued to wrist radios, and little implements on their lapels, he has \nhis own private coach, his own chef and royal tasters, his retinue of \nfancy-titled king's men. You read ``All the King's Men''?\n  So what are we waiting for? What are we waiting for? Just call in the \njeweler, contact the goldsmith, let's make the crown; let's make the \ncrown. Crown him king. That is the road on which we are traveling.\n  We gave away the line-item veto. The Roman Senate did the same. It \ngave away the power of the purse, and when the Roman Senate gave away \nthe power of the purse, it gave away its check against the executive. \nSo Sulla became dictator in 82 B.C. He was dictator from 82 to 80 B.C., \nand then a little later, the Senate--it wasn't under pressure to do \nit--voluntarily ceded the power over the purse to Caesar and made him \ndictator for a year. That was in 49 B.C.\n  Then in 48 B.C., it made him dictator again. And in 46 B.C., it made \nhim dictator for 10 years, just as we are going to do with fast track \nnow for 5 years. We don't do it a year at a time. The Roman Senate made \nCaesar dictator for 10 years. That was in 46 B.C. But the very next \nyear, in 425 B.C., it made him dictator for life.\n  I don't know when we will reach that point, but we have already ceded \nto this President great power over the purse. It has never before been \ndone in the more than 200 years of American history. It was never given \nto any President, the power over the purse. Now we are going to give \nthe President fast track. So we are just waiting, just waiting for the \njeweler! We are on the point of contacting the goldsmith! Let's now \nmake the crown!\n  From 1789 to 1974, Congress faithfully fulfilled Hamilton's dictate, \nand the dictate of the Constitution that it regulate foreign trade. \nDuring those years, Congress showed that it was willing and able to \nsupervise commerce with other countries. Congress also proved that it \nunderstood when changing circumstances required it to delegate or \nrefine portions of its regulatory power over trade. For example, \nstarting with the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Act, as trade negotiations \nbecame increasingly frequent, Congress authorized the President to \nmodify tariffs and duties during his negotiations with foreign powers. \nSuch proclamation authority has been renewed at regular intervals, most \nrecently in the 1994 GATT Reciprocal Trade Act, which I voted against.\n  I mentioned that Congress fulfilled its obligation to regulate \nforeign trade from 1789 to 1974. Well, what, you may wonder, happened \nin 1974?\n  Mr. President, it was in 1974 that Congress first approved a fast-\ntrack mechanism to allow for expedited consideration in Congress of \ntrade agreements negotiated by the President. Fast track set out limits \non how Congress would consider trade agreements by banning amendments, \nlimiting debate and all but eliminating committee involvement.\n  So we relegated ourselves to a thumbs-up or thumbs-down role. Thumbs \nup, thumbs down. Under fast track, Congress agreed to tie its hands and \nto gag itself when the President sends up a trade agreement for our \nconsideration.\n  Why on Earth, you might ask, would Congress agree to such a thing? \nWhat would convince Members of Congress to willingly relinquish a \nportion of Congress' constitutional power over foreign commerce? What \nwere Members thinking when they agreed to limits on the democratic \nprocesses by which laws are made? And why, if extensive debate and the \nfreedom to offer amendments are essential to all of the areas of \nlawmaking, would Congress decide that when it comes to foreign trade, \nwe can do without such fundamental legislative procedures?\n  Mr. President, the answers to these questions are straightforward. \nWhen Congress established fast track in 1974, it did so at a time when \ninternational commercial agreements were narrowly--narrowly--limited to \ntrade. Consider the first two instances in which fast track was \nemployed.\n  The first was for the 1979 GATT Tokyo Round Agreement. The \nimplementing bill that resulted dealt almost exclusively with tariff \nissues and required few changes in U.S. law.\n  The second use of fast track was for the U.S.-Israel Free Trade \nAgreement of 1985. The implementing language for that agreement was all \nof 4 pages--all of 4 pages--and it dealt only with tariffs and rules on \nGovernment procurement.\n  If its first two uses were relatively innocuous, starting with its \nthird use, fast track began to change and to develop an evil twin. I \nrefer to the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement which, despite its \ntitle, extended well beyond trade issues to address farming, banking, \nfood inspection and other domestic matters. One has only to see the \nsize of the agreement's implementing bill, covering over 100 pages now, \nto see how different this was from the first two agreements approved \nunder the fast-track mechanism.\n  By the time of the NAFTA agreement in 1993 and the GATT Uruguay Round \nof 1994, the insidious nature of fast track was becoming apparent for \nall to see.\n  NAFTA required substantial changes in U.S. law, addressing everything \nfrom local banking rules to telecommunications law to regulations \nregarding the weight and length of American trucks. And these changes \nwere bundled aboard a hefty bill numbering over 1,000 pages and \npropelled down the fast track before many Members of Congress knew what \nwas going on.\n  I doubt that many of my colleagues realized the extent to which, \nfirst, NAFTA and then GATT would alter purely domestic law.\n  Most of us thought of GATT as related to trade and foreign relations, \nbut through the magic mechanism of the fast-track wand--presto--trade \nlegislation became a vehicle for sweeping changes in domestic law.\n  So what had happened? What had happened? Mr. President, Socrates, in \nhis Apology to the judges said ``Petrifaction is of two sorts. There is \na petrifaction of the understanding, and there is also a petrifaction \nof the sense of shame.'' I fear that with respect to the Constitution, \nthere is not only a petrifaction of our understanding of that document, \nbut there is also a petrifaction of reverence for the document, and a \npetrifaction of our sense of duty toward that organic law. So \npetrifaction has set in.\n\n[[Page S11651]]\n\n  Mention the Constitution to Members: ``When did you last read it? \nWhat did you mean when you swore that you would support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic? What did you have in mind? Did you have in mind some foreign \ninvader that was about to set foot on American soil? Was that it? Or \ndid you think about emasculating the Constitution by passing line-item \nveto legislation or by passing fast track?\"\n  Has a petrifaction of our sense of duty to the Constitution set in? \nHas a petrifaction of our understanding of the Constitution set in? Has \na petrifaction of our caring about the Constitution taken over?\n  Well, fast track served to bind and gag the Senate, preventing much \nneeded debate and precluding the possibility of correcting amendments. \nThink about that. We give up our right to amend. And the result, as \nmany observers today would agree, is hardly a triumph for free trade or \nAmerican workers.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 36 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it was our first and, in my opinion, greatest \nPresident, George Washington, who analogized the Senate to a saucer, we \nare told, into which we pour legislation so as to cool it. Washington \nforesaw that a country as young, as aggressive and at times as \nimpatient as ours needed some institutional curb to prevent it from \nrashly throwing itself into action without sufficient reflection.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, the Senate has more than once lived up to this \nrole by providing a forum where cool minds and level intellects \nprevailed.\n  Alas, the Senate did not fulfill this role when NAFTA and GATT came \nalong. And the fault lies with the adoption of the artificial and \nunwise procedure now known as fast track--fast track. That is what the \nadministration is telling Members of Congress we have to have. Instead \nof scrutinizing these proposals closely, instead of engaging in \nprolonged and incisive debate, we were forced to play our parts in ill-\nconsidered haste. Rather than patiently and thoughtfully evaluating the \npros and cons--what did we do?--we buckled--buckled--in the face of \nadministration pressure.\n  And that is what we will do again. That is what we will do again. We \nare not going to think about the Constitution. How many of us cared a \nwhit about what the Constitution said?\n  Rather than pouring over the trade agreements, we peered at them from \nafar like tourists gawking at a distant and rapid train thundering down \na very fast and very slick track indeed.\n  The GATT and NAFTA experiences suggest that fast track--like the fast \nlane--can be risky business for U.S. trade policy. Fast track was \nCongress' response to a time when trade agreements were just that--\ntrade agreements, agreements on trade and trade alone.\n  Now that time has passed--it is gone--as huge, sprawling agreements \nlike GATT and NAFTA propose changes in trade policy whose ramifications \nspill outwards into all aspects of domestic law and policy. Now what is \nour duty? What is our duty? Where does our duty lie?\n  It is time that we in Congress wake up and resume a more traditional \nrole of treating trade agreements with the care and the attention that \nthey deserve and the care and attention that the Constitution requires \nthat we give them.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have tried to shine a few rays of truth through \nthe murky rhetoric that surrounds this contentious issue. I have \npatiently laid out the history of foreign trade regulations in order to \nemphasize the important role that tradition and the Constitution \nassigned to Congress and to show how fast track has impeded our recent \nefforts to fulfill that role. But I would be remiss in my duties if I \ndid not take the time to address some of the supposedly compelling \njustifications that fast track supporters have advanced.\n  So let me start with the first myth--the first myth--of fast track, \nwhich posits that no country will negotiate with the United States \nunless the administration has fast track in place. How laughable, how \npreposterous.\n  In the President's words:\n\n       Our trading partners will only negotiate with one America--\n     not first with an American President and next with an \n     American Congress.\n\n  Well, what did the framers say about that? What did the framers say \nabout that? They said that Congress shall regulate, have the power to \nregulate foreign commerce. The Constitution placed the duty upon us 100 \nSenators and upon the other 1,743 Members of this body who have walked \nacross this stage in the more than 200 years. So we 100 need to \nremember that this document--this document--places the responsibility \non us.\n  Do not be blinded by the glittering gewgaws in the form of words that \ncome from the White House. Do not let a call from the President of the \nUnited States, his ``Eminence,'' as John Adams wanted to refer to the \nPresident, do not let a call or a handshake or a look in the eye from \nthe chief executive, awe one--he puts his britches on just like I do, \none leg at a time. And when he nicks himself with a razor, he bleeds \njust like I do.\n  So the President said:\n\n       Our trading partners will only negotiate with one \n     American--not first with an American President and next with \n     an American Congress.\n\n  What does the Constitution say?\n  As I suggested earlier, the absence of fast track in the years before \n1974 did not seem to discourage nations from negotiating trade \nagreements with the United States. Moreover, even since 1974, fast \ntrack has been used so infrequently that it can scarcely be said to \nhave affected prospective trade partners.\n  Listening to the administration might lead one to conclude that every \ntrade agreement since 1974 could not have been concluded--just could \nnot have been concluded--without fast track. To hear them tell it down \non the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the western end, where the Sun \nrises--but not according to this, not according to this Constitution. \nThe Sun does not rise in the west.\n  But listening to the administration might lead one to conclude that \nevery trade agreement since 1974 simply could not have been concluded \nwithout fast track. Well, nothing could be further from the truth. Of \nthe hundreds and hundreds of trade agreements that we have entered into \nover the past 23 years, only--only--the five that I mentioned earlier \nhave used fast track.\n  ``What? Are you out of your head?'' Only the five that I mentioned \nearlier have used fast track? That is right.\n  Fast track has been used on a grand total of five occasions. Indeed, \nthe current administration alone has entered into some 200 trade \nagreements without the benefit of fast track.\n  Mr. President, the divine Circe was an enchantress. And Homer tells \nus that Odysseus was urged by Circe to stay away from the sirens' isle. \n``Don't go near it,'' the sirens' isle, with their melodious voices \nthat came from lips as sweet as honey. ``Odysseus alone must hear them. \nDon't let your companions hear them.'' So plugging his companions' ears \nwith wax, Odysseus ordered his companions to bind him to the mast of \nthe ship with ropes, and that if he should ask them to untie him and \nlet him go, to bind him even tighter.\n  And so they bound him, hand and foot, with ropes to the mast of the \nship. And he instructed them to disregard his order. ``Don't follow my \norders,'' he said. ``Tie them tighter than ever,'' until they were a \nlong way past the sirens' isle.\n  That is what we have been hearing--these voices, the sirens. They \ncome out of the west, down where the Sun rises at the western end of \nPennsylvania Avenue. That is where the Sun rises, believe it or not, in \nthe west.\n  I say to my colleagues, plug your ears with wax if you are invited \ndown to the White House. Plug your ears with wax or, better still, find \nsomewhere else to go. Just do not go. Do not go down there. Tie \nyourselves with ropes to the columns of the Capitol. Do not go down \nthere in the land of the rising sun, the western end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue. Do not go. But if you do go, plug your ears with wax, lest you \nfall victim to the blandishments of the sirens.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely doubt that any country will hesitate to \nnegotiate\n\n[[Page S11652]]\n\ntrade agreements with the dominant economic and political power of our \ntime out of concern that that country's legislative procedures will \nimpede a proper agreement. So do not listen to that argument. Do not \nlisten to the argument of the administration when they say, if they do \nnot have a fast-track agreement other countries simply will not \nnegotiate with us.\n  No country--no country--in my judgment, will hesitate to negotiate \ntrade agreements with this country, the dominant economic and political \npower of the age out of concern that this country's legislative \nprocedures will impede a proper agreement. If any country does \nentertain such concerns, then I suspect that the fault lies with the \nadministration, whose alarmist statements and doom-laden prophecies \nhave doubtless misled many foreign and domestic observers into thinking \nthat fast track is the only key to open trade. The administration's \nChicken Little impersonation has succeeded in whipping up false fears \nand phony worries that never existed before. One has only to ignore \nthis rhetoric and look at the administration's actual trade record to \nsee that the sky, far from falling, is still solidly secured to the \nheavens.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 40 minutes and has 20 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The record speaks for itself: Over 200 trade agreements entered into \nwithout fast track--and I am talking about the record which speaks for \nitself. The administration's actual trade record, over 200 trade \nagreements entered into without fast track versus 2 trade agreements \nentered into with fast track--200 without fast track, 2 with fast \ntrack. I might add that the latter 2 agreements have probably generated \nmore controversy than the other 200 combined. I suspect that many of my \ncolleagues rue the day that they allowed the administration to speed \nGATT and NAFTA through Congress.\n  The other great myth of fast track is that the possibility of \nCongress' amending trade agreements will seriously hamper future \nnegotiations. Lest I be accused of distorting the administration's \nposition, let me quote the President's words on trade negotiations \nverbatim.\n\n       . . . I cannot fully succeed without the Congress at my \n     side. We must work in partnership, together with the American \n     people, in securing our country's future. The United States \n     must be united when we sit down at the negotiating table.\n\n  Mr. President, I fully agree with the notion of a partnership between \nthe executive and legislative branches, and I assure you that I will \nwork with this President and with future Presidents to ensure our \nmutual trade objectives. But I will not accept the argument that \nAmerica's trade interests are best served by Congress taking a walk, \nabdicating its responsibility to consider, abdicating its \nresponsibility to debate, abdicating its responsibility to amend, if \nnecessary, trade proposals.\n  Now, the Constitution gives this Senate the right to amend and we \nought not give away that right. We ought not to agree to anything less \nthan that. This Constitution says that when it comes to raising money, \nthose measures shall originate in the other body but that the Senate \nmay amend as on all other bills. So there you are. The Constitution \nrecognizes the right of the Senate to amend. The Senate may propose or \nconcur with amendments as on other bills. There it is. That is the \nConstitution.\n  So Congress ought not take a walk. Congress ought not abdicate its \nresponsibility to consider, debate, and, if necessary, to amend trade \nproposals.\n  The President asked that we trust him alone to make trade decisions. \nNow, I like the President and I respect the President, but our \npolitical system was not built on trust. The Constitution did not say \n``trust in the President of the United States with all thy heart, with \nall thy mind, and with all thy soul.'' Our political system was built \non checks and balances, on separation of powers, on each branch of \nGovernment looking carefully and meticulously over the other branch's \nshoulder. That is how much trust the system has built into it.\n  Our Constitution's Framers realized that the surest way of preventing \ntyranny and achieving enlightened rule was to divide power among \ndistinct coordinate branches of Government. As Madison famously \nobserved, men are not angels. Accordingly, the Framers devised a \n``policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of \nbetter motives'' in which ``the constant aim is to divide and arrange \nthe several offices of Government in such a manner as that each may be \na check on the other.''\n  Mr. President, that was a good reply that Diogenes made to a man who \nasked him for letters of recommendation. ``That you are a man, he will \nknow when he sees you. Whether you are a good man or a bad one he will \nknow, if he has any skill in discerning the good and the bad. But if he \nhas no such skill, he will never know though I write to him 1,000 \ntimes.''\n  ``It is as though a piece of silver money desired someone to \nrecommend it to be tested. If the man be a good judge of silver, he \nwill know. The coin,'' said Diogenes, ``will tell its own tale.'' And \nso will the Constitution, Mr. President. It needs no letters of \nrecommendation.\n  The President asks for a ``partnership'' with Congress. He asks the \ncountry to be united at the negotiating table. But I'm afraid that what \nhe really wants is an unequal partnership in which the administration \nsits at the negotiating table and Congress sits quietly and \nsubserviently at his feet while he negotiates. Congress sits \nsubserviently.\n  Mr. President, I have a different view of the partnership between the \nPresident, any President, and Congress, a view that is rooted in the \nCongress and in the institutional traditions of this country. I see a \npartnership in which the executive fulfills its role at the negotiating \ntable and Congress makes sure that the product of such negotiations \nserves the national interest, not just the interests of a party but the \nnational interest. I don't believe that either branch has a monopoly on \nwisdom or a monopoly on patriotism or a monopoly on savvy. That is why \nI believe that each can improve the other's actions. I have no doubt \nthat Congress, after careful scrutiny, will continue to approve \nagreements that truly improve trade and open markets.\n  Now, I'm not interested in looking at the duties on every little \nfiddle string or corkscrew that is brought into this country, but they \nare overweighing policy matters that Congress ought to be interested in \nand acted about, and it may be that Congress should offer an amendment \nin one way or another.\n  Congress must be free to correct possible mistakes or sloppiness or \noversight in the negotiating process that would harm this country's \ninterests and impede truly free trade. Congress knows full well that \nany amendments it may offer could unravel a freshly negotiated \nagreement. It knows that amendments should not be freely offered and \nadopted promiscuously, haphazardly, but should rather be seen as a last \nresort to remedy serious deficiencies in an agreement. I see no reason, \nhowever, why a legislative procedure that is considered essential in \nall other policy debates should not be used in debating trade \nagreements.\n  We amend bills, we amend resolutions on various and sundry subjects, \nwe amend legislation that raises revenues, we amend bills that make \nappropriations and public moneys. Why, then, if that legislative \nprocedure is essential in all other debates, why should it not be used \nin debating trade agreements?\n  Mr. President, I recognize the importance of opening markets and \nremoving trade barriers. I also appreciate the tremendous difficulty, \nthe tremendous difficulty of negotiating trade agreements that benefit \nall sectors of our society.\n  Mr. President, I cannot support fast track. I cannot support \nsurrendering the rights and prerogatives and duties and \nresponsibilities of this body under the Constitution to any President. \nI cannot support fast track. To do so would prevent me from subjecting \nfuture trade agreements to the close scrutiny that they deserve on \nbehalf of the people of this Nation. I can and will strive to exercise \nmy limited powers in pursuit of freer, more open trade which serves the \ninterests of everyone in this Nation. But I cannot, in good conscience, \nallow fast track to strip me and my constituents of our constitutional \nprerogatives and strip this\n\n[[Page S11653]]\n\nbranch of its rightful role in regulating foreign commerce. I can't do \nthat for any President.\n\n  Mr. President, on December 5, 63 B.C. the Roman Senate sat to debate \nand to decide the fate of five accomplices of Catiline. Silaneus \nproposed the death penalty. Julius Caesar, when he was called upon, \nproposed that the death penalty not be applied, but that the five \naccomplices of Catiline be scattered in various towns, that their \nproperties be confiscated, and that their trials await another day.\n  Cato the Younger was then called upon and asked for his opinion. He \nsaid to his fellow Senators, ``Do not believe that it was by force of \narms alone that your ancestors lifted the state from its small \nbeginnings and made it a great Republic. It was something quite \ndifferent that made them great, something that we are entirely lacking. \nThey were hard workers at home. They were just rulers abroad. And they \nbrought to the Senate untrammeled minds, not enslaved by passions.''\n  And I say to my colleagues, on this question, we should come to the \nSenate with untrammeled minds, not enslaved by passions--partisan, \npolitical, or otherwise, keeping uppermost in our minds our duties and \nresponsibilities under the Constitution of the United States. That is \nthe mast to which we should tie ourselves--the Constitution.\n  I close with these final words by Cato: ``We have lost those \nvirtues,'' he said--speaking of the virtues of their ancestors--``we \npile up riches for ourselves while the state is bankrupt. We sing the \npraises of prosperity and idle away our lives, good men or bad; it is \nall one. All the prizes that merit ought to win are carried off by \nambitious intriguers, and no wonder each one of you schemes only for \nhimself, when in your private lives you are slaves to pleasure. And \nhere in the Senate the tools of money or influence.''\n  Those are Cato's words, and his words are just as fitting today and \non this question. Cato said, ``The result is that when an assault is \nmade upon the republic, there is no one here to defend it.''\n  Mr. President, how true are Cato's words today! I urge my colleagues \nto vote no on the motion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to use my time to discuss the \nfast-track bill. First, let me commend the excellent statement by the \nSenator from West Virginia. His staunch defense of the Senate and the \nCongress is based not only on his unsurpassed knowledge of the \nConstitution, but also his common sense and appreciation that the \nwisdom of the American people expressly represent the best way to make \na treaty.\n  I rise to discuss a number of issues with respect to our trade \npolicy, most particularly, the fast-track legislation that is before us \ntoday. Like all of my colleagues, I understand the importance of \ninternational trade. Today, the value of trade equals 30 percent of our \ngross domestic product, which is up from about 13 percent in 1970. \nIndeed, trade is of great importance to my State of Rhode Island, which \nexported goods totaling $1 billion in 1996.\n  There is nobody on this floor today that is arguing that trade is not \nimportant and that the United States shouldn't be actively involved in \ninternational trade. The question today is not whether the United \nStates should engage in trade. The question today is whether we will \nestablish a framework that will open markets without undermining our \nstandard of living. This debate is more than about simply increasing \nour access to cheap goods; it is about our continuing efforts to \npromote employment at decent wages here at home, continuing our efforts \nto protect the environment around the world, and strengthening our \nefforts to promote stable trade and fair trade throughout the world.\n  The critical aspects of this fast-track legislation are the goals \nwhich we set as Members of the Senate. These goals are known as \nprincipal negotiating objectives. This is the mission we give to the \nPresident--to go out and negotiate, based on these goals, to reach \nsettlements that will advance these multiple objectives: freer trade, \nfairer trade, a rising standard of living here in America and, we hope, \naround the world.\n  The rationale for fast track was aptly summarized back in 1974 when \nthe Senate Finance Committee wrote its report with respect to the first \nfast-track legislation. This report language bears repeating:\n\n       The committee recognizes that such agreements negotiated by \n     the executive should be given an up-or-down vote by the \n     Congress. Our negotiators cannot be expected to accomplish \n     the negotiating goals if there are no reasonable assurances \n     that the negotiated agreement would not be voted up or down \n     on their merits. Our trading partners have expressed an \n     unwillingness to negotiate without some assurances that \n     Congress will consider the agreement within a definite \n     timeframe.\n\n  The key operative phrase in this passage is the phrase which we have \nhighlighted behind me. The negotiated goals. That essentially is what \nwe are about today. Charting negotiating goals that will give the \nPresident of the United States the direction and the incentive to \nconduct appropriate negotiations, to yield a treaty which will benefit \nourselves, and also to signal to our trading partners what is critical \nand crucial to this Congress and the American people in terms of trade \nagreements. This rationale for fast track makes sense, and only makes \nsense, if we get it right here, if we get the negotiating goals \ncorrect.\n\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us does not provide the President with \nthe full range of goals necessary to increase U.S. trade and enhance \nour standard of living. Indeed, this bill is contrary to some of the \nprovisions of the 1988 fast-track legislation which specifically \nrecognized workers' rights and monetary coordination as fundamental \nnegotiating goals. In addition, the 1988 fast-track bill gave the \nPresident greater authority to negotiate on environmental issues in the \ncontext of these trade agreements. The Roth bill limits this authority.\n  Fast track is a great slogan. Free trade is a great slogan. But here \ntoday we are not about sloganizing, we are about legislating. And, as \nsuch, we must look to this bill, to all of its details and specifically \nto the goal which it lays out for the President of the United States. \nIn failing to adequately address issues such as labor and monetary \nconditions, the Roth bill neglects the serious assumptions that \nunderlie the whole theory of free trade.\n  The theory of free trade evolved over many, many years, based upon \nthe economic notions of comparative advantage and specialization, \nnotions that were advanced hundreds of years ago by David Ricardo, the \nEnglish economist. At the core of these notions of comparative \nadvantage and specialization is that certain nations can produce or \nprepare goods and services better than others, and that if we trade we \ncan maximize values throughout the world. These assumptions, though, \nrest on other critical assumptions. As Professor Samuelson, the famous \neconomist, pointed out in his 10th edition work on economic theory:\n\n       The important law of comparative advantage must be \n     qualified to take into account certain interferences with it. \n     Thus, if exchange rate parities and money wage rates are \n     rigid in both countries, or fiscal or monetary policies are \n     poorly run in both countries, then the blessings of cheap \n     imports that international specialization might give would be \n     turned into the curse of unemployment.\n\n  We will hear a lot about free trade, but this bill does not give the \nPresident the direction to establish the underlying environment which \nis necessary for free trade--respect for and recognition of the rights \nof workers to freely associate, to seek higher wages, respect for and \nacknowledgment of the critical role of currencies in the world of \ntrade. Because of these reasons and many others, this bill, I think, \nfalls far short of what we should in fact pass as a means to achieve \nthe goal we all fervently seek, which is free, open trade and fair \ntrade throughout the world.\n  Now, the debate on trade in the United States is not new. From the \nbeginning of our country we have fiercely debated the role of trade in \nour economy. Beginning with Alexander Hamilton's ``Report On \nManufacturers,'' there has been a constant ebb and flow between those \nthat would advise protective tariffs and those that would suggest free, \nopen trade is the only route. This battle back and forth between \nopposing views took on, in many respects, the characterization of \nprotectionism versus free traders. It reached its culmination, perhaps, \nbefore World War II when, in 1930, this\n\n[[Page S11654]]\n\nCongress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act which has become infamous \nbecause of its effect upon, at that time, the beginning of the world \ndepression. And then, in 1934 the protective tariffs embedded in Smoot-\nHawley were reversed. In 1934, the Tariff Act gave the President the \nright to reciprocally negotiate trade and tariff adjustment. So, this \nphase, running from the beginning of the country to the advent of World \nWar II, saw a fierce battle between protectionists and open-marketeers.\n  The second phase of our debate on trade began in the aftermath of \nWorld War II where a dominant American economy sought to establish \nrules for freer trade. But from World War II through 1974, particularly \nwith respect to the Kennedy and Tokyo Rounds of GATT, our view was more \nor less using trade as a foreign policy device, using trade as a way to \nestablish bulwarks against the threats of communism, the threats of \ninstability. And in so many respects it was this unintended but \naccumulation of concessions to trading partners around the world that \nhas left us where we are today, which in many respects our market is \nvirtually open in terms of tariffs and in terms of nontariff barriers, \nbut there are many other countries who still maintain barriers to our \ntrade.\n  Beginning in 1974, we recognized that an important part of access to \nmarkets was not just the tariff level but those nontariff barriers. As \na result, we started the fast-track process. In this context that I \ndescribed, fast track makes sense if we get the goals right. Today's \nlegislation, I suggest, does not get the goals right. Indeed, since \n1974 international trade has taken on a much more central position in \nour economy in terms of its size and, now, in a variation on some of \nthe foreign policy themes we heard during the 1950's and 1960's, as a \nway of some to create the democracies, the markets which we think are \nessential to progress around the world. In any respect, we are here \ntoday not to stop the progress of free trade but, in fact, to ensure \nthat free trade results in benefits for all of our citizens and, \nindeed, benefits for those citizens of the world economy which we hope \nto trade with.\n  Some have labeled anyone who opposes this fast-track mechanism as a \nprotectionist. I think quite the contrary, those of us--let me speak \nfor myself. I certainly think that we represent interventionists, \nbecause we feel that to get trade right, you can't simply leave the \ncountry we trade with as we found it. We have to insist that they begin \nto adapt to and accept international standards with respect to workers' \nrights, environmental quality, currency coordination, a host of issues. \nIn fact, when we look at the agreement, we see instances within this \nlegislation, it is quite clearly acknowledged, where we are pushing or \ntrying to push countries to adapt to our way of doing business. But \nthey seem to be exclusively with respect to commercial practices--\ncommercial laws or agricultural policies. So we have in some respects \nthe will to try to develop a world system based upon our model, but \nwhen it comes to critical issues like workers' protections and \nenvironmental quality, this legislation does not express that necessary \nrole.\n  The administration has expressed their deep desire for this \nlegislation. Indeed, I hope we could pass a fast-track legislative bill \nthis session to open up markets to American firms, to compete in a \nglobal economy. With under 5 percent of the world's population living \nin the United States, we certainly have to find ways to sell to the \nremaining 95 percent of the world's population. It is no secret that \neconomies in many parts of the world are growing faster than we are and \noffer tremendous opportunities for our investment and our exports. It \nis indeed predicted that economies in Asia and economies in Latin \nAmerica will continue to grow at significant rates and we have to be \npart of this.\n  But we have to be part of this growth in trade in a way that will \nensure that American firms and American workers are in the best \nposition to compete and win in this global economy, this battle for \nsuccess in the global economy. But I don't think, as I mentioned \nbefore, that this bill will set the goals necessary to win that \ncompetition.\n  Now, as Senator Byrd indicated so eloquently, this legislation also \nrepresents a significant expansion in the authority of the President to \nconduct the foreign policy of the United States and the commercial \npolicy of the United States. In fact, since the adoption in 1974, the \nPresident's ability to negotiate and enter into trade agreements to \nreduce or eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers has increased \nsignificantly. But because it is such a significant delegation of \nauthority, we have to, as I indicated before, make sure that we get the \ngeneral goals correct, because we won't have the opportunity, as we do \nin other ways, to second-guess or correct the President's decision as \nwe go forward.\n\n  So, again, as the Senator from West Virginia indicated, this is the \nopportunity for us, and maybe the only opportunity, to set the \nappropriate agenda for discussions going forward on international \ntrade. I think, as I said, the current bill before us does not \nestablish the appropriate negotiating goals so that we do ensure the \nPresident not only has the authority but the appropriate direction to \nserve the interests of the American people in establishing a regime of \nfree and open trade throughout the world.\n  Now, as I indicated before, the Roth bill that is before us today is \ndeficient in many specifics. First, let me take one specific and that \nis the notion of providing a very active negotiating goal to seek ways \nto improve and enforce labor relations in other countries around the \nworld. In 1988, fast-track legislation stated that one of the \nadministration's principal negotiating objectives in trade agreements \nwas:\n\n       To promote respect for worker rights; to secure a review of \n     the relationship between worker rights to GATT articles, \n     objectives, and related instruments with a view to ensuring \n     that the benefits of the trading system are available to all \n     workers; to adopt as a principle of the GATT, that the denial \n     of worker rights should not be a means for a country or its \n     industries to gain competitive advantage in international \n     trade.\n\n  This legislation before us eliminates this workers' rights provision \nas a principal negotiating objective in trade agreements. I dare say if \nwe read that to any Member of this Senate, they would say of course \nthat has to be a goal of our trade negotiators. Yet in this legislation \nit is not such a goal.\n  As a result, it will limit the President's ability to try to \nnegotiate improvements of labor standards and, as such, it will cast \naside the interests of millions of American workers as well as the \ninterests of workers worldwide.\n  It is no secret that income inequality has risen substantially in the \nUnited States in recent years. For nearly 2 decades the real wages and \ncompensation of American blue-collar workers have been declining. \nHourly compensation for nonsupervisory production workers fell by \napproximately 9.5 percent between 1979 and 1995.\n  There are many reasons for this. Some would cite declining rates of \nunionization, some the erosion of the real value of the minimum wage. \nBut others would cite the increasing globalization of trade. Although \nit is difficult to determine exactly the composition, the factors that \nare influencing this phenomena, there is an emerging consensus by \neconomists that approximately 30 percent of the relative decline in the \nwages of noncollege-educated workers, and even a larger share in the \ndecline with respect to production-wage workers, is a result of \ninternational trade and its effects. And I should say even though the \nPresident has suggested Executive initiatives in the last 2 days to try \nto correct some of these incongruities, it is not likely to do so. In \nfact, if we want to ensure that our wages remain comparable with our \nincreases in productivity, we have to ensure that when our negotiators \ngo to the table and negotiate arrangements, they are conscious of the \nrights of American workers and conscious of the rights of those workers \nin the countries with which we are attempt to go negotiate these trade \nagreements. Indeed, in light of these trends it is imperative that this \nprovision be part of our fast-track legislation. It is not such a part \nof the legislation.\n  We have the recent experience of NAFTA to further inform the debate \non these issues. It has been estimated that since enactment of NAFTA in \n1993, trade with Canada and Mexico has cost the United States \napproximately 420,000 jobs, including 2,200 in my home State of Rhode \nIsland. As a minimal estimate of job loss, the Labor Department has \ncertified approximately\n\n[[Page S11655]]\n\n143,000 workers as being eligible for assistance because of trade \ndislocation.\n  The list of companies that have made NAFTA-related layoffs is a \nveritable ``Who's Who'' of American industry. It includes General \nElectric, Allied Signal, Sara Lee, Black and Decker, TRW, Georgia \nPacific, Johnson & Johnson--and the layoffs continue.\n  Indeed, I don't think one can point the finger merely at these \ncompanies because they are certainly just taking advantage of something \nwhich we created, the opportunity legally--in fact some would argue the \nincentive legally--to move production out of the United States to other \nareas, in this case Mexico.\n  But the effect is not simply in the jobs lost. The effect perhaps is \nmore decisive in the suppression of wages. There are reports that \ncompanies will either explicitly or implicitly threaten to relocate to \nplaces like Mexico if wage concessions are not made. In fact, during \nthe debate last year on NAFTA, a Wall Street Journal poll of executives \nfound a majority of executives from large companies intended to use \nNAFTA, as they indicated, as ``a bargaining chip to keep down wages in \nthe United States.''\n  And this is borne out by numerous anecdotes. For example, workers at \na plant in my home State in Warwick, RI, agreed to freeze wages and \nwork 12-hour shifts without overtime pay because the company threatened \nto move production to Mexico. Similarly, 4,000 workers in a plant in \nWebster, NY, accepted 33-percent cuts in base pay to avoid a threatened \nplant relocation. A company in Georgia threatened to move 300 jobs at a \nlighting plant to Mexico unless workers took a 20-percent cut in pay \nand 36-percent cut in benefits. Mr. President, 220 workers at a plant \nin Baltimore agreed to take a $1-an-hour pay cut to keep the plant \nopen. And the list goes on and on and on.\n  The negative implications of NAFTA has been felt by U.S. workers and \nit should give us renewed energy and commitment to ensure that in the \nnext round of fast-track legislation we at least replicate the 1988 \ngoal of actively trying to ensure that worker protection, workers' \nrights are a central part of our negotiating strategy. Once again, this \nlegislation does not do that.\n  It is important also to note that in the context of NAFTA, the \nbenefits for Mexican workers have not been what they were advertised \nas. Since the passage of NAFTA, real manufacturing wages of Mexican \nworkers have declined 25 percent. Part of this decline is attributable, \nof course, to the peso crisis. However it is important to recognize \nthat real wages were stagnating prior to the peso crisis, while worker \nproductivity in Mexico continued to grow. So, despite increased \nproductivity, wages in Mexico continue to stagnate or decline. In fact, \nthe percentage of Mexicans considered extremely poor rose from 31 \npercent in 1993 to 50 percent in 1996, after NAFTA. And two out of \nthree Mexicans report that their personal economic situation is worse \nnow than before NAFTA.\n  Following NAFTA, we have the benefit of these experiences which we \ndid not have when we were considering the legislation back in 1988. \nAgain, it seems inconceivable that seeing what has taken place in \nNAFTA, seeing how important--not only to our workers but to the workers \nof the country we hope to trade with--how important it is to negotiate \nand to reach principled agreements on worker protections and worker \nrights, that we are neglecting to do that in this legislation. And, as \nsuch, we have left a huge hole in our responsibility to give the \nPresident the responsibility and the direction to do what is best for \nthe working men and women of this country, do what is best for the \noverall welfare of this country.\n  Now, with respect to the environment, that is another area where this \nlegislation is deficient. It restricts the ability of the President to \nnegotiate environmental issues and trade agreements by requiring that \nthey be ``directly related'' to trade. And this differs from the 1988 \nfast-track bill which provided greater latitude for the President to \nnegotiate on environmental issues. I would assume that ``directly \nrelated to trade'' means that if we have a problem getting a good into \na country because they object to an environmental rule, that we might \nsay, for example, labeling of a can, of a product, that that might be \nactionable. But it is not actionable if the country has absolutely no \nenvironmental enforcement; that it allows pollution to run rampant, \nthat it actually encourages the relocation of factories and production \nfacilities because of lax environmental rulings, because one I assume \nwould argue that's not directly related to trade, it's not directly \nrelated to a good we are trying to get into the economy. But in fact, \nand again the NAFTA experience is instructive, this is precisely one of \nthe ways in which countries undermine our environmental laws at home on \nthe standard of living of our workers here in the United States. \nIndeed, after NAFTA we should be much more interested in including \nstrong environmental protections. For the examples that the NAFTA \nexperience has given us.\n\n  Subsequent to the passage of NAFTA the Canadian province of Alberta, \nwhich was only one of two Canadian provinces to sign the NAFTA \nenvironmental side agreement, adopted legislation in May 1996 \nprohibiting citizens from suing environmental officials to enforce \nenvironmental laws. And, in fact, since that time, to attract corporate \ninvestment, Alberta has advertised its lax regulatory climate as part \nof ``the Alberta advantage.''\n  Now, it might be an advantage to Alberta. Certainly I don't think it \nis to many residents of Alberta. And it is not an advantage to U.S. \ncompanies or U.S. workers who are faced with laws that we passed, and \nrightfully so, that demand high-quality environmental controls in the \nworkplace.\n  In October 1995 Mexico announced that it would no longer require \nenvironmental impact assessments for investments in highly polluting \nsectors such as petrochemicals, refining, fertilizers and steel.\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, Mexican officials said they were eliminating \nthese environmental impact assessments to increase investment, which \nmay well be an apparent violation of NAFTA because it prohibits, \napparently, the weakening of environmental laws to attract investment.\n  So our experience with NAFTA should tell us that we must redouble our \nefforts to have the principal negotiating objective of environmental \nconcerns. Yet, again we have constrained and circumscribed the ability \nof the President by simply saying they have to be directly related to \ntrade, and many environmental problems are not directly related to \ntrade.\n  For example, near the United States-Mexican border, there is an area \nknown as Ciudad Industrial, where a number of sophisticated, highly \nautomated manufacturing plants have been established since NAFTA. These \nmanufacturing plants discharge hazardous waste through a nearby sewer \noutfall which adjoins a river that is used for washing and bathing. The \nMexican Government has enacted a number of institutional barriers to \nenvironmental progress to prevent pollution abatement. For example, \nMexican law prohibits the local government from taxing these state-of-\nthe-art factories to pay for sewers, to pay for cleaning up.\n  In these ways, unrelated directly to trade, there are advantages to \nrelocating production in countries. These are the type of actions which \nwe should be concerned about, that we should, in fact, direct the \nPresident to be concerned about, that we should, in fact, insist the \nPresident bring to the table as a significant negotiating goal.\n  There is a final point I would like to make with respect to the \nspecific deficiency of these goals, and that is the issue of monetary \ncoordination. The 1988 fast-track bill included monetary coordination \nas a principal negotiating objective. Specifically the bill stated:\n\n       The principal negotiating objective of the United States \n     regarding trade in monetary coordination is to develop \n     mechanisms to ensure greater coordination, consistency and \n     cooperation between international trade and monetary systems \n     and institutions.\n\n  The bill before us today eliminates monetary coordination as a \nprincipal negotiating objective, thereby limiting the President's \nability to address issues of currency valuation, fluctuating currency, \nall of the issues that have become tangible and palpable in the last \nfew days, as we witnessed the gyrations of currency and the stock \nmarket throughout the Orient.\n\n[[Page S11656]]\n\n  Currency valuation is a key component of trade policy because it \naffects the price of imports and exports. For example, as the U.S. \ndollar gets stronger relative to other currencies, U.S. exports to a \nforeign country will likely become more expensive in that country and \nthe country's imports will become cheap in the United States. \nInversely, as the U.S. dollar gets weaker relative to other currencies, \nU.S. exports to a foreign country will become cheaper in that country, \nand that country's imports will become more expensive in the United \nStates. As a result, and quite clearly, currency valuation affects \ntrade flow between countries and, consequently, the trade deficit.\n  We have to be terribly conscious of these currency valuations. It is \nevident in recent statistics on the valuation of the dollar in trade \nthat there is a high correlation between the two. Since mid-1995, the \ndollar has risen against a number of foreign currencies, and during \nthis period, the United States trade deficit rose also. It is estimated \nthe trade deficit will increase to $206 billion by the end of 1997. \nAlso, currency valuation affects direct investment into our country by \nforeign investors, and that is something that we also have to be \nsensitive to.\n  Again, the NAFTA experience gives us further evidence--if we didn't \nknow about it before--it gives us further evidence. As you know, NAFTA \nwas enacted and shortly thereafter, the peso collapsed. What we thought \nwere significant reductions in Mexican tariffs were wiped out by a 40-\npercent reduction in the value of the peso.\n\n  This reduction was part of inevitably the continuing strategy of \nMexico, and the strategy of many countries, to have export-led growth \nto reduce the cost of their goods to United States consumers, and one \nway they did this was through the devaluation of the peso.\n  If we continue to be indifferent to the notion of currency and its \nrole in our international trade, we are going to continue to see these \nproblems and others like them.\n  It turned out that before the negotiation of NAFTA, Mexico was \nrunning a trade deficit of $29 billion with the United States, a very \nlarge trade deficit, 8 percent of its gross domestic product. By 1994, \nafter the onset of NAFTA and towards 1996, their deficit had turned \ninto a surplus, again, in many respects because of the currency changes \nthat took place because of the peso prices.\n  So we do have to be very, very conscious of these currency effects. \nOnce again, this is not a part of the major negotiating goals for this \nlegislation.\n  Reduced currency values in Mexico has prompted increased investment \nthere. In the past year, investment in maquiladora plants in the \nMexican State of Baja California, have increased by more than 35 \npercent. In effect, because of their policies, because of our adoption \nof NAFTA, we have created monetary incentives to move and invest in \nMexico and not just for the United States but for other countries \naround the world who are using Mexico as a platform for low-cost \nproduction which, in turn, is imported into the United States without \nduties.\n  Over the horizon, there is another major trading partner whose \ncurrency manipulations, if you will, can cause us significant problems, \nand that is China. As part of its strategy to encourage exports and \ndiscourage imports, China has engaged in an effort to reduce the value \nof its currency relative to the dollar. These currency valuations wipe \nout many of the concessions that we think we have sometimes with the \nChinese with respect to their trade and our trade.\n  It puts, of course, downward pressure on the wages of U.S. workers as \nwe cannot produce here the items that can be produced overseas more \ncheaply, not because of differences in productivity, but, in many \ncases, in part at least in the very calculated manipulation of \ncurrencies by foreign countries.\n  Again, the absence of such a major negotiating provision within the \nbill, I think, is a fatal flaw.\n  Overall, the bill before us continues a policy of protecting capital \nwithout, I think, sufficient protection for workers, protecting the \nability of capital to relocate throughout the world, without \nrecognizing that there must be commensurate protections for workers, \nworkers both here in the United States and workers worldwide.\n  Because of the incentives now to deploy capital almost everywhere, we \nare beginning to recognize the phenomena of excess capacity in \nproduction facilities around the world, and many economists fear that \nthis will lead to a massive deflation, and this massive deflation could \nbe the major economic challenge that we face in the year's ahead.\n  The lack of work protections, the fact that countries can manipulate \ncurrencies, the lack of sensitivity to environmental policies has been \nan incentive, a very powerful incentive, to move production from the \nUnited States into these developing countries. For example, Malaysia's \nbooming electronics industry is based on the explicit promise to \nAmerican semiconductor companies that workers will effectively \nprohibited from unionizing. In fact, when Malaysia considered lifting \nthis ban on unionizing, American companies threatened to move to China \nor Vietnam, more receptive countries. This competition for cheap labor \ncontinues to put downward pressure on wages in developed countries as \ncompanies use the threat of relocation to leverage or reduce the pay of \ntheir workers.\n  These trends, related to labor and technology, are creating \na situation, as I indicated, of overcapacity in many respects which may \noutstrip the ability of the workers to afford the very goods they are \nproducing. The economic journalist, William Grieder, characterized the \nsituation as follows:\n\n       The central economic problem of our present industrial \n     revolution, not so different in nature from our previous one, \n     is an excess of supply, the growing permanent surpluses of \n     goods, labor and productive capacity. The supply problem is \n     the core of what drives destruction and instability. \n     Accumulation of factories, redundant factories as new ones \n     are simultaneously built in emerging markets, mass \n     unemployment and declining wages, irregular mercantilist \n     struggles for market entry and shares in the industrial base, \n     market gluts that depress prices and profits, fierce contests \n     that lead to cooperative cartels among competitors and other \n     consequences.\n\n  That is an outline of a world which faces increasing prices. The oil \ncompanies are a good example potentially of that world. By the year \n2000, the global auto industry will be able to produce nearly 80 \nmillion vehicles. However, there will only be a market for \napproximately 60 million buyers. These imbalances, created by excessive \nsupply, will put downward pressure on prices, and reduced profits and \nbegin a deflationary trend.\n  Another commentator, William Gross, is managing director of Pacific \nMutual Investment Co., which manages more than $90 billion worldwide, \nnow pegs the risk of a general deflation at 1 in 5 in the next several \nyears. He states:\n\n       My deflationary fears are supported by two arguments: \n     exceptional productivity growth and global glut.\n\n  He cites twin causes. Real wages both in the United States and abroad \ncannot keep up with the rapid growth of new production. That is, there \nwill not be enough demand to buy all excess goods and emerging \neconomies create aggressive new players eager to outproduce and \nunderprice everyone else.\n  Overcapacity may be at the heart of the crisis that we have seen in \nAsia, the crisis which is manifested through currency turbulence and \nalso through the stock market gyrations. We have seen in Thailand, for \nexample, where, fueled by massive capital infusions, the economy in \nThailand took off at a staggering rate. Between 1985 and 1994, the \nThais had the world's highest growth rate, an average of 8.2 percent. \nIt was prompted by developers who were building office towers and \nindustrial parks that were built regardless of demand. They continued \nto build even as the completed buildings were half empty.\n  Petrochemical, steel, and cement plants were operating at half \ncapacity because of oversupply. To address the oversupply issue, \ncurrency speculators thought it inevitable that the Thai currency, \nwhich was pegged to the dollar, would be devalued to boost Thailand's \nexports. Based on those assumptions, currency speculators began selling \nThai currency and it decreased. The Government was forced to step in. \nThey could not sustain their support and the bottom, if you will, \ndropped out of the local Thai currency, the baht. We feel similar \npressures with the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.\n\n[[Page S11657]]\n\n  All of this is prompted, in part, by the fact that capital can move \neverywhere, capital is moving everywhere, and we are not, I think, \nrecognizing it in terms of our overall trade policy and certainly not \nrecognizing in terms of this legislation.\n  We have to be conscious, very conscious, that the conditions of \nuntrammeled deployment of capital around the world has beneficial \neffects but can have very detrimental effects. It has to be balanced. \nIt has to be balanced by similar regimes in terms of workers' rights, \nin terms of environmental quality, in terms of coordinating currency, \nin terms of those factors which will allow free trade to be truly free \nand not allow situations to develop where capital is attracted not \nbecause of quality of workers, not because of natural resources, not \nbecause of factories that go to the heart of the production function, \nbut because countries consciously try to depress their wages, try to \nsuppress enforcement of environmental quality, try to manipulate \ncurrency, try to lure for short-term growth capital which will end up \neventually bringing their house of cards down but, in the meantime, \naffecting the livelihood, the welfare and the state of living of \nmillions and millions of American workers.\n\n  This bill does not adequately address those capital movements. It \ndoesn't adequately understand or recognize that modern technology is \nassisting these capital movements. It does not recognize that we have \nto have policies that comprehend what is going on in the world today. \nThis migration of capital, this technological expansion, all of these \nthings have an impact on the wages of American workers. All of these \nhave an impact on what we should be doing here today in terms of \ndeveloping our response to world trade as it exists today.\n  There is another aspect of this capital deployment and this \ntechnology deployment and that is the notion of forced technology \ntransfer which many of our trading allies engage in, specifically \nChina. Their trade policies have demanded that companies investing in \nor exporting to China must also transfer product manufacturing \ntechnology to China.\n  A recent article in the Washington Post chronicled this issue. For \nexample, to win the right to form a joint venture with China's leading \nautomaker, General Motors promised to build a factory in China \nfeaturing the latest in automotive manufacturing technology, including \nflexible tooling and lean manufacturing process.\n  GM also pledged to establish five training institutes for Chinese \nautomotive engineers and to buy most of its parts for the Chinese \nventure locally after 5 years.\n  Similarly, an unidentified United States manufacturer is planning to \nbuild a major facility in China instead of the United States in \nresponse to Chinese pressure. An executive with the company indicated \nthat production will be more expensive in China and the quality will be \nworse, but in order to do business in China, they had to conform to \nthese demands.\n  According to many United States business executives, China's demands \nfor technology are simply a cost of doing business with China. However, \nthe effect is that our companies are transferring their facilities to \nChina, making China not trading partners but ultimately competitors to \nour own world.\n  An interesting experience of DuPont. In the late 1980's, DuPont \nnegotiated with China's Chemical Industry Ministry to form a joint \nventure to make a rice herbicide called Londax. By the time the venture \nstarted production in 1992, several factories in China were already \nproducing Londax using DuPont technology that it was providing to the \njoint venture. Soon thereafter, approximately 30 Chinese factories were \nmaking several DuPont proprietary herbicides, all without the explicit \npermission of DuPont.\n  So what we are seeing again is not only the deployment of capital \nbecause of natural market forces, but because of the will and because \nof the negotiating stance of foreign countries that are required as a \npart of free trade, we are seeing the free transfer of our expertise, \nour proprietary information, our technology, and ultimately in many \ncases our jobs.\n  The other aspect of this legislation which should be noted, I think \nwith some significance, is the fact that this legislation really does \nnot recognize the fact that we have been running trade deficits of \nstaggering proportions year in and year out.\n  It is interesting to hear the proponents of fast track talking about \nthis as the great salvation for our trading partners. And we have had \nfast track now since 1974. I would daresay, we were probably running \ntrade deficits in 1974. So clearly, fast track is a mechanism--in fact, \nsome would argue the way we conduct some of these bilateral Free Trade \nAgreements is not the answer to the most consistent foreign problem we \nface in America today; that is, continued trade deficits. We have to \naddress these problems.\n  The major trade deficit we run of course is with the Japanese. But we \nare also running significant deficits with the Chinese.\n  In some respects, one wonders why we are here today talking about \nfast track when one would argue our major problem is adjusting our \ntrade relationship not with emerging countries like Chile, but with \ncountries like Japan and China. Once again, I do not know what this \nlegislation will do to effect those major problems.\n  Let me just suggest that we have entered into a fast-track procedure \nwhich is flawed because the goals we have established do not reach the \nmost important issues that we face in the world today. They do not \naddress our trade deficit directly. They certainly do not address the \nissues of work protections, environmental policy, currency issues. In \nfact, also they are sending wrong signals to our allies, our potential \ntrading partners.\n  By not adopting these as central, important key negotiating goals, we \nare essentially telling our potential trading partners we do not care. \nOh, yes, we will have side agreements. We will have executive \ninitiatives. We will talk a good game about these issues. But they are \nnot at the heart of this legislation which is the defining legislation \nfor our whole procedure.\n  I do not think it takes much for a trade minister in a foreign \ncountry to figure out pretty quickly it is not important--not \nimportant--to the American people, not important to Congress, not \nimportant to our trade effort when, in fact, I would argue it is the \nmost important thing that we can and should do.\n  We have seen the side agreements mentioned, but the side agreements \nhave not, I think, produced anything near the type of mechanism, type \nof framework which is essential to good trade policy throughout the \ncountry and throughout the world.\n  Let me just conclude by saying that the fast-track procedure will \nwork if we get the goals right. We have neglected to get negotiating \ngoals right. We have neglected key issues with respect to worker \nprotections, key issues with respect to environment, key issues with \nrespect to the coordination of currency. And the suggestion that we \ncan, by side agreements or by legislative initiatives, make up the \ndifference I think is mistaken. The experience of NAFTA has been very \ninstructive in that regard.\n\n  Today, we are here as Members of this Senate to do what we must do in \nthe trade process. And that is, to write legislation which will clearly \ndefine all the relevant goals that are necessary to not only open up \nmarkets but to maintain the standard of living of the United States.\n  This is a central issue that we face today and will face in the days \nahead. This bill, sadly, will not give us the kind of direction, give \nthe President the kind of direction that he needs and that the American \npeople demand.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. President, could I reserve the balance of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). That will be reserved.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. First, I want to commend the very able Senator from \nRhode Island for a very thorough and thoughtful analysis of the issues \nsurrounding this legislation. Obviously, a great deal of work went into \nthat statement, and I think the distinguished Senator touched on a \nnumber of very important and critical issues.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion to proceed to S. \n1269. This\n\n[[Page S11658]]\n\nlegislation would provide trade agreement approval procedures, so-\ncalled fast-track procedures, for implementing the results of trade \nagreements that require changes in U.S. law.\n  In my view, this is a poorly conceived piece of legislation that does \nnot serve the interests of the American people.\n  First, let me observe the fast-track procedures are relevant only to \na narrow range of trade agreements, specifically, those agreements \nwhich require Congress to make changes in existing U.S. law in order \nfor the agreements to be implemented.\n  Most trade agreements do not require legislative changes and, \ntherefore, fast track consideration would in effect be inapplicable to \nthem.\n  It is my understanding, for example, that the Clinton administration \nhas negotiated over 220 trade agreements. Only two required fast-track \nauthority--NAFTA and the GATT Uruguay round agreement.\n  So let me just observe at the outset that there is a great deal of \noverstatement going on as to the importance of fast-track authority to \nthe administration's ability to negotiate trade agreements and open \nforeign markets to U.S. exporters.\n  The fact is that for the overwhelming majority of trade agreements, \nfast-track authority is not needed. And based on its own record, the \nadministration has concluded a large number of such trade agreements \nwithout fast-track authority--not under fast-track authority.\n  The question then becomes, for the narrow range of trade agreements \nthat will require legislative action by the Congress, because the trade \nagreement reached requires a change in U.S. law, what is the \nappropriate role for the Congress in approving those agreements?\n  Now, article II, section 8 of the Constitution explicitly grants \nCongress the authority ``To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations . . \n.''\n  The authority of Congress to approve trade agreements is \nunquestioned. And it is very clearly spelled out in the Constitution. \nSo the issue is simply, how should the Congress best exercise this \nauthority?\n  I want to go back just a little bit historically and trace some of \nthe evolution of trade negotiating authority in order to bring us to \nset the current situation in context.\n  As many have observed, up until a couple of decades ago, most trade \nagreements dealt with setting tariffs on traded goods.\n  Up until 1930, Congress passed occasional tariff acts that actually \nset tariff terms. However, Congress became increasingly reluctant to \nset tariff schedules in legislation. And in 1934, in the Reciprocal \nTrade Act--I emphasize the word ``reciprocal'' --the Reciprocal Trade \nAct, Congress granted to the President for the first time so-called \nproclamation authority, the power to set tariffs by executive agreement \nwith U.S. trading partners.\n  But that was a power with respect to the setting of tariffs that was \nlimited, specifically limited within certain limits and for fixed \nperiods of time. From the 1930's through the 1960's, Congress extended \nthe 1934 act authorizing the President to negotiate reductions in U.S. \ntariffs in exchange for comparable reductions by U.S. trading partners.\n\n  Congress would typically limit how much tariffs could be reduced. In \nother words, we would set the range below which the administration \ncould not go. We would give a range how long negotiations could go on, \nand the Congress even exempted specific products from the negotiations. \nBut once the reductions were negotiated within the range that the \nCongress had established, the President then issued an order \nproclaiming the new tariffs and trade agreements between 1934 and 1974 \nwere negotiated pursuant to this authority.\n  Now, during the 1960's, trade talks began to expand into nontariff \ntrade areas that were governed by existing U.S. law; in other words, \nthe trade talks began to involve matters that were not tariff matters \nbut matters that were covered by our law. The Kennedy round GATT \nnegotiations, for example, required for the first time changes to U.S. \nantidumping laws. We had antidumping laws on the books. The negotiated \nagreement required changes in those antidumping laws. The Congress made \nclear at that time that the executive branch had to obtain authority \nfrom the Congress to change a U.S. law in a trade agreement. The \nexecutive branch can't go and negotiate a trade agreement and simply by \nsigning off on the trade agreement change an existing law without the \napproval of the Congress.\n  Now, proclamation authority for the President, which had been used in \nthe reciprocal trade agreements for tariffs, did not extend to \nauthority to proclaim all changes to U.S. law called for in a trade \nagreement.\n  Fast track was a procedure first enacted by Congress in the Trade Act \nof 1974 to deal with trade agreements that called for changes in U.S. \nlaw. What fast track provided for was a commitment by the Congress \nbefore the negotiations started that whenever an agreement came back \nfrom the trade negotiations, the executive branch could write \nlegislation implementing the trade agreement and have that legislation \nvoted on by the Congress without any opportunity to change or amend it. \nIn other words, it had to be voted as presented by the administration. \nOnly 20 hours of debate are allowed and a floor vote must take place \nwithin 60 days after the legislation is submitted.\n  Now, since its initial enactment, fast-track authority has been \nutilized for five trade agreements: The GATT Tokyo round agreement of \n1979; the United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement of 1985; the United \nStates-Canada Free Trade Agreement of 1988; the North American Free \nTrade Agreement, NAFTA, 1993; and the GATT Uruguay round of 1994. Fast-\ntrack authority expired in December 1994 at the conclusion of the \nUruguay round and has not been extended since, and the Congress is now \nconfronting that question.\n  Now, over that same period of time, hundreds of trade agreements were \nreached by U.S. administrations. Hundreds of agreements were reached. \nOther countries were prepared to enter into them, and they did not \nrequire fast track and were not submitted under fast-track authority to \nthe Congress.\n  Now, in examining this grant of authority, I first want to differ \nwith one of the assertions that is made by its supporters that the \nexecutive branch would not be able to negotiate trade agreements if \nthose agreements were subject to amendment by the Congress. That is the \nargument that is made. Unless we have this authority, we won't be able \nto negotiate agreements. As I have already indicated, the vast majority \nof trade agreements do not require changes to U.S. law and do not \nutilize fast-track procedures, and the successive administrations have \nbeen able to negotiate such agreements without any apparent significant \ndifficulty.\n  Now, the very idea that the Congress should, in effect, delegate to \nthe executive branch the authority to write changes in U.S. law and not \nhave those changes subject to modification or amendment by the Congress \nrepresents an extraordinary grant of authority by the Congress to the \nExecutive. My very distinguished colleague, Senator Byrd of West \nVirginia, spoke to this issue eloquently earlier in this debate, \npointing out what a derogation of authority this represents from the \nlegislative to the executive branch.\n\n  It is my own view that if changes are going to be made in U.S. \nstatutes, those changes ought to be subject to the scrutiny of the \nCongress and amendment by the Congress. That is the role the Congress \nis given under the Constitution. Failure to provide for that \ncongressional role, for that discipline, may leave the American people \nwithout any recourse to change unwise agreements entered into by the \nExecutive.\n  Who is to say that all of the particular decisions made by the \nExecutive in reaching an agreement are the right ones, or that the \nbalance struck by the Executive is the right one? Is the Congress, \nthen, simply to have to take this package and consider it as an all-or-\nnothing proposition? That is not what the Constitution calls for, and I \ndon't think Congress ought to be delegating this authority.\n  I recognize that a stronger case can be made for the availability of \nfast-track authority to approve large multilateral trade agreements \ninvolving well over 100 countries, like the Uruguay round of the GATT \nand bilateral trade agreements like NAFTA. There is a plausible \nargument that concluding\n\n[[Page S11659]]\n\nsuch multilateral agreements might be complicated by the ability of \nindividual countries, then, to make legislative changes in the \nagreement. That argument has been asserted and, on occasion, recognized \nby Members of the Congress. However, I point out that argument loses \nany persuasive weight when only two or a few countries are involved in \nthe trade agreement. This legislation makes no such distinction between \nmultilateral and bilateral trade agreements and would provide fast \ntrack for both.\n  It is worth noting that all major U.S. tax, arms control, \nterritorial, defense, and other treaties are done through normal \nconstitutional congressional procedures. We negotiated an arms control \nagreement with the Soviet Union. What can be more important? It is \nsubmitted to the Senate for approval. The Senate has the authority, if \nit chooses to do so, to amend that agreement. There is no fast track on \nan agreement far more important than trade agreements, involving the \nnational security of our country, where they say to the Senate, ``You \nmust approve this arms control agreement exactly as it was negotiated \nby the administration, and you can only vote for it or against it.'' We \nhave never accepted that.\n  The argument will be made at the time, ``Don't amend it because we \ndon't want to have to go back and have to renegotiate,'' but clearly \nour power to amend it is recognized and it is submitted to us under \nthose terms.\n  Now, if the agreement can withstand the scrutiny as to why it ought \nnot to be amended, then it should not be amended. But to bind ourselves \nin advance that we will only vote it up or down, without the \nopportunity to amend it, is to give away a tremendous grant of \nlegislative authority.\n  Among the nontrade treaties done under regular procedures during the \n1970's, 1980's and 1990's are the Nuclear Weapons Reduction Treaty, \nSALT I, SALT II, START, Atmospheric Test Ban Treaty, Biological Weapons \nConvention, the Customs Harmonization Convention, dozens of \ninternational tax treaties, Airline Landings Rights Treaty, Convention \non International Trade and Endangered Species, Montreal protocol, Ozone \nTreaty, and on and on and on and on.\n  No one said at the time that the Congress can only consider these to \nvote yes or no, without the power and authority to amend them; and no \none said that unless you give us such a grant of authority, we won't be \nable to negotiate these treaties.\n  Now let's turn for a moment and examine the question of what benefits \nhave we received from this extraordinary grant of authority to the \nexecutive embodied in the fast-track procedures. The fact of the matter \nis--and I am not necessarily asserting that, because the time period \ncorresponds, the whole cause was fast-track authority--but since fast-\ntrack authority was first granted by the Trade Act of 1974, there has \nbeen a sharp deterioration in the U.S. balance of trade with the rest \nof the world. During the period 1945 to 1975, the United States \ngenerally enjoyed a positive balance of trade with the rest of the \nworld, running for most of the time a modest surplus. Since then, the \nU.S. balance of trade has sharply declined.\n  Now, I first want to show a chart that shows the merchandise trade, \ngoods traded.\n  What this chart shows, Mr. President, is this. It begins back in the \nlate 1940's and it comes through to the present day. This is our \nmerchandise trade deficit. We ran a modest but positive balance \nthroughout the 1940's, 1950's, 1960's, and into the 1970's. Here about \n1975, this trade balance begins to deteriorate, and it's now down here \nat $200 billion a year. In fact, from 1948 until 1970, we had a \npositive merchandise trade balance in each and every year. In 1971 and \n1972, we had a slight minus, but it was back positive in 1973, minus in \n1974, positive in 1975; and since 1975, every year we have had a \nnegative merchandise trade balance. We have been in deficit on our \nmerchandise trade balance.\n  Listen to the numbers. I will just take a few of them. It was $28 \nbillion in 1977. In 1984, it jumped to $106 billion. It was $152 \nbillion in 1987. It dropped back down; it was down to $84 billion in \n1992. It went back up. In the last 4 years, it was $115 billion, $150 \nbillion, $158 billion, and $168 billion--negative trade deficits.\n  Now, this incredible deterioration in the merchandise trade balance \nwas offset somewhat--by no means anywhere near entirely, but it was \noffset somewhat, to give a full picture--by an improvement in our \nservices trade balance. Again, that had run in balance more or less all \nthe way, and we have had an improvement here, as you can see, over the \nlast few years.\n  The total trade deficits--in other words, adding the two together--\nhowever, continues to show a deterioration in the U.S. economic \nposition. This is what has happened to the total trade balance. We are \nrunning along here more or less with a positive balance, and then we \nhave had this deterioration in the trade balance. During the first 9 \nmonths of 1997, the United States has been running a trade deficit that \nis outpacing the 1996 rate. The cumulative U.S. trade deficit from 1974 \nto 1996, according to the Congressional Research Service, is $1.8 \ntrillion. Let me repeat that. The cumulative U.S. trade deficit from \n1974 to 1996 is $1.8 trillion. The cumulative current account deficits, \nwhen you offset the surface improvement during that period, is $1.5 \ntrillion.\n  We are running these enormous deficits. This is what we ought to be \ndebating. One argument to turn down this fast-track authority is in \norder to precipitate a national debate on what our trade policy ought \nto be and what our trade position is. We have been running these huge \ntrade deficits year in and year out. I defy anyone to assert that that \nis a desirable thing to do--to run trade deficits of the kind and \nmagnitude that we are talking about here--$1.5 trillion over the last \n22 years.\n\n  What these mounting trade deficits have done, which have persisted \nover this 20-year period, is they have resulted in the accumulation of \nU.S. foreign debt obligations that will approach $1 trillion by the end \nof this year--$1 trillion in foreign debt obligations. The fact of the \nmatter is that our trade deficits over the last 15 years have moved the \nUnited States from being the largest creditor nation in the world in \n1981 to being the largest debtor nation in the world in 1996. And this \ndebtor status is continuing to deepen. Let me repeat that. These large \ntrade deficits that we have run successively over the last 20 years \nhave moved the United States from being the largest creditor nation in \nthe world in 1981 to being the largest debtor nation in the world in \n1996. Just think of that. We have gone from being the largest creditor \nnation to being the largest debtor nation. And then everyone is saying \nthat the trade policy is a source of great strength. How can it be a \nsource of great strength when we are getting deeper and deeper into the \nhole as a debtor?\n  This development has raised concerns about the ability of the United \nStates to finance the debt. These are claims that foreigners hold on \nus. For example, Lester Thurow, in his recent book ``The Future of \nCapitalism'' wrote:\n\n       No country, not even one as big as the United States, can \n     run a trade deficit forever.\n       Money must be borrowed to pay for the deficit, and money \n     must be borrowed to pay interest on the borrowings. Even if \n     the annual deficit does not grow, interest payments will grow \n     until they are so large that they cannot be financed. At some \n     point world capital markets will quit lending to Americans \n     and Americans will run out of assets foreigners want to buy.\n\n  Now, I am not suggesting that all of the blame for this ought to be \nlaid on fast-track authority. There is a complex factor. But what I am \nsuggesting is that contrary to the constant assertions, it cannot be \nshown by the statistics that fast-track authority has had a positive \nimpact on the U.S. balance of trade. That is what we should be \ndebating. We ought to be debating why is this happening? What can be \ndone about it? What does it do to the United States to become the \nworld's largest debtor country?\n  Now, in many respects the assertion that fast track is needed in \norder to resolve some of our trade problems, I think, misses the mark. \nLet me give you a very clear example. The United States bilateral trade \ndeficit with China in 1996 was $40 billion, second only to our trade \ndeficit with Japan, and that trade deficit is continuing to deteriorate \nin 1997. In other words, the figures for 1997 will be more than the\n\n[[Page S11660]]\n\n$40 billion figure for the 1996 trade deficit with China. Resolving our \ntrade deficit with China does not require fast-track procedures. It \nrequires a determined effort by our Government to address the type of \nproblem described in a recent Washington Post article entitled, ``China \nPlays Rough: Invest and Transfer Technology or No Market Access.''\n  ``China Plays Rough: Invest and Transfer Technology or No Market \nAccess.''\n  That article describes how China forces United States companies to \ntransfer jobs and technology as a price for getting export sales. That \nis the so-called offsets issue. Of course, what we are doing is to gain \na temporary, momentary advantage we are giving away the long run. In \nother words, because of this requirement, companies come in. In order \nto get some exports now, they transfer the technology and make the \ninvestments in China which will guarantee that they will get no exports \nin the future. And the Chinese are requiring that as part of the trade \nnegotiation.\n  Those are the kinds of issues we ought to be addressing here. That is \na serious issue. And that has very severe and consequential long-term \nimplications.\n  The ongoing deterioration in the international position of the United \nStates should raise fundamental questions about our trade posture. I \ndefy anyone to look at these charts and this movement in terms of our \ntrade balance and not conclude that we are facing a serious problem \nhere.\n  I am frank to tell you, I think those agreements ought to come to the \nCongress and let the Congress scrutinize them. The Executive makes \nthese agreements. They develop the package. They do all the tradeoffs. \nThey say, if it goes to the Congress, there will be all kinds of \ntradeoffs, as if there are no tradeoffs downtown, as if the Executive \nis not engaged in all sorts of tradeoffs. Who is to say that their \ntradeoffs better serve the public national interests of the country \nthan the judgments or decisions that Congress would make?\n  Recently, Kenneth Lewis, the retired chief executive of a shipping \ncompany in Portland, OR, and a member of the Presidential Commission on \nUnited States Pacific Trade and Investment Policy, wrote an article in \nthe New York Times. In that article, he called for a significant dialog \non U.S. trade policy and the establishment of a permanent commission \ncharged with developing plans to end in the next 10 years our huge and \ncontinuing trade deficits. In fact, Senators Byrd and Dorgan and I have \nsponsored legislation to establish such a commission. In his article \nMr. Lewis wrote:\n\n       Full discussion is needed on questions like: What is the \n     purpose of our trade policy and what do we want our domestic \n     economy to look like? Who gains and who loses, and to what \n     extent, from the increases in exports and the greater \n     increases in imports?\n\n  The greater increases in imports, what this chart says. See, everyone \ncomes in, and they say, well, we are going to be able to increase our \nexports. Everyone says, well, that's a wonderful thing. No one looks at \nthe other side of the ledger, which is this incredible increase which \nhas taken place in imports and, therefore, the deteriorating economic \nposition of the United States as we run these very large trade \ndeficits--$1.5 trillion deficits since 1974, and because of that the \nUnited States, which has been the world's largest creditor nation into \nthe 1970's--and we even survived up to 1980 because we had a creditor \nposition before it was worked down. Eventually it was worked down. At \nthe end of this year we will be a $1 trillion debtor, with every \nindication that it will continue on out into the future--continue on \nout into the future.\n  Let me go back to this quote from Mr. Lewis:\n\n       Full discussion is needed on questions like: What is the \n     purpose of our trade policy and what do we want our domestic \n     economy to look like? Who gains and who loses, and to what \n     extent, from the increases in exports and the greater \n     increases in imports? Do American workers benefit, or only \n     consumers and investors? What conditions must exist--\n     concerning human rights, workers rights, or environmental \n     protections--for us to allow other nations' goods to enter \n     our country?\n\n  These strike me as the fundamental questions that we are failing to \nask about our trade policy, and fast track is not an answer to any of \nthose questions. What we really should do here is not do the fast \ntrack. Launch a major debate on our trade policy, a major examination \nof the trade figures and a major consideration of why the United States \nis running these large trade deficits. I defy anyone to come to the \nfloor and suggest that running these large trade deficits is to our \nnational interest, that that is a positive situation. It is clearly not \na positive situation.\n  Throughout this whole period we ran modest but positive trade \nbalances. In fact, many have said that the United States purposely \ntried to hold down its positive trade balances in order to help the \nrest of the world develop subsequent to World War II. So we ran these \nmodest but positive trade balances, and beginning in the mid-1970's--\ncoincidentally, as I said, about the time we started doing fast-track \nauthority--we began to get this deterioration. That's in the overall \ntrade balance.\n  In the merchandise trade balance, the deterioration was absolutely \ndramatic, as I have indicated earlier. We just had an incredible \ndeterioration in the goods balance, as we can see by this chart here. \nThis is about a $1.8 trillion deterioration in the trade. Now, it is \nsomewhat offset a bit by the improvement in the service balance. But \nthe net figure comes out to show this figure on total trade balance.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is really difficult to comprehend how much a trillion \ndollars is. And the distinguished Senator has pointed to the trade \ndeficit that our country has been running. And he said that up until \nthe early part of the 1980's our country was a creditor Nation, the \nforemost creditor Nation on Earth. And that during the 1980's it became \na debtor Nation, to the tune of $1 trillion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Now we are at a trillion. Each year, if you add $100 \nbillion, $125 billion, $150 billion, if you run a deficit that year at \n$100 billion to $150 billion, that is another $100 billion or $150 \nbillion you add to your debtor status. So, unless you get out of this \nstatus, you are continuing to worsen your position and get deeper and \ndeeper into the hole. What it means to be in a debtor status is that \nothers abroad have claims on us. When we were a creditor Nation we had \nclaims on them. Now they have claims on us. I submit that is a \nweakening, that is a deterioration of the U.S. economic position.\n  Then they will come along and say, ``Well, the economy is working \nwell.'' The economy is working well now. There is no question about it. \nBut the one thing we have not straightened out or addressed are these \nconstant trade deficits which get us deeper and deeper into the hole. \nOthers continue to finance us. But you wonder how long they are going \nto go on doing it. And even if they continue to do it, we nevertheless \nare more and more at their mercy.\n  I mean we are depending on the good will of strangers, is what it \namounts to, on the economic front. And I am just saying --now, if you \ndidn't have fast track, would you correct it? Well, I don't know. At \nleast the agreements would be subjected to a much closer scrutiny. In \nany event, we could turn our attention to finding out what the factors \nare that cause this.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. I compliment the Senator on the presentation that he is \nmaking and on his charts. It is amazing, when one contemplates that, if \none were to count a trillion dollars at the rate of $1 per second, it \nwould require 32,000 years to count a trillion dollars. It is pretty \namazing. The Senator and his charts point to the road that we are \ntraveling. I thank the Senator for his fine statement. He has been a \nstudent of this matter for many years and on his committee, the Joint \nEconomic Committee, I believe it is, he has accumulated a tremendous \namount of knowledge in this respect. I thank him for his presentation. \nI hope that Senators who are not here will take the time to read it in \ntomorrow's Record.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I appreciate the comments of my distinguished \ncolleague.\n\n[[Page S11661]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have one final point I want to make and that is on \nthis matter of protection for workers' rights, health and safety \nstandards, and environmental standards.\n  Actually, in many respects, this legislation is weaker than the \nlegislation which last reauthorized fast track in 1988 in these areas. \nThe administration has come in today with a number of so-called \ninitiatives and I am sure we will see more tomorrow, more the next day, \nand so forth. But, as I read them, none of those initiatives go right \nto the heart of the fast-track negotiating process in terms of what the \nnegotiating goals should be. Let me just point out that under this \nlegislation, we drastically limit the extent to which workers' rights, \nhealth and safety standards, and environmental protection are addressed \nin the principal negotiating objectives of the fast-track authority. \nThe fast-track authority sets out principal negotiating objectives. And \nit is those objectives that describe the subject matter of trade \nagreements which are covered by fast-track procedure.\n  My very able colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, made this \npoint in a very careful and thoughtful way. The bill states that the \nprincipal negotiating objectives with respect to labor, health and \nsafety, or environmental standards only include foreign government \nregulations and other government practices, ``including the lowering of \nor derogation from existing labor, health and safety or environmental \nstandards for the purpose of attracting investment or inhibiting U.S. \nexports.''\n  ``The lowering of or derogation from existing * * * standards. * * \n*'' Thus the bill would not allow for fast track-consideration of \nprovisions to improve labor, environmental and health and safety \nstandards in other countries. It, in effect, says they can't lower it. \nBut it says nothing about improving it. And one of the problems, of \ncourse, that we face is that environmental standards, workers' \nstandards, health and safety standards in other countries are \ncompletely inadequate and we are in that competitive environment.\n  The principal negotiating objectives, which are what the implementing \nlegislation has to be limited to, leave no room for provisions that are \noutside a very narrow range, strictly needed to implement the trade \nagreement. So this provision, despite these assurances now which are \ncoming in, all of which are unilateral assurances by the executive \nbranch and not included in the negotiating objectives, would be \nincluded within the fast-track authority. So we are not even going to \nbe able to start addressing this very serious and severe question about \nthe discrepancy between workers' standards, environmental standards, \nand health and safety standards--between what exists in this country \nand what exists with a number of our competitors.\n  What is the answer to that? Are we simply going to accept these lower \nstandards, many of which result in lower costs, and then continue to \nexperience these growing trade deficits? Are we going to lower our own \nstandards, when clearly we put them into place because we perceive that \nthey are necessary in order to deal with the sort of problems at which \nthey are directed, when we are trying to get the rest of the world to \ncome up not to go down? These are many of the questions that I think \nneed to be addressed on the trade issue.\n  Very quickly in summary, the fast-track authority represents a \ntremendous derogation of the power of the Congress. The Constitution \ngives us the power to regulate foreign commerce and we ought to \nexercise that power. We do very serious consequential arms control \nagreements that are open to amendment when they come to the floor of \nthe Senate. We may not amend them. We may decide not to amend them. But \nwe don't give away or forswear the power to do so. I don't see why we \nshould give away or forswear that power when it comes to trade \nagreements.\n  Of course we have had this incredible deterioration in our trade \nsituation. That is the issue that ought to be addressed. It would serve \neveryone's purpose if we rejected the fast-track authority and then \nprovoked or precipitated, as a consequence, a major national debate \nwith respect to trade policy. It is constantly asserted--I understand \nthe economic theory for free trade and I don't really differ with it, \nalthough I do submit to you that many of the countries with which we \nare engaged in trade are not practicing free trade. They are not \nplaying according to the rules. They are manipulating the rules to \ntheir own advantage and to our disadvantage--witness these. In many \ninstances the consequence of that is to contribute to these very large \ntrade deficits. But those are the matters that we ought to be debating. \nWe ought to have a full-scale examination of that and the Congress \nought not to give away its ability to be a full partner in developing \nand formulating trade policy. This proposal that is before us, in \neffect, requires the Congress to give up a significant amount of its \nauthority in reviewing trade agreements. I think, therefore, they don't \nget the kind of scrutiny which they deserve.\n  The examination is always on one side. It says, we will get these \nadditional exports. No one looks at what is going to happen on the \nimport side and what the balance will be between the two.\n  As a consequence of not examining the balance, we have had this \nincredible deterioration. We used to not do that. We used to have in \nmind the fact there was a balance and that it was important to us. We \nsought to sustain that balance, as this line indicates. We held that \nline for 25 years after World War II. Since then, we have gone into \nthis kind of decline, and I, for one, think it is time to address that \nproblem. I think the way to begin is not to grant this fast-track \nauthority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11632-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Background and Purpose of this Rulemaking\n       The background and purpose of this rulemaking were \n     described in detail in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     published by the Board on September 9, 1997, at 143 Cong. \n     Rec. S9014 (daily ed. Sept. 9, 1997) (``NPRM''), and will be \n     summarized here briefly. The CAA, enacted on January 23, \n     1995, applies the rights and protections of eleven labor and \n     employment and public access laws to covered employees and \n     employing offices in the Legislative Branch. Section 204 of \n     the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec.  1314, applies the rights and \n     protections of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 \n     (``EPPA'') by providing, generally, that no employing office \n     may require a covered employee to take a lie detector test \n     where such a test would be prohibited if required by an \n     employer under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 3 of the \n     EPPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec.  2002 (1), (2), (3).\n       For most employing offices and covered employees, section \n     204 became effective on January 23, 1996, and the Board \n     published interim regulations on January 22, 1997 and final \n     regulations on April 23, 1996 to implement section 204 for \n     those offices and employees. (142 Cong. Rec. S260-62, S262-\n     70) (daily ed. Jan. 22, 1996) (Notices of Adoption of \n     Regulation and Submission for Approval and Issuance of \n     Interim Regulations); 142 Cong. Rec.

The CAA, enacted on January 23, \n     1995, applies the rights and protections of eleven labor and \n     employment and public access laws to covered employees and \n     employing offices in the Legislative Branch. Section 215 of \n     the CAA, 2 U.S.C.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I am pleased that the committee has reported favorably \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 48, expressing the sense of the Congress \nregarding proliferation of missile technology from Russia to Iran.\n  The committee held a hearing on alleged Russian ballistic missile \nproliferation activities with Iran on October 8, but the committee did \nnot hold a specific hearing on Senate Concurrent Resolution 48. The \nresolution was placed on the agenda of the committee's business meeting \nfor October 9, 1997. During the business meeting several members of the \ncommittee raised questions about the intent, scope, and implication of \nthe resolution. Desirous of maintaining consensus, I postponed \nconsideration of the resolution until the questions were answered.\n  Specifically, questions arose regarding paragraph (2) of section (1) \nof the resolution. After consultation, the sponsors and co-sponsors of \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 48 agreed with the committee that the \nresolution does not raise, suggest, or recommend reassessment of those \nprograms which are in the national security interests of the United \nStates. Accordingly, in the committee's view this interpretation \nremoves from consideration, under this resolution, any ongoing programs \nand projects currently being conducted by the United States which seek \nto reduce the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, their materials and know-how, as well as associated means \nof delivery. The resolution is also not intended to affect cooperative \nspace programs between the United States and Russia. Nor is the \nresolution intended to affect humanitarian assistance or the programs \nof the National Endowment for Democracy, which promote democracy and \nmarket economic principles. Finally, the committee intends that the \nresponsibility for making the determination regarding the adequacy of \nthe Russian response under paragraph (2) lies with the President.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, over the past few weeks, a series of \nincreasingly troubling reports have been published in the press \nindicating Iran has nearly completed development of two long-range \nmissiles that will allow it to strike targets as far away as central \nEurope. According to these press reports, Russian missile assistance \nhas been the critical factor that has enabled Tehran's missile program \nto make such rapid progress.\n  In order to halt this dangerous trade, Representative Harman and I \nhave introduced a bipartisan concurrent resolution expressing the sense \nof the Congress that proliferation of such technology and missile \ncomponents by Russian governmental and nongovernmental entities must \nstop. Our resolution calls on the President to use all the tools at his \ndisposal, including targeted sanctions, to end this proliferation \nthreat, if these activities do not cease.\n  I join with Representative Harman, in clarifying that this resolution \nis not intended to affect the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program or \nsimilar U.S. government projects and programs which seek to reduce the \nthreat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their \nmaterials, know-how, as well as associated means of delivery currently \nbeing conducted. But we need to be clear that those individuals who \nproliferate will be penalized with the tools the U.S. has available.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator. I think we both agree that the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their materials, known-\nhow, as well as associated means of delivery might very well be the \nnumber one national security threat facing the United States.\n  As the Senator knows, when his resolution was raised at the Committee \non Foreign Relations business meeting on October 9, 1997, I was \nconcerned about the meaning of paragraph (2) of section (1). Paragraph \n(2) of section (1) states that: ``if the Russian response in \ninadequate'' to Presidential demands that the Russian Government take \nconcrete actions to stop governmental and nongovernmental entities from \nproviding ballistic missile technology and technical advice to Iran, \n``the United States should impose sanctions on the responsible Russian \nentities in accordance with Executive Order 12938 on the Proliferation \nof Weapons of Mass Destruction, and reassess cooperative activities \nwith Russia.''\n  I was joined by several colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee \nwho were also unsure of the intent of the Senator's language as well as \nthe definition of the term ``cooperative activities''. As the Senator \nknows, many of our colleagues in Congress and in the executive branch \nbelieve that our ongoing cooperative efforts with Russia to dismantle, \neliminate, destroy, and convert weapons of mass destruction, their \nmaterials, know-how, as well as associated means of delivery is vital \nof the national security interests of the United States. In particular, \nI am proud of the steps of our Department of Defense, Department of \nEnergy and other executive agencies have made in reducing the threats \nto the United States from weapons and materials of mass destruction.\n  I thank the Senator for taking the time to contact me personally and \nfor\n\n[[Page S11665]]\n\nworking with me to ensure that this resolution does not have the \nunintended consequence of calling in question these critical national \nsecurity programs. I believe the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, \nthe Department of Energy's Material Protection Control and Accounting \nProgram, and others have played and will continue to play a critical \nrole in serving the national security interests of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana and I assure \nhim that I support the Committee's report language which removes from \nconsideration, under this resolution, any ongoing programs and projects \nwhich seek to reduce the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, their materials, and know-how; as well as cooperative \nspace programs between the United States and Russia and the programs of \nthe National Endowment for Democracy which promote democracy and market \neconomic principles in Russia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11664-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A+ EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nCoverdell A+ education accounts, offered in legislation by my colleague \nthe Senator from Georgia. This legislation would allow parents to \ncontribute up to $2,500 per child to an education savings account, in \nwhich it would accrue tax-exempt interest that could be used for K-12 \neducation expenses.\n  Each year, Mr. President, we are bombarded with statistics showing \nthat our children are losing ground academically.\n  Each year, colleges and universities spend millions on remedial \neducation for children entering their halls without the basic skills \nnecessary to succeed in their courses.\n  Fully 60 percent of our 17-year-olds are not reading at grade level. \nThey are unprepared to take their place in a college classroom, or in \nthe many skilled occupations that literally make our country work. It \nis painfully clear, in my view, that something must be done to improve \nthe quality of our K-12 education.\n  We spend more money per child than nearly any other industrialized \nnation. But, tragically, half of American children cannot meet minimum \nstandards in reading and math.\n  The problem with our schools is not how much money we are spending on \nthem. It is how that money is being spent--and even more importantly \nwho is deciding how that money will be spent.\n  Too many decisions regarding our children's education are being made \nby bureaucrats in Washington and too few by parents. Thus too much \nmoney is being spent on bureaucrats and Washington-knows-best \nregulations, and too little on meeting the real educational needs of \nour children.\n  Mr. President, Michigan does not need Federal programs and Beltway \nbureaucrats to improve our education system; we need more power in the \nhands of our parents.\n  Teachers, principals, and school boards also are crucial to educating \nour children. But we must not forget that every child's most important, \nextensive, and fundamental education takes place in the home and must \nbe guided by the principles and habits established there.\n  Every day parents educate children--helping with homework, looking \nover tests, and providing the love and support that foster successful \nintellectual, moral, and spiritual growth. No Washington program can \nprovide this nurturing. And this makes it our duty to increase parents' \npower and resources as they seek to steer their children to successful \nand responsible adulthood.\n  During the balanced budget debate, Congress focused a great deal of \nattention on loans and other assistance for higher education. But while \nthe availability and quality of higher education should be an issue of \ntremendous concern for our Nation, it becomes a moot point if children \ndo not receive the education they need in elementary and secondary \nschool.\n  During consideration of the Taxpayer Relief Act last summer, Congress \ndebated legislation allowing parents to set up an education savings \naccount to help pay tuition and other expenses at public or private \ncolleges.\n  Senator Coverdell offered an amendment to that provision, allowing \nthe funds to also be used for K-12 education expenses. This amendment \npassed the Senate but, regrettably, was taken out during conference due \nto a threatened veto by the President.\n  Thankfully, the Senator from Georgia has reintroduced his amendment \nas a free-standing bill. In doing so, he has forced Congress to address \nthe critical question of what we can do to support parents as they \nstruggle to provide the best education possible for their children.\n  Senator Coverdell's legislation is an important step in the right \ndirection because it provides parents greater opportunity to save and \ninvest in not only their child's higher education, but in their child's \nelementary and secondary education as well.\n  Specifically, the Coverdell A+ accounts bill expands the use of \neducation savings accounts to include expenses related to elementary \nand secondary education at public, private, or religious schools and \nhomeschools.\n  Parents may withdraw from the account to pay for tuition, fees, \ntutoring, special needs services, books, supplies, computer equipment \nand software, transportation, and supplementary expenses.\n  This legislation provides parents with a wide variety of \nopportunities to supplement their child's education. Some parents may \nchoose a private or specialized education setting for their child.\n  For children attending public school, parents can use the money for \ntutoring or transportation costs. For parents of a child with special \nneeds, the money could be used for tutoring or other personalized \nservices.\n  Put simply, the Coverdell A+ accounts bill provides parents with more \noptions to meet the educational needs of their children at an early \nage. And this improved education will produce better opportunities for \ntheir children throughout their lives.\n  Mr. President, the education savings account proposal for higher \neducation passed Congress overwhelmingly, and was supported by the \nPresident. It is simply irrational to oppose the same concept for \nelementary and secondary education.\n  For all the reasons Congress supported investing in higher education, \nCongress must support investing in elementary and secondary education. \nBoth proposals are based on a sound principle, that parents should plan \nfor the long-term educational needs of their children. The Coverdell \nproposal allows parents to do that from the moment their child enters \nelementary school until that child graduates from college.\n  In my view, Mr. President, there is no reason to oppose A+ accounts \non the grounds that they would provide Federal support to religious \nschools.\n  Right now, today, Federal funds in the form of student loan \nguarantees and other assistance are helping thousands of college \nstudents attend religious colleges. I have heard no serious objections \nto this practice, and I am glad for that.\n  There is no reason to discriminate against students choosing to \nattend Catholic University, Notre Dame, Calvin College, or any of the \nmany other fine religious colleges in America.\n  By the same token, however, there is no sound reason for objecting to \nstudents and their parents who choose to attend primary and secondary \nschools with religious affiliations.\n  Likewise, Mr. President, I see no basis for the charge that A+ \naccounts will starve our public schools of needed funds. No provision \nin this legislation will cost public schools so much as one thin dime.\n  Rather, A+ accounts will bring significant benefits to our public \nschools. We should keep in mind, for example, that fully 70 percent of \nthe children whose parents will receive benefits under this legislation \nattend public school. The extra help in the form of tutors, computers \nand other aids that the children will receive thanks to A+ accounts \nwill make them better students and enhance the learning experience for \nall children in those schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11665-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11665-S11666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE KIRKS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

I have also prohibited \ncertain transactions, including the following: (1) the importation into \nthe United States of any goods or services of Sudanese origin, other \nthan information or informational materials; (2) the exportation or \nreexportation to Sudan of any nonexempt goods, technology, or services \nfrom the United States; (3) the facilitation by any United States \nperson of the exportation or reexportation of goods, technology, or \nservices from Sudan to any destination, or to Sudan from any \ndestination; (4) the performance by any United States person of any \ncontract, including a financing contract, in support of an industrial, \ncommercial, public utility, or governmental project in Sudan; (5) the \ngrant or extension of credits or loans by any United States person to \nthe Government of Sudan; and (6) any transaction by any United States \nperson relating to transportation of cargo to, from, or through Sudan, \nor by Sudanese vessel or aircraft.\n  We intend to license only those activities that serve U.S. interests. \nTransactions necessary to conduct the official business of the United \nStates Government and the United Nations are exempted. This order and \nsubsequent licenses will allow humanitarian, diplomatic, and \njournalistic activities to continue. Other activities may be considered \nfor licensing on a case-by-case basis based on their merits. We will \ncontinue to permit regulated transfers of fees and stipends from the \nGovernment of Sudan to Sudanese students in the United States. Among \nthe other activities we may consider licensing are those permitting \nAmerican citizens resident in Sudan to make payments for their routine \nliving expenses, including taxes and utilities; the importation of \ncertain products unavailable from other sources, such as gum arabic; \nand products to ensure civilian aircraft safety.\n  I have decided to impose comprehensive sanctions in response to the \nSudanese government's continued provision of sanctuary and support for \nterrorist groups, its sponsorship of regional insurgencies that \nthreaten neighboring governments friendly to the United States, its \ncontinued prosecution of a devastating civil war, and its abysmal human \nrights record that includes the denial of religious freedom and \ninadequate steps to eradicate slavery in the country.\n  The behavior of the Sudanese government directly threatens stability \nin the region and poses a direct threat to the people and interests of \nthe United States. Only a fundamental change in Sudan's policies will \nenhance the peace and security of people in the United States, Sudan, \nand around the world. My Administration will continue to work with the \nCongress to develop the most effective policies in this regard.\n  The above-described measures, many of which reflect congressional \nconcerns, will immediately demonstrate to the Sudanese government the \nseriousness of our concern with the situation in that country. It is \nparticularly important to increase pressure on Sudan to engage \nseriously during the current round of negotiations taking place now in \nNairobi. The sanctions will also deprive the Sudanese government of the \nmaterial and financial benefits of conducting trade and financial \ntransactions with the United States.\n  The prohibitions set forth in this order shall be effective as of \n12:01 a.m., eastern standard time, November 4, 1997, and shall be \ntransmitted to the Congress and published in the Federal Register. The \nExecutive order provides 30 days in which to complete trade \ntransactions with Sudan covered by contracts that predate the order and \nthe performance of preexisting financing agreements for those trade \ninitiatives.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to limit the \namount of recoupment from veterans' disability compensation that is \nrequired in the case of veterans who have received certain separation \npayments from Department of Defense; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\n          the veterans' disability benefits relief act of 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Veterans' \nDisability Benefits Relief Act. This legislation would address an \nunfair provision that double taxes veterans who participate in military \ndownsizing programs run by the Department of Defense [DOD].\n  Mr. President, since 1991, in an effort by the DOD to downsize the \narmed services, certain military personnel have been eligible for \neither the special separation benefit [SSB] or the voluntary separation \nincentive [VSI] program. However, SSB or VSI recipients who are \nsubsequently diagnosed with a service-connected disability must offset \nthe full SSB/VSI amount paid to that individual by withholding amounts \nthat would be paid as disability compensation by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs [VA].\n  Additionally, veterans who participate in the DOD's downsizing by \nselecting an SSB lump sum payment or a VSI monthly annuity payment, are \nforced to pay back the full, pretax amount in disability compensation--\noffsetting money that the veteran would never see with or without a \nservice-connected disability. This is a gross injustice to veterans by \ndouble taxing their hard-earned compensation.\n  My bill would ease this double taxation for all members who accept an \nSSB or VSI payment package and make these alterations retroactive to \nDecember 5, 1991. Thus, service members not able to receive payment \nconcurrently since 1991 will be reimbursed for their lost compensation \nportion that was taxed. The cost of this bill was estimated by CBO to \nbe only $195 million over 25 years. This is a fraction of a percentage \nof our annual spending on compensation and benefits for former military \npersonnel. I urge Congress to correct this injustice to our Nation's \nveterans and provide these veterans with the proper compensation they \ndeserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Grams, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Burns, and \n        Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1360. A bill to amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 to clarify and improve the requirements for \nthe development of an automated entry-exit control system, to enhance \nland border control and enforcement, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           THE BORDER IMPROVEMENT AND IMMIGRATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \naddress a problem that has been attracting significant concern not only \nin my State of Michigan, but also in many other northern border States \nas well as along the southern border. This bill, entitled ``The Border \nImprovement and Immigration Act of 1997,'' will also add desperately \nneeded resources for border control and enforcement at the land \nborders.\n  I am proud to have a broad range of bipartisan support on this bill \nand to have as original cosponsors Senators Kennedy, D'Amato, Leahy, \nGrams, Dorgan, Collins, Murray, Burns, and Snowe.\n  This legislation is needed to clarify the applicability of a small \nprovision of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act--section 110 of that act. That section requires the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to develop, by September 30, \n1998, an automated entry and exit system to document the entry and \ndeparture of every alien arriving in and leaving the United States. \nWhile that may sound straightforward enough, the truth is that there \ncould be disastrous consequences if this is not amended to conform with \nCongress' intent and to provide a sensible approach to automated entry-\nexit control.\n  The problem is that the term ``every alien'' could be interpreted to \ninclude Canadians who cross our northern land border--and in fact to \ninclude all aliens crossing the land borders and many aliens entering \nelsewhere who are currently exempt from filling out immigration forms. \nWe could literally end up with intolerable backlogs and delays at the \nland borders and could end up creating a conflict with current \ndocumentary requirements, such as our practice of not requiring \nCanadians to present a passport, visa or border-crossing identification \ncard to enter the United States for short-term visits.\n  The potential problems here are generating great concern. The United \nStates Ambassador to Canada wrote to me on October 14, for example, \nthat he\n\n[[Page S11679]]\n\nis deeply concerned about this issue and noted that ``section 110 is \ninconsistent with the concerted efforts the United States and Canada \nhave made in recent years to improve and simplify cross-border traffic \nflows.'' The Canadian Ambassador to the United States expressed similar \nconcerns to me when I met with him last month. I recently chaired a \nfield hearing of the Immigration Subcommittee on this issue in Detroit, \nMI, at which elected officials and industry representatives testified \nabout the unprecedented traffic congestion, decreased trade, lost \nbusiness and jobs, and harm to America's international relations that \ncould result from the full implementation of section 110 in its current \nform.\n  Mr. President, this provision was not intended by the law's authors \nto have the impact I just outlined. Our former colleague, Senator Alan \nSimpson, who preceded me as chairman of the Senate Immigration \nSubcommittee, and Representative Lamar Smith, who is chairman of the \nHouse Immigration Subcommittee, wrote in a letter last year to the \nCanadian Government that they ``did not intend to impose a new \nrequirement for border crossing cards on Canadians who are not \npresently required to possess such documents.''\n  The INS appears to maintain, however, that the law as it stands does \ncall for a record of each and every noncitizen entering or leaving the \nUnited States. When you look at the text of the statute, you can \ncertainly see a basis for their view.\n  That is why I think the most sensible course here is simply to \ncorrect the statute. I should note that the administration shares our \nconcern and has already requested that Congress correct section 110 and \nclarify that it should not apply along the land borders.\n  The full implementation of section 110 would create a nightmare at \nour land borders for several reasons. First, every alien could be \nrequired to fill out immigration forms and hand them to border \ninspectors. That would create added delays at entry points into the \nUnited States, which would be intolerable. Our land border crossings \nsimply cannot support such added pressures.\n  A recent study by Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas points out \nthat traffic congestion and delays at our land borders already create \nunneeded costs and inconvenience. What we need are increased resources \nat the land borders, not increased burdens and bureaucracy.\n  Second, every alien would likewise have to hand in forms when they \nleave the United States. Our immigration officials currently inspect \nonly those entering the United States, and there are thus no inspection \nfacilities at locations where people leave the country. This means that \nnew inspections facilities would need to be built and that we would see \nsignificant increases in traffic on U.S. roads leaving the country.\n  This additional infrastructure could run into billions of dollars, \nbut the precise cost estimates are not possible at this point since we \ndo not know what technology could even make such an exit system \nfeasible. Even as a simple fiscal matter, we should not be requiring \nthe kind of investment that would be involved here without knowing what \nthe payoff, if any, will be, particularly where an undeveloped and \nuntested system is involved. Also, at many border crossings, \nparticularly on bridges or in tunnels, there simply is not room to \nconstruct additional facilities.\n  The magnitude of these problems cannot be overstated. As just one \nexample, take the northern border, with which I am most familiar.\n  In 1996 alone, over 116 million people entered the United States by \nland from Canada, over 52 million of whom were Canadians or United \nStates lawful permanent residents. The new provision would require a \nstop on the U.S. side to record the exit of every one of those 52 \nmillion people. That is more than 140,000 every day; it is more than \n6,000 every hour; and more than 100 every minute. And that is only in \none direction. The inconvenience, the traffic, and delays will be \nstaggering.\n  If uncorrected, section 110 will also have a devastating economic \nimpact. The free flow of goods and services that are exchanged every \nday through the United States and Canada has provided both countries \nwith enormous economic benefits. Trade and tourism between the two \nnations are worth $1 billion a day for the United States. Canada is not \nonly the United States' largest trading partner, but the United States-\nCanadian trading relationship is the most extensive and profitable in \nthe world.\n  My own State of Michigan has been an important beneficiary of that \nrelationship. And 46 percent of the volume and 40.6 percent of the \nvalue of United States-Canada trade crosses the Michigan-Ontario \nborder. Last year alone, exports to Canada generated over 72,000 jobs \nin key manufacturing industries in my State of Michigan and over $4.68 \nbillion in value added for the State.\n  The United States automobile industry alone conducts 300 million \ndollars' worth of trade with Canada every day. New just in time \ndelivery methods have made United States-Canadian border-crossings \nintegral parts of our automobile assembly lines. A delivery of parts \ndelayed by as little as 20 minutes can cause expensive assembly line \nshutdowns.\n  Tourism and travel industries would likewise suffer by the full \nimplementation of section 110. People in Windsor, Canada who thought \nthey would head to Detroit for a Tiger's baseball game or Red Wing's \nhockey game might think again and stay home--with their money.\n  Canadians might decide not to bother to see the American side of \nNiagara Falls, or not to go hiking or fishing in Maine. This would \nhappen all across the northern border.\n  I am beginning to hear concerns from those along the southern border \nas well, and I believe that the impact of full implementation of \nsection 110 there could be equally disastrous.\n  Congress did not intend to wreak such havoc on the borders. The fact \nis that these issues were simply not considered last Congress.\n  Section 110 was principally designed to make entry-exit control \nautomated, so that the system would function better; it was not \nintended to expand documentary requirements and immigration bureaucracy \ninto new and uncharted territory. A simple clarification of section 110 \nwill take care of these problems. At the same time, we can take steps \nto improve inspections at our borders and to begin to take a sensible \nand longer term approach to automated entry-exit control.\n  Mr. President, my legislation is quite straightforward and contains \nthree pieces.\n  First, it provides that section 110's requirement that the INS \ndevelop an automated entry-exit control system would not apply at the \nland borders, to U.S. lawful permanent residents, or to any aliens of \nforeign contiguous territory for whom the U.S. Attorney General and the \nSecretary of State have already waived visa requirements under existing \nstatutory authority. This would maintain the status quo for lawful \npermanent residents and for a handful of our neighboring territories, \nincluding Canada, whose nationals do not pose a particular immigration \nthreat and are already granted special status by the Attorney General \nand the Secretary of State.\n  As its second main provision, my legislation calls for a report on \nfull automated entry-exit control. In my view, Congress should not \nexpand entry-exit control into new territory until it has received a \nreport on what that would mean.\n  The bottom line here is that we simply do not know whether such a \nfully implemented system is feasible, how much it will cost, whether \nthe INS has the capacity and resources to use the data from such a \nsystem, and whether it might make more sense to devote our resources to \ngoing after the problem of visa overstayers in other ways.\n  Finally, my bill provides for increased personnel for border \ninspections by INS and Customs to address the backlogs and delays we \nalready have on the border. For 3 years, it would increase INS \ninspectors at the land borders by 300 per year and Customs inspectors \nat the land borders by 150 per year.\n  Mr. President, our borders are already crowded. In 1993, nearly 9 \nmillion people traveled over the Ambassador Bridge, 6.4 million \ntraveled through the Detroit-Windsor tunnel, and approximately 6.1 \nmillion crossed the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron. Even without new \ncontrols, we have unacceptable delays at many points of our borders.\n  We should alleviate the problems we already have, not make them worse \nby\n\n[[Page S11680]]\n\nadding more controls and burdens. Even in the best case scenario, the \nnew entry-exit controls might take an extra 2 minutes per border \ncrosser to fulfill. That is almost 17 hours of delay for every hour's \nworth of traffic. It's just not practical. We must act to prevent it \nfrom happening and take action to address the delays already existing \nat our borders.\n  I would also like to note that placing new entry-exit control \nrequirements on our border neighbors will do virtually nothing to catch \npeople entering our country illegally. For that, we need to improve \nborder inspections and increase resources there.\n  I do agree that automated entry-exit control certainly is needed to \nimprove upon the INS's current system, which has a poor track record of \nproviding data on visa overstayers. Having correct and usable data \nwould be extremely helpful for a number of purposes; for example, to \ndetermine whether countries should remain in the visa waiver program \nand which countries pose particular visa overstay problems.\n  However, in my view, being able to use automated entry-exit control \nas a means of going after individual visa overstayers is a long way \noff. That is why we should be cautious in our approach.\n  We need to study this problem and consider some hard questions like \nwhat we will do down the road with all this data. Do we really think \nthat the INS is currently capable of compiling and matching the data \ncorrectly or that INS has the resources to track down individuals based \non this data? Do we want to be directing the INS to use its limited \nresources in this manner?\n  I recommend that for the time being we attack the visa overstayer \nproblem by focussing on our current enforcement tools and by continuing \nthe enforcement approach taken in last year's illegal immigration \nreform bill. I supported efforts there to increase the sanctions for \nvisa overstayers and to increase the number of INS investigators \nlooking into visa overstayers.\n  But before we burden the vast majority who do not present an \nenforcement problem and before we add inconveniences and costs to our \nown citizens, we should continue to study the options for broader \nautomated entry-exit control.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation \nquickly. Tomorrow, we will be having a hearing to consider this bill \nand these issues in the Immigration Subcommittee. Given the \noverwhelming support for this along the land borders and from the \nadministration, there is no need to wait on such an important issue or \nto leave so many with uncertainty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1360\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Not less than one-half of the inspectors added under \n     the preceding sentence in each fiscal year shall be assigned \n     to the northern border of the United States.\n       (b) Increased Number of Customs Inspectors at the Land \n     Borders.--The Secretary of the Treasury in each of fiscal \n     years 1998, 1999, and 2000 shall increase by not less than \n     150 the number of full-time inspectors assigned to active \n     duty at the land borders of the United States by the Customs \n     Service, above the number of such positions for which funds \n     were made available for the preceding fiscal year. Not less \n     than one-half of the inspectors added under the preceding \n     sentence in each fiscal year shall be assigned to the \n     northern border of the United States.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I want to congratulate the chairman of the Immigration \nSubcommittee, Senator Abraham, for focusing on this issue and am \npleased to join him and my other colleagues in putting forth this \nlegislation which is aimed at correcting deficiencies that exist in the \ncurrent law.\n  Let me say I don't intend to repeat all of the arguments put forth by \nmy colleagues. But I do want to point out, very clearly, there are a \nnumber of my colleagues who are concerned about the impact of \nimplementation of this legislation.\n  We were given such assurances as it related to its enforcement--that \nthere was no intent to impose various requirements that would actually \nstop people from Canada who were coming in on a daily basis--millions \nof people, millions. In New York, 2.7 million Canadians visit for at \nleast 1 night. One bridge, the Peace Bridge, carries 80 million \ndollars' worth of goods and services between Canada and New York, my \nState. Mr. President, 80 million dollars' worth of merchandise a day.\n  It is estimated that if we impose this law that we will impose more \ntime on inspections, which is now about 30 seconds per person, and make \nthat at least 2 minutes a person. We will have traffic jams of 3, 4, 5 \nand 6 hours. We will cost American consumers hundreds and hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. We will disrupt trade. We will create an absolute \ncatastrophe at our borders.\n  Now, is that what we intend to do? If we really want to go after drug \ndealers, and that is what this intends to do, then let's go after them. \nWe know who the cartel leaders are.\n  You are going to stop millions of people on a daily basis who are \ntraveling\n\n[[Page S11681]]\n\nback and forth between Canada and the United States? That is not going \nto affect the drug trade. Who are we kidding?\n  The implementation of this would be costly because we are talking \nabout $1 billion a day in trade. That is what we are talking about, $1 \nbillion a day.\n  Senator Simpson, who was chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration \nlast year, along with Congressman Lamar Smith, chairman of the House \ncommittee, in a letter that they wrote to the Canadian Ambassador, said \nthat ``We did not intend to impose a new requirement for border \ncrossing cards * * * on Canadians who are not presently required to \npossess such documents.''\n  Mr. President, this legislation authored by Senator Abraham, and \nwhich I am very pleased to support, would exclude Canadians who are \ncurrently exempted, just like we told the Canadian Ambassador. So this \nlegislation really keeps a commitment that was made to our friends, to \nour partners in Canada, and one in which I must say is absolutely vital \nto the interests of many, many communities.\n  Let me mention a number of communities who have said if this \nlegislation is not amended, it would be disastrous: Buffalo, NY; \nSyracuse, NY; Onondaga County; Oswego County and Plattsburgh. I have to \ntell you, they have been absolutely aghast. These are just some of the \ncommunities who have written to me and expressed, by either way of \ntheir elected officials or by the various trade groups and \nrepresentatives, that this would be catastrophic. I believe they are \nright.\n  This bill will stop problems before they are created--traffic jams \nnever envisioned before, the flow of goods and services absolutely \nbrought to a stop. I don't think we should wait for the problem to take \nplace, nor do I think we can continue to abdicate our responsibility. \nAs Senator Abraham has pointed out quite eloquently, we have not gotten \nthe kind of clarification necessary that would allow the normal \nintercourse of business between our two great countries. You can't \njeopardize people's lives, the well-being of our communities and, \nindeed, our national prosperity. I am pleased to support this bill. I \nhope we can get Senator Abraham speedy action on this. I intend to \nsupport Senator Abraham in every way possible and I want to commend you \nfor having brought this to the attention of the U.S. Congress and \nputting forth legislation in such a thoughtful way.\n  Last but not least, this legislation does something that is pretty \nimportant. It calls for increasing the number of Customs and INS \ninspectors and says at least half of them have to be placed on northern \nborders. While I understand that we have some tremendous problems on \nour southern borders dealing with the flow of drugs, we cannot \nunderestimate the importance of continuing the process of commerce--in \na manner which will continue to expand upon it and not impinge upon it.\n  I thank my colleague from Michigan for being so forthright on this. I \nhope we can get this legislation passed sooner rather than later.\n  To reiterate, I am pleased to join with the chairman of the \nImmigration Subcommittee, Senator Abraham and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Kennedy, to introduce the Border Improvement and \nImmigration Act of 1997--a bill that will preserve the smooth and \nefficient trade and travel experienced between the United States and \nCanada.\n\n  A provision of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act has caused enormous trepidation among businesses and \nfamilies living along the northern border of the United States and \nCanada. Several organizations have contacted me with their concern \nabout section 110 of the 1996 act--a provision that requires ``every \nalien'' to display documents upon entry to or exit from the United \nStates.\n  To put this problem into perspective, let me explain what \nimplementation of section 110 would mean for New York State. Over 2.7 \nmillion Canadians visit New York each year for at least 1 night, \nspending over $400 million. Last year, my State's exports to Canada \nexceeded $9.5 billion and the first 6 months of 1997 has seen a rise in \nexports. The ties between the communities are strong and must not be \ndisrupted.\n  The common council of the city of Plattsburgh has submitted a \nresolution indicating the threat to the strong relationship enjoyed by \nCanada and the United States--its economic, cultural, and social \nimpact. The Greater Buffalo Partnership states that there are about \n5,000 trucks moving goods through the port of Buffalo every day that \nwill be subject to a time intensive document production under this \nprovision. They conclude that ``this provision will cause 5-hour delays \nand jeopardize every business relying on just in time deliveries.''\n  This new requirement will cause unprecedented traffic jams at the \nborder and chaos in the business and travel industry in northern New \nYork.\n  Implementation of this border restriction would be costly for both \nAmerican and Canadian business and tourism throughout both nations. \nNationally, trade with Canada hovers near $1 billion a day and there \nhas been up to 116 million people entered the United States from Canada \nin 1996. As bilateral trade grows every year, traffic congestion and \nback ups could be expected to last hours, translating into frustration \nand lost opportunities.\n  When Congress passed this law, there was no intent to impose this \nrequirement on Canadians. As expressed by Senator Alan Simpson, \nchairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration last year, and \nCongressman Lamar Smith, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on \nImmigration, in a letter to the Canadian Ambassador, ``we did not \nintend to impose a new requirement for border crossing cards * * * on \nCanadians who are not presently required to possess such documents.''\n  This new legislation will exclude Canadians, who are currently \nexempted from documentary requirements, from having to register every \narrival and departure at the United States border. Because of the \ntremendous burden of enforcement on our borders, the bill also \nauthorizes an increase of at least 300 INS inspectors and 150 Customs \ninspectors each year.\n  There is a major problem brewing on our border with Canada. It's a \nproblem that threatens vital trade and travel between our two \ncountries. This bill will halt the problem, and allow our normal trade \nand tourism to continue successfully. I am proud to lead the effort to \npass this important legislation.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, Minnesota and Michigan are two States that \nshare a common border with Canada, and so I am very proud today to join \nmy colleague, Senator Abraham, chairman of the Judiciary Immigration \nSubcommittee, as a cosponsor of his bill to ensure Canada will receive \ncurrent treatment once the immigration law is implemented in 1998. \nThere has been a great deal of concern, especially in Minnesota, as \nwell, as to how the immigration law we passed last year will affect the \nnorthern U.S. border. Right now the fear is the law is being \nmisinterpreted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  Minnesota alone has about 817 miles of shared border with Canada and \nwe share many interests with our northern neighbor--tourism, trade, and \nfamily visits among the most prevalent. In the last few years, passage \nback and forth over the Minnesota/Canadian border has been more open \nand free flowing, especially since the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement (NAFTA) went into effect. There were 116 million travelers \nentering the United States from Canada in 1996 over the land border. As \nour relationship with Canada is increasingly interwoven, we have sought \na less restrictive access to each country.\n  The immigration bill last year was intended to focus on illegal \naliens entering this country from Mexico and living in the United \nStates illegally. The new law states that ``every alien'' entering and \nleaving the United States would have to register at all the borders--\nland, sea, and air. The Immigration and Naturalization Service was \ntasked with the effort to set up automated pilot sites along the border \nto discover the most effective way to implement this law, which was to \nbecome effective on September 30, 1998.\n  The INS was quietly going about establishing a pilot site on the New \nYork State border when the reality sunk in. A flood of calls from \nconstituents came into the offices of all of us serving in Canadian \nborder states. Canadian citizens also registered opposition to this\n\n[[Page S11682]]\n\nnew restriction. It became quite clear that no one had considered how \nthe new law affected Canada. Current law already waives the document \nrequirement for most Canadian nationals, but still requires certain \ncitizens to register at border crossings. That system has worked. There \nhave been very few problems at the northern border with drug \ntrafficking and illegal aliens.\n  In an effort to resolve this situation, I have joined Senators \nAbraham, D'Amato, Collins, Snowe, Burns, Jeffords, Kennedy, Leahy, \nMoynihan, and Graham of Florida in a letter asking INS Commissioner \nMeissner for her interpretation of this law and how she expects to \nimplement it. We have not had a response to date, but the INS' previous \nreaction to this issue indicates that every alien would include both \nCanadian nationals and American permanent residents--everyone crossing \nthe border.\n  Therefore, we must make it very clear that Congress did not intend to \nimpose additional documentary requirements on Canadian nationals; \nSenator Abraham's bill will restore our intent. Our legislation, the \nBorder Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997, will not open the \nfloodgates for illegal aliens to pass through--it will still require \nthose who currently need documentation to continue to produce it and \nremain registered in a new INS system. This will allow the INS to keep \ntrack of that category of non-immigrant entering our country to ensure \nthey leave when their visas expire. Senator Abraham's bill will not \nunfairly treat our friends on the Canadian side that have been deemed \nnot to need documentation--they will still be able to pass freely back \nand forth across the border.\n  But our bill will enable us to avoid the huge traffic jams and \nconfusion which would no doubt occur if every alien was to be \nregistered in and out of the United States. Such registration would \ndiscourage trade and visits to the United States. It would delay \nshipments of important industrial equipment, auto parts services and \nother shared ventures that have long thrived along the northern border. \nIt will discourage the economic revival that northern Minnesotans are \nexperiencing, helped by Canadian shoppers and tourists.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe Congress intended to create this new \nmandate. We sought to keep illegal aliens and illegal drugs out, not \nour trading partners and visiting consumers. Through the Abraham bill, \nwe will still do that while keeping the door open to our neighbors from \nthe north. The bill is good foreign policy, good public policy and good \neconomic policy. We all will benefit while retaining our ability to \nkeep track of nonimmigrants who enter our borders.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank Senator Abraham for \nhis leadership on this very important matter. I am aware that Senator \nAbraham had a successful hearing on this issue recently in Michigan. \nMany Minnesotans, through letters, calls and personal appeals, have \nalso showed their opposition to a potential crisis. I look forward to \ntestifying before the Immigration Subcommittee hearing tomorrow and \nassisting my colleague from Michigan in his efforts to pass this bill \nbefore the 1998 implementation date. Again, this is an unacceptable \nburden on our Canadian neighbors and those who depend upon their free \naccess that effects the economics of all border states.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator \nAbraham, chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, as a cosponsor of \nlegislation to clarify the intent of Congress under section 110 of the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. He \nhas taken up this matter to clarify the intent of Congress and I \nappreciate his efforts and those of Senator Kennedy to deal with this \nexpeditiously.\n  The interest of North Dakota in this bill specifically relates to the \nimpact of imposing section 110 entry-exit requirements on the land \nborder between Canada and North Dakota. In September, I introduced \nlegislation, S. 1212, to exempt Canadian nationals from the \nrequirements of section 110. Senators Conrad, Moynihan, and Levin have \njoined me in cosponsoring the bill.\n  I have subsequently heard from small businesses not only in North \nDakota, but from New York State, Michigan, and other States. They are \nvery concerned that if Congress fails to take action to exempt Canadian \nnationals from the section 110 requirements it could have a devastating \nimpact on their businesses.\n  In 1995, Canadian visitors spent nearly $200 million in North Dakota. \nThat is one in every four total tourism dollars coming into the State \nof North Dakota. Grand Forks, ND, devastated by floods last spring, is \nseeing a return of Canadian weekend visitors. The Convention and \nVisitors Bureau there tells me that without the Canadian visitors--who \nshop there, and who stay in area motels--without the Canadian visitors \nGrand Forks may never see a full economic recovery. These visitors are \nterribly important to this city trying to make a comeback.\n  Ask any small business owner in northern North Dakota--or for that \nmatter any northern border State. We should be talking about policies \nto encourage more Canadians to visit the United States. It is incumbent \non the Senate and the House to act to exempt Canadian nationals from \nthe requirements of section 110 and to send a signal that we welcome \ntheir business.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Abraham for taking up this important \nissue at this time. I endorse the exemption of Canadian nationals from \nsection 110 requirements, and I wholeheartedly support his efforts to \nauthorize additional personnel for the northern border. The northern \nborders in particular have seen no growth in resources for some time \nnow.\n  I encourage the committee to move expeditiously to bring this bill to \nthe floor. To do so will reassure small business owners and small \ncommunities across the northern United States that we are looking out \nfor their economic interests.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to support my colleague from \nMichigan, Senator Abraham, in the introduction of the Border \nImprovement and Immigration Act of 1997. This legislation will clarify \na small provision of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act, specifically section 110. Section 110 requires the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to develop, by September 30, \n1998, an automated entry and exit control system to document the entry \nand departure of `every alien' arriving in and leaving the United \nStates.\n  This section, if not amended, would pose great hardship to Montana, \nand to most border States. The current procedure allows Canadians to \ncross the United States-Canadian border without requiring them to \npresent a passport, visa, or border-crossing identification card. This \nassists our communities, on both sides of the border, to expand their \neconomic growth. A large portion of our economic life is derived from \nthe business we have that comes from Canada, whether it be from travel, \ntourism, or regular trade. The free flow of goods and services that are \nexchanged every day through the United States and Canada has provided \nboth countries with enormous economic benefits. If not amended, this \ncould drop dramatically.\n  Congress did not intend to cause such a disruption of service when it \npassed the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Section \n110 was principally designed to make the current entry-exist control \nsystem automated--so that the system would function better; it was not \nintended to expand documentary requirements and bureaucracy. This \nlegislation will take the steps needed to insure that the law is read \nproperly. This bill would require that the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service to develop an automated entry-exit control \nsystem would not apply at the land borders, to U.S. lawful permanent \nresidents or to any nationals of foreign contiguous territory from whom \nthe Attorney General and the Secretary of State have already waived \nvisa requirements.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will review this bill and \nunderstand the merits that it provides, not only for our border States, \nbut also for the Nation. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto ensure its swift passage.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nThe Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997. This bill will \nensure that Canadians and United States permanent residents are treated \nfairly and\n\n[[Page S11683]]\n\nappropriately and that the United States and Canada's long and friendly \nrelationship regarding immigration issues is preserved.\n  We must preserve the integrity of our open border and ensure that no \nundue hassle, inconvenience, or burden is placed upon those who cross \nthe United States-Canada border. Vermont and Canada share many \ntraditions, and one that we all value is the free flow of trade and \ntourism. Ours is the longest open border in the world, and we should do \nnothing to change or endanger that relationship. On Vermont's border \nwith Canada, commerce, tourism and other exchanges across the border \nare part of our way of life. A general store in Norton, VT, on the \nborder has the separate cash registers at either end of the shop.\n  The Border Improvement Act will preserve the status quo for Canadians \nand Americans crossing the United States' northern border. It will \nensure that tourists and trade continue to be able to freely cross the \nborder, without additional documentation requirements. This bill will \nalso guarantee that the over $1 billion in daily cross-border trade is \nnot hindered in any way. The Border Improvement Act takes a more \nthoughtful approach to modifying U.S. immigration policies than last \nyear's bill, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act [IIRIRA]. By requiring the Attorney General to \nthoroughly assess the potential cost and impact before implementing any \nsort of automated entry-exit monitoring system on the Nation's land \nborders, this bill ensures that any such system will be well planned \nand implemented. Finally, the Border Improvement Act will ensure \nadequate staffing on the northern border by requiring a substantial \nincrease in the number of INS and Customs agents assigned to this \nregion over the next 3 years.\n  I am particularly pleased to see that this bill has clear bipartisan \nsupport. Last year, I worked closely with Senator Abraham to quash \nanother ill-conceived proposed addition to the immigration bill--the \nimplementation of border-crossing fees. We successfully defeated the \nfee proposal last year, but only after much debate and negotiation.\n  Unfortunately, we did not have the same opportunity to debate fully \nthe provision in section 110 of the IIRIRA which mandates that the INS \ndevelop an automated entry and exit control system to track the arrival \nand departure of all aliens at all borders by next October.\n  The current language in section 110 of the IIRIRA, as agreed to in \nlast would have a significant negative impact on trade and relations \nbetween the United States and Canada. By requiring an automated system \nfor monitoring the entry and exit of all aliens, this provision would \nrequire that the INS and Customs agents stop each vehicle or individual \nentering or exiting the United States at all ports of entry. Canadians, \nUnited States permanent residents and many others who are not currently \nrequired to show documentation of their status would either have to \ncarry some form of identification or fill out paperwork at the points \nof entry. This sort of tracking system would be enormously costly to \nimplement along the northern border, especially since there is no \ncurrent system or infrastructure to track the departure of citizens and \nothers leaving the United States. Section 110, as currently worded, \nwould also lead to excessive and costly traffic delays for those living \nand working near the border. These delays would surely have a negative \nimpact on the $2.4 billion in goods and services shipped annually from \nVermont to Canada and would likely reduce the $120 million per year \nwhich Canadians spend in Vermont.\n  This legislation has been crafted with input from the INS and \nrepresentatives of the Canadian Government. By including the \nadministration and our northern neighbor in the discussions, Senators \nAbraham and Kennedy have developed a remedy which is sure to be \nimplemented smoothly. My cosponsorship of this bill reflects my ongoing \nconcern about the negative impact the implementation of the current \nlanguage in section 110 of the IIRIRA would have on the economy in my \nhome State of Vermont, as well as in the other northern border States. \nWhile this remedy was being negotiated, I cosponsored an amendment on \nthe floor and sent letters to Attorney General Reno and INS \nCommissioner Meissner requesting that a study be undertaken before any \nsort of automated entry-exit monitoring system be implemented. I am \npleased that this bill has a similar provision. But, the Border \nImprovement Act goes one step further to protect our Canadian \nneighbors' rights to freely cross the border into the United States \nwithout facing needless traffic delays or unnecessary paperwork \nrequirements.\n  I am pleased that Senator Abraham has called a hearing tomorrow to \ndiscuss this bill and the negative impact the current law would have in \nso many of our States. At the hearing, we will hear the testimony of \nBill Stenger, the president of the Jay Peak Ski Resort in Vermont which \nis situated only a few miles from the Canadian border. Mr. Stenger will \ntestify to the disastrous effect any increased documentation \nrequirements for Canadians would have on his business, and so many \nother United States businesses which are dependent on the preservation \nof free trade and travel across the Canadian border.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1361. A bill to provide for the appointment of 1 additional \nFederal district judge for the eastern district of Wisconsin, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              THE WISCONSIN FEDERAL JUDGESHIP ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, to introduce the Wisconsin Federal \nJudgeship Act of 1997. This bill would create one additional Federal \njudgeship for the eastern district of Wisconsin and situate it in Green \nBay, where a district court is crucially needed. Let me explain how the \ncurrent system hurts--and how this additional judgeship will help--\nbusinesses, law enforcement agents, witnesses, victims, and individual \nlitigants in northeastern Wisconsin.\n  First, the four full-time district court judges for the eastern \ndistrict of Wisconsin currently preside in Milwaukee. Yet for most \nlitigants and witnesses in northeastern Wisconsin, Milwaukee is well \nover 100 miles away. Thus, litigants and witnesses must incur \nsubstantial costs in traveling from northern Wisconsin to Milwaukee--\ncosts in terms of time, money, resources, and effort. Indeed driving \nfrom Green Bay to Milwaukee takes nearly two hours each way. Add \ninclement weather or a departure point north of Green Bay--such as \nOconto or Marinette--and the driving time alone often results in \nwitnesses traveling for a far longer period of time than they actually \nspend testifying.\n  Second, Mr. President, as Attorney General Janet Reno recently noted \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, Federal crimes remain unacceptably high \nin northeastern Wisconsin. These crimes range from bank robbery and \nkidnaping to Medicare and Medicaid fraud. However, without the \nappropriate judicial resources, a crackdown on Federal crimes in the \nupper will be made enormously more difficult.\n  Third, many manufacturing and retail companies are located in \nnortheastern Wisconsin. These companies often require a Federal court \nto litigate complex price-fixing, contract, and liability disputes with \nout-of-State businesses. But the sad truth is that many of these cases \nare never even filed--precisely because the northern part of the State \nlacks a Federal court. Mr. President, this hurts businesses not only in \nWisconsin, but across the Nation.\n  Fourth, prosecuting cases on the Menominee Indian Reservation creates \nspecific problems that alone justify having a Federal judge in Green \nBay. Under current law, the Federal Government is required to prosecute \nall felonies committed by Indians that occur on the Menominee \nReservation. The reservation's distance from the Federal prosecutors \nand courts--more than 150 miles--makes these prosecutions problematic. \nAnd because the Justice Department compensates attorneys, \ninvestigators, and sometimes witnesses for travel expenses, the \nexisting system costs all of us. In addition, Mr. President, we saw \njuvenile crime rates on this reservation rise by 279 percent last year \nalone. Without an additional judge in Green Bay, the administration\n\n[[Page S11684]]\n\nof justice, as well as the public's pocketbook, will suffer enormously.\n  Fifth, Mr. President, the creation of an additional judgeship in the \neastern district of Wisconsin is also clearly justified on the basis of \ncaseload. I have commissioned the General Accounting Office to look at \nthis issue and their report will be released early next year and which \nwe expect will confirm our belief. However, based on standards already \nestablished by the Judicial Conference, the administrative and \nstatistical arm of the Federal judiciary, an additional judgeship is \nclearly needed. In 1994, the Judicial Conference recommended the \ncreation of additional Federal judgeships on the basis of weighted \nfilings; that is, the total number of cases filed per judge modified by \nthe average level of case complexity. In 1994, new positions were \njustified where a district's workload exceeded 430 weighted filings per \njudge. On this basis, the eastern district of Wisconsin clearly merits \nan additional judgeship: it tallied more than 435 weighted filings in \n1993 and averaged 434 weighted filings per judge between 1991-93. In \nfact, though our bill would not add an additional judge in the western \ndistrict of Wisconsin, we could make a strong case for doing so because \nthe average weighted filings per judge in the western district was \nalmost as high as in the eastern district.\n  Mr. President, our legislation in simple, effective, and \nstraightforward. It creates an additional judgeship for the eastern \ndistrict, requires that one judge hold court in Green Bay, and gives \nthe chief judge of the eastern district the flexibility to designate \nwhich judge holds court there. And this legislation would increase the \nnumber of Federal district judges in Wisconsin for the first time since \n1978. During that period, more than 252 new Federal district judgeships \nhave been created nationwide, but not a single one in Wisconsin.\n  And don't take my word for it, Mr. President, ask the people who \nwould be most affected: in 1994 each and every sheriff and district \nattorney in northeastern Wisconsin urged me to create a Federal \ndistrict court in Green Bay. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nthese law enforcement officials be included in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks. I also ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Wisconsin, Tom \nSchneider, also be included. This letter expresses the support of the \nentire Federal law enforcement community in Wisconsin--including the \nFBI, the DEA, and the BATF--for the legislation we are introducing. \nThey needed this additional judicial resource in 1994, and certainly, \nMr. President, that need has only increased over the last 3 years.\n  Perhaps most important, the people of Green Bay also agree on the \nneed for an additional Federal judge, as the endorsement of our \nproposal by the Green Bay Chamber of Commerce demonstrates.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, having a Federal judge in Green Bay \nwill reduce costs and inconvenience while increasing judicial \nefficiency. But most important, it will help ensure that justice is \nmore available and more affordable to the people of northeastern \nWisconsin. As the courts are currently arranged, the northern portion \nof the eastern district is more remote from a Federal court than any \nother major population center, commercial or industrial, in the United \nStates. For these sensible reasons, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation. We hope to enact this measure, either separately or \nas a part of an omnibus judgeship bill the Judiciary Committee may \nconsider later this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1361\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \n     Eastern District of Wisconsin includes the 28 eastern-most \n     counties from Forest and Florence Counties in the north to \n     Kenosha and Walworth Counties in the south.\n       Green Bay is central to the northern part of the district \n     which includes approximately one third of the district's \n     population. Currently, all Federal District Judges hold court \n     in Milwaukee.\n       A federal court in Green Bay would make federal proceedings \n     much more accessible to the people of northern Wisconsin and \n     would alleviate many problems for citizens and law \n     enforcement. Travel time of 3 or 4 hours each way makes it \n     difficult and expensive for witnesses and officers to go to \n     court in Milwaukee. Citizen witnesses are often reluctant to \n     travel back and forth to Milwaukee. It often takes a whole \n     day of travel to come to court and testify for a few minutes. \n     Any lengthy testimony requires an inconvenient and costly \n     overnight stay in Milwaukee. Sending officers is costly and \n     takes substantial amounts of travel time, thereby reducing \n     the number of officers available on the street. Many cases \n     are simply never referred to federal court because of this \n     cost and inconvenience.\n       In some cases there is no alternative. For example, the \n     Federal government has the obligation to prosecute all felony \n     offenses committed by Indians on the Menominee Reservation. \n     Yet the Reservation's distance from the Federal Courts and \n     prosecutors in Milwaukee poses serious problems. Imagine the \n     District Attorney of Milwaukee being located in Keshena or \n     Green Bay or Marinette and trying to coordinate witness \n     interviews, case preparation, and testimony.\n       As local law enforcement officials, we try to work closely \n     with other local, state and federal agencies, and we believe \n     establishing a Federal District Court in Green Bay will \n     measurably enhance these efforts. Most important, a Federal \n     Court in Green Bay will make these courts substantially more \n     accessible to the citizens who live here.\n       We urge you to introduce and support legislation to create \n     and fund an additional Federal District Court in Green Bay.\n         Gary Robert Bruno, Shawano and Menominee County District \n           Attorney; Jay Conley, Oconto County District Attorney; \n           John DesJardins, Outagamie County District Attorney; \n           Douglas Drexler, Florence County District Attorney; Guy \n           Dutcher, Waushara County District Attorney; E.

Schneider, U.S. Attorney, Eastern District of \n         Wisconsin.\n\n       Thank you for your letter of August 8, 1994, urging the \n     creation of a Federal District Court in Green Bay. You point \n     out a number of facts in your letter:\n       (1) Although \\1/3\\ of the population of the Eastern \n     District of Wisconsin is in the northern part of the \n     district, all of the Federal District Courts are located in \n     Milwaukee.\n       (2) A federal court in Green Bay would be more accessible \n     to the people of northern Wisconsin. It would substantially \n     reduce witness travel time and expenses, and it would make \n     federal court more accessible and less costly for local law \n     enforcement agencies.\n       (3) The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over \n     most felonies committed on the Menominee Reservation, located \n     approximately 3 hours from Milwaukee. The distance to \n     Milwaukee is a particular problem for victims, witnesses, and \n     officers from the Reservation.\n       I have discussed this proposal with the chiefs of the \n     federal law enforcement agencies in the Eastern District of \n     Wisconsin, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n     Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco and Firearms, Secret Service, U.S. Marshal, U.S. \n     Customs Service, and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal \n     Investigation Division. All express support for such a court \n     and given additional reasons why it is needed.\n       Over the past several years, the FBI, DEA, and IRS have \n     initiated a substantial number of investigations in the \n     northern half of the district. In preparation for indictments \n     and trials, and when needed to testify before the Grand Jury \n     or in court, officers regularly travel to Milwaukee. Each \n     trip requires 4 to 6 hours of round trip travel per day, plus \n     the actual time in court. In other words, the agencies' \n     already scarce resources are severely taxed. Several federal \n     agencies report that many cases which are appropriate for \n     prosecution are simply not charged federally because local \n     law enforcement agencies do not have the resources to bring \n     these cases and officers back and forth to Milwaukee.\n       Nevertheless, there have been a substantial number of \n     successful federal investigations and prosecutions from the \n     Fox Valley area and other parts of the Northern District of \n     Wisconsin including major drug organizations, bank frauds, \n     tax cases, and weapons cases.\n       It is interesting to note that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in \n     the Eastern District of Wisconsin holds hearings in Green \n     Bay, Manitowoc, and Oshkosh, all in the northern half of the \n     district. For the past four years approximately 29% of all \n     bankruptcy filings in the district were in these three \n     locations.\n       In addition, we continue to prosecute most felonies \n     committed on the Menominee Reservation. Yet, the \n     Reservation's distance from the federal courts in Milwaukee \n     poses serious problems. A federal court in Green Bay is \n     critically important if the federal government is to live up \n     to its moral and legal obligation to enforce the law on the \n     Reservation.\n       In summary, I appreciate and understand your concerns and I \n     join you in urging the certain of a Federal District Court in \n     Green Bay.\n                                              Thomas P. Schneider,\n                     U.S. Attorney, Eastern District of Wisconsin.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my friend and \ncolleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, in introducing the Wisconsin \nFederal Judgeship Act of 1997. I want to commend my colleague for his \nleadership and dedication on this very important matter.\n  Mr. President, the legislation being introduced will address a \nserious problem currently confronting the citizens of the eastern \ndistrict of Wisconsin. At present, the eastern district of Wisconsin \nconsists of four district court judges and two appellate judges, all of \nwhich sit in Milwaukee. However, the eastern district of Wisconsin is \nan expansive area which extends from Wisconsin's southern border with \nIllinois all the way to the north and the Great Lakes. Approximately \none-third of the population of the eastern district of Wisconsin lives \nand works in the northern part of the district. While Milwaukee is \ncentrally located for the majority of residents who reside in south-\neastern Wisconsin, the same cannot be said for the residents of my \nState which live in the northern portion of the district.\n  The Wisconsin Judgeship Act addresses this problem by placing a fifth \ndistrict court judgeship in Green Bay which is centrally located in the \nnorthern portion of Wisconsin's eastern district. The simple fact of \nthe matter is that at present access to the justice system is \nburdensome and expensive for the residents and for law enforcement of \nnortheastern Wisconsin. In some instances, the travel time incurred by \nvictims, witnesses, and law enforcement is as much as 3 or 4 hours each \nway, often longer depending upon the weather. In some cases, the cost, \nboth in time and in scarce resources, may simply mean that legitimate \ncases are not being heard. Another troubling facet of this situation is \nthat northeastern Wisconsin is home to the Menominee Indian \nReservation. Because the Federal Government retains significant \njurisdictional responsibility for cases arising on the reservation, the \nrequirement that the cases be adjudicated in Milwaukee is particularly \nproblematic in these cases. Based on these facts Mr. President, it is \nlittle wonder that this legislation has the strong support of law \nenforcement, both from police and prosecutors, from all across the \neastern district of Wisconsin.\n  By placing a Federal judge in Green Bay, not only will the residents \nof the growing Fox River Valley have easier access to the court, but so \ntoo will those residents of my State which live in the north. Mr. \nPresident, I have long believed that access to the administration of \njustice is among the most important and fundamental rights that we as \nAmericans retain. Ensuring access to the courthouse is one of the \nprimary responsibilities that the Federal Government has to its \ncitizens. As members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Senator \nKohl and I see firsthand how important the timely administration of \njustice is to our Democratic Government. The inability to receive one's \nday in court because of geographic distance, as appears to be happening \nto some in my State, is unacceptable. This legislation will address \nthat inequity and I look forward to working with Senator Kohl and other \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee and the Senate as this legislation \nmoves forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1362. A bill to promote the use of universal product members on \nclaim forms used for reimbursement under the medicare program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n           THE MEDICARE UNIVERSAL PRODUCT NUMBER ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Breaux and myself, \nI am introducing legislation today to require the use of universal \nproduct numbers [UPNs] for all durable medical equipment [DME] Medicare \npurchases. The purpose of this legislation is to improve the Health \nCare Financing Administration's [HCFA] ability to track and to \nappropriately assess the value of the durable medical equipment it pays \nfor under the Medicare Program. Very simply, our bill will ensure \nMedicare gets what it pays for.\n  According to an interim report by the General Accounting Office [GAO] \nand the Office of Inspector General's review of billing practices for \nspecific medical supplies, the Medicare program is often paying greater \nthan the market price for durable medical equipment and Medicare \nbeneficiaries are not receiving the quality of care they should. HCFA \ncurrently does not require DME suppliers to identify specific products \non their Medicare claims. Therefore it does not know for which products \nit is paying. HCFA's billing codes often cover a broad range of \nproducts of various types, qualities and market prices. For example, \nthe GAO found that one Medicare billing code is used by the industry \nfor more than 200 different urological catheters, with many of these \nproducts varying significantly in price, use, and quality.\n  Medicare's inability to accurately track and price medical equipment \nand supplies it purchases could be remedied with the use of product \nspecific codes known as bar codes or universal product numbers [UPN's]. \nThese codes are similar to the codes you see on products you purchase \nat the grocery store. Use of such bar codes is already being required \nby the Department of Defense and several large private sector \npurchasing groups. The industry strongly supports such an initiative as \nwell. I am submitting several letters of endorsement for the record on \nbehalf of the National Association of Medical Equipment Services and \nthe Health Industry Distributors Association.\n  This bill represents a common-sense approach. It will improve the way \nMedicare monitors and reimburses suppliers for medical equipment and \nsupplies. Patients will receive better care.\n\n[[Page S11686]]\n\n And the Federal Government will save money. I ask that my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle support this legislation which I am \nintroducing today with my friend and colleague, Senator Breaux.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1362\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: On behalf of the Health Industry \n     Distributors Association (HIDA), I would like to applaud your \n     support for the use of universal product number (UPNs) on \n     Medical billings. HIDA is the national trade association of \n     home care companies and medical products distribution firms. \n     Created in 1902, HIDA represents over 600 companies with \n     appropriately 2500 locations nationwide. HIDA Members provide \n     value-added distribution services to virtually every \n     hospital, physician's office, nursing facility, clinic, and \n     other health care cities across the country, as well as to a \n     growing number of home care patients.\n       HIDA has long supported the use of UPN's for medical \n     products and supplies. UPNs provide a standard format for \n     identifying each individual product. UPNs are a major \n     enabling factor in the health industry's efforts to minimize \n     fraudulent billings and automate the distribution process. \n     The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken a leadership \n     position in promoting the implementation of the industry \n     standards of UPNs. As a part of their decision to use \n     commercial medical products distributors, the DOD has \n     mandated the use UPNs for all medical/surgical products \n     delivered to DOD facilities.\n       HIDA believes that the Medicare Program could benefit \n     greatly from the use of UPNs. By cross-referencing each UPN \n     with the HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) and \n     requiring the UPN on each claim for durable medical \n     equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (DMEPOS), \n     Medicare's ability to track utilization and combat fraud and \n     abuse would be greatly enhanced. By using UPNs, the Medicare \n     system would be able to correctly identify product \n     utilization. As UPNs provide a unique, unambiguous means of \n     identifying each item of DMEPOS on the market, Medicare would \n     have a record of the exact product used by the beneficiary. \n     Trends in product utilization and claims for ``suspicious'' \n     items would be easily identifiable. HCPCS alone can not \n     provide this information as many products of varying quality \n     and cost are included in a single code.\n       In addition, problems with ``upcoding'' could be greatly \n     reduced through the implementation of UPNs. Upcoding occurs \n     when a beneficiary receives a product of lesser cost/quality \n     than the HCPCS billed to Medicare. UPNs would correctly \n     identify the specific item of DMEPOS, thereby making it \n     impossible to misrepresent the cost and quality of the item. \n     Importantly, by addressing the problem of upcoding, the \n     Medicare Program would take great steps in assuring that \n     beneficiaries receive the exact items of DMEPOS that they \n     were intended to receive.\n       HIDA firmly believes that the Medicare Program and DMEPOS \n     industry would benefit greatly from the use of UPNs. This \n     standard would not only increase Medicare's understanding of \n     what it pays for, but also assist in the effective \n     administration of the Program. If HIDA can provide any \n     further information or be of any assistance, please contact \n     Ms. Erin H. Bush, Associate Director of Government Relations \n     at (703) 838-6110.\n       Again, thank you for your interest in this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely.\n\n                                         Cara C.

Coughlan, CAE,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1364. A bill to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful Federal \nreports; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              THE FEDERAL REPORTS ELIMINATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nlegislation that would eliminate approximately 150 unnecessary reports \nthat have been mandated by the Congress. All of these reports have been \njudged as unnecessary, wasteful, or redundant by each of the Federal \nagencies which have been required to produce them. I am also pleased to \nhave the considerable assistance of the coauthor of this legislation, \nSenator Levin.\n  This proposal is intended to combat the growing problem of the \nthousands of mandatory reports that Congress has been imposing upon the \nexecutive branch over the last decade. Each year, Members of Congress \ncontinue to burden the executive branch agencies by mandating numerous \nreports. The price for the wasteful reports is extraordinarily high. \nNot only do they cost American taxpayers hundreds of millions of \ndollars each year, but they exhaust the often limited resources of the \nFederal agencies which have to meet these reporting requirements. \nFurthermore, the thousands of Federal employees who must work for \nmonths on these unnecessary reports could focus their energies to work \non far more worthy ventures on behalf of taxpayers. They are a dubious \nuse of taxpayers dollars and Government productivity.\n  Senator Levin and I began working on various aspects of eliminating \nand sunsetting unnecessary Federal reports\n\n[[Page S11687]]\n\nin 1993. We have both been long concerned about the vast amounts of \npublic funds and valuable government personnel resources that are being \nwasted. Let me state just one instructive example of how reporting \nmandates drain public funds and departmental resources. The Department \nof Agriculture alone spent over $40 million in taxpayers money in 1993 \nto produce the 280 reports it was required to submit to the Congress \nthat year. While many of these reports may provide vital information to \nthe Congress and the public, it is undeniable that many others can and \nshould be repealed in order to save taxpayer dollars and staff time. \nThis is true for virtually every agency of the Federal Government.\n  In 1995, Senator Levin and I were able to successfully eliminate \napproximately 200 reports, and sunset several hundred others. However, \nsince that time, the administration has highlighted 450 additional \nreports that they would like repealed. Here are a few examples of the \ntype of reports I am talking about. Each year, the following are \nrequired to be sent to the Congress from Federal agencies: Report on \nthe Elimination of Notice to Congress Regarding Waiver of Requirement \nfor Use of Vegetable Ink in Lithographic Printing; Report on Canadian \nAcid Rain Control Program; and Report on Metal Casting Research and \nDevelopment Activities.\n  I have asked OMB to calculate the total amount of public funds we \nwould save if the unnecessary or redundant reporting requirements \ncontained in this legislation are repealed, and I will provide my \ncolleagues with their response. Considering that we currently have over \na $5 trillion dollar Federal deficit, Mr. President, I'm sure that you \nwould agree that our citizens would not support this egregious \nexpenditure of hundreds of useless reports each and every year.\n  It is important to note that this reporting mandate problem continues \nto grow with each passing year. GAO determined several years ago that \n``Congress imposes about 300 new requirements on Federal agencies each \nyear.'' Prompt Senate action to authorize the elimination of wasteful \nreports in this proposal will be an important service to our \nconstituents and these agencies. The staffing burdens and paper \nshuffling these outdated reporting mandates cause are of little real \nvalue to the important work of government. We should lighten the load \nof both overburdened taxpayers and the agencies involved by ending them \nnow.\n  I would again like to thank Senator Levin for his hard work and \ndedication on this issue over the past few years. Furthermore, I must \nacknowledge the administration for its earnest support of this effort. \nAdditionally, the proposed terminations were carefully reviewed and \nthen approved by each respective committee chairman and ranking member. \nThese reports represent the flagrant waste of taxpayers dollars and \nGovernment productivity.\n  It is clear that this bipartisan effort will put an end to a \nsignificant part of the unnecessary cycle of waste and misspent \nresources that these reports represent. The adoption of this \nlegislation would be a strong contribution toward downsizing Government \nas the American people have repeatedly called upon us to do. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and remove the millstone of \nunnecessary and costly paperwork that Congress has hung around the neck \nof the Federal Government for too long.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator McCain in \nintroducing the Federal Reports Elimination Act of 1997, which will \neliminate or modify 187 outdated or unnecessary congressionally \nmandated reporting requirements. This legislation will reduce \nunnecessary paperwork generated, and staff time spent, in producing \nreports to Congress that are no longer relevant or useful.\n  Senator McCain and I introduced and got enacted similar legislation \nin 1995, Public Law 104-66, the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset \nAct of 1995. In that legislation we eliminated or modified 207 \ncongressionally mandated reporting requirements and placed a 4-year \nsunset on all other reports that were required to be made on an annual \nor otherwise regular basis. We also required in that legislation that \nthe President include in the first annual budget submitted after the \ndate of enactment of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of \n1995 a list of the congressionally mandated reports that he has \ndetermined to be unnecessary or wasteful. The President provided a list \nof nearly 400 reports in the fiscal year 1997 budget along with \ncomments on why the agencies involved felt the reporting requirements \nshould be eliminated or modified. In many instances, the administration \nstates, the reports are obsolete or contain duplicate information \nalready conveyed to Congress in another report or publication.\n  For example, one report that is required of the Department of \nAgriculture asks the agency to provide to Congress a list of the \nadvisory committee members, principal place of residence, persons or \ncompanies by whom they are employed, and other major sources of income. \nThis information may be useful at the agency level, but is not \nsignificant to Congress. The administration's recommendation for \nelimination of this report stated that the ``preparation of this report \nis time consuming and may not be of particular interest to Congress. If \nthe requirement for an annual report is deleted, the information \ncontained in the report would still be available upon request.''\n  Another example of unnecessary reporting is the requirement to \nprovide reports for programs that have never been funded. The \nDepartment of Energy was tasked to provide a biennial update to the \nNational Advanced Materials Initiative Five-Year Program Plan in \nsupport of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, for which funds were never \nprovided. The Department of Justice never received funding for a \nprogram that required the submission of a report to the Judiciary \nCommittee on the security of State and local immigration and \nnaturalization documents and any improvements that occurred as a result \nof the Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989. The Department of \nTransportation has never received funding for a requirement to study \nthe effects of climatic conditions on the costs of highway construction \nand maintenance. The National Advisory Commission on Resource \nConservation and Recovery for the Environmental Protection Agency is \ntasked with providing an interim report of its activities. This \nCommission was established and commissioned in 1981 and has never met \nnor received funding for its activities.\n  The Vice President's National Performance Review estimated that \nCongress requires executive branch agencies to prepare more than 5,300 \nreports each year. That number has increased dramatically from only 750 \nsuch reports required by Congress in 1970. The GAO reports that \nCongress imposes close to 300 new requirements on Federal agencies each \nyear.\n  And preparation of these reports costs money. The Department of \nAgriculture estimated in 1993 that it spent more than $40 million in \npreparing 280 mandated reports.\n  In developing this bill, Senator McCain and I wrote to the chairmen \nand ranking members of the relevant Senate committees and asked them to \nreview the list of reports, under their jurisdiction, that the \nadministration identified as no longer necessary or useful and, \ntherefore, ready for elimination or modification. We wanted to be sure \nthat the committees of jurisdiction concurred with the administration \nin their assessment of the lack of need for these reports. Many of the \ncommittees responded to the request. Those responses were generally \nsupportive and some contained only a few changes to the \nadministration's recommendations. Some committees identified reports \nunder their jurisdiction which they wanted to retain because the \ninformation contained in the report is still of use to the committee. \nThose suggestions were incorporated into the bill so that the bill \nreflects only those reports for which there is general agreement about \nelimination or modification.\n  Senator McCain and I are introducing this bipartisan legislation to \nreduce the paperwork burdens placed on Federal agencies, streamline the \ninformation that flows from these agencies to Congress, and ultimately \nsave millions of taxpayer dollars. I hope we can act quickly on this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI:\n  S. 1365. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that the\n\n[[Page S11688]]\n\nreductions in social security benefits which are required in the case \nof spouses and surviving spouses who are also receiving certain \nGovernment pensions shall be equal to the amount by which two-thirds of \nthe total amount of the combined monthly benefit (before reduction) and \nmonthly pension exceeds $1,200, adjusted for inflation; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n         the government pension offset modification act of 1997\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that is \nvery important to me, very important to my constituents in Maryland, \nand very important to government workers and retirees across the \nNation.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill to modify a harsh and heartless rule \nof government that is unfair and prevents current workers from enjoying \nthe benefits of their hard work in their retirement. I want the middle \nclass of this Nation to know that if you worked hard to become middle \nclass you should stay middle class when you retire.\n  Under current law, there is something called the pension offset law. \nThis is a harsh and unfair policy. Let me tell you why.\n  If you are a retired government worker, and you qualify for a spousal \nSocial Security benefit based on your spouse's employment record, you \nmay not receive what you qualify for. Because the pension offset law \nreduces or entirely eliminates a Social Security spousal benefit when \nthe surviving spouse is eligible for a pension from a local, state, or \nfederal government job that was not covered by Social Security.\n  This policy only applies to government workers, not private sector \nworkers. Let me give you an example of two women, Helen and her sister \nPhyllis.\n  Helen is a retired Social Security benefits counselor who lives in \nWoodlawn, MD. Helen currently earns $600 a month from her Federal \nGovernment pension. She's also entitled to a $645 a month spousal \nbenefit from Social Security based on her deceased husband's hard work \nas an auto mechanic. That's a combined monthly benefit of $1,245.\n  Phyllis is a retired bank teller also in Woodlawn, MD. She currently \nearns a pension of $600 a month from the bank. Like Helen, Phyllis is \nalso entitled to a $645 a month spousal benefit from Social Security \nbased on her husband's employment. He was an auto mechanic, too. In \nfact, he worked at the same shop as Helen's husband.\n  So, Phyllis is entitled to a total of $1,245 a month, the same as \nHelen. But, because of the pension offset law, Helen's spousal benefit \nis reduced by two-thirds of her government pension, or $400. So instead \nof $1,245 per month, she will only receive $845 per month.\n  This reduction in benefits only happens to Helen because she worked \nfor the government. Phyllis will receive her full benefits because her \npension is a private sector pension. I don't think that's right, and \nthat's why I'm introducing this legislation.\n  The crucial thing about the Mikulski modification is that it \nguarantees a minimum benefit of $1,200. So, with the Mikulski \nmodification to the pension offset, Helen is guaranteed at least $1,200 \nper month.\n  Let me tell you how it works. Helen's spousal benefit will be reduced \nonly by two-thirds of the amount her combined monthly benefit exceeds \n$1,200. In her case, the amount of the offset would be two thirds of \n$45, or $30. That's a big difference from $400, and I think people like \nour Federal workers, teachers, and our firefighters deserve that big \ndifference.\n  Why should earning a government pension penalize the surviving \nspouse? If a deceased spouse had a job covered by Social Security and \npaid into the Social Security system. That spouse expected his earned \nSocial Security benefits would be there for his surviving spouse.\n  Most working men believe this and many working women are counting on \ntheir spousal benefits. But because of this harsh and heartless policy \nthe spousal benefits will not be there, your spouse will not benefit \nfrom your hard work, and, chances are, you won't find out about it \nuntil your loved one is gone and you really need the money.\n  The Mikulski modification guarantees that the spouse will at least \nreceive $1,200 in combined benefits. That Helen will receive the same \namount as Phyllis.\n  I'm introducing this legislation, because these survivors deserve \nbetter than the reduced monthly benefits that the pension offset \ncurrently allows. They deserve to be rewarded for their hard work, not \npenalized for it.\n  Many workers affected by this offset policy are women, or clerical \nworkers and bus drivers who are currently working and looking forward \nto a deserved retirement. These are people who worked hard as Federal \nemployees, school teachers, or firefighters.\n  Frankly, I would repeal this policy all together. But, I realize that \nbudget considerations make that unlikely. As a compromise, I hope we \ncan agree that retirees who work hard should not have this offset \napplied until their combined monthly benefit exceeds $1,200.\n  In the few cases where retirees might have their benefits reduced by \nthis policy change, my legislation will calculate their pension offset \nby the current method. I also have a provision in this legislation to \nindex the minimum amount of $1,200 to inflation so retirees will see \ntheir minimum benefits increase as the cost of living increases.\n  I believe that people who work hard and play by the rules should not \nbe penalized by arcane, legislative technicalities. That's why I'm \nintroducing this bill today.\n  Representative William Jefferson of Louisiana has introduced similar \nlegislation in the House. I look forward to working with him to modify \nthe harsh pension offset rule.\n  If the Federal Government is going to force government workers and \nretirees in Maryland and across the country to give up a portion of \ntheir spousal benefits, the retirees should at least receive a fair \nportion of their benefits.\n  I want to urge my Senate colleagues to join me in this effort and \nsupport my legislation to modify the Government pension offset.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1365\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the 10 percent floor for deductible disaster losses; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                      disaster relief legislation\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, under current law, personal property \ndamage is tax-deductible only to the extent that each loss is more than \n$100 and the total losses exceed 10 percent of income. Today, I am \nintroducing legislation which would eliminate the 10-percent test for \nunreimbursed casualty losses resulting from a Presidentially declared \ndisaster that occurs in 1997.\n  Just over a week ago, Nebraska was hit by a massive winter storm that \ndumped up to 20 inches of snow and 2\\1/2\\ inches of rain on our State \nunusually early in the season. As a result, Nebraskans have suffered \nmassive damages, the extent of which we are only beginning to discover \nas the process of digging out begins. More than 175,000 lost electrical \npower, and many of them are still waiting for it to be restored. \nThousands still lack phone service. About 85 percent of trees--still \nheavy with fall leaves--were damaged in Omaha alone.\n  Mr. President, changing this tax law won't shovel the snow, or \nrestore all the phone and electrical service. But for the homeowner \nwhose property was damaged by felled trees, or thousands of other \nNebraskans who suffered losses in this storm, allowing them to deduct \nthe full amount of those losses will provide a little breathing room as \nthe long process of digging out--and rebuilding--begins. I hope we act \non it soon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1366\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the act that authorized the Canadian River \nreclamation project, Texas to direct the Secretary of the Interior to \nallow use of the project distribution system to transport water from \nsources other than the project; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n        the canadian river municipal water authority act of 1997\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat would enable the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority in Texas \nto use the Canadian River Project's water distribution system to \ntransport water from sources other than those envisioned when the \nproject was conceived nearly 50 years ago.\n  The Canadian River Municipal Water Authority is a State agency which \nsupplies water to over 500,000 citizens in 11 cities on the Texas high \nplains, including Lubbock and Amarillo. The water authority was created \nby the Texas Legislature which authorized it to contract with the \nFederal Government under Federal reclamation laws to build and develop \nthe Canadian River Project, also known as Lake Meredith. While the \noperation and maintenance responsibilities of the project were \ntransferred to the water authority, the Bureau of Reclamation retained \nthe title and ownership of the project.\n  The quality and supply of water from the Canadian River Project has \nnot met the expectations of either the Bureau of Reclamation or the \nresidents of the Texas high plains. Not only is their insufficient \nwater to provide adequately for the needs of the communities Lake \nMeredith serves, but the water has high levels of salt.\n  The Canadian River Municipal Water Authority has proposed to \nsupplement the water in Lake Meredith with better quality groundwater \nfrom nearby aquifers. While this will not require any Federal funding, \nthe Bureau of Reclamation has ill-conceived guidelines precluding \nnonproject water from flowing through their reservoirs or distribution \nsystems.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would allow the use of the \nCanadian River Project water distribution system to transport better \nquality water from the nearby aquifers which are outside the originally \ndefined project scope. An environmental review, as required by law, \nwould be conducted and completed within 90 days of enactment of this \nlegislation. Congressman Mac Thornberry has introduced similar \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  The citizens of the Texas Panhandle have long suffered from \ninsufficient water and poor water quality. The Bureau of Reclamation \nhas worked with the water authority to develop a solution to the high \nsalt content in the water. Local officials believe that one solution is \nto simply dilute the poor quality water with better quality water from \nthe nearby aquifers.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation quickly to meet the \nlong-term water needs of many Texas Panhandle residents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1368. A bill to provide individuals with access to health \ninformation of which they are the subject, ensure personal privacy with \nrespect to personal medical records and health care-related \ninformation, impose criminal and civil penalties for unauthorized use \nof personal health information, and to provide for the strong \nenforcement of these rights; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                the medical records privacy act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the time has come for Congress to enact a \nstrong and effective federal law to protect the privacy of medical \nrecords.\n\n  To address this need, today, Senator Kennedy and I are introducing \nthe Medical Information Privacy and Security Act (MIPSA).\n  Americans strongly believe that their personal, private medical \nrecords\n\n[[Page S11690]]\n\nshould be kept private. The time-honored ethics of the medical \nprofession also reflect this principle. The physicians' oath of \nHippocrates requires that medical information be kept ``as sacred as \nsecrets.''\n  A guiding principle in drafting this legislation is that the movement \nto more a integrated system of health care in our country will only \ncontinue to be supported by the American people if they are assured \nthat the personal privacy of their health care information is \nprotected. In fact, without the confidence that one's personal privacy \nwill be protected, many will be discouraged from seeking medical help.\n  I am encouraged that a variety of public policy and health \nprofessional organizations, across the political spectrum, are \nsignaling their intentions to step forward to join forces with \nconsumers during this debate.\n  For the American public, and for the Congress, this debate boils down \nto a fundamental question: Who controls our medical records, and how \nfreely can others use them?\n  Many of us in this chamber quickly criticized the Social Security \nAdministration and the IRS regarding the security of computer records. \nWe blasted the IRS for allowing employees to randomly scan through our \npersonal financial records.\n  If we are concerned about IRS employees looking at our tax records, \nshould we not be concerned about the millions of employers, insurers, \npharmaceutical companies, government agencies and others who have \nnearly unfettered access to the personal medical records of more than \n250 million Americans?\n  All of us are health care consumers--every individual and every \nAmerican family. As Congress works toward answering this question, the \nprivacy interests of the American public will be at odds with powerful \neconomic interests and with the penchant for large organizations and \ncomplex systems to control this kind of personal information. Well-\nfunded and sharply focused special interests often win in a match-up \nlike this.\n  Senator Bob Dole, the former majority leader of the Senate, put his \nfinger on this problem when he observed that a ``compromise of \nprivacy'' that sends information about health and treatment to a \nnational data bank without a person's approval would be something that \nnone of us would accept.\n  Unfortunately, this nightmare that Senator Dole envisioned is being \nbrought to life by provisions insisted upon by the House in last year's \nhealth insurance portability bill that require a system of health care \ninformation exchanges by computers and through computer clearinghouses \nand data networks.\n  We are now confronted with the fact that the computerization of \nhealth care record provisions are going into effect in the next few \nmonths but we are still contemplating the delay of promulgating privacy \nprotection until August of 1999, unless Congress acts sooner.\n  The Information Age opens the door to endless new possibilities and \nhas empowered individuals with marvelous new tools and freedoms. But \ntechnology is our servant; we should not let it become our master. \nUnless we are vigilant, the Information Age can overwhelm our privacy \nrights before we even know it has happened.\n  I do not want advancing technology to lead to a loss of personal \nprivacy and do not want the fear that confidentiality is being \ncompromised to deter people from seeking medical treatment or stifle \ntechnological or scientific development.\n  The outlines of the challenge we face in stemming the erosion of \nmedical privacy are already clear. Insurance companies have set up \ntheir Medical Information Bureau (MIB) which stores personal medical \ninformation on millions of Americans. M.I.B. may have personal \ninformation on all of us in Congress and our families.\n  Managed care companies, HMOs, drug companies, and hospitals are \nspending up to $15 billion a year on information technology to acquire \nand exchange vast amounts of medical information about Americans.\n  While this in and of itself may not be the issue--the question is how \nand why is it being collected and for what specific use is this \ninformation being used and do individuals know about this? Patients \nshould be advised about the existence of data bases in which medical \ninformation concerning the patients is stored.\n  This information can be very useful for quality assurance, and to \nprovide more cost effective health care. But I am not certain that the \nAmerican public would agree with a recent Fortune magazine article \nwhich lauded a health insurer that poked through the individual medical \nrecords of clients to figure out who may be depressed and could benefit \nfrom the use of the anti-depressant Prozac. Are we now encouraging \nreplacing sound clinical judgment of doctors with health insurance \nclerks who look at records to determine whether you are not really \nsuffering from a physical illness, but a mental illness?\n  Contrary to some, I believe that computerization can assure more \nprivacy to individuals than the current system if my legislation is \nenacted. But if we do not act the increased potential for embarrassment \nand harassment is tremendous.\n  There are many more stories which highlight the problems that are out \nthere due with the lack of privacy and security of individuals medical \nrecords, unfortunately so many other breaches of privacy are more \nsubtle.\n  Singer Tammy Wynette entered the hospital in 1995 for a bile duct \nproblem. She used a pseudonym, but a hospital staff member broke into \nher computerized medical records and sold the information to the press, \nsupposedly for thousands of dollars. The sensational National Enquirer \nthen erroneously reported that Wynette was near death and in need of a \nliver transplant.\n  A current Member of Congress had her medical records faxed to the New \nYork Post on the eve of her primary. In 1994, she offered eloquent \ntestimony before Congress detailing her ordeal.\n  In another example, an insurance agent advised a couple that they \nwould be denied coverage for any more pregnancies since they had a 25 \npercent chance that their children would have a fatal disease.\n  In Florida, a state public health worker improperly brought home a \ncomputer disk with the names of 4,000 HIV positive patients. The disks \nwere then sent to two Florida newspapers.\n  Medical privacy issues in today's world also take on international \nimplications. Canada and the nations of Europe are taking concrete \nsteps to protect the confidentiality of computerized medical records.\n  Our nation lags so far behind others in its protection of medical \nrecords that companies in Europe may not be allowed to send medical \ninformation to the United States electronically. European countries--\nthrough an EU privacy directive--are ensuring that private medical \nrecords are kept private. The EU prohibits the transfer of personal \ninformation from Europe to the U.S. if the EU finds U.S. privacy law \ninadequate. The implications for U.S. trade are staggering.\n  The legislation we are introducing today addresses the issues I have \noutlined to close the existing gaps in federal privacy law to cover \npersonally identifiable health information.\n  MIPSA is broad in scope--it applies to medical records in whatever \nform--paper or electronic. It applies to each release of medical \ninformation--including re-releases. It comprehensively covers entities \nother than just health care providers and payers, such as life \ninsurance companies, employers and marketers and others that may have \naccess to sensitive personal health data.\n  It establishes a clear and enforceable right of privacy with respect \nall personally identifiable medical information including information \nregarding the results of genetic tests.\n  It gives individuals the right to inspect, copy and supplement their \nprotected health information. Today, only 28 states grant this right.\n  It allows individuals to segregate portions of their medical records, \nsuch as mental health records, from broad viewing by individuals who \nare not directly involved in their care.\n  It gives individuals a civil right of action against anyone who \nmisuses their personally identifiable health information. It \nestablishes criminal and civil penalties that can be invoked if \nindividually identifiable health information is knowingly or \nnegligently misused.\n\n[[Page S11691]]\n\n  It sets up a national office of health information privacy to aid \nconsumers in learning about their rights and how they may seek recourse \nfor violations of their rights.\n  It creates a set of rules and norms to govern the disclosure of \npersonal health information and narrows the sharing of personal details \nwithin the health care system to the minimum necessary to provide care, \nallow for payment and to facilitate effective oversight. Special \nattention is paid to situations such as emergency medical care and \npublic health requirements.\n  We have tried to accommodate legitimate oversight concerns so that we \ndo not create unnecessary impediments to health care fraud \ninvestigations. Effective health care oversight is essential if our \nhealth care system is to function and fulfill its intended goals. \nOtherwise, we risk establishing a publicly-sanctioned playground for \nthe unscrupulous. Health care is too important a public investment to \nbe the subject of undetected fraud or abuse.\n  MIPSA also extends to all research facilities using personally \nidentifiable information the current requirements met by federally \nfunded researchers. I am troubled that research is viewed by some as an \narea where privacy rights should be sacrificed and consent not required \nfor use of individually identifiable health information. If there are \nto be any exceptions in a federal medical privacy law for research \nusing personally identifiable health information, the Congress and the \nAmerican people need to understand better why this may be necessary. To \naddress this concern our bill mandates an evaluation of the waiver of \ninformed consent that is allowed under current regulations.\n  It does not preempt state laws that are more protective of privacy. \nThis is consistent with all other federal civil rights and privacy \nlaws.\n  It prohibits law enforcement agents from searching through medical \nrecords without a warrant. It does not limit law enforcement agents to \ngain information while in hot pursuit of a suspect.\n  I know that these are important matters about which many of us feel \nvery strongly. It is never easy to legislate about privacy.\n  I invite other Members of Congress, federal agencies and outside \ninterest groups to examine the legislation we have introduced today. \nThis bill is a work in progress and we welcome any comments or \nsuggestions to make improvements to this legislation.\n  I am pleased that my colleague from Vermont, the Chairman of the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Jeffords, has already held \ntwo hearings this year on the issue of medical privacy. The clock, \nhowever, is ticking and other Members of Congress need to join us to \nmove forward to pass strong and workable medical privacy legislation.\n  As policy makers, we must remember that the right to privacy is one \nof our most cherished freedoms--it is the right to be left alone and to \nchoose what we will reveal of ourselves and what we will keep from \nothers. Privacy is not a partisan issue and should not be made a \npolitical issue. It is too important.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1369. A bill to provide truancy prevention and reduction, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 THE PREVENTION OF TRUANCY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould help our communities respond to an increasingly serious problem \nin our country: truancy. Truancy is a dangerous and growing trend in \nour nation's schools. It not only prevents our children from receiving \nthe education they need, but it is often the first warning of more \nserious problems to come. Truant students are at greater risk of \nfalling into substance abuse, gangs, and violent behavior. Truancy is a \ngateway into all of these activities.\n  In the past ten years, truancy has increased by 67 percent. In 1994, \ncourts formally processed 36,400 truancy cases. And in some inner city \nschools, absentee rates approach 50 percent. Fortunately, truancy is a \nsolvable problem. Many communities have begun to set up early \nintervention programs--to reach out and prevent truancy before it leads \nto delinquency and criminal behavior. These programs are showing signs \nof success, as several towns have reported drops in daytime burglary \nrates of as much as 75 percent after instituting truancy prevention \ninitiatives.\n  Unfortunately, implementing these programs has been a challenge. \nTruancy is considered an educational rather than a criminal issue, and, \nwith growing classroom enrollments, many financially-strapped schools \ndon't have the resources to adequately address this problem.\n  Today, I am introducing ``The Prevention of Truancy [PTA] Act of \n1997'' whose goal is to promote anti-truancy partnerships between \nschools, parents, law enforcement agencies, and social service and \nyouth organizations. This bill would provide $80 million in grant \nfunding for the purpose of developing, implementing, or operating \npartnerships for the prevention and reduction of truancy. The \npartnerships would be administered by the Department of Education.\n  All of the partnership programs would be required to sanction \nstudents engaging in truancy, as well as provide incentives for parents \nto take responsibility for their children. These programs would also be \nevaluated for their effectiveness in preventing truancy, increasing \nschool attendance, and reducing juvenile crime.\n  Truancy prevention programs produce long-term savings. By some \nestimates, truants cost this nation more than $240 billion in lost \nearnings and foregone taxes over their lifetimes. And billions more are \nspent on law enforcement, prisons, welfare, health care, and other \nsocial services for these individuals. Imagine what we could do with \nthis money if we could keep our kids in school? Imagine how bright \ntheir futures could be? I hope my legislation will help communities \nbuild successful programs to prevent and reduce truancy so that one day \nwe will realize these concrete savings and admire the accomplishments \nof the youth who benefitted from these programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prevention of Truancy Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in 1994, courts in the United States formally processed \n     36,400 truancy cases, representing a 35 percent increase \n     since 1990, and a 67 percent increase since 1985, in the \n     formal processing of truancy cases;\n       (2) in 1993, among individuals aged 16 through 24, \n     approximately 3,400,000,000 (11 percent of all individuals in \n     this age group) had not completed high school and were not \n     enrolled in school;\n       (3) the economic and social costs of providing for the \n     increasing population of youth who are at risk of leaving or \n     who have left the educational mainstream are an enormous \n     drain on the resources of Federal, State, and local \n     governments and the private sector;\n       (4) truancy is the first indicator that a young person is \n     giving up and losing his or her way;\n       (5) students who become truant and eventually drop out of \n     school put themselves at a long-term disadvantage in becoming \n     productive citizens;\n       (6) high school drop-outs are two and one-half times more \n     likely to be on welfare than high school graduates;\n       (7) high school drop-outs are almost twice as likely to be \n     unemployed as high school graduates;\n       (8) in 1993, 17 percent of youth under age 18 who entered \n     adult prisons had not completed grade school, one-fourth of \n     such youth had completed 10th grade, and 2 percent of such \n     youth had a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent;\n       (9) truancy contributes to increased use of the foster care \n     and court systems;\n       (10) truancy is a gateway to crime, and high rates of \n     truancy are linked to high daytime burglary rates and high \n     vandalism rates;\n       (11) communities that have instituted truancy prevention \n     programs have seen daytime burglary rates decline by as much \n     as 75 percent; and\n       (12) truancy prevention and reduction programs result in \n     significant increases in school attendance.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Thomas) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 60\n\n       Whereas in 1990, Mongolia renounced the Communist form of \n     government and peacefully adopted a series of changes that \n     linked economic development with democratic political \n     reforms;\n       Whereas the Mongolian people have held 2 presidential \n     elections and 3 parliamentary elections since 1990, all \n     featuring vigorous campaigns by candidates from multiple \n     political parties;\n       Whereas these elections have been free from violence, voter \n     intimidation, and ballot irregularities, and the peaceful \n     transfer of power from one Mongolian government to another \n     has been successfully completed, demonstrating Mongolia's \n     commitment to peace, stability, and the rule of law;\n       Whereas every Mongolian government since the end of \n     communism has dedicated itself to promoting and protecting \n     individual freedoms, the rule of law, respect for human \n     rights, freedom of the press, and the principle of self-\n     government, thereby demonstrating that Mongolia is \n     consolidating democratic gains and moving to institutionalize \n     democratic processes;\n       Whereas Mongolia stands apart as one of the few countries \n     in central and southeast Asia that is truly a fully \n     functioning democracy;\n       Whereas the efforts of Mongolia to promote economic \n     development through free market economic policies, while also \n     promoting human rights and individual liberties, building \n     democratic institutions, and protecting the environment, \n     serve as a beacon to freethinking people throughout the \n     region and the world;\n       Whereas the commitment of Mongolia to democracy makes it a \n     critical element in efforts to foster and maintain regional \n     stability throughout central and southeast Asia;\n       Whereas Mongolia has some of the most pristine environments \n     in the world, which provide habitats to plant and animal \n     species that have been lost elsewhere, and has shown a strong \n     desire to protect its environment through the Biodiversity \n     Conservation Action Plan while moving forward with economic \n     development, thus service as a model for developing nations \n     in the region and throughout the world;\n       Whereas Mongolia has demonstrated a strong commitment to \n     the same ideals that the United States stands for as \n     a nation, and has indicated a strong desire to deepen and \n     strengthen its relationship with the United States;\n       Whereas the Mongolia Government has established civilian \n     control of the military--a hallmark of democratic nations--\n     and is now working with parliamentary and military leaders in \n     Mongolia, through the United States International Military \n     Education and Training program, to further develop oversight \n     of the Mongolia military; and\n       Whereas Mongolia is seeking to develop political and \n     military relationships with neighboring countries as a means \n     of enhancing regional stability: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) Congress--\n       (A) strongly supports efforts by the United States and \n     Mongolia to use the resources of their respective countries \n     to strengthen political, economic, educational, and cultural \n     ties between the two countries;\n       (B) confirms the commitment of the United States to an \n     independent, sovereign, secure, and democratic Mongolia;\n       (C) applauds and encourages Mongolia's simultaneous efforts \n     to develop its democratic and free market institutions;\n       (D) supports future contacts between the United States and \n     Mongolia in such a manner as will benefit the parliamentary, \n     judicial, and political institutions of Mongolia, \n     particularly through the creation of an interparliamentary \n     exchange between Congress of the United States and the \n     Mongolian parliament;\n       (E) supports the efforts of the Mongolia parliament to \n     establish United States-Mongolia Friendship Day;\n       (F) encourages the efforts of Mongolia toward economic \n     development that is compatible with environmental protection \n     and supports an exchange of ideas and information with \n     respect to such efforts between Mongolia and United States \n     scientists;\n       (G) commends Mongolia for its foresight in environmental \n     protection through the Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan \n     and encourages Mongolia to obtain the goals illustrated in \n     the plan; and\n       (H) commends the efforts of Mongolia to strengthen civilian \n     control over the Mongolia military through parliamentary \n     oversight and recommends that Mongolia be admitted into the \n     Partnership for Peace initiative at the earliest opportunity; \n     and\n       (2) it is the sense of Congress that the President--\n       (A) should, both through the vote of the United States in \n     international financial institutions and in the \n     administration of the bilateral assistance programs of the \n     United States, support Mongolia in its efforts to expand \n     economic opportunity through free market structures and \n     policies;\n       (B) should assist Mongolia in its efforts to integrate \n     itself into international economic structures, such as the \n     World Trade Organization; and\n       (C) should promote efforts to increase commercial \n     investment in Mongolia by United States businesses and should \n     promote policies which will increase economic cooperation and \n     development between the United States and Mongolia.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent \nresolution expressing the sense of Congress in support of efforts to \nfoster friendship and cooperation between the United States and \nMongolia. Passage of this resolution will signal American support of \nMongolia's peaceful transition to a stable democracy and market \neconomy. Senator Thomas is an original cosponsor to this resolution.\n  There has been a stunning political transformation in Mongolia since \nit broke away from Communist rule in 1990. In the past 7 years, there \nhave been two Presidential elections and three parliamentary elections. \nAll of these have been open and democratic, and have not suffered from \nviolence or fraud.\n  The most important aspect of these elections is that they have showed \nthe triumph of democracy and democratic forces. In 1996, the Mongolian \nSocial Democratic Party [MSDP] and Mongolian National Democratic Party \n[MNDP] formed a coalition with two smaller parties to promote a unified \ndemocratic front. The fruits of this decision soon came to bear when \nthe unified coalition campaigned on a ``Contract with the Mongolian \nVoter'' and won 50 of the 76 seats in the 1996 Parliamentary elections. \nI am happy to say that the International Republican Institute played a \nmajor role in this victory by showing these parties how to mobilize \ntheir supporters and work toward victory. The Mongolian Peoples \nRevolutionary Party, the former Mongolian Communist Party, won a \nPresidential election this year, and the President-elect has made \nassurances, including to me personally in August, that he supports \ndemocracy.\n  This democratic transformation has established a firm human rights \nregime. The Mongolian Constitution allows freedom of speech, the press, \nand expression. Separation of church and state is recognized in this \npredominantly Buddhist nation as well as the right to worship or not \nworship. Full freedom of emigration is allowed, and Mongolia now is in \nfull compliance with sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974, \nalso known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment. An independent judiciary has \nbeen established to protect these rights from any future violation.\n  Mongolia is also in the middle of an economic transformation. As part \nof the ``Contract with the Mongolian Voter,'' the democratic coalition \nof the MNDP and MSDP ran on promises to establish private property \nrights and encourage foreign investment. The Mongolian Government is \nnow steadily creating a market economy. A program has been set up to \nallow residents of Government-owned high rise apartments to acquire \nownership of their residences. Mongolia joined the World Trade \nOrganization in January this year, and in May the Parliament eliminated \nall tariffs, except on personal automobiles, alcoholic beverages, and \ntobacco. In September 1996, the Government removed price controls and \nMongolians were able to finally survive a winter without a major \nbreakdown of heat or electricity. The Mongolian Government is now \nboldly moving to set the nation on a course to privatize large-scale \nenterprise and reform the state pension system.\n\n  When I was in Mongolia, I saw the effects of this economic \ntransformation firsthand. At a town hall meeting in Kharakhorum, the \nancient capital of the Mongol Empire, I met a herdsman and asked him \nabout the economic liberalization. First, I asked him how many sheep he \nhad under communism. He said none, because the Communists didn't allow \nprivate property. Then I asked him how many sheep he owned after \nprivatization. He answered that he had 3 sheep then, which is not much \nin a country with 25 million sheep. So I asked him how many sheep he \nhas now. He answered that he now has 90 goats, 60 sheep, 20 cows, and 6 \nhorses. I\n\n[[Page S11694]]\n\nasked him if that was considered successful. He replied that he was \nsuccessful as were many herdsmen in this new economy. He then told me \nthat he would never want to change the system back to what it was, \nbecause ``now Mongols have control over their own life and destiny.'' \nThat is the new culture of a market Mongolian economy.\n  There are many benefits to supporting Mongolian democracy and \neconomic liberalization. In 1991, Secretary of State James Baker \npromised Mongolia that the United States would be Mongolia's ``third \nneighbor.'' We remain committed to that course of action to encourage \nMongolia in its endeavors and promote it as an example of how nations \ncan successfully convert from a Communist totalitarian state to a \nmarket democracy. Finally, a democratic Mongolia will promote peace and \nstability in northern Asia.\n  Finally, there are important economic benefits to the United States. \nMongolia would like to make the United States a major trading partner. \nTotal two-way trade between the United States and Mongolia has almost \ntripled in value from $13 million in 1991 to $35 million in 1996. Total \nU.S. exports have more than doubled from over $2 million in 1992 to \n$4.2 million in 1996. As Mongolia continues to liberalize its economy, \nthe United States will be able to count on it to become an important \nmarket for American goods and services.\n  I hope that my colleagues here in the Senate will join me in \nrecognizing Mongolia as an example of successful democratic \ntransformation and supporting the Mongol transition to a market \neconomy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11693-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize an \noutstanding American and Texan and to take note of his recent \nreappointment by President Clinton as a member of the Board of \nDirectors of the Inter-American Foundation.\n  Many in South Texas know Frank Yturria, and is wife, Mary, for the \nmany years they have devoted to public service in Brownsville, TX, and \nthroughout the Rio Grande Valley. As a leading voice for community \nimprovement, Frank Yturria has served as an example of devotion to \ncommunity. He and his wife have been involved in, and often led, \nnumerous community projects in the south Rio Grande Valley. They are \nalso pioneers in the effort to forge meaningful and productive \nrelationships with private and public sector community leaders on the \nMexican side of the border.\n  Frank Yturria was first appointed in 1990 by President Bush to serve \nas chairman of the Board of Directors of the Inter-American Foundation, \na development agency which promotes self-help community efforts in \nLatin America and the Caribbean. During his tenure, Frank Yturria \ninstituted necessary reforms at the agency and insisted on program \naccountability. Because of his efforts and hard work, Frank Yturria is \nthe first member of the Inter-American Foundation's Board of Directors \nto be reappointed by any President, Democrat or Republican. This \nreappointment by President Clinton clearly speaks volumes about Frank \nYturria's contributions to his community, Texas, and to our Nation. I \nsupport his reappointment and wish him well as be continues to work for \nmutual friendship and prosperity of the United States and Latin \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11695-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11695-S11698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN INSTITUTE 1997 FREEDOM AWARD\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, late last month in downtown \nWashington, the International Republican Institute honored Ronald \nReagan as the recipient of their 1997 Freedom Award. Seldom, if ever, \nhas a Washington dinner been held to honor an American when the honor \nwas more richly deserved or more sincerely conferred. There was a deep \nand abiding outpouring of respect, admiration and affection for our \nNation's 40th President. Even a touch of nostalgia was present as \nguests and speakers recalled when our Nation was led by a President \nguided by a clear vision and deeply-held convictions.\n  The formal program included remarks by James Billington, the \nLibrarian of Congress, and our colleague, the chairman of I.R.I., \nSenator McCain of Arizona. Mrs. Reagan was there to represent her \nhusband and she made a brief statement in his behalf when the award was \npresented. These statements focused on Ronald Reagan's indispensable \nleadership that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and to freedom for \nhundreds of millions throughout the globe.\n  Mr. President, the statements of these distinguished Americans \ndeserve the attention of the Senate and the American people. Moreover, \nthey should be part of the public record so that future generations \nwill have convenient access to them as they examine the life and \ninfluence of this great American whose vision and leadership changed \nthe world.\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, I ask that the statements by Senator \nMcCain and Dr. Billington, as well as the brief remarks by Mrs. Reagan, \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11696]]\n\n  The statements follow:\n\nThe Foreign Policy of President Ronald Reagan (by James H. Billington, \n               Librarian of Congress, September 25, 1997)\n\n       The Cold War was the central conflict of the second half of \n     the 20th century, the longest and most unconventional war of \n     the entire modern era and an altogether unprecedented \n     experience for Americans. We never directly fought our \n     principal antagonist, the Soviet Union, but we were faced for \n     the first time in our history--and over a long period--with \n     an opponent who was both ideologically committed to overthrow \n     our system and materially equipped to destroy us physically.\n       President Ronald Reagan was the single most important \n     political figure in ending the Cold War without either making \n     concessions or incurring major loss of life on either side. \n     It was an astonishing accomplishment. Not surprising, those \n     who never thought such an outcome was possible in the first \n     place have been slow to recognize that the unraveling of the \n     Soviet Empire began, and became irreversible, on his watch--\n     and in no small part as a result of his special qualities of \n     leadership.\n       In his monumental study of the rise and fall of \n     civilizations, written just as the Cold War was beginning, \n     Arnold Tonybee suggested that empires begin their inevitable \n     decline when they meet a challenge to which they are \n     systematically unable to respond. The hierarchical control \n     system of the Soviet Empire met such a challenge with the \n     Solidarity Movement in Poland. As a bottom-up mass movement \n     rooted in religion within the largest Soviet satellite, \n     Solidarity was not the kind of movement which Soviet imperial \n     managers could domesticate either by decapitating or co-\n     opting the leaders or by offering carrots and sticks to its \n     members. John Paul II, the first Slavic Pope, spiritually \n     inspired it, and President Reagan's political support \n     helped it survive martial law to become the decisive \n     catalyst in the eventual chain reaction of Communist \n     collapse at the end of the 1980's.\n       What were the key elements of Ronald Reagan's role in all \n     of this? First of all, he was guided by a simple vision that \n     ordinary people everywhere could understand--rather than by \n     some complex strategic doctrine intelligible only to foreign \n     policy wonks. In 1981 at Notre Dame, he spoke not of winning \n     the cold war but of the bright prospects ``for the cause of \n     freedom and the spread of civilization,'' indicating that \n     ``the West will not contain Communism; it will transcend \n     Communism.''\n       He made it clear at the beginning of the administration \n     that tokenism in arms control and photo-op summit solutions \n     to serious problems would no longer be accepted. In effect, \n     he told the world he would not go on playing the old favorite \n     Russian game of chess, the aim of which always seemed to be \n     to play for a draw. Here, at last, was a good old-fashioned \n     American poker player who knew he had the stronger hand, was \n     willing to raise the ante to a level that the strained Soviet \n     system could not meet, and had the imagination to throw in \n     the wild card of a strategic defensive initiative. He proved \n     that an American President could be reelected without having \n     had a summit meeting of any kind--let alone the kind which \n     legitimized Soviet leaders and placed the spotlight on \n     weapons: the one area where the Soviet Union did, in some \n     respects, enjoy parity with America.\n       Reagan's strategic defense initiative addressed a need \n     which is arguably still important today with the possibility \n     of rogue states acquiring deadly delivery capabilities. But, \n     at that time, it represented as well a second key challenge \n     to which the Soviet system was systematically unable to \n     respond--neither materially, because of their backwardness in \n     computers and high technology, nor politically, because \n     ordinary people (as distinct from policy wonks) could not \n     believe that a defensive system that we were willing to share \n     with others really threatened anybody.\n       If the first element of the Reagan leadership, then, was \n     vision backed by strength in his first term, the second \n     ingredient was his ability to be an altogether gracious \n     winner in his second term. By establishing a genuinely warm \n     and basically non-adversarial relationship with Gorbachev, \n     cemented by a rapid-fire set of summits in his second term, \n     President Reagan defied the general assumption of the foreign \n     policy establishment that summits had to be basically \n     choreographed by experts and incremental in accomplishment. \n     He began at Geneva by going one-on-one with Gorbachev. He \n     reacted to the accelerating crisis of communism in a way that \n     did not humiliate but, in fact, honored an opponent who was \n     moving things in the right direction.\n       It is easy to forget now just how ritualized the Soviet-\n     American conflict had become by the end of the 1970's--and \n     how fatalistic the Western establishment had become in \n     accepting a more-or-less indefinite coexistence with a Soviet \n     Empire then at the height of its expansiveness. What helped \n     change all that was the third element in President Reagan's \n     formula: the disarmingly simple way he redefined the conflict \n     itself as being not fundamentally between systems, alliances, \n     or even nations but between good and evil.\n       His famous ``evil empire speech,'' which met with almost \n     universal condemnation in the Western media and academia, may \n     well have played an important role in unclogging the logjam \n     in the Soviet system and ending the menace of accidental or \n     mutual destruction that always hovered over the Cold War. Two \n     different Soviet reformist politicians told me amidst the \n     alcoholic bonhomie of the state dinner at the Reagan-\n     Gorbachev Moscow summit in June 1988 that they used the \n     unprecedently undiplomatic nature of that talk to convince \n     other Soviet leaders that they should try to accommodate \n     and not continue to confront the West. It seems of course, \n     paradoxical to suggest that a belligerent speech could \n     pave the way to peaceful change. But what seems unlikely \n     in theory may well be true in real life. Real life is told \n     in stories. No one was a greater storyteller in real life \n     than Ronald Reagan; and he had a good basic story to tell. \n     In my view, the end of the Cold War represented \n     essentially the victory of a story over a theory.\n       The United States of America is the result not of any \n     theory but of a story--made up over the years out of hundreds \n     of individual human stories. The Soviet Union was the product \n     of a theory suddenly superimposed by politicized \n     intellectuals through a coup in the midst of the inhuman \n     chaos of World War I. Because Communism as a theory was, in \n     some ways, inherently appealing, Americans were often \n     reluctant to believe that the Soviet system was evil rather \n     than just a temporary victim of Stalin's paranoia or perhaps \n     of defective genes traceable back to Ivan the Terrible or \n     Genghis Khan. It had been easy for intellectuals to believe \n     that Nazi totalitarianism represented a threat because of its \n     exclusivist, racist underpinnings, but it seemed hard to \n     believe that anything could be fundamentally wrong with the \n     inclusive ideal of an egalitarian society or with fellow \n     intellectuals like Marx and Lenin, who spent so much time in \n     the British Museum even if they never worked in factories.\n       The capacity to provide gratuitous excuses for Soviet \n     behavior had reached a grotesque climax in the immediate \n     aftermath of the Afghan invasion. For the first couple of \n     days, the only explanation the Soviet regime could offer was \n     that they were intervening at the invitation of the leader \n     whom they had then proceeded to shoot. They were soon rescued \n     from this embarrassment by the gratuitous rationalizations \n     and explanations for their behavior provided by the Western \n     media.\n       Reagan, the storyteller, instinctively realized that \n     America was a story, not a theory; that stories tend to unify \n     people; and that the best stories are based on relatively \n     universal archetypes that deal with good and evil. Theories \n     rarly bring peace, since they inspire divisions based on \n     right and wrong and invite argument that leads to conflict. \n     Stories are shared; theories are debated.\n       Anyone who came within the President's orbit was \n     immediately attracted by his stories. They invariably drew \n     the diverse people at his table together and were essentially \n     inclusive. Theories, on the other hand, tend to exclude those \n     who do not believe in them--and to induce arrogance in those \n     who do.\n       The American academic experts whom President Reagan \n     periodically gathered around a lunch table in the White House \n     were often perplexed by his tendency to relate tales of his \n     own negotiations with labor leaders in Hollywood. Yet, as I \n     listened to these stories, I saw that he was both securing a \n     measure of buy-in from the often skeptical intellectual \n     community and, at the same time, pre-testing his future \n     tactics by probing for the reaction of theorists to the \n     practicalities of his negotiating techniques.\n       President Reagan could negotiate from strength because he \n     had reassured us that our own story was a positive one, and \n     that the sun was rising and not setting on America.\n       I do not know exactly what the substance was of the \n     President's early conversations with Gorbachev, but they \n     seemed to involve more the telling of stories than the \n     debating of theories. Debates like wars have a winner and \n     loser, but a story can celebrate the common victory of a \n     higher good. President Reagan never claimed victory in the \n     cold War. Rather, he seemed to be welcoming Russia into the \n     near-universal story of movement toward freedom and openness.\n       President Reagan also had respect for the Russians' own \n     story. In his important addresses of June 1988 at Moscow \n     State University, he repeatedly used Russian examples to \n     illustrate the universal principles of freedom and moral \n     responsibility. During the same Moscow summit, he invited for \n     lunch a full range of dissident Russian voices, each of whom \n     had a story to tell; and at the State dinner at Spaso House, \n     he invited many of these same figures and mixed them up at \n     tables with political leaders. Each dinner table brought the \n     best storytellers of the emerging reforms face-to-face for \n     the first time in one room with the powerful perpetuators of \n     outmoded theories.\n       I was able to observe first-hand, in the course of \n     preparations for and the execution of President Reagan's \n     Moscow summit in June 1988, how he supported the forces of \n     change at the level of both vision and tactics. The President \n     had asked me, as perhaps he had asked others on the eve of \n     the summit, a simple but centrally important question. How \n     was it possible, he asked, for people to survive with sanity \n     in such a cruel and repressive system? I did not have time to \n     think much about the question and responded instinctively, \n     largely on the basis of my own family's experience of living \n     there, ``Because of the women, Mr. President.'' It was the \n     babushkas who held the family together, staying at home while \n     both parents worked, creating a nest of warmth and honesty \n     that compensated for the falsehoods and\n\n[[Page S11697]]\n\n     absurdities of the system and the coldness of both the \n     climate and the bureaucracy.\n       At a dramatic moment at the Moscow summit of 1988, \n     President Reagan was asked by a Russian reporter on live \n     television if he had any messages to leave behind to the \n     Russian people. He replied that he wanted to send this \n     heartfelt greetings to the women of Russia for their role in \n     holding families together and transmitting the traditions and \n     values of the Russian people from one generation to another. \n     This spontaneous response was mentioned by almost all \n     Russians with whom I talked in the additional week I stayed \n     on after the summit to inventory popular reactions. And I \n     thought of this remark again when I was in Moscow three years \n     later as the entire system imploded during 48 dramatic hours \n     in August 1991. Crucial in the resistance against the coup \n     attempt of the dying Communist system were the old women who \n     castigated the young boys in the tanks and, in effect, became \n     an alternate chain of command, demanding that they obey their \n     mothers rather than their officers.\n       President Reagan's Moscow summit in 1988 coincided with the \n     Russian celebration of the Millennium of Christianity, and \n     the President had planned to visit the newly restored Danilov \n     Monastery and to identify himself with the old Biblical story \n     that Russians were then recovering. Many Americans, however, \n     were urging him to cancel this visit because of the role that \n     the Russian Orthodox Church hierarchy had played in \n     suppressing the rights of Uniate Catholics in the Ukraine. \n     The President resolved this dilemma not by retreating from \n     the visit but by using it energetically to endorse the \n     rights of the Catholic minority in the very sanctuary of \n     Russian Orthodoxy. He seems instinctively to have \n     understood that even imperfect sources of the good should \n     be supported if the mission is to expel the real evil that \n     had so long been camouflaged under the mask of utopian \n     perfection.\n       Of course, Ronald Reagan was not the only, and at times not \n     the main, hero of the story of the Cold War's ending. The \n     peoples of Eastern Europe and leaders like Gorbachev \n     basically affected the changes; and, on the American side, it \n     was a cumulative and essentially bi-partisan accomplishment.\n       But President Reagan, in playing out the all-important end \n     game of the Cold War, had a rare gift for making the American \n     people comfortable with the main lines of his foreign policy \n     even when they were uncomfortable with details.\n       At the end of an ideal story, good not only triumphs over \n     evil, but those who had been in darkness find the light and \n     every one lives happily ever after. We all know that even \n     this happy story did not quite work out this way. Many are \n     still in darkness in the East; there were and are some \n     shadows in our light; and it was not the end of history.\n       But the long-lingering cloud of potential total war was \n     evaporated along with the empire that might have activated \n     it. And our children and our children's children will always \n     owe a lot to a man who had a good story to tell, and like \n     most great storytellers, was at heart a romantic.\n       In most morality tales that have human appeal, there is a \n     strong woman who helps the forces of good overcome those of \n     evil and redeem the follies of man.\n       Ronald Reagan had--and still has--such a woman at his side. \n     At the Moscow summit of 1988, the President was sustained and \n     supported at every turn by a wife who did not simply do \n     traditional, ritual things, but read richly into Russian \n     history and subjected herself to a cram course that continued \n     right up to the moment Air Force One touched down in Moscow. \n     She then plunged into an overdrive schedule of visiting and \n     empathizing with almost all the positive elements in Russia \n     that were then pressing for change. As she debarked from the \n     plane, she was whisked by Raisa Gorbachev into the Cathedral \n     of the Assumption in the Kremlin, where she politely asked \n     why it was no longer the center of worship that it had been \n     and would once again soon become. She got up early the next \n     morning and asked to see Russia's greatest icons which had \n     been removed from public view by the regime, ostensibly for \n     restoration but probably also to avoid excessive veneration \n     during Russia's Millennium year of Christianity. By prying \n     these holy pictures out of the reserve collection of the \n     Tretyakov Gallery, she enabled Russians to see them since \n     there had to be television coverage of her visit.\n       She visited schools, writers, and Pastenak's grave, and--\n     all on one hectic day--the greatest single mind and the two \n     best cultural centers in St. Petersburg before returning by \n     plane to host the state dinner at which she inter-seated the \n     Soviet political establishment with its own cultural and \n     political opposition.\n       This whirlwind of activity exhausted her traveling \n     companions, like the wife of the Russian President, Mrs. \n     Gromyko, who observed on the plane going back to Moscow that \n     she had solemnly concluded that some kind of Supreme Being \n     might actually exist. Gorbachev met for the very first time \n     at Nancy Reagan's dinner Tengiz Abuladze, whose great film \n     ``Repentance'' was probably the most important, single \n     cultural document in pushing for the repudiation rather than \n     just the modification of the Soviet system.\n       Thanks, largely to Nancy, the Reagan story is not over just \n     because the sound track is now silent. The one key \n     illustration for this story is that of a man and woman, hand-\n     in-hand, who made their sunset years those of America's \n     sunrise.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     Remarks by Senator John McCain\n\n       A long running dispute among historians is whether great \n     men and women shape their times or whether the times shape \n     the person. I suspect both propositions are true, but, there \n     is no doubt that Ronald Reagan, a man who's character was \n     certainly shaped by the times, profoundly influenced the \n     course of human history. He did so in many ways which Senator \n     Lott so ably identified.\n       But, of all the lessons President Ronald Reagan also taught \n     the world, the one which transcended all the others was his \n     extraordinary insight into the universal appeal of American \n     Ideals and the ultimate futility of building walls to \n     freedom.\n       At the time Ronald Reagan began his presidency there were \n     few among us who shared his remarkable confidence that a new \n     age of enlightenment for the rights of man would be ascended \n     in all the corners of the world. This was not only possible \n     in some distant century but probable in our time. For most of \n     us who have lived through the long struggle between the \n     forces of freedom and the forces of tyranny the prospect of \n     our eventual triumph seemed a long distance off. Ronald \n     Reagan did not see it that way, Ronald Reagan did not believe \n     in walls. That was his genius. Ronald Reagan predicted to a \n     skeptical world that it was inevitable, eminent for freedom. \n     ``Let us by shy no longer'' he asked, ``let us go to our \n     strength. Let us offer hope, let us tell the world that a new \n     age is not only possible but probable.'' These words \n     marshaled the American people and their allies for a \n     reinvigorated campaign to support the forces of liberty in \n     some of the most closed societies on earth.\n       In one perfect sentence, that keen observer of the Reagan \n     Presidency, Lady Margaret Thatcher summed up President \n     Reagan's contribution to the astonishing changes in the world \n     today, `'Ronald Reagan won the Cold War without firing a \n     shot.'' Credit for the victory is shared by all who fought \n     and suffered for the idea that just government is derived \n     from the consent for the government.\n       Americans and freedom fighters everywhere recognize \n     President Reagan as the godfather of the contemporary \n     movement that would liberate half a billion people from \n     communism and authoritarianism.\n       Mrs. Reagan, tonight we are giving IRI's Freedom Award to \n     President Reagan to honor the man who's faith in our country \n     and it's mission is unyielding. But, we are here to honor you \n     as well for your long partnership with the President for the \n     work that has meant so much to America and the world. For \n     your shared commitment to preserve the ideals which make \n     America great, for your compassion for those who struggle to \n     live their lives as we live ours, free people in a free \n     country.\n       This is a fitting expression of our gratitude but it will \n     not suffice to honor the service you and the President \n     rendered to humanity, merely a token of our appreciation. The \n     highest tribute we can pay it to keep faith, your faith, and \n     the faith that shouts to tyrants, ``tear down this wall.'' \n     Like Ronald Reagan we must be destroyers, not builders of \n     walls. All Americans, especially Republicans gain courage \n     from your example and not fear the challenge from an every \n     smaller world. We should build our walls in a futile attempt \n     to keep the world at bay, not walls to people, no walls to \n     the free exchange of ideas, no walls to trade. Ronald Reagan \n     knew and you did, that an open competition of our ideals and \n     ingenuity assure dour success. You both knew that \n     isolationism and protectionism is a fools error. You both \n     knew that walls were for cowards, not for us, not for \n     Americans.\n       There are those who define this country by what we are \n     against and not what we are for. It is enough for them that \n     the United States opposed communism and once the threat \n     communism posed to our security was defeated they view \n     America as the champion of liberty to become an expensive \n     vanity which was sure to disappear with the Berlin wall. Such \n     a grand view of the American purpose insults the generous \n     spirit of Ronald Reagan who believed that supporting the \n     forces of democracy overseas was our abiding moral obligation \n     just as it was a practical necessity during the Cold War.\n       I am proud of Americas long and successful opposition to \n     communism, but being anti-communist was not enough. It was \n     never enough. In our efforts to help others secure the \n     blessings of liberty distinguishes us from all other nations \n     on earth. It was necessary to defeat communism to protect the \n     well-being of Americans but it was also necessary to defeat \n     communism because it threatened America's best sense of \n     itself and our sublime legacy to the world.\n       Mrs. Reagan, we thought long and hard about a gift to give \n     you and the President this evening in addition to the Freedom \n     Award. We decided upon something appropriate for the occasion \n     and to the spirit of the Reagan legacy. But without our \n     sincere commitment of carrying on that legacy, these tokens \n     will have little value, and on behalf of everyone here, I \n     give you and President Reagan that commitment.\n       Many years ago now, I and a great many friends were kept \n     behind walls in a place where human beings suffered for their \n     dignity without a feel to a just government. When we came \n     home many of us were eager to visit with two people we knew \n     who didn't believe in walls, two people who did the right\n\n[[Page S11698]]\n\n     things to help free us from the walls which confined us. Two \n     people who we knew kept faith in us as we were challenged to \n     keep faith in our country. You and, then, Governor Ronald \n     Reagan, graciously attended a homecoming reception for us one \n     evening in San Francisco. It was an event none of us will \n     ever forget, nor our admiration and appreciation for you \n     began many years before when we learned that taps on walls \n     and whispered conversations was work being done to help us \n     return to a land without walls.\n       This handsome box contains two symbols of the vision and \n     faith for which we and the President will always be \n     celebrating. The first is a piece of the multi-colored brick \n     taken from the rubble of what was once a prison wall built by \n     the French a century ago and called by the Vietnamese \n     `hoaloa'. The Americans who were later obliged to dwell \n     there, called it the `Hanoi Hilton'. These walls no longer \n     stand, the prison was demolished a few years ago and a real \n     hotel, presumably with better room service was erected in its \n     place.\n       The second gift is a customized POW bracelet inscribed to \n     you and President Reagan for your faith, loyalty and \n     perseverance from all of us who came home, as well as those \n     who did not, remember with enormous gratitude your loyalty to \n     us and your steadfast faith in the cause we serve.\n       There's a story about President and Mrs. Reagan that has \n     always impressed me, because it demonstrates their sincerity \n     and concern for Americans who suffer for their countries \n     sake. A long time ago, the President and Mrs. Reagan became \n     concerned about the plight of those who were held captive in \n     Vietnam. President Reagan decided to hold a press conference \n     to express his support for improvement in their treatment and \n     their rapid homecoming. At that press conference were \n     families and children of those who were missing in action at \n     that time. As President Reagan began his remarks for the bank \n     of cameras and media people there, a little boy, about three \n     years old, came forward from the crowd and tugged at his \n     sleeve. President Reagan bent over and the little boy \n     whispered in his ear and then President Reagan left with the \n     little boy to his office and then came back. It turns out \n     that the young boy had to go to the bathroom.\n       Then as President Reagan began his remarks again the young \n     boy tugged his sleeve again and Ronald Reagan bent over and \n     he said, ``Please, can you help bring my daddy home?'' \n     President Reagan from that time on wore a bracelet with \n     Captain Hanson's name on it.\n       Mrs. Reagan, your husband served and honored us and are \n     honoring us still. As you remember us, we will always \n     remember you. And stand witness to a greatness and a faith \n     that could not abide walls. Mrs. Reagan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   Remarks by Mrs. Nancy Reagan 1997\n\n       Thank you very much. Thank you for all our presents and for \n     a very kind introduction. Thank you, Trent and thank you, Jim \n     for those wonderful remarks about my husband and me. I do \n     know that I am not the speech maker in the family or the \n     storyteller. But I am very honored to be here tonight to \n     accept the 1997 IRI Freedom Award on my husband's behalf. I \n     wanted to be here tonight for him, especially since tonight \n     is really a special night for the both of us. Not only is the \n     IRI honoring my husband but it's been done in partnership \n     with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation that supports \n     the Reagan library and its programs. The library is a very \n     special place for both Ronnie and me. It's a place where the \n     legacy of Ronald Reagan is preserved for generations to come. \n     And speaking of legacies, the International Republican \n     Institute is really the living legacy of Ronald Reagan's \n     peace through strength approach to foreign policy. I know I \n     am being biased a little bit, I know you'll agree that during \n     his eight years in the White House, my husband encouraged \n     untold numbers of people around the world to move toward \n     democracy. Ronnie was a believer. He believed in the power of \n     freedom. He had a dream that in the twenty-first century \n     human beings would be respected everywhere, hoping that one \n     day, people of all nations would have the privilege of \n     basking in the light of freedom and I'm convinced that along \n     with your help and vision this dream will come true, and I \n     know you do to.\n       Thank you for inviting me here, for acknowledging my \n     roommate. I know that he will enjoy being a part of these \n     special people. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11695-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE INVESTITURE OF THE HONORABLE DEBORAH ROSS ADAMS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nHonorable Deborah Ross Adams on her appointment as a new judge of the \n36th District Court. On Friday, November 14 she will be invested and \nbegin her official duties.\n  Judge Adams is very deserving of this appointment. Throughout her \ncareer, she has maintained the strongest of commitments to the highest \njudicial standards. From her private practice to her role as a \nmagistrate, Judge Adams has been recognized by her peers for her \nimpartiality and broad knowledge of the law.\n  Judge Adams has accumulated this wealth of legal knowledge over \nseveral years and numerous experiences. After attending one of the most \noutstanding institutions of legal education in the Nation, she was a \nlaw clerk, started her own private practice, and served the city of \nDetroit, among other roles. These many experiences have afforded Judge \nAdams tremendous opportunities to gain a better, more comprehensive \nunderstanding of the law. In the process, she has become a most \nqualified individual.\n  Additionally, Judge Adams is very involved with her community. \nBelonging to numerous civic and professional organizations, Judge Adams \ncontinues to help the children and families of Michigan. Through these \nmany memberships, Judge Adams has come to know her community \nintimately; an education that especially prepares her for the role she \nnow undertakes.\n  Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to welcome Judge Adams to \nthe bench. Her reputation as being fair-minded precedes her, and I am \nconfident the 36th District and the State of Michigan will benefit from \nher tenure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11698-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11698-S11699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUDAN SANCTIONS ON TARGET\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nAdministration on a policy change announced today.\n  Last night President Clinton signed an executive order imposing \ncomprehensive sanctions on the Government of the Sudan. Specifically, \nthe United States has put into place new, unilateral sanctions that \nwill prevent the Government of the Sudan from reaping financial and \nmaterial gain from trade and investment initiatives by the United \nStates.\n  As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said earlier today, this \npolicy change is designed to send a strong signal to the Sudanese \nGovernment that it has failed to address the concerns expressed in no \nuncertain terms and on several occasions by the Clinton Administration. \nIn particular, the Sudan continues to engage in practices that we \nAmericans find unconscionable, including: providing sanctuary for \nindividuals and groups known to have engaged in terrorist activity; \nencouraging and supporting regional insur-gencies; continuing a violent \ncivil war that has cost the lives of thousands of civilians; and \nengaging in abominable human rights abuses.\n  Mr. President, these are the four main issues that continue to plague \nU.S.-Sudan relations. Let me take each of them in turn.\n  First, terrorism. Terrorism is clearly one of the most vexing threats \nto our national security today. Terrorist groups, by seeking to \ndestabilize or overthrow governments, serve to erode international \nstability. By its very nature, terrorism goes against everything we \nunderstand to be part of the ``international system,'' challenging us \nwith methods we do not necessarily comprehend. People--often, innocent \nbystanders--die as a result of such terrorism. Buildings are destroyed. \nAnd everyone's sense of personal safety is shattered.\n  According to the State Department's most recent Patterns of Global \nTerrorism report, Sudan ``continued to serve as a refuge, nexus, and \ntraining hub in 1995 for a number of international terrorist \norganizations,'' which likely include some of the most notorious groups \nin the world such as Hamas, Abu Nidal and Hezbollah, among others. In \naddition, the government continues to harbor individuals known to have \ncommitted terrorist acts. For example, it is widely believed that Osama \nBin Laden, who was once described by the State Department as ``one of \nthe most significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremist activities \nin the world,'' enjoyed refuge in the Sudan in the early 1990's.\n  Second, Sudan's support of insurgency movements in many of its \nneighboring countries poses a significant threat to regional stability. \nIn Eritrea, it supports the Eritrean Islamic Jihad, and in Uganda, it \nsupports both the Lord's Resistance Army and the West Bank Nile Front. \nSudanese government officals have been known to smuggle weapons into \nTunisia.\n  Third, Sudan continues to promote a brutal civil war against the \nlargely Christian and animist people of Southern Sudan. Sadly, during \nits 41 years of\n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\nindependence, Sudan has only seen about 11 years of peace. This \nseemingly endless conflict has taken the lives of more than 1.5 million \npeople and resulted in well over 2 million displaced persons or \nrefugees. Perhaps the saddest consequence of the war is that there are \nthousands of teenagers who do not remember a peaceful period, and who \nknow better the barrel of a gun than the inside of a classroom.\n  The international community has done the best that it can with this \nsituation; there are approximately 40 national and international \nhumanitarian organizations providing millions of dollars annually in \nfood aid and development assistance. For its part, the United States \ngovernment has provided more than $600 million in food assistance and \nnon-food disaster assistance since the mid-1980's.\n  The United Nations' Operation Lifeline Sudan [OLS], which maintains a \nunique agreement with parties to the conflict, has been instrumental in \nallowing humanitarian access to displaced persons in the southern \nSudan. I commend the humanitarian organizations operating in the region \nwho daily face not only enormous technical and logistical challenges in \nserving the Sudanese population, but also the all-too-frequent threat \nof another offensive nearby.\n  Fourth, the Sudanese government has a deplorable record in the area \nof human rights. According to the most recent State Department human \nrights report, the Khartoum government maintains not only regular \npolice and army units, but also internal and external security organs, \na militia unit, and a parallel police called the Popular Police, whose \nmission includes enforcing proper social behavior. In 1996, according \nto the report, government forces were responsible for extrajudicial \nkillings, disappearance, forced labor, slavery, and forced conscription \nof children. Basic freedoms--of assembly, of association, of privacy--\nare routinely restricted by the government. Worse, imposition of \nIslamic law on non-Muslims is far too common. An April 1997 U.N. Human \nRights Commission resolution identified pages of similar abuses.\n  Mr. President, this is not a regime that should be included in the \ncommunity of nations.\n  In response to Sudan's actions in these areas, particularly with \nrespect to terrorism, the U.S. government has imposed a series of \nsanctions on the current Sudanese regime over the past several years, \nincluding suspending its assistance program and denying senior Sudanese \ngovernment officials entry into the United States.\n  In part at my urging, the Administration officially designated Sudan \nas a state sponsor of terrorism by placing it on the so-called \n``terrorism list'' in 1993. Inclusion on the terrorism list, according \nto Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act (P.L.96-72), \nautomatically puts statutory restrictions on the bilateral relationship \nincluding prohibitions on foreign, agricultural, military and export-\nimport assistance, as well as licensing restrictions for dual use items \nand mandated U.S. opposition to loans from international financial \ninstitutions.\n  In addition, the United States has supported several resolutions by \nthe United Nations Security Council, including three demands that Sudan \nextradite three suspects wanted in connection with the failed 1995 \nassassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. After \nSudan failed to comply with these resolutions, the Council later \nadopted measures calling on member states to adopt travel restrictions \nand to ban flights by Sudanese-government controlled aircraft.\n  But, as important as these measures have been, Sudan has apparently \nrefused to get the message that its actions are simply unacceptable.\n  Sudan has the potential to be one of the most important countries in \nAfrica. It is the largest country on the continent and has a population \nof 29 million people. With cultural and geographic ties to both Arab \nNorth Africa and black sub-Saharan Africa, the Sudan has the potential \nto play a significant role in East Africa and the Gulf region.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, Sudan continues to squander that \npotential by engaging in or supporting outrageous acts of violence and \nterrorism.\n  So, Mr. President, I welcome the President's decision to take a \ntougher line with respect to Sudan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11698-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FEHBP + 65 DEMONSTRATION PROJECT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of S. 224, to allow \nMedicare--eligible military retirees to join the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan, I am pleased to cosponsor S. 1334, introduced by \nSenator Bond. S. 1334 will create a demonstration project to evaluate \nthe concept of increasing access to health care for military retirees \nby allowing them to enroll in the Federal employees plan.\n  After hearing from military retirees in Montana, I am convinced that \nFEHBP + 65, as it's called, is a necessary step to help ensure that \nmilitary retirees have access to quality health care. When military \nretirees turn 65, they no longer have guaranteed access to health care. \nThe lucky ones can get services from military treatment facilities \n[MTFs] on a space-available basis, but the rest do not have access to \nMTF's. They must rely on Medicare, which has less generous benefits and \nsignificant out-of-pocket costs, despite the commitment they received \nfor lifetime health benefits by virtue of their service to this \ncountry. They are the only group of Federal employees to have their \nhealth benefits cut off at age 65. That just not right.\n  The Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan is a popular program which \nprovides good benefits at a reasonable cost. It will serve military \nretirees well and uphold the Government's commitment to provide quality \nhealth benefits. Our military retirees deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11699-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11699-S11700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FUNDING OF THE MEDICAL CREEK TRIBAL COLLEGE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, would the chairman of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee yield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Senator Gorton and I have been working \nwith the Puyallup Tribe of Washington to establish base funding in the \nBIA budget for the Medicine Creek Tribal Community College in Tacoma, \nWA. The Tribe has been working diligently and patiently with the BIA to \nsecure the necessary accreditation to facilitate such base funding. I \nam happy to report that the tribe has just recently received such \naccreditation.\n  However, the BIA has recently denied the Puyallup request for funding \non the grounds that they had not established their accreditation, even \nthough that was not a requirement of the BIA rules when the initial \nrequest for funding was made. On April 8, 1997, I wrote the BIA to \nexpress my concern regarding an apparent accreditation ``catch-22''. It \nseemed that in order to be accredited, the school needed to demonstrate \na secure funding base. However, to secure a funding base the college \nneeded to be accredited. I expressed to the BIA my sincere desire to \nsee this apparent conundrum resolved. Over the past several months, it \nappeared that the BIA was, in fact, moving to address this issue. In a \nrecent meeting the tribe had with Michael Anderson, Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for Indian Affairs, they were assured they would receive \nfunding for fiscal year 1998. But we now understand that the BIA has \nchanged its mind and indicated that Medicine Creek Tribal College will \nnot receive funding for fiscal year 1998. This is not acceptable.\n  In the conference report on H.R. 2107, the conferees agreed to \nincrease funding for tribally controlled community colleges by \n$2,500,000 over the fiscal year 1997 level. Is it the intention of the \nchairman of the subcommittee that the Medicine Creek Tribal College be \neligible for some of this funding?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, like Senator Murray, I am disturbed that \nBIA has now taken the position that the Medicine Creek Tribal College \nwill not receive any funding. My office has worked with the tribe and \nunderstood that their funding needs would be met in fiscal year 1998. \nWe urge the BIA make funds available from the increase in tribal \ncommunity college funding to assist the Medicine Creek Tribal College \nmove forward with its recent accreditation.\n\n[[Page S11700]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, across our great Nation in the 50 \nState legislatures, we find true public servants who receive very \nlittle remuneration, but dedicate themselves to the challenge--the pain \nand the joy--of representing at the grassroots of American citizens. \nThey are the first line of defense and offense for our citizens.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to one who quietly and humbly personifies \nthe best qualities of these public servants. Delegate Lacey Putney of \nBig Island, VA, is the most senior member of the Virginia House of \nDelegates and the only Independent. When he is re-elected today, he \nwill tie with former speaker John Warren Cooke's record for the longest \nservice in Virginia's General Assembly--38 years.\n  Delegate Putney and I were classmates and close friends as students \nat Washington and Lee University a half century ago. I have been \nprivileged to count him as a valued advisor since that time.\n  As this month's ``Virginia--Capitol Connections'' magazine states: \n``Lacey Putney: The Democrats Want Him, The Republicans Want Him, But \nthe People of Virginia Have Him.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record at this point two \ntributes to Delegate Putney.\n  The tributes follow:\n\n                     The Honorable Lacey E. Putney\n\n                       (By Charles W. Gunn, Jr.)\n\n       Some forty-two years ago I first met Lacey Putney, the \n     country gentleman from Big Island, Virginia. This young man \n     was different from most in his comfortable approach to \n     strangers in that he assisted them while thanking them for \n     helping him. I never saw him ask for help, but I saw him \n     carefully seek out those who needed help.\n       His deep compassion for his fellow man was quite unique and \n     so needed in our world today. He is a man of action with many \n     personal accomplishments of assisting the most needy without \n     seeking public acknowledgment. When he hears of a need, he \n     responds either in person or else contacts the person or \n     agency who can best address the problem. He is tough and \n     thorough, while coupled with a soft heart. If you decide to \n     debate him, be certain you are well prepared, for he seldom \n     uses all of his ammunition but saves some for the rebuttal. \n     He rarely loses!\n       During his thirty-six years of selfless service, thousands \n     of citizens have been helped by his legislative actions. \n     Equally, thousands have been helped by his personal \n     involvement or intervention. He is an Independent by choice \n     (officially since 1967) but has always been independent in \n     making decisions in our government. If it's a matter of \n     principle, Lacey will take his stand even if he is alone. \n     That's integrity at it's best.\n       I am grateful to Lacey's wonderful wife, Elizbeth, and his \n     children, Susan and Edward, for their sacrifice in giving \n     Lacey their sincere support during these thirty-six years of \n     service to all Virginians.\n       Lacey touched my personal life and family in ways that were \n     miraculous as he did in dozens of lives that I am personally \n     aware of. His private nature and extreme humility prevent me \n     from detailing these ``personal blessings'' that he made \n     possible for many of us.\n       I am honored to have the privilege of sharing with you some \n     of the contributions made by the country boy from Big Island; \n     that man of great integrity, wisdom, faith, compassion and \n     humility; the gentleman from Bedford, the Honorable Lacey E. \n     Putney, House of Delegates member, Nineteenth District, with \n     thirty-six years of distinction.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       ``Bedford City Council works with a number of Virginia \n     legislators and it is gratifying to see the high level of \n     esteem and respect that Lacey is accorded from both his state \n     peers as well as national representatives.\n       ``Lacey has taken a personal interest in assuring that \n     Bedford has received proper recognition and the deserved \n     respect on the following:\n       ``Passage of legislation that guaranteed Barr Laboratories \n     locating in Bedford County;\n       ``Strong leadership position with respect to the National \n     D-Day Memorial's state funding;\n       ``Persistence with the Highway Commission to insure needed \n     work on Highway 501 and the Independence Boulevard project.\n       ``Lacey has responded to the needs of our community in real \n     time with real results.\n       ``Lacey plays a pretty good game of tennis for an old \n     guy.''--Skip Tharp, Bedford City Council.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11700-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11700-S11701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SURGE IN DIABETES\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I work with my colleagues to \nincrease federal support for combating the incidence of diabetes \nparticularly among minorities such as American Indians, Hispanics, \nBlacks, and Asians, I would like to draw your attention to an article \nin Monday's Washington Times, November 3, 1997. It is by Joyce Howard \nPrice and entitled ``Surge in diabetes tied to unhealthy lifestyles.''\n  Dr. Gerald Bernstein, President-elect of the American Diabetes \nAssociation, is reported to say that the national increase in diabetes \nwas predictable, ``given that the population is older, fatter, and less \nactive.''\n  Dr. Bernstein was referring to a report from the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (CDC) estimating that 16 million Americans \ncurrently have diabetes, but only 10 million have been diagnosed. He \nsaid, ``Cancer is much more dramatic and devastating. With diabetes, \nyou erode and rot away. It's almost like leprosy.''\n  The article goes on to quote Dr. Richard C. Eastman, director of the \nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases who \nsaid, ``While we usually get an increase of 3 to 4 percent, there was \nan 8 percent increase this year. We fund 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 \ninvestigators.'' Dr. Eastman estimates the current national research \neffort in diabetes at $200 million.\n  Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Donna Shalala agreed with \nme earlier this year that a special effort is needed to create a multi-\nmillion dollar effort for a ``large-scale, coordinated primary, \nsecondary, and tertiary prevention effort among the Navajo, who have a \nlarge population with a high incidence of diabetes and risk factors for \ndiabetes.''\n  I have reached agreements in the Senate Appropriations bill for \nLabor-HHS to fund such a center for preventing diabetes in Gallup, New \nMexico. In a colloquy with Subcommittee Chairman Arlen Specter, we will \naffirm the need for this center in our national approach to alleviating \nthe acute increases in diabetes, especially among American Indians \nwhose incidence rate is almost three times the national average.\n  Among Navajo Indians over age 45, two in five have been diagnosed as \ndiabetic, and many experts believe that almost four in five actually \nhave diabetes, but we will not know until our outreach and testing \nefforts are improved on this vast Indian reservation.\n  Dr. Bernstein ``points out that the gene that predisposes someone to \ndiabetes is five times more prevalent in American Indians than in \nwhites and twice as prevalent in blacks, Hispanics and Asians than in \nnon-Hispanic whites.'' He says the disease has ``failed to get priority \nstatus because it strikes minorities disproportionately.''\n  He is absolutely right about the lack of attention to the problems of \nNavajo and Zuni Indians in New Mexico and Arizona. I would remind my \ncolleagues that the Balanced Budget Act of 1998 has a $30 million per \nyear program for preventing and treating diabetes among American \nIndians through the Indian Health Service (IHS). This commitment is for \nfive years or a total of $150 million.\n  I am currently working with HHS Secretary Shalala to coordinate the \nefforts of this IHS funding from the Balanced Budget Act with CDC to \nfocus on designing more culturally relevant prevention and diagnosis \napproaches in a new prevention research center in Gallup, New Mexico. \nEven if we are slow to learn more about treating this dreaded disease, \nenough is known today to significantly control the negative end results \nof diabetes like blindness, amputation, and kidney failure.\n  I hope my colleagues will continue to support my efforts to create \nthis very specialized center for the study of improving prevention \ntechniques for Indians and other minorities. In the case of Navajo and \nZuni Indians, prevention can be difficult to incorporate into daily \nreservation life. Exercise programs may not be readily available, \ndietary changes may be contrary to local custom for preparing foods, or \nsoft drinks may be routinely substituted for drinking water that is not \nplentiful or potable.\n  These kinds of factors in Indian life will be studied carefully at \nthe Gallup Diabetes Prevention Research Center. Recommendations and CDC \nassistance will be provided to IHS service providers throughout the \nNavajo Nation, the Zuni Pueblo, and other Apache and\n\n[[Page S11701]]\n\nPueblo Indians in New Mexico and Arizona. It is my hope that improved \ndiagnostic and prevention programs will readily flow from this Gallup \ncenter to all IHS facilities around the country.\n  It may surprise my colleagues as it did me, that in the 1950's the \nIHS officially reported negligible rates of diabetes among Navajo \nIndians. In less than 50 years, diabetes has gone from negligible to \nrampant and epidemic.\n  I commend the Washington Times for this timely and informative update \non the surge in diabetes in our nation. I ask to have the entire \narticle printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  I believe this article is a poignant reminder of the seriousness of \nthis disease and its rapid growth in our country. My colleagues can \ncount on me to continue to help with the critical funding to control \nthis disease with every sensible means possible, especially among the \nFirst Americans who seem to suffer at disproportionately high rates. \nWith our funding successes of this year, I would urge my colleagues to \ncontinue to seek ways to combat the slow physical erosion that Dr. \nBernstein described as being almost like leprosy.\n  Dr. Bernstein is advocating for a billion dollars to expand urgent \nresearch and treatment of diabetes. I do not see this amount possible \nin our current budget situation, but I do concur that the medical costs \nof treating diabetes will continue to escalate unless our medical and \nprevention research efforts are more successful. I thank the Senate for \nthis year's strong support of our efforts in this year's budget to \nimprove the situation for all Americans who are susceptible to the \nravages of diabetes.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Nov. 3, 1997]\n\n   Surge in Diabetes Tied to Unhealthy Lifestyles--Doctors Call for \n                         Federal Research Funds\n\n                        (By Joyce Howard Price)\n\n       The president-elect of the American diabetes Association, \n     Dr. Gerald Bernstein, says no one should be surprised by the \n     explosion of diabetes in the United States today, confirmed \n     in a new federal report.\n       Given that the population is older, fatter and less active, \n     Dr. Bernstein says, the continued increase in diabetes was \n     predictable. He also criticizes the federal government for \n     ``totally inadequate'' levels of support for research.\n       With all its complications, he says, diabetes costs the \n     nation about $140 billion a year--about 15 percent of all \n     U.S. health expenditures:\n       ``While cancer, HIV [and other major diseases] get $5 to \n     $10 for research for every $100 spent on health care, \n     diabetes gets just 25 cents,'' says Dr. Bernstein, director \n     of the Harold Rifkin Diabetes Center in New York.\n       A report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention says about 16 million Americans currently have \n     diabetes, but only about 10 million have been diagnosed. The \n     number of diagnosed cases is up from 1.6 million in 1958.\n       Diabetes is the nation's seventh leading killer and was the \n     primary cause of more than 59,200 deaths in 1995, according \n     to the National Center for Health Statistics. But data also \n     indicate it may have contributed to as many as 180,000 deaths \n     that year.\n       ``We are becoming a more overweight population, we are less \n     active and we are also getting somewhat older,'' says Dr. \n     Frank Vinicor, director of the CDC's diabetes division. ``If \n     you put all of those factors together, we are seeing a \n     chronic disease epidemic occurring.''\n       Diabetes is a disease caused by a deficiency of insulin, a \n     hormone secreted by the pancreas that is necessary for the \n     metabolism of sugar.\n       Of the estimated 16 million diabetics in the United States \n     today, less than 1 million have Type I diabetes, meaning \n     their pancreases do not work at all, and they are insulin-\n     dependent. Type I diabetes usually occurs in childhood or \n     adolescence.\n       The overwhelming majority of diabetics have Type 2 \n     diabetes, a form of the disease that usually occurs after age \n     40 and is usually treated by diet, pills or both.\n       ``The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is increasing \n     tremendously in the United States as people adapt more \n     sedentary lifestyles and obesity increases,'' says Dr. \n     Stephen Clement, director of the Diabetes Center at \n     Georgetown University Medical Center.\n       Dr. Bernstein says ``more women die of diabetes than breast \n     cancer.''\n       Nevertheless, he says, it has been hard to ``politicize'' \n     diabetes except when young children are involved, because the \n     average Type 2 diabetic is a ``fat [adult] individual who's \n     not compliant'' with recommendations that he or she exercise \n     and adopt a healthy diet.\n       ``Cancer is much more dramatic and devastating. With \n     diabetes, you erode and rot away. It's almost like \n     leprosy,'' he says, explaining why this disease has been \n     given short shrift by political leaders, the media and \n     those handing out research dollars. He says the disease \n     has failed to get priority status because it strikes \n     minorities disproportionately.\n       He points out that the gene that predisposes someone to \n     diabetes is five times more prevalent in American Indians \n     than in whites and twice as prevalent in blacks, Hispanics \n     and Asians than in non-Hispanic whites.\n       Dr. Richard C. Eastman, director of the National Institute \n     of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, declines to \n     comment on the adequacy of research funding for diabetes, \n     which he says is currently $200 million a year.\n       ``We had a record (funding) increase this year,'' he says. \n     ``While we usually get an increase of 3 to 4 percent, there \n     was an 8 percent increase this year. We fund 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 \n     investigators.''\n       Dr. Bernstein says the recent push for stepped-up diabetes \n     research money came from medical insurers, overwhelmed by \n     having to pay the staggering costs of treating patients \n     stricken with strokes, cardiovascular disorders, nerve \n     damage, kidney problems, limb amputations, and vision loss \n     triggered by diabetes.\n       Cardiovascular disease and stroke risk are two to four \n     times more common among diabetics than the general \n     population, and better than 60 percent of diabetics have high \n     blood pressure and mild to severe neuropathy, or nerve \n     damage.\n       ``This disease is going to break the economic back of this \n     country, so the amount provided [by the federal government] \n     for diabetes research should be a billion dollars a year,'' \n     Dr. Bernstein says.\n       As evidence of the need for more research, he cites a \n     recent study by researchers at the University of Arkansas \n     ``who found a teen-age population that was obese, \n     hypertensive [had high blood pressure], and also had Type 2 \n     diabetes,'' a condition usually confined to middle-aged \n     adults. ``So we're now seeing it's all over the place.''\n       Dr. Clement agrees a lot more federal money is needed for \n     research. But he and Dr. Eastman point out that the National \n     Institutes of Health is currently funding large studies \n     designed to determine if both types of diabetes can be \n     prevented.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/04/senate-section/article/S11700-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11701-S11703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO COST ESTIMATE--S. 1228\n\n Mr. D'AMATO.

Alfonse M.

The CBO staff contact is John R. \n     Righter (for federal costs), and Matthew Eyles (for the \n     private-sector impact).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James L. Blum\n                                  (For June E. O'Neill, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n     S. 1228--50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act\n       Summary: S. 1228 would require the U.S. Mint to make \n     changes to the quarter-dollar and one-dollar coins and to \n     issue three coins commemorating the 100th anniversary of the \n     first flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. CBO estimates \n     that enacting this bill would decrease direct spending by $15 \n     million over the 1998-2002 period and by $40 million over the \n     1998-2007 period. Because the bill would affect direct \n     spending, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. S. 1228 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) \n     and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Description of the bill's major provisions: S. 1228 would \n     direct the Secretary of the Treasury to design and issue a \n     series of quarters commemorating the 50 states over a 10-year \n     period beginning in 1999. During this period, designs for \n     each state would replace the current eagle design on the \n     reverse side of\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\n     the George Washington quarter. The Mint would issue five \n     quarters a year in the order that the states ratified the \n     Constitution or were admitted into the Union. Before \n     selecting an emblem for each state, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury would consult with the state's governor and with the \n     federal Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) and would submit the \n     selected design for review by the Citizens Commemorative Coin \n     Advisory Committee (CCCAC). The bill would authorize the Mint \n     to sell silver replicas of the quarters--both in proof and \n     uncirculated versions.\n       S. 1228 also would permanently replace the current Susan B. \n     Anthony one-dollar coin with a new dollar coin. Under the \n     bill, the Mint could produce additional quantities of the \n     Susan B. Anthony, if needed, until the new coin was ready for \n     circulation. (The Mint predicts that public demand will \n     exhaust its current inventory of approximately 130 million \n     coins in about 30 months.) The new one-dollar coin would be \n     golden in color and have distinctive tactile and visual \n     features but would have the same diameter and weight as the \n     current coin. In consultation with the Congress, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury would select the designs for both \n     sides of the coin. The bill also would direct the Treasury to \n     market the coin to the American public before placing it into \n     circulation and to study and report to the Congress on the \n     results of its efforts. In addition, the Mint would have the \n     authority to include quantities of the new coin in collector \n     sets sold to the public prior to its introduction into \n     circulation. Unlike previous proposals to introduce a new \n     dollar coin, S. 1228 would not eliminate the one-dollar bill.\n       Finally, S. 1228 would direct the U.S. Mint to produce a \n     ten-dollar gold coin, a one-dollar silver coin, and a half-\n     dollar clad coin in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 commemorating \n     the 100th anniversary of the first flight of Orville and \n     Wilbur Wright at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In selecting a \n     design for each coin, the Secretary of the Treasury would \n     consult with the Board of Directors of the First Flight \n     Foundation and the CFA and submit the designs for review by \n     the CCCAC. The coins would be available for sale from August \n     1, 2003, through July 31, 2004. The price of each coin would \n     equal the sum of its face value, the amount of the surcharge \n     set for it by the bill, and the costs of the Mint to produce \n     it. The bill would set a surcharge of $35 per coin for the \n     ten-dollar coin, $10 per coin for the one-dollar coin, and $1 \n     per coin for the half-dollar coin. S. 1228 would require the \n     Mint to transfer all proceeds from surcharges to the First \n     Flight Foundation.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 1228 is shown in the following table. \n     The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 800 \n     (general government).\n       In addition to the budgetary effects summarized in the \n     table, by increasing the public's holding of coins, S. 1228 \n     also would result in the government acquiring additional \n     resources for financing the federal deficit. The seigniorage \n     (or profit, the difference between the face value of coins \n     and their cost of production) from placing the additional \n     coins in circulation would reduce the amount of government \n     borrowing from the public. Under the principles established \n     by the President's Commission on Budget Concepts in 1967, \n     seigniorage does not affect the deficit but is treated as a \n     means of financing the deficit.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         By fiscal year, in millions of \n                                                   dollars--            \n                                      ----------------------------------\n                                        1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING                       \n50 States Quarter Program:                                              \n  Estimated Budget Authority.........      0     -8     -5     -5     -5\n  Estimated Outlays..................      0     -8     -5     -5     -5\nNew One-Dollar Coin:                                                    \n  Estimated Budget Authority.........      1      3      3      1      0\n  Estimated Outlays..................      1      3      3      1      0\nNet Change in Direct Spending Under                                     \n S. 1228:                                                               \n  Estimated Budget Authority.........      1     -5     -2     -4     -5\n  Estimated Outlays..................      1     -5     -2     -4     -5\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--The table only includes provisions that would change direct      \n  spending in fiscal years 1998 through 2002. S. 1228 also includes a   \n  provision that would authorize the Mint to issue three commemorative  \n  coins during fiscal years 2003 and 2004.                              \n\n     Basis of estimate\n       Direct spending\n       50 States Circulating Commemorative Quarter Program. \n     Beginning in 1999, S. 1228 would authorize the Mint to sell \n     silver replicas of the redesigned 50 states quarters--both in \n     proof and uncirculated varieties. CBO estimates that enacting \n     this provision would decrease direct spending by $23 million \n     over the 1998-2002 period and by $48 million over the 1998-\n     2007 period.\n       CBO assumes the Mint would sell a five-coin proof set a \n     price of around $30, which would cover the full cost of the \n     set and provide it with a margin of profit consistent with \n     past silver proof sets. We also assume the Mint would sell \n     each uncirculated silver quarter at a price equal to the spot \n     price of silver plus a markup of 3 percent. Because the \n     silver replicas would be sold as a commercial product, the \n     receipts would constitute offsetting collections to the Mint. \n     Based on information provided by the Mint, including \n     historical sales and profit data for past silver proof and \n     uncirculated designs, CBO estimates that the sale of the \n     silver replicas would increase offsetting collections to the \n     Mint by about $10 million each year for a total of $40 \n     million over the 1999-2002 period. This estimate assumes \n     that, on average, the Mint would sell about 1 million five-\n     coin proof sets each year, which would generate the $10 \n     million in profits. CBO expects that the profits earned in \n     any one year from selling uncirculated versions of the \n     quarters would not be significant.\n       Public Law 104-52, which established the U.S. Mint Public \n     Enterprise Fund, requires the Mint to transfer any excess \n     funds to the general fund of the Treasury at least annually. \n     For the purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that the Mint \n     would retain about one-half of the $10 million in increased \n     offsetting collections generated from annual sales of the \n     silver replicas. We estimate that half of the amount retained \n     would be spent in the same fiscal year, with the other half \n     spent in the following fiscal year. In total, net direct \n     spending would decrease by between $20 million and $25 \n     million over the 1998-2002 period, or by about one-half of \n     the increase in offsetting collections to the Mint.\n       New One-Dollar Coin. S. 1228 would replace the current \n     Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin with a new one-dollar coin. \n     The bill would authorize the Mint to produce quantities of \n     the Susan B. Anthony, as needed, until the new coin was ready \n     for circulation. (The Mint has not produced any new Susan B. \n     Anthony coins since 1981). According to the Mint, it would \n     need at least 30 months to design, test, and produce a new \n     one-dollar coin for circulation. Thus, assuming this bill is \n     enacted within the next several months. CBO expects that the \n     new coin would not begin circulating before sometime in \n     fiscal year 2000. CBO estimates that producing a new one-\n     dollar coin would increase direct spending by between $5 \n     million and $10 million over the 1998-2002 period.\n       Previously, the Mint has estimated cost of about $93 \n     million to purchase the necessary infrastructure and \n     materials and to design and promote a new one-dollar coin. \n     That estimate, however, assumed that the one-dollar bill \n     would be eliminated, and that the Mint would produce an \n     initial supply of approximately 9 billion coins to meet the \n     public's demand for one-dollar currency. Under S. 1228, CBO \n     expects the public's annual demand for one-dollar coins would \n     approximate the roughly 50 million Susan B. Anthony coins \n     currently added to the nation's circulation of coins each \n     year. Thus, based on information provided by the Mint, CBO \n     estimates start-up costs under this bill of between $5 \n     million and $10 million. That estimate includes the costs to \n     research, design, and test the new coin and to market it to \n     the public. CBO estimates the Mint would also incur costs of \n     less than $500,000 in fiscal year 2001 to study the effects \n     of the marketing program and report its results to the \n     Congress by March 31, 2001.\n       S. 1228 also would authorize the Mint to include the \n     redesigned dollar coin in coin sets sold as commercial \n     products to the public. The Mint currently offers a five-coin \n     proof set, a five-coin silver proof set, and a 10-coin \n     uncirculated set. Adding a redesigned dollar coin to one or \n     all of these sets could increase offsetting collections to \n     the U.S. Mint Public Enterprise Fund if its addition \n     increases collectors' interest in the sets. It is uncertain \n     whether the Mint would add a redesigned dollar coin to each \n     of these sets. Given the addition of the commercial items \n     that would be included under the 50 states quarter program, \n     as well as the Mint's recent introduction of platinum coins \n     and its expected first-time issue of .9999 fine gold coin \n     sets, CBO estimates that even if the Mint does include the \n     new dollar coin, any increase in net offsetting collections \n     from the sale of all commercial products would be small--\n     as much as several million dollars in the first two \n     years--and largely one-time. In addition, CBO estimates \n     that the Mint would retain and spend any additional \n     collections, resulting in no net budgetary effect over \n     time.\n       Commemorative Coins. S. 1228 would direct the Mint to \n     produce and issue three coins commemorating the 100th \n     anniversary of the first flight at Kitty Hawk, North \n     Carolina. Because the coins would not become available until \n     2003, the provision would have no budgetary impact over the \n     next five years. CBO estimates that the provision would have \n     no net budgetary effect over the 1998-2007 period. The bill \n     could raise as much as $9.25 million in surcharges if the \n     Mint sold the maximum mintage level authorized for each coin, \n     although the experience of recent anniversary-based \n     commemoratives suggests that sales would be less than the \n     authorized total of 1.35 million coins. Because the bill \n     would require that the Mint transfer all surcharges to the \n     First Flight Foundation, a nonfederal entity, proceeds from \n     surcharges would have no net budgetary impact over time. We \n     expect that the Mint would retain and spend any additional \n     net proceeds generated from such sales to fund other \n     commercial activities.\n       Seigniorage\n       In addition to the bills' effects on direct spending, by \n     increasing the public's holding of quarters, S. 1228 also \n     would result in the government acquiring additional resources \n     for financing the federal deficit. Based on the previous \n     experience of both the United States, with the bicentennial \n     quarter in 1975 and 1976, and Canada, with its series of \n     quarters commemorating its 12 provinces and territories in \n     1992, CBO expects that enacting the bill would lead to a \n     greater production of quarters. The seigniorage, or profit, \n     from placing the additional coins in circulation would reduce \n     the amount of government borrowing from the public. Such \n     profits are\n\n[[Page S11703]]\n\n     likely to be very significant--the Mint estimates that the \n     seigniorage from making a quarter is 20.2 cents, so for each \n     additional $100 million worth of quarters put into \n     circulation each year for 10 years, the amount of seigniorage \n     earned by the federal government would increase by about $808 \n     million over the ten-year period.\n       By substituting a new dollar coin for the current Susan B. \n     Anthony, the legislation could also affect the seigniorage \n     earned--estimated at 92 cents per coin--from circulating one-\n     dollar coins. That increase would occur only to the extent \n     that the public demanded more one-dollar coins than under \n     current law. (According to the Mint, the federal government \n     currently is increasing the amount of Susan B. Anthony \n     dollars placed in circulation by about 50 million coins each \n     year.) Because S. 1228 would not eliminate the one-dollar \n     bill, CBO expects that any increase in circulation of the \n     one-dollar coin would not be significant.\n       Previously, CBO has done estimates for proposals that would \n     replace the one-dollar bill with a new one-dollar coin.

However, some \n     private-sector entities would incur costs as a result of \n     provisions in the bill to issue a new dollar coin. Vending \n     machine operators who choose to accept the new coin, for \n     example, would be required to modify their machines because \n     the electromagnetic properties of the new gold-colored dollar \n     coin would be different from those of the Susan B. Anthony \n     dollar (which many machines are currently equipped to \n     accept). Costs of modification would be reduced if the new \n     coins were used with some regularity and operators were able \n     to eliminate bill acceptors from most vending machines. In \n     addition, to the extent that the dollar coin circulates even \n     modestly, depository institutions would incur some additional \n     expenses because they bear a substantial share of processing \n     costs for all circulating coinage. Other entities, such as \n     mass transit authorities, would experience lower costs \n     because coins can be collected and processed at a cost that \n     is significantly lower than notes. Mass transit authorities, \n     however, are generally publicly operated and therefore not \n     included in the private sector. Nevertheless, because no \n     provision in federal law requires any person or organization \n     to accept a specific form of payment, including the proposed \n     new dollar coin, S. 1228 contains no private-sector mandates \n     as defined in UMRA.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: John R. Righter. \n     Impact on the Private Sector: Matthew Eyles.\n       Estimated approved by: Paul N.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this bill exempts adopted immigrant \nchildren ages 10 and under from the battery of immunizations they would \nnormally have to receive before being allowed to enter the United \nStates.\n  I share Senator Abraham's disappointment that this bill does not go \nfurther. The immunization requirement which has caused so many problems \nfor all immigrants, including the parents of adopted immigrant \nchildren, was passed as a part of last year's immigration bill. This \nprovision requires all immigrants to receive the entire series of \nvaccinations recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization \nPractices before they are allowed to enter the United States. During \nthe debate of the immigration bill, significant concerns were raised \nthat this requirement would lead to many unintended results, such as \nforged immunization records, unavailability of vaccines, and inadequate \nhealth care if the immigrant had an adverse reaction to a vaccine.\n  As a result of these concerns, the Senate passed a modified \nimmunization provision, requiring immigrants to obtain most of their \nimmunizations after they entered the United States, where vaccines and \nhealth care are available and adequate. Unfortunately, the Senate \nprovisions were dropped in the conference on the final bill. Our\n\n[[Page S11704]]\n\nconcerns were borne out, and the bill we are about to pass deals with \npart of the problems caused by the overseas immunization requirement. I \nhad hoped we could pass a bill that exempted all immigrant children, \nnot just adopted immigrant children, from this requirement. However, \nthe adoptive parents are legitimately concerned about their children's \nhealth, and they deserve this relief. I urge my colleagues to approve \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 237, S. 1231.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1231) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     years 1998 and 1999 for the United States Fire \n     Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1231 as \nreported by the Commerce Committee. This bill would reauthorize the \nprograms of the U.S. Fire Administration [USFA].\n  As I stated when we introduced this bill, it is a tragic statistic \nthat the United States currently has one of the worst fire records of \nany country in the industrial world with more than 2 million fires \nreported in the United States every year. Even more tragic is the fact \nthat these fires result in over 4,500 deaths, 30,000 civilian injuries, \nand billions property losses.\n  The USFA has done a tremendous job since its creation in 1974, \npursuant to the recommendation of the National Commission on Fire and \nControl, in reducing deaths and damage caused by fires. This bill \nbefore the Senate today will allow the USFA to continue assisting our \nNation's 1.2 million member fire service in doing their job, \nefficiently and safely, with the best technology available.\n  Mr. President, the fire service is one of the most hazardous \nprofessions in the country. Firefighters not only confront daily the \ndangers of fire; they also are required to respond to other natural \ndisasters, such as earthquakes, floods, medical emergencies, and \nhazardous materials spills.\n  Finally, we are all well aware of the recent rise in arson activities \nin this country. Arsonists are responsible for over 500,000 fires every \nyear. Arson is the No. 1 cause of all fires, and is the second leading \ncause of fire deaths in residences.\n  The USFA has initiated several measures to combat this weapon of \nhatred, including: community grants in high risk areas to hire part-\ntime law enforcement officers, and to pay for law enforcement overtime \nand other church arson prevention activities; National Fire Academy \ntraining courses; additional training and education for arson \ninvestigators with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; arson \nprevention information for the general public; and juvenile arson \nprevention workshops. This bill allows these efforts to continue.\n  Mr. President, we owe our support to this Nation's 1.2 million \nfirefighters who risk their lives every day to save the lives and \nproperty of others. By passing this bill, the USFA can continue \nproviding the education, data analysis, training, and technology needed \nto enable these brave individuals to do their job as efficiently and \nsafely as possible. This bill ensures that both firefighters and the \nUSFA get the financial resources they need to serve the public. I \nencourage my colleagues to support passage of S. 1231.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1231) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1231\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

NOTICE.\n\n       (a) Major Reorganization Defined.--With respect to the \n     United States Fire Administration, the term ``major \n     reorganization'' means any reorganization of the \n     Administration that involves the reassignment of more than 25 \n     percent of the employees of the Administration.\n       (b) Notice of Reprogramming.--If any funds appropriated \n     pursuant to the amendments made by this Act are subject to a \n     reprogramming action that requires notice to be provided to \n     the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives, notice of that action shall concurrently \n     be provided to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Science of \n     the House of Representatives.\n       (c) Notice of Reorganization.--Not later than 15 days \n     before any major reorganization of any program, project, or \n     activity of the United States Fire Administration, the \n     Administrator of the United States Fire Administration shall \n     provide notice to the Committees on Science and \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committees on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and \n     Appropriations of the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE YEAR 2000 PROBLEM.\n\n       With the year 2000 rapidly approaching, it is the sense of \n     Congress that the Administrator of the United States Fire \n     Administration should--\n       (1) give high priority to correcting all 2-digit date-\n     related problems in the computer systems of the United States \n     Fire Administration to ensure that those systems continue to \n     operate effectively in the year 2000 and in subsequent years;\n       (2) as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, assess the extent of the risk to the operations of \n     the United States Fire Administration posed by the problems \n     referred to in paragraph (1), and plan and budget for \n     achieving compliance for all of the mission-critical systems \n     of the system by the year 2000; and\n       (3) develop contingency plans for those systems that the \n     United States Fire Administration is unable to correct by the \n     year 2000.\n\n     SEC. 7.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited the ``Battle of Midway National \n     Memorial Study Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) September 2, 1997, marked the 52nd anniversary of the \n     United States victory over Japan in World War II.\n       (2) The Battle of Midway proved to be the turning point in \n     the war in the Pacific, as United States Navy forces \n     inflicted such severe losses on the Imperial Japanese Navy \n     during the battle that the Imperial Japanese Navy never again \n     took the offensive against the United States or the allied \n     forces.\n       (3) During the Battle of Midway on June 4, 1942, an \n     outnumbered force of the United States Navy, consisting of 29 \n     ships and other units of the Armed Forces under the command \n     of Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Spruance, out-maneuvered and \n     out-fought 350 ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n       (4) It is in the public interest to study whether Midway \n     Atoll should be established as a national memorial to the \n     Battle of Midway to express the enduring gratitude of the \n     American people for victory in the battle and to inspire \n     future generations of Americans with the heroism and \n     sacrifice of the members of the Armed Forces who achieved \n     that victory.\n       (5) The historic structures and facilities on Midway Atoll \n     should be protected and maintained.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to require a study of the \n     feasibility and suitability of designating the Midway Atoll \n     as a National Memorial to the Battle of Midway within the \n     boundaries of the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. The \n     study of the Midway Atoll and its environs shall include, but \n     not be limited to, identification of interpretative \n     opportunities for the educational and inspirational benefit \n     of present and future generations, and of the unique and \n     significant circumstances involving the defense of the island \n     by the United States in World War II and the Battle of \n     Midway.\n\n     SEC. 4. STUDY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MIDWAY ATOLL AS A \n                   NATIONAL MEMORIAL TO THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than six months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall, acting through the Director of the National Park \n     Service and in consultation with the Director of the United \n     States and Wildlife Service, the International Midway \n     Memorial Foundation, Inc.

The \n     report shall also include an inventory of all known past and \n     present facilities and structures of historic significance on \n     Midway Atoll and its environs. The report shall include a \n     description of each historic facility and structure and a \n     discussion of how each will contribute to the designation and \n     interpretation of the proposed national memorial.\n\n     SEC. CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to delay or prohibit \n     discussions between the Foundation and the United States Fish \n     and Wildlife Service or any other government entity regarding \n     the future role of the Foundation on Midway Atoll.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of calendar No. 238, S. 1324.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1324) to deauthorize a portion of the project \n     for navigation, Biloxi Harbor, Mississippi.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 1324, a \nbill introduced by Senator Lott to deauthorize a portion of the project \nfor navigation at Biloxi Harbor, MS. The Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works unanimously approved this measure on \nOctober 29, 1997.\n  This technical legislation is necessary as the Mississippi Department \nof Transportation intends to replace an existing bascule bridge, which \nspans a segment of the Bernard Bayou Federal navigation channel in \nBiloxi Harbor, with a fixed span bridge. Construction of the fixed span \nbridge would obstruct the navigation channel, which was authorized as \npart of the 1960 River and Harbor Act. However, the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers has determined that there is no current or expected \ncommercial navigation along the channel.\n  Thus, deauthorization of a portion of the Bernard Bayou Federal \nchannel appropriately addressed an artifact of the 1960 authorization \nand allows for construction of the fixed span bridge. The Army Corps of \nEngineers has informed the Congress that it has no objection to \ndeauthorization of the Bernard Bayou Federal navigation channel segment \nidentified in S. 1324. Mr. President, I encourage Senate adoption of \nthis necessary measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from June O'Neill of the CBO to \nme be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. CONGRESS,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 1997.\n     Hon. John H. Chafee,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1324, a bill to \n     deauthorize a portion of the project for navigation, Biloxi \n     Harbor, Mississippi.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.

The bill contains no intergovernmental \n     or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act of 1995, and would impose no costs on \n     state, local, or tribal governments.\n       S. 1324 would deauthorize a portion of the project for \n     navigation of Bernard Bayou Channel, Biloxi, Mississippi, \n     that was authorized by the River and Harbor Act of 1960. The \n     deauthorization would allow the Mississippi Department of \n     Transportation to replace the existing bascule bridge \n     (drawbridge) that spans that channel with a fixed-span \n     bridge. Any costs associated with constructing a bridge would \n     be incurred voluntarily by the state of Mississippi.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. the CBO staff contact is Gary Brown. \n     This estimate was approved by Robert A. Sunshine, Deputy \n     Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.
