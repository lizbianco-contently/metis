Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask the following Senators be listed as \noriginal cosponsors of the amendment: Senator Frist, Senator Hagel, \nSenator Mack, Senator Coverdell, Senator Helms, Senator Bob Smith, \nSenator Domenici, Senator Nickles, and Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last fall during the debate of the Labor, \nEducation appropriations bill, I introduced an amendment to consolidate \nmore than a dozen Federal aid programs for education from kindergarten \nthrough 12th grade into a single block grant, with the block grant \ngoing to each individual school district across the United States. The \namendment had\n\n[[Page S3376]]\n\nthree goals: To see to it that each school district receive more money \nthan it does at the present time by sending directly to the school \ndistricts money now kept by the Department of Education for \nadministrative purposes and money kept by State educational agencies \nfor administrative purposes. The second goal was to reduce the flood, \nthe blizzard, of paperwork imposed on all of our school districts \nacross the country with respect to dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of \nseparate programs directly or indirectly aimed at the education of our \nchildren between kindergarten and 12th grade. And the third and \nphilosophical reason for the amendment was the belief that the \nprofessional educators, the parents, and the elected school board \nmembers in each State and school district in this country had the \neducation of their children close to their hearts and really knew, in \neach community, more about what the children of that community required \nin connection with education policy than did any person in Washington, \nDC, whether a bureaucrat in the Department of Education or a U.S. \nSenator in this body.\n  Perhaps the most difficult conclusion for any of us here to reach is \nthat maybe we don't know as much as do people at home about the \nimmediate problems and challenges that they face in a wide range of \nareas--in this case, most particularly, education. So it was an attempt \nto allow 10,000 flowers to bloom, to allow each individual school \ndistrict far more discretion than it has at the present time to \ndetermine where Federal aid could best be used. After all, we only come \nup with 6 to 8 percent of the money that our schools spend. We don't \nhave a right to come up with 50 or 60 percent of the rules and \nregulations and forms with which our schools must contend. That burden \nlessens the ability of teachers to teach and administrators to \nadminister and school board members to set policies.\n  Somewhat to my surprise, that amendment was passed by a vote of 51 to \n49. It was objected to, partly on substantive grounds and partly on \nprocedural grounds. It had not been the subject of hearings. The House \nof Representatives was uncomfortable with it. The President was \nopposed. And it was eventually dropped in the conference committee on \nthat appropriations bill. Since then, however, it has been a matter of \nmajor discussion among school officials all across the United States. \nIt has been the subject of hearings here in the U.S. Senate, conducted \nby my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator Frist from Tennessee, \non a bipartisan basis. I have spent countless hours talking to \neducators on the subject and listening to both their praise and to \ntheir concerns. As a consequence, this amendment is somewhat changed \nfrom the previous amendment. This amendment will last for 5 years, but \nits effective date will be delayed in order to give the people of each \nState a very real choice in the way in which they receive their Federal \naid for education.\n  We heard the representative of at least one State school \nsuperintendent say that he liked the present system. We heard several \nState school superintendents say how much more they could do with the \nmoney dramatically to reform education policy if the money came to each \nof the 50 States, to their Governor or to their superintendent of \nschools. Many of the outside intellectuals and academics in the field \nof education feel that it is at the State level that true education \nreform is taking place.\n  We hear from many school board members--I hear from many of them in \nmy home State and so do other Members--that they liked my original \nproposal to get rid of both bureaucracies and allow each individual \nschool district to make these decisions.\n  So this amendment gives each State a choice. The State legislature in \nthe next year may elect to continue the present system, it may elect to \ntake the money at the State level going through whatever educational \nestablishment that State has established, or it may elect, either \npositively or by taking no action, to allow the money to go directly \nthrough to school districts.\n  Senator Frist will offer a second-degree amendment allowing that \nchoice to be rescinded to change the amendment I think friendly to the \nproposition.\n  As a consequence, we will be able to determine whether or not the \nproposal I made last year is a significant benefit to education, \nwhether the best system is one in which each State makes its own \nchoices, much as we have done with respect to welfare reform, or \nwhether the present system is best, because there will be States that \nmake each of these three decisions.\n  I hope that this will turn this proposal into a bipartisan proposal. \nI am not sure why anyone should oppose that triple option allowing a \ndifferent way of doing things. Only if we regarded the present \neducation system as perfect should we reject an experiment of this \nsort.\n  The second objection, the second apprehension that was close to \nuniversal, was the proposition that if we went to a block grant, if we \ncombined all of these ideas into a block grant, Congress would \nimmediately lose interest in education and the block grant would \ninevitably decline and that the money wouldn't be there for schools. I \nbelieve the interest in education here to be high enough so that that \nwould not have taken place, but the concern was very real.\n  In responding to that concern, we have set authorization levels for \nthe 5 years during which this experiment will take place, each of which \nrises modestly in each of those years consistent with the balanced \nbudget agreement and the projections of the freeze under which \ndiscretionary spending will operate. This proposal says that if in any \nyear we don't meet that authorization level, the whole experiment falls \nand ends, and we go back to the present system. We have guaranteed not \nonly a continuation of effort, we have guaranteed a modest increase in \nthat effort over the years.\n  Finally, we have a hold harmless under which school districts say \nthat no school will receive less money if they elect one of the two \nsystems other than continuing the status quo than they would have \nreceived otherwise, with the distribution of title I money based on the \nnumber of title I eligible students fundamentally, bilingual money \nbased on the number of bilingual students fundamentally, and a \ndistribution of the balance on the basis of the prosperity and poverty \nof a given State.\n  I think we have something very positive for education here, a system \nthat will get more money into the classroom, will allow more \nexperimentation, will allow us to find out whether the present system \nis the best system we can come up with or a State-based system or a \nlocal-based system.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues of both parties to \nlook at this very carefully, not to judge it necessarily on the basis \nof the way in which they judged last year's proposal but to judge it on \nthe basis of whether or not they have a sufficient trust in their own \nelected school board members, elected by the same people who elect us, \nto make better judgments, in some cases, about their schools than we \ncan make here on a one-size-fits-all basis in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Gorton amendment. I \nlistened with great interest to the Senator's presentation, as I did \nthe last time we debated this issue. Of course, we understand now that \nif the States want to go out to their taxpayers and raise taxes and to \nvote those taxes to any of the points that the Senator desires, they \nhave every right to do so, and there is nothing that any of us are \ndoing here that would prohibit them from doing it.\n  The fact is that the resources which are being provided here and \nwhich the amendment is directed to are the resources that are being \nraised at the Federal level and have been targeted to those aspects of \nour educational systems that have been identified as being meaningful \nin terms of our national interest and our national purpose. The \nSenator's amendment effectively eliminates the Drug-Free Schools \nProgram. That would be included in his block grant, but the funding \nwould not be there.\n\n  Maybe parents are speaking to the Senator from Washington and saying \nthey don't like a drug-free program in their schools, but parents in my \nState are saying they like it and they hope it will be enhanced.\n\n[[Page S3377]]\n\n  They talk about dispute resolutions that are being developed in \nvarious schools. They don't want that program emasculated or \neffectively destroyed. It does not reach a level of priority in the \nGorton amendment.\n  When I go around my State of Massachusetts, particularly after all of \nthe publicity that was received in the international competition about \nwhere the United States stood in areas of math and science, they are \nnot saying cut out the Eisenhower Math and Science Education Training \nProgram. They are asking me, ``Do we have in our schools qualified \nteachers in math and science, and what are you going to do in your \nhigher ed bill to try to have enhanced math and science qualified \nteachers who are going to teach our children in our schools?''\n  Too many of the teachers who are teaching in the schools in my \nState--and in every other State, I might add--are not qualified to \nteach in their particular courses. One of the most effective programs \nis math and science under the Eisenhower program. That doesn't exist in \nthe Gorton amendment.\n  Maybe people are going around and saying to their Senators that math \nand science training and additional enhancements for our teachers is \nsomething in which they are not interested. But I do not hear that in \nMassachusetts. I do not hear that.\n  We have support for programming that is going to enhance academic \nachievement and accomplishments to raise the bar. One of the most \nimportant transitions we have seen in terms of education policy is to \nfree ourselves from dumbing down academics, from social promotions in \nthe various schools, and setting high academic standards. The \nprovisions that exist in Federal law would be virtually eliminated by \nthe Senator's amendment. I do not find parents in my State saying, ``We \nare not interested in establishing higher academic standards in our \nschools.'' That is eliminated.\n  If, in particular, communities do not choose to take advantage of \nthese programs, they do not have to take advantage of these programs. \nBut why deny the people in my State the opportunity to take advantage \nof it if it is desired in the local community and the State makes that \ndetermination of priority? It is a partnership today. It is a \npartnership, but they effectively are denying it under the Gorton block \ngrant resolution.\n  Mr. President, our role is extremely limited. We provide maybe 7 \ncents out of every dollar that is extended locally--maybe 6, 7, 8 \ncents. A chunk of that goes into nutrition programs. A good part of \nthat is the title I programs, additional help and assistance in terms \nof IDEA, a small part in terms of the bilingual program and a few \nothers, such as the math and science programs. In the Eisenhower math \nand science training, it is about $360 million, but it is a very good \nqualified program. And for the life of me, I do not understand where \nthis demand is coming to vitiate that and eliminate those programs.\n\n  If a particular community wants to innovate and create and try to do \nall these other kinds of matters that the Senator talks about, then let \nthem go ahead and do it, let them go ahead and do it. But these \nprograms have been targeted, been basically developed with strong \nbipartisan support, I might add, or they would not be on the books. We \nhave had strong bipartisan support in terms of the safe and drug-free \nschools.\n  We have had it with regard to the Eisenhower training programs, math \nand science training programs. They will be reinstated when we are \ndealing again with the Higher Ed Act, with strong bipartisan support. \nEffectively, we are saying, without a day of hearings, with a very \nlimited debate here for 30 minutes--a few hours in the last session of \nCongress--that we are effectively emasculating all of these programs.\n  It is not sound education policy, and I think it is unwise policy for \nus to be considering at this particular time. We ought to be looking \nand evaluating each of these programs one by one. If they are having a \nheavy administrative burden, we ought to examine that and address that. \nThat is why we are commending the work that has been worked out with \nSenator DeWine, Senator Wellstone, Senator Jeffords, and others in our \ncommittee for consolidating various work training programs, 126 work \ntraining programs in six different agencies to eliminate those \nadministrative costs and to try to do it in a way as to protect the \nfunction but eliminate a lot of the administrative costs.\n  We have been involved in the last several years with waiving various \nrules and regulations in States and in educational districts, which is \nworking out. And we can do that, selectively and effectively. We \nwelcome the opportunity to do so. We have had evaluations, and they are \neffective. We welcome the opportunity to work with Members here. The \nleader in that effort was Senator Hatfield of Oregon, who is a leader \nin education as well as an attempt to try to give the focus of limited \nFederal funds to areas which have national purpose and national accord.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we do not have accountability under the \nGorton amendment. We hear a great deal about trying to have greater \naccountability so we know what are going to be the results of \ninvestments of scarce Federal funds. We do not have that in the Gorton \namendment. We do not know what is going to happen when that money goes \nout into these various communities. There may be some feel-good \nmeasures that people feel good that they are able to try to move \nvarious resources around in different directions, but we do not know \nwhat the outcomes are going to be. You do not have the accountability.\n  So finally I just say that we have a relationship at the Federal, \nState, and local community levels in terms of education. It is a \npartnership. I think it is fair to review that partnership. It is fair \nto examine various programs and what is effective in that partnership. \nBut we raise money at the Federal level for national purposes, safe and \ndrug-free schools. We made that a part of our war on drugs in this \ncountry.\n  It is a matter of national policy. We said we want, as a national \npolicy, to have drug-free schools. That is effectively eliminated in \nthis program. We said we want focus and attention on math and science \nin our schools, and we developed a program that if initiated in the \nlocal communities on a competitive basis will provide those resources. \nThat program is eliminated.\n  We have said as a matter of national policy that--and just about \neveryone agrees with that--we ought to raise the bar in terms of \nacademic achievement and accomplishment. Let us go ahead and do that. \nAnd we have an agreement by parents. They are enthusiastic about it. \nAnd that is going to be eliminated under this program.\n  Mr. President, this is not an advance. It is rearranging the deck \nchairs, but we are not enhancing the academic opportunities for \nchildren in this country with this amendment. And I hope that it will \nnot be accepted.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 5 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold the balance of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, those deck chairs, as I remember, were \nsitting on the deck of the Titanic. It is already going down.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ashcroft be added as a cosponsor \nto the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am saddened by the response of Senator \nKennedy. This amendment was revised very substantially after \nconsultation, wide consultation with people thoughtfully interested in \neducation.\n  By the terms of the amendment, any State that wants to continue the \npresent system and thinks it is best may do so, any State that wants to \noperate its Federal aid through its State educational entity may do so, \nand any State that thinks that education will best be conducted at the \nlocal level will be permitted to do so. How that destroys programs or \nhurts education is beyond my understanding.\n  In January, Dr. Carlotta Joyner of the General Accounting Office came \nbefore the Senate budget task force and said in three areas of \neducation 15 Federal departments and agencies administer 127 at-risk \nand delinquent youth programs; 11 Federal departments and agencies \nadminister more than 90 early childhood programs; and\n\n[[Page S3378]]\n\n9 Federal departments and agencies administer 86 teacher-training \nprograms.\n  Twenty programs are consolidated into this block grant for those \nStates that wish it. It takes about one-third of all of the money that \nthe U.S. Department of Education spends on education from kindergarten \nthrough 12th grade. To say that once we reduce the rulemaking functions \nof the U.S. Department of Education we are going to destroy education \nis to say that neither State education agencies nor local school \ndistricts nor superintendents nor teachers either know what they are \ndoing or care about what they are doing.\n  That is simply wrong. They know more and they care more because they \nare right there with our children. If it does not work, it will go out \nof existence. Any State that does not want it does not have to take it. \nI believe this is an amendment that ought to be adopted unanimously. I \nregret the opposition of the Senator from Massachusetts. What we are \ndoing is improving education and getting more dollars into the \nclassroom, not less.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as he wishes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Two?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield the Senator 1 minute. Sorry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate both Senator \nGorton and Senator Frist. Senator Frist conducted a series of hearings \nin his Budget Committee task force from which came much of the factual \ninformation and evidence of the great need for reform in the programs \nthat are now in the Gorton amendment.\n  Frankly, I think what has happened is some are still looking at last \nyear's Gorton amendment and assuming that is the bill before us. This \nis about one-third of the Department of Education's programs, a little \nover $10 billion out of a little over $30 billion. So one-third of it \nwill be block granted.\n  But the point of this amendment this year for those who thought we \nwere going to in some way dismantle the programs nationally, this bill \nhas options in it so if anybody wants to stand up and say these Federal \nprograms are the greatest thing and the States love them and the school \nboards love them and they participate wholeheartedly and they are \neffective, they can say that. It really isn't true, but they can say \nthat, and we can stand up and say, well, fine, if they are that good, \nobviously, the States and school boards across the land will choose the \noption to keep them just like they are and let the Federal Government \nrun them. The healthy part of this is it is going to be a wonderful \nexperiment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak for 1 \nadditional minute and it not be counted against Senator Gorton's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This will be a wonderful experiment, for if, indeed, \nsome States choose to remain under the bureaucratic programs that in \nmany cases do not even fit the needs, and in many cases States do not \neven participate because they are so far from what the needs are, if \nthey want to, they keep the programs. And then a number of States may \ngo the other route, it will be marvelous for Americans to be able to \nsee, in about 5 or 6 years, which approach helped the kids more, which \napproach got more education dollars into the classroom on a day-by-day \nbasis, addressing the major problems that the school boards and State \nschool boards find to be the real areas of need at the State level.\n  I think it is time to let States make that choice. Let us see which \none works best--categorical strings attached, Federal programs that \nfrequently miss the mark, or the approach that Senator Gorton has. I am \ndelighted to be a cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 5 minutes 40 \nseconds and the manager has 1 minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make a couple of comments.\n  First, I think the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, is a \nthoughtful legislator and I have agreed with him on a number of \neducation policies, including last year his fairly controversial \namendment on IDEA. I supported him on that and I thought his amendment \nwas the right amendment.\n  This is an area in which there is just some philosophical \ndisagreement. Let us be honest, there are some--I don't think the \nSenator from Washington is among them, or perhaps the Senator from New \nMexico--there are some who very much believe the Federal Government \nshould not be involved in education in the elementary and secondary \neducation at all.\n  The Republican Party platform in 1996 said, ``This is why we will \nabolish the Department of Education and end Federal meddling in our \nschools.'' I am not suggesting that is what this amendment does, but \nphilosophically there are people, and a fairly significant number in \nyour party, who really believe there should not be a Federal Department \nof Education, who believe that these programs represent meddling, and \nit ought to all be done at the local level.\n  My point is this: There have been certain national priorities that we \nhave tried to address with the programs that we have developed for \nelementary and secondary education at the Federal level. By far the \nbulk of funding for elementary and secondary education is at the local \nlevel. They run the schools; they finance the schools. If we were to \ndecide, ``Let's not care about how these moneys are spent that go to \nState and local governments from the Federal Government for elementary \nand secondary education,'' I would say then let's not be a tax \ncollector here. That is what we would be. If we say we don't care how \nthe money is spent, we will collect the money and throw it back there, \nall we end up being is a tax collector to add extra money for \nelementary and secondary education. In that case I say, raise the money \nat home. Why pass around an ice cube? All that does is mean you get \nless money back when you do it that way, so just raise the money at \nhome. Don't do it at all. Just suggest there aren't national programs \nof national interest or national need.\n  Some of us here believe very strongly that what we have done with the \nDepartment of Education and the kind of ``gap funding'' we have \nprovided for certain title programs and other programs of some national \nimportance and national interest and national need have advanced the \nissue of education in this country. It doesn't mean we have tried to \nrun the school systems. We haven't and shouldn't and won't. It does \nmean that a number of these things we have done nationally strengthens \nthe schools. It fills in areas of national need on issues of national \nimportance that otherwise would not have gotten done.\n  Again, I have great respect for the Senator from Washington, but I \nwill oppose his amendment simply because I happen to think that what we \nhave done in creating a Department of Education and in providing some \ndirected gap financing for programs that represent national interest \nand national need--drug-free schools program being one, for example, \nand many, many others that are very important that I think have \nstrengthened education in this country.\n  I understand there will be a second-degree amendment offered here and \nthat will allow a few more minutes of discussion. But let me just say \nagain, I think this stems just from some philosophical differences. I \nrespect those on the other side who say, ``Well, you can spend this \nmoney better at home.'' I say, if that is the case that there shall be \nno national purpose and no national interest with respect to some of \nthese issues, let us not have tax collectors in Washington raising the \nmoney here and taking it away before they send it back home. Just have \nthe folks back home raise all the money and spend all the money.\n  If you believe there are certain things that are worthy--including \nprograms like title I and so many others--that have advanced education \nin this country and been very helpful, not intrusive, but very helpful, \nto State and local governments who run our elementary and secondary \nschool systems, if you believe that, then I think you support what we \nhave done to improve it and strengthen it.\n\n[[Page S3379]]\n\n  I yield back the remainder of our time. My understanding is there \nwill be offered a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my friend from North Dakota makes two \narguments. One, a philosophical argument against the abolition of the \nDepartment of Education, based on the philosophy that there is a \nfunction of the Department of Education in Washington, DC. That, \nhowever, is not an argument against this amendment since this amendment \ndoes not abolish the Department. It takes only about one-third of the \nmoney that it is spending in K through 12 education.\n  The second argument the Senator from North Dakota makes is that it is \nabsolutely essential for the success of our educational efforts that \nthere be very strict rules coming from the Department of Education to \nevery school district in the United States. That would be a forceful \nargument if we had been a tremendous ``signal'' success in these \npolicies. Nothing indicates that we have been. It is one of the reasons \nwe are debating education policy here today.\n  What I proposed is an opportunity to try three experiments: Continue \nthe present system, allow the States to do it, or allow local school \ndistricts to do it. I remain puzzled that anyone should say that we are \nso successful today that we can't experiment, we can't change. Let's \ntry for a while three different systems and see which one works the \nbest. Competition always ends up with the best results.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time on the amendment is expired.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2294 to Amendment No. 2293\n\n      (Purpose: To provide for direct awards of education funding)\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2294 to amendment No. 2293.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. I understand we have 15 minutes on either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Gorton \namendment and also rise to explain the amendment which I just \nsubmitted.\n  As has previously been referred to this morning, I have had the \nopportunity over the past 6 months to chair the Senate Budget Committee \ntask force on education. During that series of seven hearings that we \nheld, I listened very carefully to a number of witnesses. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans alike came before our committee and discussed \nthe nature of the Federal role in education. The terms that were used \nand the picture painted was that we had this sprawling endeavor, that \nis duplicative in many ways, that has not been focused to the degree \nthat any of us would like, which in turn, in many ways, has tied the \nhands of the education establishment, has tied the hands of State \ncommunities and local communities and local school administrators and \nteachers and principals and parents. We have heard it again and again.\n  I applaud Senator Gorton for building upon his amendment from last \nyear. The amendment that we see today, which I think goes a long way \ntoward accomplishing the goals as recommended by the task force to \nconsolidate--not eliminate, but consolidate--the various efforts we \nhave at the Federal level to accomplish what we want to accomplish; \nthat is, to educate the young people, K through 12 today. We have not \nbeen successful in the past. We all know that. That has been \ndemonstrated again and again.\n  The amendment that I introduced today makes the Gorton amendment, I \nbelieve, even stronger. Under the Gorton amendment, a State must choose \nwithin a 1-year time period and pursuant to a majority vote in their \nState legislature and with the concurrence of the Governor, one of \nthree options. Again, the beauty of this amendment is that there are \nthree options. After the initial selection under the Gorton amendment, \na State can only change that selection one time and only after a 3-year \nperiod.\n  My amendment would simply allow a State which has chosen to remain in \nthe current system--again that is the beauty; if a State elects not to \nchange under the Gorton amendment, they don't have to change--if a \nState does say we will stay exactly as we are today, continue the \ncategorical program that they have today, under my amendment they will \nbe able to opt any time over the next 4 years to go into one of the \nblock grant programs.\n  That is the extent of my amendment. In addition, we heard from States \nlike Kentucky that have biennial State legislatures, and it gives them \nthe opportunity to make that decision after they next meet, since the \nunderlying amendment had this 1-year time limit. The real theme to the \nGorton amendment is the flexibility that is given to localities--\nflexibility for individual localities and individual States to decide \nfor themselves, based on their own priorities, based on their own \nidentified needs, how to best spend their education dollars.\n  My amendment builds on that flexibility, allowing States to decide, \nand they are given more choice. The need for consolidation could not be \nclearer today. We know that over the last 20 years we have had stagnant \nstudent performance in science, mathematics, and reading. We have seen \nthat data again and again. Our task force looked at the Federal role in \neducation, and we found this sprawling, unfocused effort that did \nsuffer from a programmatic reluctance to ask the fundamental question: \nWhat works and what doesn't work? There is something inherent in the \nprogram that prevented us from asking that question, until today.\n  We saw these huge charts that take the 500 Federal programs, or 2,900 \nprograms of the Department of Education, and we saw these overlapping, \nintertwining, well-intended programs that have lacked the focus, have \nlacked the streamlined consolidation approach, and they have not \nworked. What the Gorton amendment allows us to do is choose a system, \nnot change it all for two block grants of about $10 billion, to choose \nbased on your individual needs what might work for you.\n  We have already tabled, over the last 2 days, a school construction \nprogram. We will debate other amendments that create a program for \ndropout prevention, to create new programs. The beauty of the Gorton \namendment is that we give the States and the localities the money, and \nif they have a problem with dropouts, they can identify that program \nand use the money there. If they don't have a problem, they don't have \nto use it there. For technology development, we give the States and the \nlocalities the option to decide how to spend that money.\n  It is not a partisan issue. People have tried to make it, both in the \nmedia and sometimes on the floor, Republicans versus Democrats. We \nlistened carefully in our task force to the Democratic officials from \nthe Chicago school system. They extolled the virtues of flexibility. \nThat is what the Gorton amendment is all about. They said that the \nflexibility in much of their own program's success in reforming the \nChicago system can be--it draws back to that use of block grants, which \nhas that flexibility. They said to our task force: ``We know the \nsystem, and we believe we know the things that it needs to have in \norder to improve.'' They continued: ``So the more flexibility we have \nwith Federal and State funds, the easier it is to make those changes.''\n  Florida's commissioner of education went on to say: ``We at the State \nand local level feel the crushing burden caused by too many Federal \nregulations, procedures, and mandates. Florida spends millions of \ndollars every year to administer inflexible categorical Federal \nprograms that divert precious dollars away from raising student \nachievement. Many of these Federal programs typify the misguided, one-\nsize-fits-all command and control approach.''\n  Those were the words of Florida's commissioner of education.\n\n[[Page S3380]]\n\n  We also heard that the Department of Education has indeed made some \nprogress in eliminating some regulations and consolidating programs. \nSecretary of Education Riley reported that the Department eliminated 64 \nprograms. But then we heard 2 weeks later from the General Accounting \nOffice that the Department still oversees 244 separate individual \nprograms. Given that the Department and the Secretary are moving in the \ndirection of streamlining and consolidation, it is really confusing to \nme why the Department and the administration oppose the Gorton \namendment, which does just that; it consolidates, it does not eliminate \nthe Department of Education, it does not eliminate the targeted \npopulations; it consolidates and allows individual communities to best \nchoose how to use those same amounts of dollars.\n  Accountability was mentioned. It is a red herring. The Gorton \namendment very specifically provides for accountability to both the \nFederal Government and to those people who really care the most. I am \nabsolutely convinced that the people who really care the most are the \nparents of those children in those schools. The Gorton amendment very \nspecifically requires public involvement in planning a strategy for the \nuse of block-granted funds and an accounting to the public of the \nresults once the funds are used. Accountability is specifically \naddressed.\n  Targeting. We heard about the title I population. That is \nspecifically spelled out in this amendment. There is no weakening of \nthe targeting nature of the Federal funding of things like title I. It \nis interesting to note that the Gorton amendment does not do this. In \nfact, 100 percent of title I part A funds would flow directly to the \nlocal education agencies--100 percent. There is no cutting there. Under \nthe Gorton amendment, 100 percent of the funds would be used by the \nschools in the classrooms, not with that administrative overlay, \nadministrative cut taken off to be spent here in Washington, DC. No; \nthis makes sure that the targeted populations receive the funds in the \nclassroom.\n\n  The premise behind both my second-degree amendment and the Gorton \namendment is flexibility. States and localities will have the \nflexibility to decide for themselves how to best use education dollars, \nnot the U.S. Congress' well-intended layering on of program on program, \nnot the administration's budget proposal sent to us in which there were \neight new education programs. Another four have been proposed here in \nthe last 2 days. No; we want those moneys, that accountability, that \nflexibility to be carried out at the local level.\n  The task force heard testimony of numerous witnesses. We heard from \nSusan Gendrich, who runs a wonderful public school in Murfreesboro, TN, \ncalled Cason Lane Academy. We heard that the real beauty, the reason \nthey have been able to accomplish so much, is because they were given \nthe flexibility to have remedial schoolwork in the afternoons by using \nunused funds that otherwise would have gone to something they did not \nneed.\n  Yes, let the States and the localities exercise some creativity. That \nis where the innovation actually is. Again, remember, in the last 20 \nyears we have been stagnant in school performance. What we have done \nthrough 500 programs, spending $100 billion a year, has not improved \neducation in our public schools. Let's give them an option. That is \nwhat this is, an option to keep what you have, to go to a block grant \nprogram. Our current approach is simply not working. Let's try a new \napproach, something novel, and return decisionmaking authority to those \nclosest to our students--the States and the localities.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Frist amendment, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to commend Senators Gorton and \nFrist for what I believe to be a very important step forward in \nproviding the basis for educational achievement by students. Sometimes \nI think in all the debate we have about education, we get worried about \none group of individuals who might manage funds here and one group who \nmight manage funds there, and whether or not this would be directed by \nthis group or that group. The ultimate objective of our program in \neducation is student achievement. We want students to develop, as a \nresult of our educational efforts, the capacity to grapple with the \nissues of the next century. We ought to ask ourselves on a regular \nbasis, How is that best done? How do we elevate the capacity and the \nperformance of the students? What is it that gets that done best?\n  Well, I think this particular effort on the part of the Senator from \nWashington and the Senator from Tennessee recognizes two or three \nimportant principles in student achievement. First, nothing is more \ndirectly correlated to student achievement than parental involvement. \nThe more influence we give to parents, to community leaders, and to the \nrole models who are right around those students in shaping the \nstudents' opportunities, the more likely those students are to achieve. \nStudy after study shows that when parents are involved, when \nschoolteachers and community officials are involved, when the culture \naround the student is involved in decisionmaking and they get active in \nthe schools, that is when achievement goes up.\n  Now, this block grant approach is going to move toward the parents, \ntoward the communities, toward the students, toward the cultural \nleaders who surround the students, and give the right to make and the \nopportunity to make decisions that they believe will best motivate and \nenhance the capacity of students to achieve. It is very, very \nimportant.\n\n  Second, I believe that it is very difficult to make intelligent \ndecisions for the whole country under the rubric of a single \nprescription. There are a lot of health problems in the United States. \nBut if we were to say we were going to prescribe a single wonder drug, \nI think people would wonder about it. They know they would like to be \nable to go to their doctor to decide what is wrong with them, what \ntheir problems are, and to get a prescription that would really make a \ndifference to them. I think when we give the capacity to deploy \nresources to State and local school agencies and we don't tell them \nwhat sort of prescription there has to be but we allow them to use the \nresources to best achieve what is needed in that area, we provide the \nbasis for student achievement for actually delivering through the \neducational process what it is we need to deliver.\n  I visited a school in southwest Missouri just this last year. Both \nState and local governments had so many strings on what they said money \ncould be used for that they could not do what needed to be done. They \nneeded to build new classrooms. They were laboring under a requirement \nthat they had to spend so much of the money for teacher's salaries. \nThey wanted to be able to do teacher's salaries. But they first needed \nclasses. Because it was a high growth area, they were trapped between \nneeding to get the classrooms first, for which they could not spend the \nmoney, and having to spend the money for teachers. They couldn't use \nthe teachers until they had the classrooms.\n  We really need to free the people who care the most about America's \nfuture--they are parents, community leaders, school leaders, teachers, \nand administrators at the local level. We need to free them to be able \nto deploy resources effectively.\n  There is a myth in Washington; that is, that we can make something \nwhere one size fits all. The truth of the matter is one size fits none.\n  These amendments are fundamentally beneficial amendments which will \nhelp Americans develop and shape better schools for their children in \nwhich students achieve.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, once again I think we have a philosophical \ndifference here. I don't see that parents, teachers, schools, and local \nofficials are not free now. They are certainly free now to develop \ntheir own programs, raise their own money, and\n\n[[Page S3381]]\n\nrun their own schools. They do that. They are free to do that. They do \nit every day in every way.\n  The local school in my hometown of 300 people is run by the local \nschool board. They raise the money in the local tax district. The \nschool board hires the teachers. They decide with the State government \nabout the curriculum. They are perfectly free to do that, and do it \nevery day.\n  The Senator from Washington indicated this is not a debate about \nabolishing the Department of Education. He is absolutely correct about \nthat. This, however, represents a seed from the same garden. That is \nwhy I mentioned that in the 1996 Republican National Party platform it \nsays: ``That is why we will abolish the Department of Education and \nFederal meddling in our schools.''\n  It is a seed from the same garden that says, by the way, if there is \nany money going back from the Federal Government, let's make sure that \nthere is no purpose for that money; let's make sure it goes back in the \nform only of general aid and not some kind of assistance, as has \nhistorically been the case for compensatory education for poor \nchildren.\n  One-half of the Federal money that has been spent since 1960 for \nelementary and secondary education has been spent for compensatory \neducation for lower-income children. It has been remarkably successful.\n  Once again, let me emphasis that we don't run and never will run the \nlocal school districts, and we don't finance the local school systems. \nThis is kind of gap financing for certain things that we have \nconsidered a national purpose, among which, as I mentioned, is \ncompensatory education for lower-income children, but other areas as \nwell.\n  Let me mention just a couple of them: The School-to-Work Program, the \nSafe and Drug-Free Schools Program. What if, for example, this \namendment passes, and it is decided that in 45 States, while we have \nsaid there ought to be a national priority on the Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools Program, and here is the money for it, 45 States say, ``Well, \nsorry. It is not our priority. That is not our priority. We are not \ngoing to do that.'' Yet, we keep sending the money, and we have 45 \nStates in which there is not a safe and drug-free schools program.\n  My question to the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from \nWashington is: Why would we want to keep spending the money in that \ncase? Why would we want the Federal Government to become a tax \ncollector for local school districts for no national purpose? They have \nsaid, ``We want your money, but there is no national purpose served in \nhaving a safe and drug-free school program.'' I don't think that makes \nany sense.\n\n  I say just do this through the front door. If one really doesn't want \nthe Federal Government to be involved in these programs, just end the \nfinancing for the programs.\n  What we are suggesting here is not--the Senator from Washington is \ncorrect--abolish the Department of Education, although I certainly \nthink there are plenty who want to do that. But I think the American \npeople probably would not approve of that. So it is the kind of an \napproach that says, ``Well, let's simply abolish the purpose for the \nmoney but continue to provide the money.'' I just do not understand \nthat.\n  The Senator from Missouri made a general point about education. Let \nme say that I agree with what he said about education. Education works \nin our local schools all across this country when you have a teacher \nthat is a good teacher, when you have a student who comes to school \nwilling to learn, and when you have a parent involved in that \neducation. Those three elements are critical and necessary for \neducation to work. There is no question about that.\n  We debated yesterday the question of the priority of school \nconstruction to see if there could be some incentive to promote further \ninvestment in school construction. That was not the priority yesterday. \nThere needs to be other discussions. Regrettably, I wish it was. But \nthat is also a rather important point. That child must go through the \nclassroom door of the classroom that is a good classroom in good repair \nand not overcrowded.\n  I mentioned a week ago that I was at the Cannon Ball school--at an \nIndian school, a public school, and a public school district--and a \nsecond grader named Rosie Two Bears, she is going to school this \nmorning in a school that is not in good repair. You can have all the \nother things that work, and then to have classes where one teacher is \nteaching two classes back and forth at 50-minute intervals with kids \nwith desks that don't have a half an inch between them, because there \nis not room with 140 kids and 40 staff people in a building that is 90 \nyears old, part of which is condemned, and they have two bathrooms and \none water fountain for 180 people, that is not in good repair. Does \nthat school need substantial investment to make sure this second grader \nnamed Rosie who goes to school has the same opportunity that your kids \nand my kids do? Absolutely.\n  We have a lot to do, and a lot of challenges.\n  This issue, however, is not about the general financing of elementary \nand secondary education, because we do not do that. The general \nfinancing and the management of our elementary and secondary education \nsystem is done at home. That is where it ought to be done. We have, \nhowever, in recent decades indicated there are some basic issues of \nnational purpose to be served by creating a title I program, a \nvocational education program, and a safe and drug-free schools program. \nThat represents national interests and a national purpose that you \nwould hope to see attained at every school district in every State all \nacross this country. Some say, ``Well, let's just retreat on this issue \nof national purpose. Let's just back up on this issue of national \nimportance.'' The Senator from Washington last year when he offered his \namendment included, for example, title I in vocational education. He \ndid not include it this year. I am pleased to see that because, \nfrankly, it seems to me that if you just look at what has happened to \nthe success of these programs you can't help but conclude that what we \nhave done, while not perfect, has been enormously important in the \nlives of a lot of students, especially poor students in every school \ndistrict in this country.\n  The General Accounting Office recently found that the targeting of \nthe Federal education programs to those with the greatest financial \nneed has been very successful.\n  In fact, they say for every dollar the Federal Government provides to \na student, in general, it provides $4.73 to an impoverished student.\n  What that means is what we have tried to do has largely worked to try \nto fill in some gaps to say that where there is not adequate funding \nlocally and where we have a sense of national purpose about something \nthat we know needs to be done, we are going to try to fill in that gap.\n  It seems to me to say that we are going to retreat on that and say \nwhat we are going to send back now will just be general aid--I say the \nright approach for that is, if you are going to retreat altogether, \njust say we will not be sending categorical aid because we do not sense \na national priority or a national purpose or a national interest and \ntherefore we won't send the money either.\n  Or, alternatively, you can end up deciding there is no national \npurpose here and we will not support the national interest in these \nprograms, safe and drug-free schools being an example, but we will \ncontinue to be a tax collector and will collect the taxes and then send \nthe money back. Gee, I think the folks back home would be much more \nimpressed with a straightforward approach to this alternative, which I \ndon't support, in which we say we do not support the programs and we \nwill not collect the money for it; you do what you will back home.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 29 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. In my 29 seconds, let me make it very clear that the \nGorton amendment continues to target title I, the student. The \ndisadvantaged students still get the money, still get the programs. The \ndifference is that 100 percent of the money gets down to the classroom \nwhere it is needed.\n\n[[Page S3382]]\n\n  The Gorton amendment has as its underlying theme flexibility and \naccountability, the two things that we have heard again and again are \nnecessary to accomplish our goals of educating students. We are not \ndoing a good job. Our education system is not successful. When we \ncompare ourselves in the 12th grade to science students all over the \nworld, out of 21 countries only 2 do worse than us. It is not \nsuccessful.\n  This bill preserves choice. It gives options: No. 1, to continue to \nreceive this $10 billion in Federal funds under the current system with \nthe same regulations, no change. You can choose that. Or your second \nchoice: Have those Federal funds sent directly to the local school \ndistricts minus the Federal regulations. Or choice No. 3: Have Federal \nfunds sent to the State education authority minus Federal regulations.\n  As Frank Grogan, Florida's commissioner of education, said:\n\n       With education, we are already beginning to see States \n     becoming living laboratories. If left to pursue reform \n     without added Federal burdens and interference, States can \n     learn from the success and mistakes of others with the \n     freedom to emulate some programs as models and/or discard \n     those that are ineffective.\n\n  The Gorton amendment gives that opportunity, with accountability \nbuilt into those States and the local level.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me just make another quick point.\n  You will not find a challenge anywhere in this Chamber by anyone who \nwould stand up and say it is not important to have local people making \nlocal decisions, that some of the best decisions that can be made can \nbe made locally. No one is going to contest that.\n  The point I am making is this: Local governments, State and local \nofficials who run the elementary and secondary school systems in many \ncases over now many years, have indicated they do not have the \nresources to provide the kind of help we provide in title I as a gap \nfinancing that moves certain kinds of assistance to poor children or \nchildren who go to poor school districts.\n  Now, the amendment of the Senator from Washington does not put title \nI in this block grant category this time, as I indicated he did last \nyear but does not this time, as I understand it. I address the Senator \nfrom Washington. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. No, the Senator is not correct. Title I is in this \namendment. However, the money is distributed only on the basis of title \nI-eligible students. In other words, the school districts will get the \nsame amount of money and will still be targeted for title I-eligible \nstudents. But it is in this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding was that title I was not part of his \namendment. We were trying last evening and this morning to understand \nexactly what the language would be.\n\n  That makes his amendment much, much worse than I had previously \nthought. It does confirm then what I said earlier, that we have taken a \nsuccessful approach in which we have tried to provide some compensatory \neducation assistance especially directed at impoverished areas and at \npoor children, and have done it in a very successful way, and now say \nbut all of that will become a pot of money that we send back, and we \nwill just become tax collectors for local governments or for school \ndistricts and say, ``You all pretty much retool this and rethink what \nyou want to do with it along the lines that represent your \npriorities.'' They have their priorities, and should have their \npriorities, and their priorities are to govern how they run their \nschools. And they are free to do that.\n  Again, the discussion earlier was about they are not free somehow. Of \ncourse, they are free. State and local schools are run by the State and \nlocal school districts. They are free to raise their money, free to \nimpose taxes, free with their State governments to develop curriculums. \nOf course, they are free to make those decisions. But in areas where we \nhave provided some assistance based on what we perceive to be a \nnational purpose, the amendment says, let us provide the money but no \nrequirement that anyone sign up to this national purpose. And again I \ncome to the issue of safe and drug-free schools. There are a good many \nof them: Eisenhower Professional Development, the Innovative Education \nProgram, the Technology Challenge Grants, and so on--safe and drug-free \nschools.\n  Have we decided, or should we decide, or will we decide as a country \non a national need to have a safe and drug-free schools program across \nthis country that is stimulated by some financing that we say you must \npursue this and must have it because there is a national purpose for \nthis, and we will provide some financing help because we are mandating \nsomething? Are we at a point where we say, no, there is no longer a \nnational purpose for a Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act? Let's have a \nSafe and Drug-Free Schools Act, for example, in North Dakota, but the \nother 46 States say, ``Gee, we don't want one; this is not a national \npriority.''\n  Drugs and the issues surrounding drugs and young Americans and \nschoolchildren are a national priority. It is of national interest. And \nwe have decided in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act that we want to \nprovide some funding if we are going to provide a mandate here, some \nfunding from the Federal Government to say to these school districts, \n``We would like you to do this as a sense of national purpose and \nnational interest, and here is some financing to help you do it.''\n  The amendment is an amendment that essentially says, well, let's \nconvert all of those national interests and urges to some notion of \ngeneral aid, and so we will then be tax collectors and we will just \ncollect money and send it back. I say as I started, that is like \npassing an ice cube around. By the time you get to the sixth or seventh \nposition on that ice cube passing, there is no ice cube left.\n  A much more straightforward way of doing this would be to say we \ndon't believe these are programs of national interest, and therefore \nlet us say to local governments, ``Raise your own money and spend your \nown money. We are out of the way.'' We are, as their party would \nsuggest in their platform, abolishing the Department of Education. Get \nout of the way and let everyone else do their thing.\n  There is a different way, and the other way is to recognize that most \nall of elementary and secondary education is funded by, controlled by, \nthe local people back in the home districts and the school district in \nthe towns. It will always be that way. But there are things that \nrepresent a national interest, and those kinds of policies and those \nkinds of issues, debated over many, many years here in this Congress, \nresulted in the construction of a program called title I and other \ntitle programs. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act, the Technology \nChallenge Grants, and others have been, I think, enormously important \nto say to the local school districts, ``While you are there, we are \ngoing to offer some help, for example, to see that you get your school \nwired up to the Internet. If you need help to do that, here is some \nhelp to do that, to see that you have a safe and drug-free schools \nprogram in your school district, in your schools.''\n  That has been the nature of our involvement in education. Again, it \nis very seductive, I think, to say, well, gee, shouldn't local people \nmake all these decisions. Yes, I think so. With their money they should \nmake all their decisions in their elementary and secondary education \nprograms. But isn't there a circumstance where we have some issues of \nnational importance where our money, our resources, our investment \nought to follow that urge of national importance on the Safe and Drug-\nFree Schools Act? I think so. To back away from that, I think, would be \na mistake.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I understand the minority will simply \npermit the Frist second-degree amendment to pass by a voice vote. I \nwill then ask for a rollcall vote, which will take place at 3 o'clock, \non the underlying amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I, by consent, say to the Senator from Washington, \nwhile we do not support the second-degree amendment, the second-degree \namendment is a rather technical change of the underlying amendment\n\n[[Page S3383]]\n\nand we see no purpose in having another rollcall vote on that. While I \ndo not support it, we will accept a voice vote on the second-degree and \nthen have a recorded vote on the underlying amendment today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2294) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2293\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in 1768 in a letter to George Wythe, \nThomas Jefferson wrote,\n\n       No other sure foundation can be devised for the \n     preservation of freedom and happiness . . . Preach a crusade \n     against ignorance; establish and improve the law for \n     educating the common people. Let our countrymen know that the \n     people alone can protect us against the evils [of \n     misgovernment].\n\n  As a nation we have long recognized the importance of education of \nthe future well-being of our children and our nation. A quality \neducation is vital in an increasingly competitive global environment \nand indeed, as Jefferson notes, to the preservation of our democracy. \nEvery Senator undoubtedly wants to do everything in their power to \nimprove the educational opportunities for all children. It is one of \nour highest priorities in the U.S. Senate.\n  As many of my colleagues may recall, last year I offered an amendment \nto the fiscal year 1998 Senate Labor, Health and Human Services \nEducation appropriations bill that consolidated most federally funded \nK-12 education programs, and sent that money directly to local school \ndistricts free from the mandates and regulations imposed on our schools \nby Washington, DC, bureaucrats. The Senate approved the amendment but, \nat the administration's insistence, it was stripped from the final \nbill.\n  For most of this half century Washington, DC, has been dominated by \npeople who believe that centralized decisions and centralized control \nexercised by Washington, DC, is the best way to solve problems, \nincluding those in the classroom. This approach has not worked. As \nWashington, DC, has taken power and authority from local school \ndistricts, our schools have not improved. But, old habits die hard. The \nbelief in centralized power is still very much alive. When I proposed \nmy amendment last year, every single Democrat in the Senate opposed it \nand the President strongly criticized the approach of returning money \nand authority over education to our school districts.\n  Why is the status quo no longer acceptable? There are a multitude of \nreasons. As many of you know, the results of the Third International \nMath and Science Study (TIMSS) were recently announced. Unfortunately, \nthose graduating from our high schools did not fare well. Twelfth grade \nstudents from the United States did not achieve at a level I would call \nacceptable, with scores below the international average in both science \nand mathematics.\n  Is it because the United States has not been devoting sufficient \nresources to education? The facts don't bear out that assessment. \nResources devoted to education have been increasing in constant dollars \nalmost yearly for the last 25 years, but there has been no significant \nchange in the achievement of students.\n  What do we have to show for our investment? We have a web of \nliterally hundreds of Federal education programs woven throughout 39 \nFederal departments and agencies and totaling $73.1 billion in 1997. I \nwish I had a comprehensive list of all the Federal education programs \nto show you, but the Department of Education doesn't know exactly how \nmany there are.\n  In January of this year Dr. Carlotta Joyner of the GAO appeared \nbefore the Senate Budget Committee Education Task Force and presented \nus with a graphic that highlights the web of Federal education programs \nin only the three areas of education: At Risk and Delinquent Youth, \nEarly Childhood programs, and Teacher training programs. What this \nchart shows is that 15 Federal departments and agencies administer 127 \nAt Risk and Delinquent Youth programs, 11 Federal departments and \nagencies administer more than 90 Early Childhood programs, and 9 \nFederal departments and agencies administer 86 Teacher Training \nprograms.\n  It is no wonder that more and more, our states and local school \ndistricts are being suffocated by a tidal wave of papers, forms and \nprograms, each of which no doubt began with good intentions. The net \nresult of this tidal wave, however, is precisely what makes it \ndifficult to set priorities in each of the many varied states and \nschool districts across the country to determine that which will best \nserve their students. I firmly believe that the elected school board \nmembers, parents, superintendents and principals, as well as governors \nand legislatures, are dedicated to providing the best possible \neducation for school children that they possibly can, and that they are \nbetter able to make decisions about what is best for their students \nthan are Members of Congress or bureaucrats in the Department of \nEducation.\n  It is extremely arrogant of us here in this body to set detailed \nrequirements for very specific education programs that apply to \nchildren all across the United States. It's wrong to believe that \nCongress or the Department of Education has all the answers to the \nvariety of problems our schools and educators face. Why should a \nbureaucrat in Washington, DC, decide what's best for the children in \nWashington State? They don't know Walla Walla from Wenatchee from \nWoodinville.\n  Over the past several months I have had the opportunity to meet with \nparents and educators from across Washington State and the Nation. They \nhave expressed a great deal of concern about the stifling nature of the \nrules and regulations that come along with the myriad of federal \neducation programs in existence. In fact, several have commented that \nalthough school districts receive only about 7 percent of their funding \nfrom the Federal Government, with that money comes 50 percent of the \nrules and regulations they must comply with.\n  A perfect example of the crushing nature of Federal rules, \nregulations and paperwork comes from a program I didn't even include in \nmy amendment. The Bellevue School District, a suburban school district \neast of Seattle, has gathered all the paperwork necessary to begin, \njust begin, the file they are required to keep for special education \nstudents under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). \nPlaced end to end, this paperwork extends for almost 40 feet. 40 Feet! \nWe have allowed bureaucrats in Washington, DC, to impose half or more \nthan half of the rules and regulations that so often frustrate \ninnovation and success in our schools.\n  Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that Congress must do more \nto free State and local officials from the burden placed on them by the \nFederal Government to educating America's children. We must be willing \nto admit that somebody else may know a little bit more than we do about \nthis subject. My firm belief is that the wisdom needed to educate our \nchildren lies in States and individual school districts--with parents \nat home, with teachers in the classroom, with principals in the \nschools, and with school board members who, almost without exception, \nare public-spirited citizens who have run for election to a job that \ndoes not pay or pays very little. We must keep in mind that the same \ncitizenry who elected us to the U.S. Senate also elected our school \nboard members. It is unlikely that they were wise in electing us and \nignorant of their own interests in picking their school board members.\n\n  I have listened to educators from around the country and have applied \nthose lessons to the crafting of this amendment. My amendment makes \nseveral changes that address the concerns of those who have been kind \nenough to take the time and work with me and my office to improve upon \nthe work begun during last year's appropriations process.\n  First, there were concerns that any attempt to block grant education \nfunds to local communities was simply a back door attempt to cut \nfunding. My amendment makes it crystal clear that is not what this \neffort is about. My amendment authorizes specific levels of funding \nthrough fiscal year 2003, targets that appropriators must meet in order \nfor the block grants to continue.\n\n[[Page S3384]]\n\nIf these targets are not met, we would revert to the status quo.\n  Others have expressed concern that my amendment is an attempt to \nclose the Department of Education. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. My amendment is not about abolishing the Department of \nEducation--my amendment is about giving communities the flexibility \nthey need to educate our children. Even after enactment of my \namendment, there would be plenty of work left for the Department. My \namendment does not even touch on the Department's responsibilities with \nrespect to higher education. And even though my amendment includes more \nthan 20 Federal education programs, that is but a fraction of the total \nnumber of education programs administered by the Department of \nEducation, not to mention the Federal Government as a whole.\n  Concerns have also been expressed about the targeting of Federal \nfunds to disadvantaged students. The concern is that because Federal \nfunding often is targeted at a specific population, block granting \nfunds and allowing States and school districts to decide how those \nfunds are spent will mean those populations will no longer be served. \nWell, this mentality is what led to the creation of the quagmire of \neducation programs we find ourselves wallowing in today. My amendment \nretains specification for what populations the Bilingual Education and \nEducation for the Disadvantaged (Title I, Part A), funds are to be \nspent, but it leaves up to States and school districts the method by \nwhich those populations are best served. As for the list of 20 Federal \nprograms, my amendment outlines a series of allowable uses such as \nhiring new teachers, magnet schools, charter schools, and combating \nilliteracy, which give local officials flexibility in designing reforms \nto improve the achievement of students. The total amount of funding \nthat gets to the classroom will be considerably greater because so much \nless will get lost in the gears of administration at two, three or four \ndifferent levels of bureaucracy between Washington, DC, and the \nclassroom. As I've stated previously, we cannot assume that Washington, \nDC, knows best when it comes to educating the diverse population that \nexists in America today.\n  I have heard comments that different states have different opinions \nabout how they should receive federal funds. As a member of the Senate \nBudget Committee Education Task Force, chaired by my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Frist, I had a chance to hear from Frank Brogan, \nCommissioner of Education from the State of Florida, and Henry Der, \nDeputy Superintendent of Public Instruction from the State of \nCalifornia. Mr. Brogan and Mr. Der have widely different opinions about \nthe efficacy of involving the Federal Government in decisions regarding \neducation in their States. Mr. Brogan states,\n\n       Congress should identify priority areas and allow States to \n     designate the dollars for specific programs.\n       With Education, we are already beginning to see States \n     becoming living laboratories, testing varied programs and \n     options. If left to pursue reform without added Federal \n     burdens and interference, States can learn from the success \n     and mistakes of others, . . . with the freedom to emulate \n     some programs as models and/or discard those that are \n     ineffective.\n\n  Mr. Der followed Mr. Brogan with,\n\n       We submit to you that the roads toward devolution will \n     result in less opportunities for those with special needs and \n     will retard the leadership role that the U.S. Department of \n     Education has played, as well as undermine the accountability \n     that we need to build into our education programs.''\n\n  Therefore, it became clear to me that States should have a choice \nconcerning how they receive their Federal funds, and my amendment gives \nthem that choice. My amendment says that States will have three options \nwith respect to how they receive Federal education funds. Simply put, a \nState legislature, with the concurrence of the Governor, will choose \nfrom one of three methods for receiving Federal funds: (1) States can \ncontinue to receive Federal education funds through current categorical \nprograms; (2) States can receive Federal education funds in a block \ngrant to the State Educational Agency; or (3) States can direct the \nFederal Government to send Federal education funds directly to their \nLocal Educational Agencies.\n  There are also provisions in my amendment that respond to other \nconcerns about the immediate financial impact on States and school \ndistricts. My amendment includes a 100 percent hold harmless, so that \nno State or school district will receive less than what they received \nbefore enactment of this legislation. Further, there is a provision \nwhich says that for those States receiving a multiyear grant through \none of the programs included in the block grant, that multiyear grant \nwill be funded through to completion in order to provide an appropriate \ntransition from one process to another.\n  Finally, my amendment encourages accountability by requiring States \nand school districts to collect information about how Federal funds are \nspent, as well as involving parents and other members of the public in \ndebates over how funds will be utilized.\n  As you can see, my amendment is based on the principal that with \nadditional authority and money schools would receive from this reform, \nour teachers, parents, principals, and school boards would be inspired \nto do even more for our children. They would not, as some suggested \nduring debate on this issue last year, be inspired to build swimming \npools. They would be inspired to make sure that every child in their \ncommunity receives the best education possible. While I think this \nexample shows the fundamental difference between the approach I \nadvocate, and that of the administration, I just have to ask this \nquestion: Does anyone really believe that there are parents, teachers \nor school board members in America who would rather use scarce \neducation dollars for swimming pools instead of providing a quality \neducation for their children?\n\n  On February 10 of this year, I had the opportunity to visit the Union \nGap Elementary School and learn about the tremendous work they are \ndoing, in the words of their Superintendent Bob McLaughlin, to `heal' \ntheir children's reading difficulties.\n  More than three years ago, Dr. McLaughlin became painfully aware that \nthe Union Gap School District did not have a program to assist its \nstudents who were having difficulty learning to read. Dr. McLaughlin \nthen took it upon himself to search out a program which would be both \naffordable and helpful to the students. During the 1995-96 school year. \nDr. McLaughlin discovered the Read-Write program and soon thereafter \nthe program underwent a 10-week test in the school.\n  The test was so successful that at the conclusion of the 10-week test \nrun the school board adopted the program and fully implemented it for \nthe 1996-97 school year. Since the program has been implemented, \nsignificant gains have become evident.\n  Dr. McLaughlin also took the time to explain to me his previous \nexperience as a principal at a neighboring high school upon which \nbrought him to the conclusion something should be done about reading \ncomprehension at the elementary level. As a high school principal, Dr. \nMcLaughlin would continually see students entering his school \nunprepared to read and write effectively, and in many instances no \nwhere near grade level. The frustration he experienced seeing these \nkids struggle through high school without the necessary tools drove Dr. \nMcLaughlin to seek a solution at Union Gap Elementary. As Dr. \nMcLaughlin and other teachers at the elementary school know, once you \nteach a child to read that child has gained a skill he or she retained \nfor a lifetime of enrichment.\n  This instance is a clear example of the innovative work school \ndistricts are engaging in to improve the education of their students. \nUnder the Gorton Amendment, Dr. McLaughlin and his school board would \nhave the flexibility to expand this program if that is what they felt \nwas in the best interest of their students. I doubt seriously that Dr. \nMcLaughlin would consider tennis courts or swimming pools to be a \npriority.\n  This issue boils down to each Senator asking if he or she believes \nschools will be improved through more control from Washington, DC, or \nby giving more control to parents, teachers, principals, \nsuperintendents, and school board members? I believe our best hope for \nimproving the education of our children is to put the American people \nin charge of their local schools.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if the minority manager will agree to a \nunanimous\n\n[[Page S3385]]\n\nconsent agreement that I have 3 additional minutes on this amendment? I \ndo see my colleague from Washington here. We are going forward with \nthat amendment, and I would like just 3 minutes further to speak on \nthis subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from North Dakota \nand I, together, less than 2 months ago, voted with 94 other Members of \nthis Senate for a bill relating to transportation covering somewhat \nmore than four times as many billions of dollars as this amendment \ndoes. Unlike the House of Representatives, we included no specific \nprograms in that transportation bill. We decided there was a national \npurpose for transportation but that the priorities as to how that money \nfor highways ought to be spent should be set by States--generally \nspeaking, not by elected officials in those States, but usually by a \nhighway bureaucracy.\n  No one said that, because we weren't telling the States what roads to \nbuild, there was no national purpose and we should abandon \ntransportation as a national issue. Yet the Senator from North Dakota \nsays that, rather than give a three-way option to States with respect \nto $10 billion a year in education money, it would be philosophically \nmore consistent to abandon the field because, after all, the States \nmight set different priorities; maybe the States and local school \ndistricts don't care about drugs or don't care about disadvantaged \nstudents.\n  Mr. President, that is a basic philosophical difference between us. \nThe thought being expressed to me--that elected school board members \nand principals and teachers and parents and even State legislators \ndon't care much about education or about education priorities--boggles \nthe mind. We are the only people who do so? We are the only people who \ncan set the way in which national priorities are carried out? We and \nbureaucrats at the Department of Education? Let me tell you, we come up \nwith 7 percent of the money and 50 or 60 percent of the rules? In one \nfield not covered by this, where the Senator from North Dakota did \nsupport me, we give 9 percent of the money for disabled education and \nwe set rules that are so stringent that some school board members are \nsaying they are going to defy those rules because they cannot provide \nfor a safe environment for their students. In title I, the forms are \nexceeded only by IDEA.\n  This proposal will allow schools to spend more money on disadvantaged \nstudents, more money on bilingual students, and do it in a way that \nsuits the particular needs of the districts, if the State elects to do \nso. Any State that agrees with the position of Senator Dorgan is \nperfectly free to keep the present system. Any State that feels it can \ndo a better job will be allowed to do a better job. And any State that \nfeels its elected school board members can do a better job will be \nallowed to do that.\n  Maybe Senator Dorgan is right. If so, we will learn by experiment. \nBut unless we feel--with him and Senator Kennedy--that the present \nsystem is working magnificently, that our system of education is so \ngood that it doesn't need to be changed or experimented with at all, we \nshould reject this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Washington will \nallow me, by consent, 2 minutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Washington chooses an inappropriate \nexample to begin with, the highway system. We provide Federal money to \nthe State of Washington. But if I go to Washington and drive on roads \nthat are constructed in the State of Washington by his State highway \nofficials with Federal money, I know I am not going to drive on a \nroadbed of marshmallows or cork. Why? Because his highway officials \nmust follow the Federal prescribed rules about what kind of highways \nthey are going to build with those Federal funds.\n  My only point is, if the Senator from Washington suggests that if, \nfor example, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program is not a national \npriority, let's give them the money for it but not require them to do \nit, I think that is a huge step backwards. Is it in most instances the \ncase that people closer to the problem can spend the money more \neffectively? Absolutely. That is why almost all of elementary and \nsecondary education is done and managed and controlled locally. But \nthere are some programs of national interest for which we provide the \nfinancing and for which we hope there is a national purpose and to \nwhich we will have all school districts subscribe. That is the purpose \nfor all this.\n\n  I find it interesting. You could make the same case about food \nsafety. You could have exactly the same debate. Say, do you think back \nhome they are not concerned about food safety? Why do we need national \nfood safety standards? Do you think back home in every State they are \nnot concerned about food safety? Of course they are. Of course they \nare. But it is something of national interest and national importance, \nand that is the gap financing that is involved here with respect to \nthese kinds of programs. Are they perfect? No. Should they be changed? \nYes. Should we retreat from them? In my opinion, I think that would be \na huge mistake.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMcConnell be added as a cosponsor to the Gorton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, seeing there is the sponsor of another \namendment here, I think proper procedure is to move to that amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for a rollcall on the Gorton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Gorton amendment \nis temporarily laid aside and the Senator from Washington, Senator \nMurray, is recognized to offer an amendment on which there shall be 30 \nminutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2295\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding reductions in \n                              class size)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2295.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n                     TITLE ____--SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n     SEC. ____01. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Qualified teachers in small classes can provide \n     students with more individualized attention, spend more time \n     on instruction and less on other tasks, cover more material \n     effectively, and are better able to work with parents to help \n     the parents further their children's education.\n       (2) Rigorous research has shown that students attending \n     small classes in the early grades make more rapid educational \n     progress than the students in larger classes, and that those \n     achievement gains persist through at least the 8th grade. For \n     example:\n       (A) In a landmark 4-year experimental study of class size \n     reduction in grades kindergarten through grade 3 in \n     Tennessee, researchers found that students in smaller classes \n     earned significantly higher scores on basic skills tests in \n     all 4 years and in all types of schools, including urban, \n     rural, and suburban schools.\n       (B) After 2 years in reduced class sizes, students in the \n     Flint, Michigan Public School District improved their reading \n     scores by 44 percent.\n       (3) The benefits of smaller classes are greatest for lower-\n     achieving, minority, poor, and inner-city children. One study \n     found that urban 4th-graders in smaller than average classes \n     were \\3/4\\ of a school year ahead of their counterparts in \n     larger than average classes.\n       (4) Smaller classes allow teachers to identify and work \n     sooner with students who have learning disabilities and, \n     potentially, can reduce those students' need for special \n     education services in the later grades.\n       (5) Students in smaller classes are able to become more \n     actively engaged in learning than their peers in large \n     classes.\n       (6) Efforts to improve educational outcomes by reducing \n     class sizes in the early grades are likely to be successful \n     only if well-qualified teachers are hired to fill additional \n     classroom positions and if teachers received intensive, \n     continuing training in\n\n[[Page S3386]]\n\n     working effectively in smaller classroom settings.\n       (7) State certified and licensed teachers help ensure high \n     quality instruction in the classroom.\n       (8) According to the National Commission on Teaching and \n     America's Future, the most important influence on student \n     achievement is the expertise of their teachers. One New York \n     City study comparing high- and low-achieving elementary \n     schools with similar student characteristics, found that more \n     than 90 percent of the variation in achievement in \n     mathematics and reading was due to differences in teacher \n     qualifications.\n       (9) Our Nation needs more qualified teachers to meet \n     changing demographics and to help students meet high \n     standards, as demonstrated by the following:\n       (A) Over the next decade, our Nation will need to hire over \n     2,000,000 teachers to meet increasing student enrollments and \n     teacher retirements.\n       (B) 1 out of 4 high school teachers does not have a major \n     or minor in the main subject that they teach. This is true \n     for more than 30 percent of mathematics teachers.\n       (C) In schools with the highest minority enrollments, \n     students have less than a 50 percent chance of getting a \n     science or mathematics teacher who holds a degree in that \n     field.\n       (D) In 1991, 25 percent of new public school teachers had \n     not completed the requirements for a license in their main \n     assignment field. This number increased to 27 percent by \n     1994, including 11 percent who did not have a license.\n       (10) We need more teachers who are adequately prepared for \n     the challenges of the 21st century classroom, as demonstrated \n     by the fact that--\n       (A) 50 percent of teachers have little or no experience \n     using technology in the classroom; and\n       (B) in 1994, only 10 percent of new teachers felt they were \n     prepared to integrate new technology into their instruction.\n       (11) Teacher quality cannot be further compromised to meet \n     the demographic demand for new teachers and smaller class \n     sizes. Comprehensive improvements in teacher preparation and \n     development programs are also necessary to ensure the \n     effectiveness of new teachers and the academic success of \n     students in the classroom. These comprehensive improvements \n     should include encouraging more institutions of higher \n     education that operate teacher preparation programs to work \n     in partnership with local educational agencies and elementary \n     and secondary schools; providing more hands-on, classroom \n     experience to prospective teachers; creating mentorship \n     programs for new teachers; providing high quality content \n     area training and classroom skills for new teachers; and \n     training teachers to incorporate technology into the \n     classroom.\n       (12) Efforts should be made to provide prospective teachers \n     with a greater knowledge of instructional programs that are \n     research-based, of demonstrated effectiveness, replicable in \n     diverse and challenging circumstances, and supported by \n     networks of experts and experienced practitioners.\n       (13) Several States have begun serious efforts to reduce \n     class sizes in the early elementary grades, but these actions \n     may be impeded by financial limitations or difficulties in \n     hiring qualified teachers.\n       (14) The Federal Government can assist in this effort by \n     providing funding for class size reductions in grades 1 \n     through 3, and by helping to ensure that the new teachers \n     brought into the classroom are well-qualified.\n\n     SEC. ____02. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress should support \n     efforts to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes in \n     first, second, and third grades to an average of 18 students \n     per class all across America.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have been debating education policy \nfor several days and actually several times over the last several \nmonths here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I am very excited about \nthat, because one of the reasons I came here to the U.S. Senate was to \nmake sure that we focus on real issues that affect everyday average \nfamilies across our country. There is nothing more important to any \nparents than making sure, when they send their children off to school \nin the morning, that they get the kind of education that will mean they \nwill be a success in this country.\n  I am disappointed, however, that the bill before us, the Coverdell \nIRA proposal, will not provide that kind of quality education that \nparents are demanding. I believe it is a flawed policy which really \nwill not make any meaningful difference for either private or public \nschool students and their families. It is not a real results-driven \nproposal.\n  Many of my colleagues have been out here on the floor over the last \nseveral days talking about what the IRA Coverdell proposal will do and \nthat it will only mean $7 for a family in the future. Many of my \ncolleagues have talked about how it will begin us on a road to publicly \nfunding private schools, and the dangers of that.\n  We can debate that. But I am here today to bring forward an amendment \nthat I believe will make a substantial difference in our children's \neducation across the country, and that is regarding the issue of class \nsize. Ask any parent who sends his or her child off to school what \nquestion they ask when their child comes home on the first day of \nschool. It is, ``How many kids are in your class?'' They ask that \nbecause they know it will make a difference in whether or not their \nchild gets the attention and the education he or she needs throughout \nthat entire school year. If there are 40 kids in the classroom, or 35 \nkids in the classroom, your child will not get the kind of education \nand attention that he or she needs and deserves in this complex world \nthat we live in today.\n  My amendment that is before the Senate is a sense of the Congress \nthat we should support efforts to hire 100,000 new teachers so that we \ncan reduce class sizes in first, second and third grades to an average \nof 18 students per class all across America.\n  This is simply a sense of the Congress saying this is the way we \nshould move forward. We have been on the floor before to debate this \nissue, and this Congress has said no, they are not going to fund lower \nclass sizes. I am back today because I believe this is the kind of \ndifference that we can make, that we should make, and that we must \nmake. Reducing class sizes will make a difference for children across \nthe country.\n  Will 100,000 teachers be enough? No, but it will be an impetus. This \namendment simply will send a message that we understand the issue and \nwe are willing to take it under consideration and move it forward.\n  I know as a former educator what a difference it makes to have a \nsmaller class size. I have taught 4-year-olds. I have had 18 children \nin my classroom. I have had 24 children in my classroom. It means the \ndifference between having the time to work individually with students \nor simply having crowd control for the entire classroom.\n  Every teacher of early grades will tell you the more time they have \nwith their students, the better chance they have to make sure that all \nstudents will have the chance to learn to read, to learn to write, to \nlearn the basic skills that will mean that they are a success \nthroughout their later years. It also means that those teachers will \nhave the time to deal with the complex problems that come before them \nas a teacher in our classrooms.\n  I distinctly remember one time I had with a class when I had a young \nstudent come to class and we were in the process of talking about the \nalphabet. We were talking about one of the letters. I was talking with \nmy young children about different words that begin with the letter A, \nand all of a sudden a young child in my classroom just simply blurted \nout to me, ``My dad didn't come home last night; he was arrested.'' My \nentire class stopped. How could I have talked about the alphabet? How \ncould I have talked about the words that started with the letter A?\n  I had a devastated child in my classroom of 24. Yet, I could not take \nthe time to sit with him and work with him because I had 23 other \nchildren in my classroom who needed attention and whose parents wanted \nthem to learn about the alphabet.\n  That child probably went on to a very troubled adulthood. We could \nhave made a difference simply by having fewer students in the \nclassroom, by simply having the time to deal with these kind of \nproblems. Don't just take it from me as a former educator, take it from \nthe studies.\n  I have submitted a number of studies in the past as I have talked \nabout this issue on this floor. A 1989 study of the Tennessee STAR \nProgram which compared the performance of students in grades K through \n3 in small and regular size classes found that students in small \nclasses of 13 to 17 students significantly outperformed other students \nin math and reading every year at all grade levels across all \ngeographic areas.\n  My sense of the Congress simply says we understand this is \nsignificant. It says we in the Senate want to make a difference in the \nlearning of American children, and we want to move forward on the \nprogress of reducing class size and take that on as an issue in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S3387]]\n\n  I have talked about it as an educator. I have talked about the \nstudies many times that prove what I say, but we should also be \nlistening to other people. I know that when we were here a month ago \nand debating, I submitted a number of letters from different teachers \nfrom across my State and across this country, but I want to \nspecifically have printed today a letter, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat a letter to the editor by State Senator Al Bauer be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter to the editor was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Columbian, April 15, 1998]\n\n                       Murray Has the Right Idea\n\n       The April 5 editorial, ``Patty Murray's teacher plan is \n     costly mandate,'' criticized the plan by U.S. Sen. Patty \n     Murray, D-Wash., for the federal government to hire 100,000 \n     new teachers to reduce class sizes nationwide.\n       The editorial warned that ``unintended consequences can \n     destroy any attempt at progress,'' noting that a school \n     district in the Seattle area cut early childhood education \n     for at-risk youngsters because of its decision to reduce \n     class sizes.\n       The criticism makes the best case for Murray's proposal. If \n     that school district had the additional federally funded \n     teachers to reduce class sizes in all grades, it would not \n     have to negatively impact Head Start and at-risk programs. \n     Matter of fact, the district could also improve those \n     programs by smaller class sizes.\n       As for the criticism that 100,000 new teachers would need \n     that many more new classrooms, teachers are creative enough \n     to develop curriculum around the needs of children without \n     additional classrooms.\n       I visited several classrooms this year where two teachers \n     shared 46 or more students. With Murray's proposal, a third \n     teacher could be added to such a team, thereby reducing the \n     student-teacher ratio from one teacher for 22 students to one \n     for 15. We are not talking about added classrooms; we are \n     talking about more teacher time for each student so that \n     fewer students fall through the cracks.\n       As for how Murray should pay for the additional teachers, \n     Congress should pay in the same way the members propose to \n     pay for a highway budget that is billions of dollars higher \n     than the balanced-budget agreement.\n       It sounds like what happened in the State Legislature this \n     past session. The majority party refused the proposal by us \n     Democrats to spend $50 million more for class size \n     reductions, particularly in the early-grades. The majority \n     also decided to propose to the voters in November to transfer \n     currently used sources of revenue for education from the \n     general fund to the highway fund.\n       The editorial correctly urges school districts to sue the \n     Legislature for underfunding education from the State level. \n     In 1977 the Legislature was sued, and the courts ruled that \n     it was the paramount duty of the Legislature to fully fund \n     kindergarten through grade-12 education. As a consequence, in \n     the Vancouver School District school levies dropped. A person \n     with a $50,000 home or property saved $254 a year.\n       It is time to get the Legislature to live up to the court's \n     mandate. Where are our priorities? Children's education lasts \n     forever; asphalt lasts a few years.\n       I am glad we have Murray in the U.S. Senate. By speaking \n     out for our most valuable assets, our children, she is \n     exerting the leadership on educational matters she \n     demonstrated while serving in the State Senate.--State Sen. \n     Al Bauer, Vancouver.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Al Bauer is a former colleague of mine in \nthe State Senate of Washington. He is also a former educator, and he \nspeaks from his heart when he talks about education. He wrote in his \nletter that hiring more well-trained teachers will help school \ndistricts stave off cuts to other special programs for at-risk \nstudents. He argues that more teachers does not have to mean more \nclassrooms. It is the number of well-trained adults in the room that is \nimportant, because students' access to time with the teacher is at the \nheart of learning. He argues that Congress can pay for class-size \nreductions if we can put billions of extra dollars into transportation.\n  State Senator Al Bauer is absolutely right. The arguments against \nthis proposal are not valid. It doesn't mean that we need more class \nspace. It doesn't mean that we will siphon money from other places.\n  It does mean that this Congress, this Senate, the people on this \nfloor are listening to what parents and educators and people across \nthis country are saying. When we send our children off to school, we \nwant to know they are safe, we want to know they will learn, and we \nknow they will be safe and they will learn and get the attention they \nneed if we begin to focus on class size in this country.\n  Now, a person could spend a year or a lifetime searching, and they \nwould not be able to find someone who understands education in \nWashington state more deeply than Senator Al Bauer. And he happens to \nbe a former educator, and he happens to be a Democrat. But Senator \nBauer and I stood together in the state Senate, and we worked with our \nRepublican colleagues to do everything we could to improve public \neducation.\n  He knows and I know that Republicans and Democrats in Washington \nstate can work together. They have worked together to reduce class \nsize, increase family involvement in school decisions, fund school \nconstruction, improve teacher quality, allow communities to set higher \nstandards for students, publish school report cards, hold schools \naccountable for results, reward schools that do well and mediate \nschools that are failing, increase student's options about which school \nthey attend.\n  All these things were bipartisan proposals, based on what local \nschool communities told us would work to improve results for students. \nAnd the great news is that many of these proposals have actually \nimproved things in Washington state schools.\n  And when I think about the partisan tone of this debate on education, \nand I look at the education IRA proposal which offers only a seven-\ndollar a year solution to only a few families--I think of all the \nthings we could be doing that would really make a difference for all \nstudents. And class size improvement is near the top of that list.\n  I think it is important to listen to what educators say. I want to \nread to you what some of the educators have written to me as I have \ntalked about this issue over the last several months.\n  Larry Swift, who is the executive director of the Washington State \nSchool Directors' Association, wrote to me, and I especially appreciate \nhis words because I am a former school board member and Larry Swift \nrepresents the school board members across my State. He says:\n\n       As we pursue our state's goal of improving learning for all \n     of our students, it becomes increasingly important that all \n     of our resources be used efficiently and effectively. The \n     most valuable resource in today's schools is the people who \n     devote their time and effort to make schools successful--the \n     teachers. Reducing the ratio of students to adults is \n     particularly critical for youngsters with a variety of \n     learning challenges that must be overcome if those students \n     are to meet the new, higher learning standards.\n\n  Mr. President, Larry Swift is right. Representing the school boards \nacross my country, he makes a very clear case that increasing the \nnumber of teachers and reducing the class size is critical because we \nare requiring our young students to know more today than we ever have \nbefore in the history of this country.\n  Let me also quote from Kenneth Winkes, who is the head of the \nAssociation of Washington State Principals. He represents all the \nprincipals in my State, and here is what they say:\n\n       It is increasingly evident that students entering our \n     schools have diverse and unique needs which can only be \n     addressed by principals, teachers, and support personnel who \n     are not overwhelmed by crowded classrooms. Rather, educators \n     must be able to devote attention to each student in smaller, \n     more manageable classes.\n\n  That is what principals say.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four short statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Washington State School\n\n\n                                       Directors' Association,\n\n                                      Olympia, WA, March 20, 1998.\n       ``As we pursue our state's goal of improving learning for \n     all of our students,'' Larry Swift, executive director of the \n     Washington State School Directors' Association, said, ``it \n     becomes increasingly important that all of our resources be \n     used efficiently and effectively.

It is increasingly \n     evident that students entering our schools have diverse and \n     unique needs which can only be addressed by principals, \n     teachers, and support personnel who are not overwhelmed by \n     crowded classrooms. Rather, educators must be able to devote \n     attention to each student in smaller, more manageable \n     classes.\n       Recent studies on reduced class size and their impact on \n     student performance, undertaken in Tennessee (STAR study) and \n     Wisconsin (SAGE study), speak to learner benefits in areas \n     such as reading, language arts, and math. In our own state of \n     Washington, reduction of class size and improved student \n     performance are priorities for both legislators and \n     educators.\n       AWSP is convinced that class size reduction is essential if \n     our state's, and nation's, efforts towards school improvement \n     are to be successful. We appreciate and support Senator Patty \n     Murray's commitment to this end.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                             Washington Education Association,\n\n                          Federal Way, WA, Friday, March 20, 1998.\n\n        WEA President Applauds Sen. Murray's Work on Class Size\n\n\n Statement of Lee Ann Prielipp, president of the Washington Education \nAssociation, regarding Sen. Patty Murray's work to lower class sizes in \n                       Washington, March 20, 1998\n\n       Every student deserves a safe and effective learning \n     environment, and we commend Sen. Murray's devotion to this \n     pressing issue. Washington currently has the fourth largest \n     class sizes in the United States, a dubious distinction which \n     we must work to change.\n       When educators have too many students in a class, it is \n     hard for them to give each student the individual attention \n     that students need. It is this individual attention that is \n     at the heart of the learning process, and it is crucial in \n     helping our students succeed.\n       The 65,000 members of WEA support Sen. Murray in her work \n     to lower class size in Washington. This is an issue that is \n     getting worse, and which we can no longer ignore. Thank you, \n     Senator Murray, for working to give our students the \n     education they need and deserve.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            American Federation of\n\n\n                                                     Teachers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1998.\n\nStatement by Sandra Feldman, President, American Federation of Teachers \n                        on Reducing Class Sizes\n\n       Modern schools and more well-trained teachers are the right \n     antidote for the overcrowding that plagues too many American \n     schools. Research shows that youngsters, especially in the \n     early grades, perform better in smaller classes that allow \n     for greater one-on-one instruction. Smaller classes also help \n     teachers maintain discipline. Parents and teachers understand \n     this well, and that's why Senator Murray is absolutely \n     correct in supporting the President's proposal to provide \n     subsidies for school construction and to emphasize teacher \n     recruitment.\n       Several new studies clearly demonstrate the link between \n     reduced class sizes and improved academic achievement. A \n     sampling:\n       STAR, the highly reputed Tennessee class-size study, \n     analyzed the achievement levels of K-3 students randomly \n     assigned to classes of 13 to 17. Those in small classes did \n     much better than students in regular classes in math and \n     reading, every year and in all grades. The small classes made \n     the biggest difference in the scores of children in inner-\n     city schools.\n       SAGE, a Wisconsin program begun in 1996-97, reduces class \n     size for K-3 children in certain high-poverty schools. At the \n     end of the first year, SAGE kids had made significantly \n     greater improvements in reading, language arts, and math than \n     children had in similar schools.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr, President, I have numerous quotes from teachers, and \nI can tell you from personal anecdotes, as I have talked with teachers \nthroughout my State, it makes a difference when you have time, it makes \na difference when you have to turn away three or four students with a \nquestion because you simply don't have time. We demand higher learning \nskills. We have a responsibility to do something about it. We can't \njust say, ``Oh, it's a local school district problem.'' ``Oh, it's a \nState problem.'' ``Oh, it's somebody else's problem.''\n  We have a responsibility in the U.S. Senate as leaders in this \ncountry to send a message that we want to make a difference and we are \nlistening to the people we represent that class size makes a \ndifference.\n  Let me also tell you what some students say, because I have a group \nof students who are my advisors. They are called my student advisory \nyouth involvement team or SAYIT. I go to them and ask them to tell me \nwhat they think of the issues we are debating.\n  On the issue of class size, this is what students say:\n  Brook Bodnar, who is age 16, recently moved from a school with larger \nclasses to Olympia High School which has smaller classes. She says:\n\n       . . . with smaller classes I'm learning so much more. Class \n     is going so much faster.\n\n  That is what a student says.\n  Jared Stueckle, age 16, a junior at Selah High School, believes \neducation should be a higher priority in funding and that class size is \na good investment. Jared says:\n\n       The classes in which the number (of students) is lower I \n     generally do better, but in a crowded class, the teacher does \n     not give us enough individual attention.\n\n  I have numbers of comments from young students. They are excellent. I \nask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Class Size Reduction--What Students Say\n\n       Meghan Sullivan, age 15, a 10th grader at Tumwater High \n     School, says: ``. . . reduction is needed especially at the \n     K-5 grade levels. This is the beginning of their education \n     and this is where they form study habits and learning skills, \n     so it's more important to get some one-on-one contact with \n     teachers.''\n       Antonella Novi, age 18, a senior at Anacortes High School, \n     says: ``Smaller class sizes enrich the learning experience \n     for the student and the teaching experience for the \n     teacher.''\n       Jaime Oberlander, age 16, a junior at Tumwater High School, \n     says: ``I know that I have learned more in smaller classes. I \n     have a stronger relationship with the teacher. I am less \n     intimidated to participate in class discussions or ask for \n     help when I need it. I also receive more feedback from my \n     teacher . . . my teacher can spend more time critiquing my \n     work and helping me to learn.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if we listen to parents, if we listen to \nteachers, if we listen to principals, if we listen to school board \nmembers, and if we listen to our children, we will hear what the \nAmerican public truly wants and knows is right. Parents say it, \nteachers say it, studies prove it: Smaller class sizes will make a \ndifference in our children's ability to learn.\n  My amendment simply says that it is the sense of the Congress that we \nwill move forward in any way we can to make sure that class sizes in \nthis country are reduced to manageable levels.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we certainly concur with the Senator \nfrom Washington that class size is a fundamental ingredient, a concern \nto everyone. I will simply say that perhaps there are two very \nmeaningful issues that would affect that.\n  We have just spent over an hour discussing a real bullet that is not \na sense of the Senate, it is a real bullet that would free up over $10 \nbillion to local schools to take care of whatever issue they have. If \nit is like the Senator from Missouri said, they had to have new \nclassrooms before they could hire new teachers. They could not use the \nteachers if they did not get the classrooms.\n  The Gorton amendment which has just been discussed would send over \n$10 billion to local schools to do just what the Senator from \nWashington wants to have done. They would be in a position and be freed \nto have resources to reduce their class size or to make more efficient \nthe facilities for teaching in these local school districts.\n  In a moment we will hear from the Senator from Arkansas, who brings a \nvery meaningful perspective to moving these resources directly to \nclassrooms and not letting it get siphoned off en route.\n  So, Mr. President, with these two points--we have just spent an hour \naddressing the issue that the amendment of the Senator from Washington \nalludes to, and we have a real solution here that will be before us \nthis afternoon that really gets to the problem--I yield the remainder \nof my time to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the last\n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\nminute of our time be reserved for Senator Coverdell from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  While no one questions the sincerity of the desire of my colleague \nfrom Washington to lower the class size and the student-teacher ratio, \nI think it once again reveals the huge philosophic chasm that has been \nevident time and time again during this debate on education and the \namendments that have been offered on the floor of the Senate, the \ndifference between the approach and the philosophy that we can best do \nthings controlled out of Washington, DC, that knowledge and wisdom \nflows from this city and this institution, and that we want to \nconcentrate the power and the control over education in this country in \nWashington.\n  The effort here to support the President's plan for hiring 100,000 \nnew teachers at the Federal level, I think, is once again evidence that \nthose of us who believe that there needs to be flexibility with local \ncontrol cannot accept this as moving in the right direction.\n  One size does not always fit all. While some schools may benefit from \nreduced class sizes, other schools may not benefit from reduced class \nsizes. In fact most teachers--most teachers --in this country are \nsatisfied with current class sizes.\n  For example, according to a survey by the Department of Education, 79 \npercent of the teachers in my home State of Arkansas are satisfied with \ncurrent class sizes--79 percent. My sister teaches in public school in \nRogers, AR. There are many things that my sister is not satisfied with \nabout education in Arkansas. I know that is true of public school \nteachers all across the State of Arkansas. There are many things they \nwould like to change and improve. But 79 percent said that that is one \narea that they currently are satisfied with, that the student-teacher \nratio is not the big problem in education in Arkansas.\n  Over three-quarters of the teachers in Connecticut, Kansas, Montana, \nNebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wyoming are satisfied with the \ncurrent class size ratio.\n  Nationally--I would call the attention of my colleagues--nationally \n65 percent of teachers are satisfied with current class sizes. So I \nsuggest if there is a crisis in class size, if there is one group in \nthis country that would know, it would be the teachers of this country. \nAnd the teachers of this country are saying that is one area where \nthere is not a crisis. Thus the Washington-knows-best proposal to hire \n100,000 new teachers does not make any sense.\n  Class size does not always mean better education. Many schools with \nsmall class sizes have poor achievement results, and vice versa. For \nexample, once again according to the Department of Education, \nWashington, DC, schools have one of the lowest average class sizes in \nthe Nation but ranks near the bottom in academic achievement; while \nUtah ranks near the bottom in class size ratio but ranks very high in \nstudent achievement. There is not a direct and definite correlation.\n  I further point out that average class size has already dropped \nsignificantly over the past 40 years and we have not seen a \ncorresponding improvement in student achievement. Average class size \nhas dropped from 27 to 1 in 1955, to 21 in 1975, to 17.3 today. Isn't \nit interesting that over the last 40 years, while we have seen class \nsizes consistently drop from 27 to 21 to 17.3, that student achievement \nscores--student achievement--have been dropping during that same 40-\nyear period?\n\n  Average elementary class size has dropped from 30.2 in 1955 to 18.5 \ntoday, a dramatic drop in class sizes on the elementary level, and once \nagain we have student achievement scores falling at the same time. \nAccording to the Department of Education, most States already have \naverage class sizes of 18 or less.\n  Although elementary classes are a little bit larger, the national \naverage now is 17.3, with the lowest being in New Jersey and Vermont at \n13.8, and the highest being in California at 24 and Utah at 23.8 and \nWashington State at 20.4.\n  The average elementary class size--18.5--due to demographics alone, \nis projected to fall over the next 10 years without any massive \ninfusion of teachers from the Federal level. We will, because of \ndemography, see the class sizes at the elementary level continue to \ndrop. Many States, independent of the Federal Government, independently \nof anything we do, are already taking actions to reduce class size. My \npoint being, we do not need a new Federal program to hire teachers when \nthe States are already addressing this problem. We should not be \nimposing this from the Federal level.\n  Five States--California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and \nWisconsin--have already taken dramatic steps to reduce class size by \nhiring thousands of new teachers in their States. These States are \nhiring teachers, and they are doing it with State dollars.\n  Senator Moseley-Braun yesterday shared convincing pictures that her \nState needs to use Federal money, if it gets it, for school \nconstruction and repair. I do not agree with a Federal program to do \nthat. But Illinois has an average class size of 17. Their great need, \naccording to Senator Moseley-Braun, is not for an infusion of teachers. \nTheir great need is actually in school construction.\n  That is the beauty of the Gorton approach. That is the beauty of the \ndollars-to-the-classrooms approach. I have a bill we introduced that \nwould ensure that the money actually reaches the local level and that \nthe local decisionmakers have the right to decide where the need is and \nhow that money should be spent.\n  Washington, DC, needs funds for school repair, textbooks and other \nsupplies in the District right here. The great need is not for more \nteachers in the Nation's Capital. The great need is school repair, \ntextbooks, other supplies, perhaps computers. They already have an \naverage class size of 15 in the District. And so what do we say? \n``Well, let's hire 100,000 new teachers.'' That is not the great need \nhere in our Nation's Capital. That is not the great need in the State \nof Arkansas.\n  There are many needs in education, some of them being resource \noriented. But for us to have a one-size-fits-all solution from \nWashington is not the direction we need to be going.\n  A new Federal teacher program would further add to the paperwork \nburden that our teachers already complain about, thus increasing the \ntrue cost of this program and reducing its effectiveness. As we have \nheard so often in this debate, we provide 6, 7 percent of local school \nfunding but we provide 50 to 60 percent of their regulations and their \npaperwork burden.\n  So what do we come up with? Another Federal solution with more \npaperwork and more regulations on that local level. New Federal \nprograms require new Federal bureaucrats to administer the program. We \nhave already placed an enormously heavy burden upon those local \nteachers, and we don't need to siphon off scarce Federal dollars going \nto the States currently to start a new program hiring large numbers of \nteachers with Federal dollars.\n  My sister, Gerri, teaches at the Reagan Elementary Public School in \nRogers, AR. She reflects the attitude of 79 percent of the teachers in \nArkansas that class size is not the big problem that she faces. \nDiscipline, yes; many other needs, yes. Class size is not at the top of \nthe list. Arkansas has made great strides. I think we rank 28th in \nstudent-teacher ratio nationally. Twenty-eighth is not great, but it is \nfar better than we are in many other categories, including academic \nscores and the percentage going on to college and so forth. So while we \nhave many challenges, we wouldn't put class size at the top of the \nlist. We couldn't. I have never heard my sister complain once about the \nsize of her class.\n  I believe the Gorton amendment that we will vote on later today--the \ndollars to the classroom bill, legislation that I have introduced, that \nwould ensure that 95 cents out of every dollar, Federal dollar, would \nactually reach the classroom and local control--is a far better \napproach. Allow local school boards, allow classroom teachers, greater \ndiscretion, greater flexibility on how those dollars are used, greater \nflexibility with fewer Federal mandates. Perhaps they need to paint the \nclassroom. Perhaps they need to buy a computer. Perhaps they need to \nhire a tutor. Perhaps they have another local need. But what we don't \nneed to do is to start a new Federal program and to hire massive \nnumbers of new teachers from the Federal level.\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining, and the \nother side has 2 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I listened with interest to my colleague from the other side of the \naisle debate the issue of whether or not we as parents across this \ncountry believe that our class sizes should be reduced and that it will \nmake a difference. I heard numbers that don't take into account what is \nreally happening, because that is the number of adults in a school that \nmy colleague from Arkansas referred to--the nurses, the counselors, \nlibrarians, social workers. What we are talking about here is the need \nto put new teachers across this country into classrooms so we can \nreduce class size.\n  I speak to all of the people who are listening to this debate today. \nWhen you hear somebody say your class sizes are the right size, think \nabout how many kids are in the classroom in your local school; think of \nthe amount of attention they are getting; think about whether or not \nthey are getting the skills that you as a parent want them to get. If \nyou agree with me that class size reduction will make a difference, \ncall this Senate and let us know. Call this Senate and let us know. \nPeople across this country need to let us know that you recognize it is \nour responsibility as adults at every level to make sure that our \nchildren are getting a good education. Parents know it, teachers know \nit, and studies show it: Class size reduction makes a difference. We \ncan't pass this off and say it is somebody else's responsibility; it is \nour responsibility.\n  I heard my colleague say there is a philosophical difference. You bet \nthere is a philosophical difference. There is a philosophical \ndifference between those who believe we should go down a path of block \ngrants and cuts, meaning high-need students will get less. There is a \nproposal that we eliminate the Department of Education and no longer \neven say public education is in the domain of this country or that we \ncare about it as a priority.\n  This current budget that was passed by the Republicans just a short \ntime ago cut education by $2.2 billion. The IRA proposal in front of us \nthat takes us down a road where somebody gets $7 in the year 2002 for \neducation, it is a narrow road that says in the future only a few \nchildren will get a good education.\n  The philosophy I believe is that every child, no matter who they are, \nwhere they come from, or how much money they have in these United \nStates of America, will be able to get a good public education. We can \ndo that by reducing class size, by rebuilding our crumbling schools, by \nmaking an investment in our teachers and training them with the skills \nthey need to teach our children. That is the philosophy that will make \nsure we have a strong democracy in the future.\n  I hope that parents across this country weigh in on this debate. It \nis a critical one for the future of all of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has 1 minute 47 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Let me respond to a couple of points. The Senator \nfrom Washington said the figures I used speak of a number of adults in \nthe school system. That is not the fact. The Department of Education \nhas provided these figures, and it speaks of class size. Average class \nsize has dropped from 27 in 1955 to 17.3 today. That is class size. It \nhas dropped dramatically. And while it has dropped dramatically, \nstudent achievement has decreased. Twenty-one countries tested in the \n12th grade math and science competency; the United States ranked 19th. \nThere is no disputing our schools have problems, but it is also very \nevident that simply reducing class size, as we have done over the last \n40 years, will not be the magic bullet. It will not be the panacea that \nsuddenly is going to give us great academic achievement.\n  What we do need is, in fact, greater local control, greater \nflexibility. The issue is not, as my colleague tried to make it, \nwhether we will eliminate the Department of Education; that is a red \nherring, a straw man.\n  The issue and the debate is whether we are going to provide greater \nflexibility and greater control at the local level, or whether we \ncontinue down the path that Washington, DC, is the fount of all wisdom, \nhave all our solutions float from the Nation's Capitol, and it is so \nevidently demonstrated we don't solve the problem, and in many cases we \nsimply exacerbate them.\n  I suggest this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is, while \nwell motivated, ill conceived and takes us down the road of further \nfederalizing education, placing greater mandates and greater burdens \nupon local teachers while not appreciably addressing the educational \nproblems we face in this country.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider there is a better way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Arkansas has \nexpired.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2296 to Amendment No. 2295\n\n   (Purpose: Expressing the sense of Congress that the Department of \n   Education, States, and local educational agencies should spend a \n greater percentage of Federal education tax dollars in our children's \n                              classrooms)\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have a second-degree amendment that I send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has reserved 1 \nminute.\n  Does the Senator from Arkansas yield that back?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield that back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2296 to amendment numbered 2295.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike all after ``TITLE ____'' and insert the following:\n                          --SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n     SEC. ____01. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of the United States know that effective \n     teaching takes place when the people of the United States \n     begin (A) helping children master basic academics, (B) \n     engaging and involving parents, (C) creating safe and orderly \n     classrooms, and (D) getting dollars to the classroom.\n       (2) Our Nation's children deserve an educational system \n     which will provide opportunities to excel.\n       (3) States and localities must spend a significant amount \n     of Federal education tax dollars applying for and \n     administering Federal education dollars.\n       (4) Several States have reported that although the States \n     receive less than 10 percent of their education funding from \n     the Federal Government, more than 50 percent of their \n     paperwork is associated with those Federal dollars.\n       (5) While it is unknown exactly what percentage of Federal \n     education dollars reaches the classroom, a recent audit of \n     New York City public schools found that only 43 percent of \n     their local education budget reaches the classroom; further, \n     it is thought that only 85 percent of funds administered by \n     the Department of Education for elementary and secondary \n     education reach the school district level; and even if 65 \n     percent of Federal education funds reach the classroom, it \n     still means that billions of dollars are not directly spent \n     on children in the classroom.\n       (6) American students are not performing up to their full \n     academic potential, despite the more than 760 Federal \n     education programs, which span 39 Federal agencies at the \n     price of nearly $100,000,000,000 annually.\n       (7) According to the Digest of Education Statistics, in \n     1993 only $141,598,786,000 out of $265,285,370,000 spent on \n     elementary and secondary education was spent on instruction.\n       (8) According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics, in 1994 only 52 percent of staff employed in \n     public elementary and secondary school systems were teachers.\n       (9) Too much of our Federal education funding is spent on \n     bureaucracy, and too little is spent on our Nation's youth.\n       (10) Getting 95 percent of Department of Education \n     elementary and secondary education funds to the classroom \n     could provide approximately $2,094 in additional funding per \n     classroom across the United States.\n       (11) More education funding should be put in the hands of \n     someone in a child's classroom who knows the child's name.\n       (12) President Clinton has stated: ``We cannot ask the \n     American people to spend more on education until we do a \n     better job with the money we've got now.''.\n       (13) President Clinton and Vice President Gore agree that \n     the reinventing of public education will not begin in \n     Washington but in communities across the United States and\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\n     that the people of the United States must ask fundamental \n     questions about how our Nation's public school systems' \n     dollars are spent.\n       (14) President Clinton and Vice President Gore agree that \n     in an age of tight budgets, our Nation should be spending \n     public funds on teachers and children, not on unnecessary \n     overhead and bloated bureaucracy.\n\n     SEC. ____02. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Department of \n     Education, States, and local educational agencies should work \n     together to ensure that not less than 95 percent of all funds \n     appropriated for the purpose of carrying out elementary and \n     secondary education programs administered by the Department \n     of Education is spent for our Nation's children in their \n     classrooms.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 minutes of debate equally divided \non this amendment.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. There is no doubt we are facing a crisis in American \neducation, a crisis that is putting us at risk economically. While it \nhas been 15 years since the education alarm was sounded in this Nation \nwith the report, ``A Nation at Risk,'' most indicators show that U.S. \neducation is still desperately in need of repair.\n  As I have suggested, mandating the hiring of 100,000 new teachers at \nthe Federal level is not the right answer. I further suggest there is a \nbetter way, and that is the dollars to the classroom. If we can take \nthe limited Federal dollars--and I think that is about 67 percent of \nlocal funding of the schools right now--if we can take those dollars \nand assure they actually reach the classroom, we will be far better \noff. Keep the local control. It will mean more money at the local \nlevel.\n  So the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that I am offering as a \nperfecting second-degree amendment would simply say that we will make \nour efforts to ensure that 95 cents out of every dollar actually \nreaches the classroom. Right now, money does not reach the classroom. \nIt is estimated between 15 percent and 35 percent of Federal funds \nspent on education never reaches the classroom. My colleagues, that is \nabsolutely amazing. That is astounding, that 15 to 35 percent of \nFederal funds spent on education never reach the classroom. That is as \nmuch as $5.4 billion of taxpayer money targeted to education that will \nget lost in nothing but bureaucracy. School systems waste their own \nmoney on Federal paperwork. Federal paperwork burdens account for 50 \npercent of paperwork completed at the State education agencies, yet \nonly 6 percent of their funds come from the Federal Government.\n  Federal money is wasted--wasted over and over again. If we can take a \nlook at this chart, we have a little example of where some of those \nFederal dollars are wasted. There are 21,922 publications listed by the \nDepartment. What are some of those publications that our tax dollars \nare being spent on?\n  They include: 140 studies on checklists; 13 studies on welding; 260 \nstudies on surveys; 100 studies on education researchers researching \ntheir research techniques; and 3 studies entitled ``Cement: The \nConcrete Experience.''\n  If there were any other evidence necessary to demonstrate that the \nsolution doesn't come from Washington, DC, I don't know what it would \nbe. This should be sufficient. Is it any wonder that only 65 cents out \nof every dollar actually reaches the classroom when we are spending \nFederal education dollars in these ways? Again, three studies were \nentitled, ``Cement: The Concrete Experience.''\n  We also spend Federal education dollars for closed captioning of \nprograms like Baywatch, Jerry Springer, Jenny Jones, Hard Copy, and \nMTV's Real World. Those are some of the areas where I believe we are \ncurrently wasting valuable and precious tax dollars.\n  So we find that between 15 and 35 percent of these funds are consumed \nat the Federal bureaucracy. So $5.4 billion of taxpayer money targeted \nto education will get lost in the bureaucracy. Federal money is wasted \ntime and time again. The fact is that a large portion of Federal \neducation dollars support this huge and growing Federal and State \neducation bureaucracy.\n  The question boils down to how we spend the money, not how much we \nspend. We throw money at problem after problem and find that the \nproblems simply get worse. Even the President said this: ``We cannot \nask the American people to spend more on education until we do a better \njob with the money we have got now.'' So I believe the solution--or at \nleast a step in the right direction is the dollars-to-the-classroom \nproposal. The fact is that those closest to the students are the \nparents. That is the first and best ``department of education'' that \nhas ever existed. And the teachers who spend every day in that \nclassroom with those children and the school administrators know best \nthe individual needs of the students. That is why I am offering this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Under the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, we urge that 95 percent of \nFederal funds should go to the classroom. If 95 percent went to the \nclassroom, each class would have an additional $2,094 to spend on their \nparticular needs.\n  I will show this chart to my colleagues. Under the dollars-to-the-\nclassroom amendment, simply go through the figures. The number of \nstudents in K through 12 in the United States is 51.7 million. \nElementary and secondary Department of Education outlays for fiscal \nyear 1997, according to CBO, were $15.04 billion. The current estimate \nof above-mentioned dollars to the classrooms, the 65 percent that \nactually make it to the classroom under current policies, is $9.78 \nbillion. The goal of the above-mentioned dollars to the classrooms, 95 \npercent, would be $14.29 billion that would get to the classroom. So \nthe added dollars for use in the classroom are over $4.5 billion. That \nis without any new taxes. Without any new appropriations necessary, we \nwould free up $4.5 billion for use in the classroom to be determined by \nthe local school boards as to how that money could best be spent. That \ncould be the hiring of additional teachers. It could be that in some \nschool districts the great need is to lower classroom sizes. It could \nalso be that they need to build a new school building or purchase some \ncomputers. It could be that they need to hire a tutor to help in a \nparticular academic area. Additional dollars per student under this \nformula of 95 percent would be $89.23 per student. Average class size \nis 23.2 for teachers in departments, 25.2 for self-employed--\napproximately 24 children per class. If you multiply by 24, you come \nout with over $2,000 per classroom.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that that is a far wiser approach than \nstarting a new Federal program. The classroom is where learning occurs. \nIt is where knowledge grows. It is not in some stuffy office in \nWashington where 35 cents out of every dollar is currently being spent. \nThus, we should get the money away from Washington and drive it to the \nclassrooms through that block grant approach that has been so \nridiculed. We would be able to accomplish that, where local school \nboards or the States would be able to make those decisions.\n\n  This resolution--it is only a sense of the Senate--lays the \ngroundwork for getting education dollars to the schools, where local \nofficials and parents and teachers can decide how best to spend the \nmoney. The question is, whom do we trust? Do we trust Washington, or \nlocal school boards, local schools, teachers and parents? A vote for \nthis perfecting second-degree amendment is a vote for the classroom in \nyour States and a vote against bureaucracy. That is the question. Do \nyou want it down in the classroom or do you want to have another \nFederal bureaucracy hiring more teachers, another overlay, another step \nin federalizing education in this country?\n  I ask my colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution on \ndollars to the classroom, where the money can best be used, where the \ndecisions can best be made.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. But I see the \nSenator from Washington on her feet at this time. Maybe she would like \nto address this and then I will make some brief comments about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have had a brief chance to take a look \nat this amendment. We have not seen it before 10 minutes ago. We are \nlooking at the language now.\n  The Senator from Arkansas says that he wants 95 percent of the money \nto go\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\nto classrooms. I don't think anybody disagrees with that. In fact, it \nis my understanding that much more than that--in fact, 98 percent of \nFederal funds actually go to school districts and classrooms. So what \nhe is asking for currently is in place.\n  We go back to why I originally put this amendment before us, which is \nthe fact that we have classrooms that are overcrowded, classrooms where \nchildren are not learning. We have classrooms where we as elected \nofficials are demanding that our students learn math, reading, and \nlanguage skills but simply do not have the ability to do it because of \novercrowded classrooms.\n  Mr. President, we will continue to take a look at this language. I \nyield to my colleague from Massachusetts for a comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington is really targeted on a key area of educational policy--that \nis, the reduced class size--for all the reasons she eloquently \npresented to the Senate just a few moments ago. It is a time-tested way \nof enhancing academic achievement and accomplishment for our public \nschools. The fact is that she has taken this proposal, offered it to \nthe Senate so that we would have an opportunity to state whether we \nbelieve that smaller class size would be useful and helpful, \nparticularly in the early grades. That is what this is really targeted \non.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has come in and offered an amendment that \neffectively vitiates her amendment, by saying that we should be \ncommitted to at least 95 cents of the educational dollar going into the \nclassroom. Well, we are in favor of that. This is a rather clever way, \nevidently, by our Republican friends of trying to obscure the issue of \nwhether smaller class size is an important educational tool.\n  We agree that 95 percent of the funds ought to go to the classrooms. \nIn many programs, it's more than 95 percent; 98 percent goes through to \nthe classrooms. So why the Senator has made this proposal is to wipe \nout the Murray amendment. Let's not fool ourselves. We can stand up \nhere all day long and say how we want to preserve taxpayer funding to \ntargeted areas in educational programs. We are for it. We are all for \nit. It is not a new idea. It has already been accepted in the House of \nRepresentatives. We hope there will be a voice vote on it. But we ask \nthe Senator, why attempt to vitiate the excellent program or deny the \nSenator the opportunity to get a vote on her program for smaller class \nsize?\n  That is what you are basically about. Let's not kid ourselves. Let's \nnot stand up here and take the time of the U.S. Senate and try to say \nwe are all for trying to get the money into the classroom. We are all \nfor that. The Senator has the legitimacy to take the time of the Senate \nto do so. We are for it. But what you should say is: By accepting my \namendment, we effectively emasculate the Murray amendment, which has \ntried to put the Senate on record saying that smaller classrooms can be \none of a number of tools to try to enhance academic achievement and \naccomplishment.\n  You are effectively trying to deny that. Let's call a spade a spade. \nThat is why I certainly hope that we have every intention of getting a \nvote on the Murray concept. We will have that opportunity to do so at \nsome time. I hope we will persevere.\n\n  I think the amendment of the Senator from Washington is a carefully \ncrafted amendment and that we in this body understand the importance of \nmoving towards smaller class size. I heard the Senator eloquently speak \nfrom her own personal experience. There isn't a Member in this body who \ncan speak with the personal experience of the Senator from Washington. \nShe has been in the classroom. She has been in large classes and in \nsmaller classes and has been a school board member. There isn't a \nMember in the Senate who can claim those kinds of credentials. She \nknows about this as an important concept.\n  We are not going to be denied by any Senator in here from at least \ngetting an opportunity to vote on that. You can try what you like, but \nyou are not going to be successful. I hope we can get beyond the chaff \nthat is out here and get to the real wheat, which is the Senator's \namendment.\n  If the Senator wants to have a vote on his, good. I hope we would get \non with it, if we are serious about having an education debate. But \nmake no mistake about it. The thrust of the Senator's amendment is to \neffectively deny the Senate an opportunity to vote on the Murray \namendment because we all virtually agree. I have not heard a voice out \nhere that isn't going to support the Senator's amendment, which is \nabout 95 cents out of every dollar going to the classroom. That is not \nwhat this is about. It is to deny the Senator from Washington of having \na fair chance to have her amendment heard. We know our Republican \nfriends are so tied up with this idea of using scarce resources for \nprivate schools, and we know the drive that has in terms of the whole \nCoverdell proposal. But they want to deny even the opportunity for the \nSenate to address in a short period of time a very important and \nsignificant educational policy issue. Even under these restrictive \nrules, which we had to agree to, they are not going to be able to \nprohibit the Senator from getting a vote on it.\n  I hope that we do that in a way that will be accommodated. We can do \nit nice or do it rough. But we are going to get a vote on it. The \nSenator can make up his mind which way he wants to play with it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, may I inquire? What time is available, \nwithout consuming time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington controls 8 \nminutes; the Senator from Arkansas is in control of 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas may want to \nrespond. But let me make a point that his amendment essentially, as the \nSenator from Massachusetts says, wipes out the Murray amendment dealing \nwith class size and 100,000 teachers and reducing the class size of \nfirst, second, and third grades to an average of 18 students.\n  The point I made the other day is that this debate is about the \npriorities of need in education. The Senator from Georgia brings a bill \nto the floor and says the priority of need is a provision for a tax \ncredit, the bulk of which will go to wealthy folks who send kids to \nprivate schools. That is his priority of need. It is not me saying \nthat; it is now the Department of Treasury saying that of the \nlegislation.\n  The Senator from Washington says there is another need. We talked \nearlier about school construction. The President and the Senator from \nWashington has done a lot of work on this issue and talk about the need \nto reduce the class size of first, second, and third grades. We know \nthat makes a difference in education. That is not rocket science. We \nknow that works. That makes a difference in education.\n\n  The second-degree perfecting amendment that has been offered \nessentially obliterates this and takes it out. The Senator from \nMassachusetts just indicated--he is absolutely correct--that we are \ngoing to get a vote on the amendment offered by the Senator from \nWashington, Senator Murray. We have a right to get that vote. We will, \nbecause the Senator from Arkansas says he wants to obliterate that \namendment. We will then come back and offer a second-degree at the end \nof his amendment, and we will get this vote later now rather than \nsooner. But we will get it.\n  So I don't have any objection to somebody coming to the floor saying \nlet's have 99 percent of the money spent on education going into the \nclassroom. I have no objection to that. I have no objection to his \namendment at all. What I object to is he comes to the floor and says--\nby the way, the Senator from Washington worked on this for some while, \nand it was one called for in the President's State of the Union \nAddress--we will just wipe that out. That is not part of the unanimous \nconsent. She has a right to vote on it. What we will do at 11:30 in the \nmorning is just wipe it out.\n  Finally, let me propound a parliamentary inquiry, if I might, to the \nPresiding Officer. Is it not the case that the Senator from Washington \nwill be able to offer a second-degree amendment at the end of the \nperfecting amendment providing this perfecting amendment is approved by \nthe Senate at some appropriate point in this process and get a vote on \nthe second-degree amendment?\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Upon disposition or taking care of the \nHutchinson second-degree, other second-degrees would be in order.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. How much time do I control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as I began my remarks, I was not \ntrying to play dirty pool, or something, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts has suggested. The rules are the rules. The rules allow \nme to offer a second-degree amendment. As I expressed at the very \nbeginning, I think there is a big philosophic difference as to how we \nimprove education in this country because I don't believe that a \nFederal program of 100,000 new teachers is the best way to do it. It \ndoesn't mean that I somehow am playing dirty pool. We have a great \ndifference of opinion as to what is the best approach.\n  Everybody stands up and says what we want in this case is to just \nlower the class size and we are going to have better schools. No one \ndeals with the figures. No one deals with the facts that I have given. \nI wish somebody would. The Department of Education gives us figures \nsaying from 1955, when the class size average was 27 in this country \nuntil the current time when the average size is 18.5 in elementary, \n17.3 overall, that we have seen class size drop now by over 10 per \nclass size. During the same 40-year period, we have seen academic \nachievement decrease.\n  Furthermore, I wish somebody would explain this to me. Here in \nWashington, DC, we have one of the lowest average class sizes in the \nNation--13. Yet, our Nation's Capital ranks near the bottom in academic \nachievement. If this is the solution, why 100,000? Let's hire 200,000, \nif the solution to education in this country is getting class sizes \ndown. Let's get it down to 10. But the fact is we have seen class sizes \ndrop and drop and drop, and at the same time we have seen academic \nscores--nationalized achievement tests--drop and drop and drop. What do \nwe do? Let's hire more teachers. That is bound to help. Yet, no one \nwants to deal with the issue. They just want to say this isn't right, \nthat you should offer a second-degree amendment.\n  By the way, I am so glad about the endorsement of the 95 cents out of \nevery dollar going to classrooms. There is legislation that would do \nthat. I expect now--as Senator Dorgan says--I don't think they actually \nwill but I hope that we get the dollars for the classrooms and allow us \nto get that money to the classrooms. It is a better approach.\n  In Utah, the State of Utah ranks near the bottom in class size. In \nfact, I think it was 48th in class size. Yet, they are at the top \nnationally in student achievement. But the way we are going to solve \nthe school problems in this country is hire more teachers.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. No, I will not yield for questions at this time. I \nresent the implication that somehow I have violated the comity of the \nprocess by offering a second-degree amendment which sincerely reflects \nmy desire to address the education problems in this Nation in what I \nbelieve is a better way and my sincere--my sincere--reluctance to \nfurther federalize education in this country by hiring 100,000 new \nteachers with Federal funds. I think it is the wrong direction.\n  I think it is the right of any Senator to come and propose a better \nway.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 3 minutes 1 \nsecond remaining.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas has offered an \namendment that strikes the amendment offered by the Senator from \nWashington. We had a unanimous consent agreement in this Chamber on how \nwe were going to handle amendments. It provided that she was going to \nhave an opportunity to offer her amendment and get a vote on her \namendment. I didn't use the words ``dirty pool.'' The Senator did. But \nmy point is, if we had an agreement that she was going to be able to \noffer this amendment on the Senate floor and the Senator comes and \nstrikes her amendment, it seems to me that is not what we agreed to \nsome long while ago when we agreed to the rules of this debate.\n  The Senator is within his rights of offering the second degree. I \ndon't disagree. But my point is the Senator comes to the floor, not \njust advancing his ideas, but essentially prevents her from getting a \nvote on her amendment because the Senator strikes the Murray amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am not sure what the question is. I yielded for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask a question. And while you do this you make the \npoint apparently larger class sizes are better. Do you believe that?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have not made that point, as we all well know. Let \nme say again, what I think I demonstrated very, very clearly is that \nthere is no evidence that simply lowering class size is going to \nimprove academic achievement. That's been the assertion from the other \nside.\n  I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I just wanted to clarify the unanimous consent \nagreement. I have been off the floor for a moment. But the unanimous \nconsent agreed to 12 Democrat amendments, 5 Republican amendments and \nany second degrees, unlimited. So I don't think anything has happened \nhere that was not appropriate under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Is it your understanding that my offering of the \nsecond-degree amendment is any violation of comity as to the agreement \nthat was entered into?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No, there is not. That's the point.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Any implication that somehow I have wronged the \nSenator from Washington in offering this would be inaccurate?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is inaccurate.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2296, as modified\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I believe I have control of the floor. I ask the \nSenator from Georgia if he would be agreeable to me offering this as a \nfirst-degree amendment with a recorded vote and removing this as a \nsecond-degree amendment, in my effort, in my desire to be as agreeable \nand cooperative as possible to the Senator from Washington?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If I understand--I just heard this--what the Senator \nfrom Arkansas is saying, there is a suggestion that your second degree \nwould be framed as a first degree?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. On which there would be a vote, and then there would \nbe a vote on the amendment of the Senator from Washington absent the \nsecond degree. So both proposals would be voted on. It is my \nunderstanding that was agreeable to the Senator from Washington. If it \nis agreeable to the Senator from Arkansas, I think that could be \nfacilitated.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. It is agreeable to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator will yield, I will get a vote then on my \namendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Georgia want to propose \nthat as a unanimous consent request?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Let me propose it as a unanimous consent request then.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I have not had a chance to respond. How much time do I \nhave remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. When I said no more time, I didn't mean to interrupt \nthe time already allotted.\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is it the Senator's intention there be no second-degree \nintervening amendment before voting on the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Washington?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes. We are agreeing to have a vote on the amendment \nof the Senator from Washington and the amendment of the Senator from \nArkansas, and no other amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, again reserving, and I shall not object, \nthis does correct exactly what we were complaining about. I appreciate \nvery much the opportunity to do that because the unanimous consent \nagreement gave her the understanding that she was going to be able to \noffer an amendment, provide the debate and get a vote on her amendment. \nI do not represent that the intention here was to deliberately prevent \nthat. But the effect----\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Such a suggestion was made.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But the effect of it is to prevent her from getting a \nvote on her amendment unless it is corrected. This does correct it, and \nI think it makes a great deal of sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2296), as modified, reads as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                      TITLE   --SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n     SEC. ____01. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of the United States know that effective \n     teaching takes place when the people of the United States \n     begin (A) helping children master basic academics, (B) \n     engaging and involving parents, (C) creating safe and orderly \n     classrooms, and (D) getting dollars to the classroom.\n       (2) Our Nation's children deserve an educational system \n     which will provide opportunities to excel.\n       (3) States and localities must spend a significant amount \n     of Federal education tax dollars applying for and \n     administering Federal education dollars.\n       (4) Several States have reported that although the States \n     receive less than 10 percent of their education funding from \n     the Federal Government, more than 50 percent of their \n     paperwork is associated with those Federal dollars.\n       (5) While it is unknown exactly what percentage of Federal \n     education dollars reaches the classroom, a recent audit of \n     New York City public schools found that only 43 percent of \n     their local education budget reaches the classroom; further, \n     it is thought that only 85 percent of funds administered by \n     the Department of Education for elementary and secondary \n     education reach the school district level; and even if 65 \n     percent of Federal education funds reach the classroom, it \n     still means that billions of dollars are not directly spent \n     on children in the classroom.\n       (6) American students are not performing up to their full \n     academic potential, despite the more than 760 Federal \n     education programs, which span 39 Federal agencies at the \n     price of nearly $100,000,000,000 annually.\n       (7) According to the Digest of Education Statistics, in \n     1993 only $141,598,786,000 out of $265,285,370,000 spent on \n     elementary and secondary education was spent on instruction.\n       (8) According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics, in 1994 only 52 percent of staff employed in \n     public elementary and secondary school systems were teachers.\n       (9) Too much of our Federal education funding is spent on \n     bureaucracy, and too little is spent on our Nation's youth.\n       (10) Getting 95 percent of Department of Education \n     elementary and secondary education funds to the classroom \n     could provide approximately $2,094 in additional funding per \n     classroom across the United States.\n       (11) More education funding should be put in the hands of \n     someone in a child's classroom who knows the child's name.\n       (12) President Clinton has stated: ``We cannot ask the \n     American people to spend more on education until we do a \n     better job with the money we've got now.''.\n       (13) President Clinton and Vice President Gore agree that \n     the reinventing of public education will not begin in \n     Washington but in communities across the United States and \n     that the people of the United States must ask fundamental \n     questions about how our Nation's public school systems' \n     dollars are spent.\n       (14) President Clinton and Vice President Gore agree that \n     in an age of tight budgets, our Nation should be spending \n     public funds on teachers and children, not on unnecessary \n     overhead and bloated bureaucracy.\n\n     SEC. ____02. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Department of \n     Education, States, and local educational agencies should work \n     together to ensure that not less than 95 percent of all funds \n     appropriated for the purpose of carrying out elementary and \n     secondary education programs administered by the Department \n     of Education is spent for our Nation's children in their \n     classrooms.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Washington is on \nthe floor. I will just take a moment or two to talk about support for \nsmaller class sizes. The idea that we say this is going to be the \nanswer in education, of course, no one has represented that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Two minutes. No one has represented that.\n  But what we have found, for example, as a result of very extensive \nhearings--I do not know which ones were cited--is that in Flint, MI, \nefforts over the last 3 years to reduce class size in grades K through \n3 have lead to a 44 percent increase in reading scores and an 18 \npercent increase in math scores. In Wisconsin, student achievement in \ngrades K through 3 is also finding similar results. Project STAR in \nTennessee, K through 3 in 80 different schools in Tennessee. And in \nCalifornia similar kinds of results. So the idea that this is not a \nworthwhile educational policy tied into other education policy as a way \nto help to assist local schools that make that judgment fails, I think, \nto be credible, and I think that is why we are all grateful we are \ngoing to be in a situation that we can have the vote on the amendment \nof the Senator from Washington and a vote on the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas. I hope this body will vote in favor of both.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for bringing this very important \nmeasure to the Senate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues from \nMassachusetts and North Dakota because they are stating the case quite \ncorrectly on class size. It absolutely makes a difference when you \nreduce class size particularly in lower grades.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has cited what several empirical \nstudies have shown. The Educational Testing Service says that empirical \nevidence is clear; smaller classes can make higher levels of student \nachievement, at least in the elementary school grades and particularly \nfor disadvantaged students.\n  We have submitted these studies for the Record, and our colleagues \nare welcome to look at the Record. But I can tell you as an educator, \nclearly class size makes a difference. There is not a parent in this \ncountry who does not want to send their child off to school and know \nthat they are learning how to read, that they are learning how to \nwrite, that they are learning math skills. When you have reduced class \nsize, it makes a difference. Ask any parent. Ask any student. Ask any \nteacher. It will make a difference.\n  Every parent asks their child on the first day of school when they \ncome home, ``Who is your teacher? How many kids in your classroom?'' \nThey ask that because they know it makes a difference. Parents know it. \nStudents know it. Teachers know it. And the studies show it. If you \nwant to help IDEA kids, to which many of my colleagues have been \nalluding on the floor, I will tell you that class size matters. It \nmatters more than anything else. I think it is absolutely imperative \nthat this Senate go on record stating that we understand that. We are \nnot going to ignore it. We are not going to come up with all kinds of \narguments about paperwork and bureaucracy and federalism. We are going \nto say that as leaders in this country we understand that class size \nmakes a difference. We want to make a difference for our children in \nour schools across this country, and we can by passing this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The question to my colleague from Washington is: How \nmuch does your proposal cost, and are these going to be Federal \nteachers? Are they going to be paid for entirely by the Federal \nGovernment or partly by the State government? What is the cost \nallocation?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. In the President's State of the Union Address, he said \nhe\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\nwanted us, in our budget, to add 100,000 additional teachers in our \nclassrooms just as we added 100,000 police officers. Within our budget, \nwe will look at how we can do that. My sense of the Senate simply puts \nus on record, as leaders in this country, that we are going to move in \nthis direction. We have numerous ways of looking at it.\n  If we can fund roads, if we can fund construction projects across \nthis country, if we can fund numerous projects that we have in our \nbudgets, we certainly can fund lower class sizes for our students \nacross this country that will make a difference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Washington has \nexpired. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that each side have an \nadditional 2 minutes to discuss this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague's response. I said, How much \nis it going to cost? She said it is in the President's budget. The \nPresident's budget says we will spend $7.3 billion to hire an \nadditional 100,000 teachers. It doesn't really define in the budget how \nthat is going to be done. My colleague from Washington said it is going \nto be done like we did community policing. He has a goal to hire \n100,000 community police. When that started out, it was 100 percent or \n75 percent Federal, and then 50 percent Federal, and then 25 percent \nFederal each succeeding year, and the individual communities had to \npick up the greater costs.\n  I laugh at that. A lot of communities are saying, ``We like the \nprogram when the Federal Government is paying all of it. We don't like \nit when we have to pay all of it.''\n  Then I asked my communities in the State, I went around to several \ncommunities--I am sure several of my colleagues did--and said, ``Are \nyou going to get one of these teachers? Is your school going to get a \nteacher? Is your school going to get a teacher? Who is going to be \nlucky enough to get the Federal teacher?'' I don't think it makes any \nsense.\n  Do I want smaller class size? I would say, in general, yes. Do I \nthink the Federal Government should mandate it, should pay for it? The \nanswer is no. I think the solution is, as our Senator from Washington \nsaid, let's give the money and power and control back to the States, \nand if they want smaller class size, they can make that decision. If \nthey want new buildings, they can make that decision. If they want new \ncomputers, they can make that decision. We should not try to say, ``Oh, \nwe think this classroom should have another teacher. We are going to \nhave a Federal teacher here and have the Federal Government pay 75 \npercent of it or 50 percent of it for the first year.'' I just don't \nthink it makes sense. I don't think it is affordable.\n\n  The $7.3 billion the President had in his budget was financed on the \nso-called tobacco deal, and we don't even know whether or not it is \ngoing to happen. So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of my \nfriend and colleague from Arkansas saying that 95 percent of this money \nshould go directly to the classroom. I urge my colleagues not to say we \nshould be dictating to the States how, and put Federal teachers or \nfederally-paid-for teachers in the schools. I think it would be a \nserious mistake.\n  If we want to have a sense of the Senate, ``Hey, we urge you to have \nsmaller class size,'' and leave it to the States, fine. But the \nimplication of the amendment of the Senator from Washington is that we \nneed to have the President's program, we need to have the Federal \nGovernment writing checks for teachers in individual school districts, \nand I think that is a mistake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have 2 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes remaining under your \ncontrol.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I appreciate the Senator from Oklahoma and his \nclarification on the amendment, the sense-of-the-Senate resolution of \nthe Senator from Washington, because it is not clear whether these are \nFederal teachers, federally funded or not. It is clear now that it is \nSenator Murray's intention that this fulfill the President's request in \nhis budget; that is $7.3 billion.\n  We all want smaller class sizes. My point has been that we have been \ngetting that. Mr. President, 27 was the average class size in 1955, 21 \nin 1975, 17.3 today. Class sizes are dropping. They will continue to. \nDemographically, we are told class sizes will continue to decrease.\n  Furthermore, we know as well that many States are already addressing \nthis problem. California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and \nWisconsin have taken dramatic steps to reduce class size on their own. \nOur whole point has been that 100,000 new teachers hired at the Federal \nlevel is not the best use of $7.3 billion. We would be far wiser in use \nof limited Federal resources to ensure that that money gets to the \nclassroom, as opposed to starting another Federal initiative, another \nFederal effort.\n  We know that our schools have problems. Mr. President, 25 percent of \n12th grade scores were below basic reading in the 1994 NAPE test. The \nliteracy level of young adults, 15 to 21, dropped 11 points between \n1984 and 1994. That has happened simultaneous with smaller class sizes. \nWe all want smaller class sizes. I think that is wonderful. But is that \nthe best use of scarce resources? The answer is no.\n  What is the correct answer is to provide maximum flexibility with the \nfewest possible mandates, ensuring that the highest percentage possible \nof those dollars gets to the classroom. That is what my amendment does. \nThat is what the ``dollars to the classroom'' proposal is all about--\nmore money to the classroom with fewer regulations and fewer controls \nfrom the bureaucrats in Washington, DC. I think most Americans agree \nwith that, I think most schoolteachers agree with that, and I am sure \nmost parents agree with that proposal.\n  So I ask my colleagues to vote for this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. It expresses their reluctance, skepticism about another \nFederal program hiring another 100,000 teachers for our local schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the Senator from Arkansas has \nexpired. The Senator from Washington has 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the \neducation debate because I care deeply about public education in this \ncountry. I believe that our democracy was founded on the principle that \nall children, no matter who they are or where they come from or how \nmuch money they have, should have the opportunity within our public \neducation system in this country to get a good education. I have gone \nacross my State and asked parents and teachers and principals and \nschool board members, What will make a difference? And resoundingly \nthey have said to me we need to focus attention on class size; the \nSenate needs to focus their attention on class size.\n  I am, frankly, really tired of the argument that our public education \nsystem has failed. Our public education system has not failed. We have \nfailed our public education system. And we have failed it because we \nhave not put in the adequate resources for what we are demanding, as \nleaders in this country--that our children learn how to read and write \nand get the skills they need to get jobs one day. These are skills we \nare demanding. Yet we turn our backs and say we are not going to fund \nit.\n  This is an issue of priorities. Are we going to fund public education \nin this country? Or are we going to do what my Republican colleagues \ndid in this budget and cut $2.2 billion from education? Mr. President, \nwe can go down a narrow road in this country, and we can pass vouchers, \nand we can say that we can block grant, and we can make sure that a few \nkids get a public education. But that is not the country I was born and \nraised in. That is not the philosophy I believe in. I believe we can do \nthe right thing. I know, and I will tell all of you: Reducing class \nsize makes a difference. Ask any parent. Ask any parent if they know \nthat it makes a difference, and they will tell you yes, it does.\n  Mr. President, this is a simple amendment that we are offering. It\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\nsimply says this Congress understands that class size reduction is an \nissue that makes a difference and we are willing to look at how we can \nhelp make that happen across this country. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Washington has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nHutchinson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2295\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The yeas and nays on the Murray amendment, Mr. \nPresident? I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Murray amendment \nand the Hutchinson amendment are temporarily laid aside. The Senator \nfrom Indiana, Mr. Coats, is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2297\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide an \n additional incentive to donate to elementary and secondary schools or \n    other organizations which provide scholarships to disadvantaged \n                   children, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2297.\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, can I inquire of the time allotted to the \nSenator for this amendment? My understanding is it is 15 minutes. Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 30 minutes on \nthis amendment, equally divided. So 15 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first of all, I compliment the author of \nthe underlying legislation. It has been an extraordinary effort. It is \na bipartisan effort, we ought to stress, and it is one that clearly \noffers long-term improvement in education and opportunities in \neducation for many Americans. I thank them for their work on this, and \nI intend to support them when it comes to a vote.\n  There has been a critique of the legislation in that most of the \nbenefits will flow to middle-income Americans and above, and that we \nare not paying adequate attention to low-income Americans and \nparticularly those who attend urban schools, so many of which are \nfailing urban schools.\n\n  That critique is really misplaced because that is not the intent of \nthe bill. There have been other opportunities offered on this floor, \nagain, in a bipartisan fashion. Senator Lieberman and I have joined \nforces on a number of occasions to try to address specifically the \nproblems of low-income students, minority students, who are receiving \ninadequate educations, and each time those efforts have been met with a \nfilibuster and defeated.\n  There have been other initiatives. I have offered some, and other \nMembers have offered some. We are going to continue to do that. So the \ncritique is really misplaced. But in an effort to strengthen the \nunderlying bill which we are addressing, I am offering this amendment \nwhich I will explain in a moment.\n  It is clear that there will be Americans, a sizable number of \nAmericans, who don't have the income to take advantage of the tax-free \nsavings accounts that are created in this legislation. Under the best \nof circumstances,\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\nit would take them years to accumulate the amount of money necessary to \nutilize those funds for alternative means of education. We cannot \nafford years. We are losing people to the system, and it is an \ninadequate system.\n  Let me take a moment to talk about that crisis that exists in urban \neducation.\n  A recent study published by Education Week points out just how \ndesperate the situation has become. In 1997, just 43 percent of grade-\nschool-age children attending urban schools met the basic standard for \nreading skills, and that ``basic,'' just for my colleagues' \nunderstanding, is defined as being able to read a very simple child's \nbook or children's literature. Among children attending urban schools \nin high-poverty areas, basic reading ability rates fall to just 23 \npercent of students. Think of it: Fewer than one in three children \nattending schools in poor neighborhoods can read a simple story; two-\nthirds of nonurban students meet the basic standard for mathematics.\n  Among urban students in high-poverty areas, this one-in-three \nstatistic is truly disturbing. Looking at the area of science, while 65 \npercent of nonurban students are meeting the basic standard in science \nachievement, only 38 percent of urban students perform this, and in \nhigh-poverty schools, only 31 percent. So, again, fewer than one in \nthree are meeting these standards.\n  A public school system in which over two-thirds of our children are \nfunctionally illiterate in reading, in science, in math is a system \nthat cannot and must not be defended. Yet, those who are opposing any \nefforts to try to move this system to improve it or reform it, to \nprovide alternatives for children trapped in the system, are met with \ndisdain, are met with challenges.\n  The logic--actually, I should say the illogic--of the opponents of \nattempts at reform is difficult to understand, because it is literally \ncondemning poor children to an inadequate education. The one chance \nthey have to escape the plight that they live in is being denied them, \nbecause people want to maintain--some people want to maintain--the \nstatus quo, and the status quo is bankrupt.\n  Every year, we debate, as I said, different proposals to permit these \nlow-income children to escape the plight in which they find themselves. \nEvery year, we talk about the need for competition to force public \nschools to reform the way in which they teach their children. And every \nyear, we are met on the Senate floor with a filibuster by those who \nsay, ``No; let's maintain the status quo in the name of absolute \nequality.''\n\n  One of the analogies that is often used is that we are just simply \ntrying to throw lifeboats out and scholarships are just lifeboats that \nare not available to all; and if they are not available to all, then \nthey shouldn't be available to anybody.\n  A lot of us have seen the recent epic ``The Titanic.'' Fortunately, \nthe opponents of the basis of the proposal that, if you can't help \neverybody, you shouldn't help anybody were not running the Titanic, \nbecause then everybody would have been denied an opportunity to escape \non a lifeboat because there were not enough lifeboats for everybody.\n  If we cannot help everybody all at once, we are not going to help \nanybody. That is the logic of the opponents of any attempt, whether it \nis this bill, whether it is the voucher bill that this Senator, Senator \nLieberman, and others have been offering, or whether it is any other \nproposal that other Members have been offering. That is the logic of \nthe opposition. It does not match up.\n  Recently--I think it was just yesterday or maybe a couple days ago--\nthe President at a press conference with the Democratic leadership \nchallenged the supporters of scholarships to make their case to the \nNation, he said. The President said, ``You ought to do something rather \nthan just talk about it.''\n  Mr. President, I don't know where you have been lately--well, maybe I \ndo know, preoccupied with other matters--but if you will just look very \nclosely, you will understand that things are being done by those who \nfavor the proposal. We are doing something.\n  Currently, there are 32 privately funded scholarship programs \noperating across this country. In virtually every major urban area of \nthis Nation--New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Seattle, Indianapolis, \nAlbany, San Antonio, Atlanta, just to name a few--private citizens are \njoining forces to provide poor children a way out of collapsing public \nschool systems. To date, these foundations have raised over $30 million \nand have provided assistance to over 13,000 children. Just this \nmorning, we learned that a major private funder of private school \nchoice announced a $50 million gift to San Antonio's program that will \npermit any low-income student in the San Antonio system to opt out of a \npublic school if they are not getting an adequate education.\n  I say we are putting our money where our mouths are. Individuals are \nstepping forward, people are addressing it and are doing so out of a \nmatter of desperation, desperation that children are being left behind \nand are not buying into this idea that if you cannot do it for \neverybody right now, don't do it for anybody.\n  The demand for this is rising. We are all familiar with the New York \nCity Private Scholarship Foundation. When they announced they had 13 \nnew scholarships for low-income children, they received 17,000 \napplications. Ten percent of the eligible population of New York said, \n``Give us a chance. Give us something different.'' They were \noverwhelmed by the response.\n\n  Last year, the Washington Scholarship Fund here in the District of \nColumbia announced plans to offer 1,000 new scholarships and received \n7,500 requests. That represents 15 percent of the eligible population \nin the D.C. public schools.\n  A recent poll of minority parents published last year found that two-\nthirds of them are crying out for some alternative for education. Low-\nincome families in cities around the country are saying, ``We refuse to \ncontinue to allow our children to be condemned to schools which don't \ngive them any chance to escape the poverty that they live in.''\n  My colleague, Senator Lieberman, has appealed to his party to say: We \nare the party of equality. We are the party that reaches out to help \nthose who need help, and yet we are turning our backs on the very \npeople our party is supposed to defend. We are condemning them to an \ninadequate education and therefore condemning them to a life in which \nthey will not be able to participate in the American dream.\n  The only way out of many of these areas in our urban cities is drugs, \nathletics, or education. One in 10,000 make it into college athletics. \nThat is the statistics of all the kids playing basketball, baseball, \nand football: 1 in 10,000 gets a college scholarship. Out of that, the \nnumber is infinitesimal of those who can go on and actually earn a \nliving playing professional sports. So while many dream of being the \nnext Michael Jordan, the reality is that only 1 in about 100,000 or \nmaybe a million is going to be that person or have that opportunity.\n  The next alternative is drugs and crime. And the statistics there are \nappalling. Children are dying on the streets, as we speak, at tender \nages because they think the way out of their plight--the only way out \nof their plight--is to move drugs. And that is a prescription for \ndeath, that is a prescription for incarceration, that is a prescription \nfor failure.\n  What do parents want? They understand those realities. They want \ntheir children to be educated, given the skills necessary to be able to \nenter today's workplace, given the education to be able to go on and \nfurther their education after high school. And they are not getting \nthat in our urban schools.\n  How does my amendment try to address this? We try to provide a little \npiece of a solution to the puzzle we are trying to put together, a \nmosaic we are trying to put together to try to get us out of this \nconundrum that tweaks the Tax Code a little bit to give a little extra \nencouragement to people who donate money to those scholarship funds.\n  Under current law, a contribution to a 501(c)(3) organization that \nprovides scholarships is deductible against income. My amendment would \nsimply give them a 10 percent incentive to try to encourage more people \nto give more. We offset that so that it is paid for and revenue \nneutral. I offered an offset which I thought would be fairly \nattractive, but I could not get the votes to\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\nsupport it. I did not want to see my amendment fail on that basis, so \nwe worked with the majority leader, we worked with Members, to try to \nfind something that had been vented by the Finance Committee, had been \napproved as a potential offset. And I do not believe there is any \ncontroversy. We have tried to run all the traps on that in terms of the \noffset.\n  I can describe the offset. It is two technical items that pay for the \nchange which takes place in the Tax Code with this. What it means is \nthat if a family wanted to donate $500 to a scholarship fund or an \nindividual, they would get a $550 deduction for that. It is an extra \nincentive. It is just a small piece. I mean, people are going to come \ndown and probably say, ``Well, this doesn't solve the problem.'' No, it \ndoes not solve the problem, but it is a step in the right correction. \nIt is a tiny step. And I guess we are reaching out saying, at least can \nwe take some tiny steps to help people who find themselves in an \nabsolute lockbox of inadequate education with no way to escape?\n  This is my latest attempt. I keep trying to bring ideas down here to \ntry to give poor kids, minority kids, kids condemned to failing urban \nschools, a chance to get out and get an education. I try to use it as a \nbasis to spur some competition so those who run the public schools will \nget the idea they need to improve their schools.\n  We really care about these low-income children, which this bill does \nnot address, but, again, that is not the intent of the bill. I think \nthis strengthens the bill. Then we ought to look for ways in which we \ncan encourage alternatives to education and encourage competition in \nthe system that will force some change.\n  I will never forget the testimony of the former 25-year \nsuperintendent of the Milwaukee public schools, an educated man, an \nAfrican American, who said: Senator, I've tried everything. You can't \nname a reform proposal within the system that has worked. The unions \nblock it. The public teachers don't want it. We've tried everything. I \ndefy you to name an approach within the current public education system \nthat forces change. Only one thing has forced change in the Milwaukee \npublic schools, and that is the competition from private schools, the \nvouchers and the scholarships that have been available so that parents \ncan vote with their feet and their children may have a choice. All of a \nsudden that has wakened up the Milwaukee public schools which has said, \n``We've got to change or we're going to lose these kids.''\n  So instead of trying to perpetuate a bureaucracy that protects their \nemployment, and their tenure, they have said, ``Let's make the changes \nthat will give students an opportunity to learn, to read, to meet the \nmath and the science skills, to advance in their education.''\n  Who do we care more about? Protecting the system or helping the \nchildren? That is the only thing. And so this is an attempt to, one, \nprovide some lifeboats for some kids who are trapped--no, we cannot \nprovide enough for everybody. That really isn't even my intent. My \nintent is to reform the public school system, because we are going to \nhave, and we need to have, a public school system, a viable public \nschool system, but we can do it by providing competition. In the \nmeantime, we can at least help some kids. This amendment will do that. \nI hope I have the support of my colleagues in doing so.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment to \nincrease the charitable deduction to 110 percent of any contribution \nmade to an educational institution if the contribution is used to \nprovide scholarships for low-income families.\n  Education is paramount to the future of our children and nation, and \ncontributing toward the education of another is certainly one of the \nfinest forms charitable giving can take.\n  Let me also say that I know the distinguished Senator from Indiana \nhas the best intentions with this amendment. I generally believe that \ncharitable giving serves disadvantaged people much better than \ngovernment programs.\n  However, there are several concerns that I believe need to be fully \nexamined and addressed before we consider moving down a road that \nprovides a charitable tax deduction in excess of the amount donated. \nThis is a serious departure from settled tax policy principles.\n  Once we begin to offer charitable tax deductions that are more than \nthe amount donated for low-income scholarships, what comes next?\n  What other kinds of tax benefits will be proposed where the amount of \nthe deduction exceeds the cost to the taxpayer?\n  Should these kinds of scholarships be the only charitable activities \nenjoying this benefit? And, if not, are we prepared to move forward \nwith such a precedent?\n  There are other concerns I have about the Senator from Indiana's \nproposal. On what basis does one decide that the percentage should be \n105, 120 percent, or a percentage lower than 100 percent? Should we be \nin the position of choosing among charities and assigning percentages?\n\n  Another concern I have is the proposal's attempt to single out one \nkind of charitable activity and offer it special tax advantages. Why is \nthis kind of charitable activity better than other charitable \nactivities? To do so is a step towards complexity in the tax code.\n  Mr. President, I believe charitable giving is an activity that we \nmust continue to encourage with tax benefits. For instance, most \ntaxpayers do not itemize, and therefore, cannot deduct their charitable \ncontributions. This is a feature of our tax policy that concerns many \nmembers.\n  This issue, along with other proposals in the charitable giving area, \nsuch as the one from the Senator from Indiana, should be reviewed when \nthe Finance Committee holds hearings on fundamental tax reform.\n  Mr. President, Senator Coats' amendment is well-intended, but raises \ntoo many questions to be hastily considered in a Senate floor vote. \nLet's pass the Coverdell bill, and deliver to taxpayers education tax \nincentives we have previously debated and approved.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we conferred with the other side and I \nam going to ask unanimous consent that the Coats amendment be set \naside.\n  Mr. COATS. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure that \nthe time remaining is reserved under the amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Let me clarify the unanimous consent--that all time \nremaining be reserved and the amendment be brought back into the queue \nat the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as I understand it, the next amendment \nin order would be a Levin amendment. We are now notifying the Senator \nthat he is next in the order.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will soon send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Coats amendment \nwill be set aside.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if I can ask the \nmanager of the bill whether or not this amendment has been cleared on \nour side.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand that regular order now would \ncall for me to offer my amendment. I tell my friends, if they can work \nout the issues that they have, that I would be happy to stand aside in \nthe middle of my presentation and turn the floor over to the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2299\n\n (Purpose: To replace the expansion of education individual retirement \n accounts to elementary and secondary school expenses with an increase \n  the lifetime learning education credit for expenses of teachers in \n                     improving technology training)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Bingaman be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  Under current law, there is a learning credit in the Tax Code equal \nto 20 percent of a student's college education cost, up to $5,000. My \namendment increases the percentage from 20 percent to 50 percent of \nthose college costs for teachers who return to receive training in \ntechnology. We currently have this lifetime learning credit of 20 \npercent for college costs, up to $5,000.\n  Because of the critical importance of our teachers learning how to \nutilize technology in the classrooms, this amendment would increase \nthat credit to 50 percent of that teacher's college costs in those \ncourses where he or she received training in technology. The amendment \ndoes not affect most of the beneficial aspects of the bill before us. \nIt only removes the most controversial part of that bill relative to \nthe use of the IRA in the K through 12th grades--I will come to that in \na moment--but it leaves in place the other parts of the education bill \nbefore us, including the extension of the tax exclusion for employer-\nprovided education assistance, the provision of a tax exclusion for \nwithdrawals from State tuition programs, the limited school \nconstruction provisions, and, again, the expansion of the education IRA \nas it relates to college and postsecondary education.\n  This amendment is necessary in our school districts all over our \ncountry because they are making investments in technology, hardware and \nsoftware, wiring together schools so they can connect their computers, \nand inside of the school building connecting computers through what is \ncalled ``local area networks,'' connecting our K through 12 classrooms \nto colleges and universities for distance learning through fiber \noptics. Lots of new technologies are being provided in our schools at \ngreat cost to our taxpayers.\n  I have spent a lot of time traveling in my State. What I find is that \nno matter how advanced a school district is in the installation of \nthese technologies, we do not have nearly enough of the professional \ndevelopment, the giving to our teachers those skills that are essential \nso that they can utilize these education technologies.\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\n  School districts vary as to how much technology they have, how much \naccess to the Internet they have, how modern their computers are, how \nmany computers they have for their students, and how well-connected \nthey are to the higher institutions to which they connect. They vary in \nthat regard a great deal. But all of the school districts tell me their \nteachers who are so experienced in teaching in the traditional ways \nhave not been given the skills to utilize these new technologies. So we \nare making these huge investments in hardware and software and wiring \nwithout making anywhere close to full use of these investments.\n  A study that was conducted by the Education Testing Service at \nPrinceton, NJ, shows that on the national average only 15 percent of \nour teachers at the time of the study had at least 9 hours of training \nin education technology in their lifetime. By the way, that training is \nmostly spent just teaching a teacher how to use a computer to, for \ninstance, give their grades and keep track of attendance, to input. \nWhat we are talking about here is training teachers in the use of \ntechnology so that they can use that wealth of information that is now \navailable, those thousands of libraries around the world, those \nhundreds of field trips that they can bring into their classroom \nthrough this technology. What our teachers need to do is have the \nopportunity to train themselves to use these technologies for those \nnew, wonderful opportunities to bring exciting material into their \ncurriculum, to integrate into their curriculum the material that is now \navailable through these technologies. For instance, in my State, only \n10 percent of the teachers had 9 hours of training in their lifetime in \nthe use of education technology for any purpose. The national average \nis 15 percent. That meant that 85 percent of our teachers did not even \nhave 9 hours of training in their lifetime in the use of education \ntechnology.\n\n  For the younger generation, it is easy to learn how to input, it is \neasy to learn how to access the Internet. For those of us who are \nolder, it is not so easy. It takes training. My children teach me how \nto input, how to access the Internet. For them, it is like breathing. \nFor me, it is work. It is concentration. It is repetition. It is having \na mentor. That mentor might be 5 years old. But for me it is more \ndifficult. For our experienced teachers, it takes training. In many \ncases it takes returning to school. This amendment provides the \nincentive to go back to school to learn how to use the education \ntechnologies which are now made available to our teachers.\n  This amendment pays for this by restricting the use of the expanded \nIRA that is in this bill to postsecondary education. This is a highly \ncontroversial part of the bill, as we all know. Senator Glenn offered \nan amendment to strike this provision just as it relates to K through \n12. My amendment goes the same distance as Senator Glenn in trying to \nstrike this provision for the reasons which he and so many others have \nspoken about on this floor. But it takes the funds that are freed up \nand invests them in this 50-percent lifetime learning credit for \nteachers who go back to learn how to utilize education technology.\n  The provision in the bill relative to the use of these funds in the \nlower grades, K through 12, is flawed for many reasons, I believe \nconstitutionally flawed, but it also has a fundamental unfairness.\n  It is significantly tilted towards those families with children in \nprivate schools. This is according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. \nThese numbers are not mine; these are the numbers of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation. There are 35.4 million families filing tax \nreturns who have children in public schools. Those families get less \nthan half of the dollars which are utilized in this part of the pending \nbill; 48 percent of the dollars go to 35 million taxpayers, the ones \nwith children in public schools. More than half, 52 percent, of the \ndollars, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, go to 2.9 \nmillion taxpayers with children in private schools.\n  Now, that is a significant inequity. Putting aside its constitutional \nquestion, that represents a significant tilt away from public schools. \nThis amendment would strike that part of the expanded IRA. It leaves \nall the other provisions in the education bill before us that I have \ntalked about. The extension of the tax exclusion for employer-provided \neducation assistance is not touched. The tax exclusion it provides for \nwithdrawals from State tuition programs is not touched by this \namendment. The limited school construction language is not touched. The \nexpansion of the education IRA for college and graduate cost is not \ntouched.\n  What is eliminated is the use of the expanded IRA for kindergarten \nthrough the 12th grade, and it uses that money instead to give \nincentives to teachers to learn how to use the technologies which are \nbeing provided at such great cost by our taxpayers to our schools. \nThere is no point in spending a fortune on computers and distance \nlearning and software unless our teachers have the training to fully \nutilize those technologies, and this amendment addresses that issue.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, most of the teachers in today's public \nschools became educators before the era of personal computers really \nbegan and was established. To address the skills of the next generation \nof teachers, 32 states require a course in education technology as part \nof the teacher preparation curriculum. 18 states have not yet \nincorporated such a requirement.\n  New Mexico teachers must have just one education technology course \nbefore they are certified, and some universities such as New Mexico \nState University and Eastern are taking the lead in integrating \ntechnology into their education school programs. Yet, the majority of \nNew Mexico's current teachers received their training before the start \nof the computer era in the mid-1980's and the new regulations do not \naddress their training needs.\n  Nationwide, although 98 percent of schools are equipped with \ncomputers to some degree, 90 percent of new teachers, even after a \nsingle course, do not feel prepared to use technology in the classroom. \nClearly, more skill development needs to take place to increase the \ncomfort teachers feel with technology.\n  Most of the roughly $6 million in New Mexico state and federal \nfunding for education technology has been used to purchase and install \nequipment rather than to train teachers to use new technology. \nTremendous resources have been invested in hardware and installing the \nmechanism for access to the Internet. Sixty five percent of schools \nnationwide have at least some connection to the Internet, yet only 13 \npercent of schools have Internet training for teachers, and only 20 \npercent of teachers say that they readily use the Internet to help with \ntheir instruction.\n  With a teaching load of 80 students and an average salary of $29,600, \nmost New Mexican teachers cannot afford to pay for their own training \nor take the summer off to learn how to use computers.\n  Although we have seen significant progress over the last few years in \nFederal support for technology and the use of technology in education, \nthe one great deficiency is the preparation teachers need to use \ntechnology effectively. This legislation will help to correct the \nproblem by supporting educators' pursuit of training and expertise.\n  I thank Senator Levin for sponsoring this legislation as an amendment \nto the Coverdell bill, and I'm proud to serve as a cosponsor on it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I have time remaining, I would ask to \nreserve the remainder of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 41 seconds \nremaining, and the time has been reserved.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I \nrise in opposition because it takes away the ability of parents to use \neducational IRAs to pay for expenses relating to the schooling of their \nchildren between kindergarten and 12th grade. Allowing parents greater \nresources to meet the educational needs of their young people is a very \nimportant part of the Coverdell legislation. Senator Levin proposes to \ntake those resources away and give them to teachers by expanding the \nlifetime learning credit for those who participate in technology \ntraining.\n  No one can argue that helping teachers become more proficient in \ntechnology is not a good thing. It is vitally\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\nimportant. It will have a positive influence on their ability to teach \nour children. However, to increase the lifetime learning credit for \nteachers at the expense of expanding the IRAs for our children runs \ncontrary to the needs and objectives of American families.\n  Mothers and fathers need increased wherewithal to support their \nchildren's educational goals. Mothers and fathers need stronger, more \nuseful IRAs. They need the ability to use more of their own hard-earned \nmoney to take care of family priorities. The Senate recognized this \nlast year when we gave parents with children in grades K-12 the ability \nto use educational IRAs.\n  Our objective was to strengthen mom and dad's ability to get the best \neducation possible for their children. Our objective remains the same \ntoday. This is what the Coverdell legislation is all about, empowering \nfamilies to make decisions that are in their best interests, allowing \nthem to use their own resources for their own benefit.\n  Remember, Mr. President, the money in question here belongs to the \ntaxpayers. They earned it. It is theirs. They will save it, and they \nshould be able to choose how it will be spent. Let them use it where it \nserves them best--on their children.\n  Senator Levin's amendment is well intentioned. A lifetime learning \ncredit is a provision that was included in the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997. It allows everyone pursuing postsecondary education to take a tax \ncredit each year equal to 20 percent of their qualified expenses. Those \nexpenses are limited annually to $5,000 through the year 2002, and \nstarting in the year 2003 they will be annually limited to a total of \n$10,000. The lifetime learning credit is available to any taxpayer who \nmeets the income requirements. Full-time students can take the credit, \nas can any professional who wants to continue his or her education. And \nthis includes teachers, engineers, or research scientists.\n  What Senator Levin proposes is to single out teachers and increase \ntheir lifetime learning credit to 50 percent for technology training. \nNot only would this come at the expense of students and their families \nbut it would be inequitable among the professions. Remember, teachers \ncan already receive a 20 percent credit for any additional education in \nwhich they engage. The fact is, Senator Levin's amendment goes too far \ntoo fast and it comes at the expense of the children.\n  This amendment takes the means to use expanded IRAs to educate \nchildren, and it creates a more complex and distorted learning credit. \nNot only will meeting the criteria to qualify for the credit create a \nbureaucracy to determine what conditions qualify, but it emphasizes one \narea of study over another. For example, why give a 50 percent credit \nfor teachers to become more proficient in using and teaching technology \nbut only give a 20 percent credit to those who take courses to become \nbetter reading instructors? Or we could ask the same question. What \nabout the teacher who takes courses to enable them to better teach \nthose who are disabled? All worthy goals. And the problem here is that \nwe would single out one to benefit over the others, which only adds to \nthe complexity of this matter.\n  This is not what we want to do. Ask the parents of America. Ask our \nfamilies. Ask our students how they would choose to use the financial \nresources in question. I believe the vast majority would make it clear \nthat they want the opportunity to use their money to give them greater \nflexibility and power to meet the educational objectives of the family.\n  Mr. President, I must oppose the Levin amendment. The educational IRA \nis the foundation of the Coverdell bill. This modification guts the \nbill at the expense of the children. For that reason I oppose this \namendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 28 seconds, and the \nSenator from Michigan has 4 minutes 41 seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, will the Chair notify me at the \nexpiration of 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I echo the remarks of the Senator from \nDelaware, the Finance Committee chairman. I rise in opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Michigan because its effect would \nmake moot a core component of the legislation that came from the \nFinance Committee and to the Senate floor; i.e., the education savings \naccount. If the Levin amendment were to succeed, it would have the \neffect of telling 14 million American families, ``No thanks. We don't \nwant you to create these savings accounts and prepare for your \nchildren's specific educational needs.''\n  The number of children who would no longer have the opportunity to be \nbeneficiaries of these savings accounts, guided to help them with their \neducational needs, would be over 20 million--14 million families, 20 \nmillion children. Public schools, private schools, home schools all \nacross our Nation would be deprived of, over a 5-year period, $5 \nbillion of volunteered money and resources that would be coming to the \naid of America's children grades kindergarten through college. You \nwould severely hamper the ability of families to prepare for the higher \ncosts of higher education. Over a 10-year period, the effect of the \namendment would be to eliminate over $10 billion of savings that would \nhave been accrued.\n  Remember, these moneys are volunteered moneys. They are moneys coming \nfrom the individual families themselves and sponsors, and no school \nboard, no school district had to raise a dime of taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator's 2 minutes is \nexhausted.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No county school board had to raise taxes, no State \nhad to raise income taxes, no Federal taxes were required to accomplish \na $10 billion resource coming to the aid of children throughout all of \nour country. So this, among the other reasons listed by the Finance \nchairman, would be the reason I oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that a \nnumber of letters from a number of groups supporting my amendment be \nprinted in the Record at this time. Those groups are the National \nAssociation of State Boards of Education that support the amendment, \nthe Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, the \nAmerican Association of University Professors and the American \nAssociation of Colleges for Teacher Education, as well as the American \nVocational Association.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    State Boards of Education,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 17, 1998.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: The National Association of State \n     Boards of Education (NASBE) appreciates your intent to offer \n     an amendment to the Coverdell Education IRA bill which will \n     be considered by the Senate early next week.\n       The Coverdell bill, S. 1133/H.R. 2646, seeks to expand \n     existing higher education savings accounts to include K-12 \n     educational expenses, including private school tuition. These \n     benefits will disproportionately accrue to wealthy families \n     and even then will only amount to $37 in annual tax savings, \n     according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n       Unlike the Coverdell bill, which does nothing to improve \n     public education, your amendment to increase the lifetime \n     learning education tax credit for teachers enrolled in \n     technology training will directly improve the quality of \n     instruction for America's students. As more advanced \n     technologies are introduced into the classroom, teachers will \n     need more training in both new methods of instruction and \n     integrating this technology into the curriculum.

In order to teach their students how learn in \n     these media--in order to go beyond the merely technical \n     skills involved in operating the machinery--teachers need \n     some educational support.\n       Using the newly created Lifelong Learning Credit as a \n     vehicle is an appropriate and efficient way to assist \n     teachers in meeting this shared need. We appreciate your \n     initiative in coming forward with this proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Ruth Flowers,\n     Director, AAUP Government Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                            of Colleges for Teacher Education,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 1998.\n     Senator Carl Levin,\n     Russel Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: On behalf of the American Association \n     of Colleges for Teacher Education, please accept our \n     endorsement of your legislation to provide a tax credit for \n     teachers who take coursework to improve their use of \n     technology in the classroom.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this issue and your \n     commitment to well prepared teachers.

Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: On behalf of the American Vocational \n     Association (AVA), I am writing to commend you on your \n     efforts to emphasize technology in teacher training. Your \n     amendment to expand the Lifelong Learning Credit for teachers \n     enrolled in technology programs is an important step in \n     raising awareness of the need for teachers to better \n     understand and more effectively use technology in the \n     classroom.\n       AVA represents 38,000 secondary and postsecondary teachers, \n     career guidance counselors, administrators, teacher educators \n     and business leaders from across the country who are \n     dedicated to improving vocational-technical education for our \n     nation's students. Vocational-technical education prepares \n     students with the critical combination of academic and \n     technical skills that is needed to succeed in a \n     technologically advanced workplace. Teachers must have high-\n     level technology skills to prepare students effectively for \n     the careers of the future. In addition, expanding the use of \n     technology as a teaching tool will make teaching more \n     effective and will give students a first-hand view of how \n     technology applies to learning and work.\n       With these things in mind, AVA is advocating for a stronger \n     focus on technology issues in the reauthorization of the \n     Higher Education Act and the reauthorization of the Carl D. \n     Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. \n     Federal leadership on this issue is necessary to promote \n     innovation and improvement in teacher preparation. Your \n     amendment helps to highlight this priority.\n       In addition to seeking federal leadership, AVA is working \n     hand-in-hand with the business community to create new \n     opportunities for teachers and students to improve their \n     knowledge of technology. Our new partnership with Pulsar Data \n     Systems and the Xerox Corporation will provide scholarships \n     to teachers to learn how to use technology and to students \n     who want to pursue education programs that will enable them \n     to enter into information technology careers. We are excited \n     about this project and will continue to seek additional ways \n     to expand the technology focus in education.\n       Thank you for your leadership in seeking to improve \n     teachers' knowledge of technology. We also greatly appreciate \n     the work of Dan Guglielmo and Jackie Parker of your staff who \n     have been most helpful to us in working on this important \n     issue. Please feel free to contact Nancy O'Brien, AVA's \n     assistant executive director for government relations, or me \n     whenever we may be of assistance to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bret Lovejoy,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first on the question of why technology. In \nmy earlier remarks I indicated why there was such a need for training \nin technology for our teachers. We make a number of special provisions \nin our law for technology. It's not unique. We make special provisions \nfor lots of purposes, including language training. Why language \ntraining? Because there is a need that we have for language training. \nWhy technology? Because obviously the incomes of our students are going \nto depend on how well they can use technologies and how well we utilize \ntechnologies in their training. For instance, we currently have a \nTechnology Literacy Challenge Fund. That is part of our law; $425 \nmillion, I believe, in this year's fiscal budget. It is addressed \ntowards technology because of the importance of technology. So there is \nnothing unusual about having special provisions for different parts of \neducation and for training, and this amendment is focused on one of the \nvery critical needs that we now have.\n  Let me briefly quote the acting director of technology from the \nMichigan Education Department. His name is Jamie Fitzpatrick. I have \nworked with him closely over the past 6 months as I have traveled over \nthe State visiting with schools and school districts in this technology \narea. This is what Mr. Fitzpatrick says, as quoted in a press dispatch:\n\n       For every dollar we spend on computer hardware and software \n     in kindergarten through 12th grades, I think we would be \n     lucky if we saw 5 cents on the dollar spent on training and \n     support. If we continue with those kinds of ratios, we will \n     never realize the gain in student achievement that we think \n     technology has the potential to elicit. We obviously need to \n     put money into training.\n\n  That is what this amendment is aimed at, giving an incentive to \nteachers, experienced teachers in their courses, to go back to get \nskills necessary to utilize these new technologies in their curricula. \nOtherwise we are not utilizing fully the potential of these \ntechnologies that come at such great cost to our parents.\n  I would wager on the answer, if we ask the American people whether or \nnot they think it is right for 35.4 million families with students in \npublic schools to get less of a benefit from the current provision in \nthis bill that we would draft--less of a dollar benefit than the 2.9 \nmillion families with students in private schools who get the lion's \nshare of that IRA money for grades K-12. That's not my numbers. That's \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation's numbers. I wish we had a way of \ntaking a survey of families in America, to ask whether or not they \nthink this provision in the pending bill fairly treats the families of \nAmerica. I don't think it does, and I think those families want us to \nhave our teachers fully trained to utilize these new technologies. I \nthink that is why the support for this amendment comes from the \ngrassroots, as I know it does from my travels around my own State.\n  Mr. President if I have any time remaining, I reserve the remainder \nof that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 41 seconds. Who yields time? \nThe Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. First of all, I \nwant to point out again that we have no quarrel with respect to the \nimportance of technology and technical training. We think that it is of \nkey interest. But at the same time we think its critically important to \nrecognize that other types of training for teachers are equally \nimportant. For example, taking programs to better learn how to teach \nthe disabled is certainly a top goal and desire, or to teach math or \nEnglish to our children. All of these are worthy goals, and our concern \nis that by singling out technology we\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\nwould be hurting others who have interests of similar importance.\n  I am also concerned about the complexity this proposal writes into \nthe Tax Code. One of the constant complaints--and I think a justified \ncomplaint--is that we are always making the Federal code more \ndifficult, more complex to administer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator's 2 minutes have expired. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 1 more minute.\n  So, I say that one of the problems with this proposal is that it adds \nan additional complexity that is going to be harder to administer and \nrequire the creation of a new bureaucracy. Let's keep and treat all \npeople in this situation the same.\n\n  The other point I want to make is that the benefits of the Coverdell \namendment do not go to the wealthy. I point out that 70 percent of the \nbenefits of the Coverdell education IRA go to families making $75,000 \nor less. I point out that a blue-collar worker can easily be making \n$40,000 with overtime; his spouse or her spouse working as a teacher, \nor otherwise, can be within this range. I defy anyone to go out and ask \nany of these people whether they consider themselves to be wealthy. The \nanswer will be no.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back the remainder of \nhis time?\n  Mr. ROTH. No; I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 51 seconds remaining.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, very briefly, the argument that alleges or \nsuggests that someone making $75,000 is wealthy, we did not address \nthat issue at all. What this chart shows, though, is that the 2.9 \nmillion families with children in private schools get more of the \nbenefit than the 35.4 million families with children in public schools. \nThat is the disproportion and inequity that I point out in this \namendment.\n  We have almost 36 million families getting back less of a total \nbenefit, 48 percent, than 2.9 million families with children in private \nschools. That is the argument.\n  I do not have any time to yield back, but I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to address the chart. The \nchart, with all due respect to my good colleague, is very misleading. \nSeventy-five percent of the families who open savings accounts will be \nsupporting children in public schools, and 30 percent will be \nsupporting children in private schools. Clearly, those families, or \nwhat comes out of the accounts, the $5 billion saved, is directly \nproportional to what the families are willing to put into the account.\n  The families who have children in private schools understand they \nhave a higher hurdle. They are paying public school taxes, and they \nhave to pay the private school costs over and above that. What this \nreflects is they are going to put more money in their accounts because \nthey have more costs to cover. Nevertheless, $2.5 billion of the $5 \nbillion will go in support of children in public schools, and about \n$2.5 billion will go in support of children in private schools.\n  The chart is nothing more than a function of which families are \nsaving what. The entire cost, to cause all these billions of dollars to \nbe saved, is $500 million over the next 5 years. So the entire bill, in \nsupport of private education, is about 7.5 percent of all this \ninvestment to children in private schools and the balance to children \nin public schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I make a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield--well, reserving the right----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask the Senator from Missouri if he will yield for a \nunanimous consent request to have printed a document from the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation that supports this chart.\n  There being no objection,the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 1998.\n     To:  Maury Passman and Nick Giordano\n     From:  Lindy L. Paull\n     Subject:  Revenue Requests\n       The attached tables are in response to your request dated \n     January 28, 1998, for revenue estimates of H.R. 2646 as \n     passed by House of Representatives and as modified by Senator \n     Lott's second degree amendment as well as the corresponding \n     number of taxpayers estimated to benefit from H.R. 2646.\n       Additionally, you requested information regarding the \n     utilization of educational savings accounts for public versus \n     private education. We estimate that approximately 38.3 \n     million returns would have dependents in schools at the \n     primary or secondary level in 1999. We estimate that, of \n     those eligible to contribute, approximately 2.9 million \n     returns would have children in private schools, and that \n     approximately 2.4 million of these returns would utilize \n     education IRAs.\n       We estimate that the proposed expansion of education IRAs \n     to include withdrawals to cover primary and secondary \n     education expenses would extend approximately 52 percent of \n     the tax benefit to taxpayers with children in private \n     schools. We estimate that the average per return tax benefit \n     for taxpayers with children attending private schools would \n     be approximately $37 in tax year 2002.\n       Conversely, we estimate that of the 38.3 million returns \n     eligible, approximately 35.4 million returns would have \n     dependents in public schools, and that approximately 10.8 \n     million of these returns would utilize education IRAs.\n       We estimate that the proposed expansion of education IRAs \n     would extend approximately 40 percent of the tax benefit to \n     taxpayers with children in public schools, with an average \n     per return tax benefit of approximately $7 in tax year 2002.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter from the Joint Committee on Taxation that explains this chart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2300 to Amendment No. 2299\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit spending Federal education funds on national \n           testing without explicit and specific legislation)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I offer a second-degree amendment to the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2300 to amendment No. 2299.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes in \nsupport of his amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri thanks the \nChair.\n  The first thing the second-degree amendment which I have offered will \ndo is restore the Coverdell IRA language which has been stricken from \nthe measure by the first-degree amendment offered by the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  I think that debate has been pretty clearly conducted. I believe it \nis clear that the Coverdell amendment is a virtuous amendment. The \nsuggestion that individuals in public schools don't get as much benefit \nin terms of the tax break here, it seems to me, overlooks one thing: \nThat virtually the entirety, of the public school cost is already tax \nunderwritten and funded by the Government. Those who are in private \nschools are not only paying that rate, but as taxpayers they are also \nseeking to provide education for their children on a secondary and \nalternative track. To suggest that we should ignore the fact that the \ntotality of the educational experience, virtually the totality of it, \nhas already been paid for governmentally in the public school\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\nsystem is, I think, failing to take into account a very important \npoint.\n  In addition to restoring the Coverdell language, which would provide \na basis for an IRA for individuals who would save for their children's \neducation, my second-degree amendment adds a permanent ban on Federal \nfunding for national testing of students in our schools unless there is \nexplicit congressional authority for such funding.\n  Any movement toward the national control of education, I believe, \nsavages educational principles that we as Americans hold dear. Parental \nauthority and control, local control of schools, school board control, \ncommunity control, teachers who are free to teach core subject matters, \nand school boards that are responsive to their communities, not held \ncaptive by distant bureaucrats, are a fundamental commitment of this \nNation.\n  When President Clinton proposed national testing for our children, it \nwas an example of a Federal power grab. The President wants to move \npower out of the hands of parents and out of the hands of school boards \nand away from communities and begin, through national testing, to \ndirect the way the schools are operated all across the Nation. It \ndoesn't take an educational expert to know that when you dictate the \ntest, you describe the curriculum.\n  I visited lots of schools during my time as Governor, and I have \nsince I have become a Senator. I asked a group of 5th graders not long \nago when I was in their school, ``If I were to tell you that I was \ngoing to test you on the first 50 words in the dictionary this \nafternoon, what would you study this morning?'' It didn't take any of \nthem any trouble to know that they would study the first 50 words in \nthe dictionary. The test dictates the curriculum.\n  Last fall, 36 other Senators joined with me to threaten a filibuster \nof the Labor-HHS and Education appropriations bill unless there was a \nban during the fiscal year on Federal funding for the President's \nnational testing proposal. We won an important victory when Congress \nand the administration agreed to provisions banning deployment of any \ntests or field testing activities during the year in which we are now \noperating. However, that 1-year ban is not enough. Congress must \npermanently ban Federal funding for national testing in order to \nprotect parental involvement and local control of education.\n  Why do I oppose national testing, this description of what has to be \ntaught by what you are going to test? First of all, I think we should \nhold our children to the challenging academic standards that will lead \nthem to greatness. However, any such standards should be set at State \nand local levels where parents, teachers and school boards are \nfundamental participants in making the critical decisions that will \nrelate to the children's educational experience.\n  Federalized tests mandated from Washington will hurt education in the \nNation. First, because the No. 1 indicator of student achievement is \nparental involvement. Whenever we say to parents, ``We're going to \ndecide what is tested, therefore we will decide what is taught, you're \nnot going to be relevant anymore,'' we dislocate parents from the \nprocess.\n  All the data indicate that the most important factor in student \nachievement is parental involvement. Study after study has proven this. \nI refer you to a 1980 study reported in Psychology in the Schools. It \nshowed that family involvement improved Chicago elementary school \nchildren's performance in reading comprehension.\n  Here is the conclusion: 1 year after initiating a Chicago citywide \nprogram aimed at helping parents create academic support conditions, \nstudents in grades 1 through 6, intensively exposed to the program, \nimproved a half to six-tenths of a grade equivalent more in their Iowa \ntest of basic skills over students less intensively involved in the \nprogram.\n  Parental involvement boosts student achievement. We should not have a \nnational program which disengages parents. We should not say to \nparents, ``parents need not apply.'' We should not be telling parents \nthat we do not care what you think and that we in Washington know \nbetter what ought to be done.\n  Let me just indicate that there are a number of other similar \nstudies. I ask unanimous consent to have material about them printed in \nthe Record, including the California and Maryland elementary schools \nstudies.\n       California and Maryland elementary schools achieved strong \n     gains in student performance after implementing \n     ``partnership'' programs, which emphasize parent involvement.\n       A 1993 study describes how two elementary schools \n     implemented a ``partnership'' program which emphasized two-\n     way communication and mutual support between parents and \n     teachers, enhanced learning at both home and school, and \n     joint decision making between parents and teachers.\n       Students at Columbia Park School in Prince George's County, \n     Maryland, ``who once lagged far behind national averages, now \n     perform above the 90th percentile in math, and above the 50th \n     percentile in reading,'' after implementing the partnership \n     program.\n       ``In its fourth year of the [partnership] program, the \n     Daniel Webster School in Redwood City, California, shows \n     significant gains in student achievement compared to other \n     schools in the district. Webster students have increased \n     their average California Test of Basic Skills math scores by \n     19 percentile points, with all grades performing above grade \n     level. In language, most classes improved at least 10 \n     percentile points.''\n       Source: Developing Home-School Partnerships: Form Concepts \n     to Practice, Susan McAllister Swap. New York: Teachers \n     College Press, Columbia University, 1993.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. These studies show the amazing impact that parental \ninvolvement has on children's educational performance.\n  I think there is a clear understanding that when parents are actively \ninvolved and engaged, students prosper. Why should we have a situation \nin which Washington begins to dictate what happens in our schools?\n  Former Governor George Allen of Virginia, a State that developed \nwidely acclaimed standards of learning, indicates that the most \nimpressive gains happen when we emphasize the grassroots. Governor \nAllen states:\n\n       If there is one important lesson we have learned during our \n     efforts to set clear, rigorous and measurable academic \n     expectations for children in Virginia's public school system, \n     it is that effective education reform occurs at the \n     grassroots, local and State levels, not at the Federal \n     Government level.\n\n  This confirms the experience I had as Governor and, of course, as an \nindividual who had an intimate responsibility for being helpful to \nlocal school districts. I learned firsthand that local control is \nneeded to create educational programs that respond to the needs of \nlocal communities. A local community should be able to decide whether \nit is going to teach with phonics or whether it is going to use some \nother measure.\n  A local community should be able to decide that it wants to teach the \nnew math or the whole math or any method it wants to use to teach \nbasic, fundamental mathematics and arithmetic skills that focus on \ncomputation.\n  When our military, for example, responded to the Federal Government's \ndemand that they initiate the new math--or what some people called \n``MTV'' math or ``fuzzy'' math, as one Member of this Chamber on the \nother side of the aisle referred to it--we saw precipitous declines in \nstudent performance.\n  I believe when you start saying from the national level that you are \ngoing to provide tests that will dictate what is taught, and frequently \nhow it is taught, there is a real threat to the ability of local \nschools, parents, community leaders and the culture to shape the \neducational experience that is so fundamental and important.\n  Perhaps that is why the Missouri State Teachers Association, which is \ncomprised of 40,000 members--by far the largest teacher association in \nmy State--warned: ``The mere presence of a Federal test would create a \nde facto Federal curriculum as teachers and schools adjust their \ncurriculum to ensure that their students perform well on the tests.'' \nThe mere presence of a Federal test begins to direct everything toward \nthe Federal Government instead of toward what parents, teachers and \ncommunity leaders want.\n  In fact, when Jimmy Carter was President of the United States and was \nconsidering a national test proposed in this Chamber, Joseph Califano, \nCarter's Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, warned, ``Any set \nof test questions that the Federal Government prescribes should surely \nbe suspect as a first step toward a national curriculum.'' He went on \nto say, ``In its most extreme form, national control of curriculum is a \nform of national control of ideas.''\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\n  I think it is time for us to make permanent the funding ban on \nnational testing by the U.S. Government. There are plenty of other \ninstruments that help us understand how our students are doing. It is \nimportant that we say that this Congress is on record as prohibiting \nthe utilization of tax resources to undermine schools in determining \nwhat should be taught and how it is to be taught at the local level. We \ndo this because, at bottom, students learn best when parents, local \nofficials, school officials, and community leaders make decisions about \nthe schools and participate in them so that student achievement is the \nNo. 1 objective and goal.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator from Missouri yield for 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If we are in a national debate about the condition of \nelementary and secondary education, would one be nervous, given the \nforces that want to protect the status quo, that testing could be \ndesigned to protect the condition we are in?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Certainly. And dumbing down the test would be an easy \nway to make it look like we were making great progress.\n  I will just state that a few years ago, when there was an effort to \nset national history standards, we watched the politically correct \nmovement overtake school officials as they demanded that we delete \npeople like Robert E. Lee, Thomas Edison and other notables from the \nhistory standards and, instead, insert people like Madonna. I think the \nlast thing we need is dumbed-down national standards. We need real \nacademics, not politically correct education. The threat of politically \ncorrect curriculum and politically correct tests is something America \nshould not endure.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes, and then I will \nyield the remainder of time to the Senator from Massachusetts to \ncontrol.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, on the amendment that I offered \nbefore, I just want to read very briefly from the memorandum from the \nJoint Committee on Taxation which supports the chart I have used. This \nmemorandum, which is now part of the Record, says that they estimate \nthat ``2.4 million of the returns [who have children in private school] \nwould utilize education IRAs'' and that those returns would utilize \n``52 percent of the tax benefit. . .''\n  On the other hand, this letter says that the ``35.4 million returns \n[with] dependents in public schools'' would utilize 48 percent of the \ntax benefit.\n  That is a direct quote from the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  Relative to the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, I will just \nspeak briefly because I will turn the remainder of the time over to the \nSenator from Massachusetts on this issue. But I will say this. I do not \ndisagree with his point that local school districts, communities, and \nparents should control the curriculum. I happen to be a strong believer \nin local control.\n  Whether or not a school district wants to use new math or old math is \nsomething they ought to be able to decide. But one of the things they \nalso should be able to decide is whether or not they want to utilize a \nnational test which will give them some idea as to where their students \nstand relative to other students.\n  If they do not like that idea, they should not have to give that \ntest. That should be a local option. It is a local option under the \nPresident's proposal. It is not a mandatory test. It is voluntary as he \nproposes it. School districts can use it or not use it. The question is \nwhether or not, then, we should deny a school district the option, \nwhether we should deny a local community an option to use a tool if \nthey see fit to use it. That is the issue.\n  That tool may not be a useful tool. The Senator from Missouri may be \ncorrect. A school district may decide they do not want any part of it \nfor the reasons that he gives. That should be the right and is the \nright of the local school district under the President's proposal.\n  But it should also be an obligation available to a local school \ndistrict if they think there is a benefit from utilizing a national \ntest. Why deny a community? Why deny a local government, a local school \ndistrict, a tool which they believe is useful?\n  That is the issue. That is what would be denied under this second-\ndegree amendment. I don't think we ought to deny that opportunity here \nfor local school districts to make that choice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous I be allowed to yield the remainder of \nmy time to be under the control of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has 11 minutes 48 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Ashcroft amendment to prohibit \nthe administration from developing voluntary tests for academic \nachievement. Schools need clear-cut standards of achievement. Realistic \ntests to measure achievement are an essential part of good education. \nThe same voluntary tests that received broad support in the Senate last \nyear, the testing compromise, had a vote of 87-13.\n  Voluntary national tests based on widely recognized national \nstandards makes sense. They give parents and communities and schools an \neffective way to improve education and to chart the progress they are \nmaking. The voluntary national tests will be designed to assess fourth \ngrade reading and eighth grade math. They are basic subjects and basic \nstages in each students' academic development. The assessments are \ntimely and worthwhile.\n  Every student, parent, and school will benefit from them. The \nAshcroft amendment will keep them in the dark. Parents want to know how \nwell their children are doing and how well their schools are doing \ncompared to other students in other schools across the Nation. Today, \ntoo many schools in communities across the country are attempting to \neducate their students without the kind of assistance and guidance that \nought to be available. They have no way to compare the performance of \ntheir students with students in other schools and other communities in \nother parts of the country.\n  We know by every current indicator the performance of American \nelementary and secondary school students falls far short of the \nperformance of students in many other nations. We have to do better. \nKnowing where schools and students now stand is an essential part of \nhelping them do better.\n  As the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, pointed out, the tests \nwill be entirely voluntary. I repeat, entirely voluntary. States and \nlocal districts will have the opportunity to participate if they choose \nto. Nothing is mandated by the Federal Government. Nothing is mandated \nby the Federal Government. There is no Federal control of local \neducation. What is being made available on a voluntary basis is a long \noverdue opportunity for schools across the country to have realistic \nguideposts to measure the academic progress of their students. The \ntests will be based on national and international standards that will \nshow whether students are meeting widely accepted criteria for \nachievement in reading and math.\n  No current test is available to provide this essential information to \nstudents and parents and teachers and school administrators. Families \nhave no way to measure the performance of students in their community \non a comparative basis with students in other schools and other \ncommunities and other States.\n\n  Mr. President, 87 of us agreed last year that the National Assessment \nGoverning Board, which is a bipartisan group, is well equipped to \noversee the tests. It is a time-honored bipartisan group of skilled \neducators, made up of\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\ndifferent representatives of the educational community. Voluntary \nnational tests do not undermine local efforts on school reform. They \nenhance them. We need to do what we can to support local efforts to \nimprove teaching and learning, especially in such vital areas as \nreading and math. Voluntary tests are an important way to support local \nschool reform. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Ashcroft amendment.\n  Finally, I think this is an empowerment issue for parents. Basically, \nwe are permitting on a voluntary basis, the States and then again the \nlocal communities, to make a decision about whether they are going to \nhave these tests in the various communities and then to permit, \nobviously, the parents to know how their children are doing. By knowing \nhow they are doing, then the parents can make judgments and decisions \nabout what additional steps ought to be taken to try to improve the \nacademic achievement and accomplishment of their children.\n  These kinds of tests are in the interests of the parent, so they know \nhow their children are doing in schools, it is in the interests of the \nschool board member to know whether they are making the correct \njudgments in terms of allocating resources and priorities, and it is in \nthe interests of the community so they will know how they are doing in \ncomparison with other communities.\n  All of these issues were debated at very significant length in the \nlast Congress, and steps were taken to make sure that the bipartisan or \nvirtually the nonpartisan education group was going to be developing \nthese tests. They are in the process of doing so at the present time. \nThey are not going to go into implementation until the year 2002. We \nare in 1998 at the present time and they are going into effect in 2002. \nSo we are approaching this issue very modestly. They are going to be \ntested before they will be accepted. We will have ample opportunity to \nreview the results of both the tests, the testing results as they give \napplication to the tests, long before they go into effect.\n  The question is whether we will take this step by step and make \njudgments that will ultimately enhance the power of parents in knowing \nhow their children are doing. If the Ashcroft amendment goes into \neffect, we are terminating that and denying a very important ingredient \nto parents and local communities. Parents in local schools want to know \nhow their children are doing. Too often they have been kept in the \ndark. If there is a local decision, a local judgment, a State judgment, \nto put these into effect, they ought to have that opportunity to do so. \nUnder the Ashcroft amendment, they will be denied that opportunity to \ndo so.\n  I think this is a very modest program that is being put into the \nprocess at the present time and we should not undermine it this early \nin the process.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 3 minutes 50 \nseconds remaining and the Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes 6 \nseconds remaining. If neither side yields, time will run equally.\n\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, earlier in debate on this, I attempted to offer a \ncompromise amendment partly because I believed, and still do, that the \nassessment of achieving reading and math standards is important \ninformation for parents, school boards, and others involved in \neducation to make appropriate decisions about how changes should be \naccomplished so that we can achieve better results.\n  There was a lot of complication with that because of the concern \nabout the influence of the Department of Education over the design of \nthe tests, the fact that some of this information assessment might not \nbe accurately assessed.\n  What I was attempting to accomplish was to give parents more \nknowledge so they could put more pressure on their local public schools \nto do a better job, to accept reforms. In many instances I was \nconcerned because State departments of education are deceiving parents \nin an effort, from a political standpoint, to convince their \nconstituents that their schools are doing just fine, that their \nstudents are doing as well as anyone. They are not administering tests, \nI think, or interpreting those tests in the way that gives parents \nadequate reflection of that.\n  If we could structure this in a way to get an independent, outside \nthe Department of Education test, voluntary on a State basis, it could \nbe helpful. Well, we weren't able to do that. I think it is now \nentirely appropriate that the Senator's amendment, which essentially \nsays set this aside until we authorize it, debate this thing, work it \nthrough, is the way to go. So I am going to support his amendment. I \nthank the Senator for the time.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 3 minutes. Before the Senator from \nIndiana leaves the floor, I was very persuaded by the logic and \neloquence of the Senator on the reasons he supported the compromise \nlast time. I was under the impression that we still had NAGB doing that \ntest at the present time. The independent board has already taken, as I \nunderstand it, several steps to address the key concerns that were \nraised during the debate and discussion. I understand they are doing \nthe test at the present time. Is the Senator's information different?\n  Mr. COATS. No. The Senator is correct. There seems, however, to be \nsome considerable degree of confusion in the Congress about how that \ntest is going to be structured and what the process is and an \nexpression on the part of many Members that Congress ought to be \ninvolved in the process. So let's just temporarily put that on hold so \nthat the Congress can engage in terms of a better understanding and \ndefining how that ought to be put together. I have agreed that perhaps \nthat is the best way to go, because unless we really have some better \nunderstanding and assessment of that, I am not exactly sure we are \ngoing to accomplish what we want. I think the basic principle that I \ntried to propose earlier, which the Senator supports, I still retain \nthat. I am going to work toward that end.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I wonder why we are going through \nthis, because I am strongly committed to achieving the compromise that \nwas worked out with the leadership. The Senator from Indiana and, I \nbelieve, Senator Gregg were interested in this. We had a great deal of \ndebate and discussion. I thought that giving the assurances in terms of \nthe integrity of the test should be the tough kind of criteria that the \nSenator from Indiana established in terms of the makeup of these tests. \nI understood this was in the process now. That is why I think it is \npremature to wipe all of that out. I hope that if there are \ndifferences, we can try to work those out in a way that is consistent \nwith that agreement rather than just halting the whole process now. As \nthe Senator knows well, we are not going to have this go into effect \nuntil 2002. We have a long way to go. Rather than stop it and start it, \nit might be wise if we can sort of measure it at the present time \nrather than end it.\n  Mr. COATS. In response to the Senator, I would not describe it as a \nstop; it is just a temporary pause while we better discuss the matter \nwith our colleagues to make sure they understand exactly what we are \ntrying to do. Apparently, I have been unsuccessful with that to this \npoint. I am hoping to do better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from \nMassachusetts that his 3 minutes have expired. The Senator from \nMassachusetts has 1 minute 57 seconds. The Senator from Missouri has 1 \nminute 42 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we heard from the Senator from \nIndiana, the reasons for these kinds of reviews are basically that \nthere is nothing wrong with setting high standards for the achievement \nfor the Nation's children and giving parents the opportunity to know \nhow their children are doing. I think that is the basic policy issue.\n\n  The Senator from Indiana and the Senator from New Hampshire insisted\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\nthat this is being done in a nonpartisan, bipartisan way, and I agree \ncompletely. I believe that is the way it is being done. It should be a \nnational priority to do all we can to help the children meet these high \nstandards.\n  Under the existing proposal, that would be done voluntarily. The \nStates would make a judgment, local communities would make a judgment. \nI think we ought to retain the current system and try to adjust it if \nit needs to be adjusted rather than to effectively stop it in its \ntracks. Therefore, I oppose the Ashcroft amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator has 1 minute 46 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I find it novel that individuals would allege that \nthere are no tests to tell us how we are doing now, but then they can \ntell us how far behind we are. The truth of the matter is, there are \nlots of privately generated, academically appropriate tests. There are \nno politically proper tests that come from Government. The Iowa Test of \nBasic Skills and the Stanford Inventories are there. That is the reason \nwe know where we are and parents can find that out.\n  The leadership is clear on this. I have talked to Senator Lott and \nhis staff. He is going to be strong for this. Representative Goodling \nhas led an overwhelming vote of 242-174 in this direction in the House \nof Representatives. Senator Coverdell, who is leading this matter on \nthis bill is a part of this effort. It is an important effort. There \nare lots of national tests. It is said that this would be a voluntary \ntest. Here is what President Clinton said about the voluntary nature of \nthe test: ``I want to create a climate in which no one can say no.''\n  So much for Federal voluntary programs. ``. . . a climate in which no \none can say no.''\n  Incidentally, that was made in remarks to a joint session of the \nMichigan Legislature in Lansing, MI, on March 10, 1997. We don't need \npolitically imposed, politically correct things in education. We need \nacademically appropriate, strong things that local communities trust \nand can mandate and enforce. We don't need direction from Washington, \nDC. I think we have a clear opportunity here to reinforce local control \nof schools, parental involvement in the education of their students. I \nam delighted that the occupant of the Chair has said we should take \nadditional time here to make sure we don't do something that is \ninappropriate.\n  I urge this body to vote in favor of this second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time yielded to the proponents of the \namendment has expired. The Senator from Massachusetts has 54 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is no question that there are tests \nthat are out there, but quite clearly the hearings demonstrated they \nwould not provide the kind of information to the parents across this \ncountry that this kind of initiative would provide. It seems to me that \nwe want to challenge the young people of this country, setting the high \nstandards for the Nation's children and giving the parents the \nopportunity and responsibility to know how their children are doing and \nthen taking action at the local level on how they are going to deal \nwith it. That was the principle that was accepted by the Senate and the \nstrong bipartisan vote last year. Let's continue with that and give \nthat a try before effectively stopping it in its tracks.\n  I yield the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, just an update here. It appears that on \nour side we have one amendment that has been set aside for some \nresolution. On the other side, it appears that there are four \namendments that are yet to be considered. We, of course, would \nencourage any Senator that has amendments to come forward. The aircraft \nthat has taken a delegation to the funeral of a former Member of the \nSenate from North Carolina was scheduled to land, and voting was to \nbegin at approximately 3 o'clock. It has been confirmed that the \naircraft will probably be a little late. So this will alert the Members \nof the Senate that the stacked voting will probably more likely occur \naround 3:45 this afternoon.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield. I will be glad to inquire on \nour side of those who desire to speak or offer an amendment and request \ntheir presence so that we can move along and not in any way hold this \nprocess up.\n  I will do that. I see our friend, the good Senator from Wisconsin. \nMaybe he could be entitled to speak for some time. I will inquire from \nour colleagues on our side about Senators who still have amendments so \nthat we can move this process along.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate that consideration from the Senator from \nMassachusetts. We will do the same.\n  I ask the Senator from Wisconsin about how much time he will need.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will ask for 15 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. On another subject?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. On a different subject.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have no objection.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for fifteen minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1966 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to speak up to 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3375-5", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3407-S3408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EARTH DAY 1998\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today, across our country, Americans are \ncommemorating Earth Day, a day that is vitally important to all who \nserve in this chamber.\n  As my colleagues know, Earth Day was first observed on April 22, \n1970. Its purpose was--and remains--to make people across the country \nand internationally reflect on the splendor of our world, an \nopportunity to get people to think about the earth's many gifts we \noften take for granted. Earth Day is a day for us to sit in the grass, \ntake a walk, listen to the birds, and observe wildlife. Earth Day is a \nday for all of us to reflect on our dependence on our natural resources \nand recognize the care with which we must respect and use our natural \nresources, recycling and replenishing them where possible.\n  The New York Times, on the original Earth Day, ran a story which in \npart read,\n\n       Conservatives were for it. Liberals were for it. Democrats, \n     Republicans and independents were for it. So were the ins, \n     the outs, the Executives and Legislative branches of \n     government.\n\n  The goals of Earth Day 1970 were goals upon which all of us agree. \nThey're goals still shared across our country, regardless of age, \ngender, race, economic status, or religious background.\n  They're shared by this Senator, as well. I consider myself a \nconservationist and an environmentalist. I think everyone who serves in \nthe Senate does. No one among us is willing to accept the proposition \nthat our children or grandchildren will ever have to endure dirty water \nor filthy skies. Our children deserve to live in a world that affords \nthem the same, or better, environmental opportunities their parents \nenjoy today.\n  Mr. President, I believe today, on Earth Day 1998, we must speak of \nour responsibilities--our responsibilities to the Earth, to one \nanother, and to our nation. It is clearly our responsibility to protect \nour earth and ensure its health. Congress has a duty to see to it that \nwe are cautious and conscientious stewards of our natural resources. \nSince the late 1960s, Congress has met this challenge by enacting what \nhas amounted to a ``war on pollution.'' By\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\nengaging in this battle, Congress and an increasingly large federal \nbureaucracy have been successful in centralizing power, expanding \nregulations, saddling taxpayers with more debt, and leaving states and \nlocalities without the power to meet local environmental challenges \nwith local environmental solutions. Local governments have the best \nability to improve the environment--and the most incentive to protect \ntheir people as well.\n  To be sure, this war on pollution has had its successes. The Clean \nAir Act and Clean Water Act have improved our environment in countless \nways. This Congress, and many before it, have spent billions upon \nbillions of dollars in environmental protection plans, conservation \nplans, superfund clean-ups, endangered species act protections, \nwetlands protections, and wildlife refuges just to name a few. Our \nurban landscapes are no longer polluted by the thick, black smoke of \nindustrial smokestacks. Our lakes and rivers are no longer the dumping \nground for toxic sludge. We're recycling newspapers, glass, and \nplastics in record numbers--this, in fact, is a priority in many Senate \noffices, including my own. Through efforts such as the Conservation \nReserve Program, Congress is working in partnership with the American \npeople to ensure our generation leaves behind a cleaner Earth than the \none we inherited.\n  Over the past few years, however, issues of environmental concern \nhave moved away from the consensus required of prudent public policy \nmaking and increasingly toward the margins. Americans have enabled this \nshift because even though we've become more environmentally aware, in \nmany cases we've failed to become more environmentally educated, \nresulting in extremes on both sides of many issues. This past year, a \n14-year old student in Idaho used a simple experiment to prove this \nobservation.\n  In a story reported across the country, young Nathan Zohner entered a \nproject in a local science fair warning people of the dangers of \ndihydrogen monoxide, or DHMO. He described DHMO as a substance potent \nenough to prompt sweating and vomiting, cause severe burns in its \ngaseous state, or even kill if accidentally inhaled. Further, he \nclaimed, DHMO contributes to erosion, decreases the effectiveness of \nautomobile brakes, and can be found in acid rain and cancerous tumors.\n  Nathan then asked roughly 50 people to sign a petition demanding \nstrict control or a complete banning of the chemical. Not surprisingly, \n43 said yes, while five would not sign and two were neutral. What's \nsurprising to many who hear of this story is that dihydrogen monoxide \nis merely water--a substance, Mr. President, we all know is completely \nsafe when handled and consumed properly.\n  Sadly, it took the efforts of a 14-year-old boy to point out the \ndrastic lengths to which our society has taken the rhetoric of \nenvironmental protection. Americans today fear everything from drinking \nwater to beef--and are spurred on by leaders who are often masters of \nfiction, whipping up doomsday scenarios prompted by our supposedly \ncareless treatment of Mother Earth.\n  Mr. President, Nathan Zohner's experiment only scratched the surface \nof the insanity of over-zealous regulation. Regulations today cost \nAmericans over $700 billion each year. That amounts to almost $7,000 \nper household. Let me repeat that--regulations in our country cost \nevery American household nearly $7,000 per year.\n  That is outrageous and it ultimately has nothing to do with \nprotecting the earth or being good stewards. It is the result of a \ncentralized federal bureaucracy which must not only justify its \nexistence, but expand its purpose and scope in order to feed its \ninsatiable appetite for power.\n  Let's review the process. Congress enacts legislation and the \nPresident signs it into law. Simple enough, but what happens next?\n  Well, Executive Agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency \ninterpret what Congress meant and go on a rampage of issuing and \nenforcing regulations that often fly in the face of Congressional \nintent. In Congress, we protest that we didn't mean for that to happen, \nbut rarely, if ever, are we able to reverse the process or rescind the \nregulation. We fail in our most basic role of oversight. And far too \nmany times Congressional intent is thrown aside by these growing \nfederal bureauracies and their own desires are then enforced.\n  American businesses, workers, farmers, states, and localities are \nthen forced to comply with the goals of the EPA's regulations and \nordered to achieve those goals at the direction of the EPA as well. Too \noften, those being regulated aren't allowed to find unique and \ninnovative means of compliance.\n  They aren't allowed to tap into the same American ingenuity which, \nfor the span of our nation's history, has provided workable solutions \nto achievable goals.\n  They are approached by the federal government as adversaries, not as \npartners--and are therefore given a one-size-fits-all dictate by a \ngovernment that most often either doesn't care or doesn't know any \nbetter. And millions of dollars are spent to do $10 worth of good.\n  We all come to the floor and regularly recite polls and studies and \nintricate, numerical details. We often forget that real people and real \njobs and real families mean a whole lot more than just the numbers \nbehind the latest study. But one thing is certain: Americans do not \nexpect that they should have to chose between environmental protections \nand their jobs or standard of living. When we do both, we can ensure a \nhealthy environment and a strong economy and strong economic growth.\n  According to a Wirthlin Worldwide Study conducted last August, only \n11% of Americans consider themselves active environmentalists while 57% \nare sympathetic to environmental concerns. The same study found that \n70% of Americans believe they should not have to choose between \nenvironmental quality and economic growth.\n  Clearly, Americans want their leaders to work pro-actively towards a \nclean and healthy environment, but not to the extreme and certainly not \nat the cost of their safety, their jobs, or their individual freedoms.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that on Earth Day we pledge to come together \nto improve our environment and strengthen our natural resources. I also \nsuggest that we recognize both our failures and successes of the past.\n  We must recognize that today, compliance with regulations is the \nrule--and that blatant attempts to pollute and circumvent regulations \nare the exception. With this in mind, I believe we must renew our \nnation's commitment to pragmatism.\n  Government, on all levels, must do its part as watchdog while \nempowering those being regulated to develop unique and innovative means \nof compliance.\n  At the same time, we must promote ideas that create public/private \npartnerships and encourage companies and individuals to take voluntary \nsteps to protect our natural resources. Through education and \nawareness, we'll be able to approach environmental issues in a way that \nfosters compromises and ensures public policy is pursued in the best \ninterests of all.\n  It is time, Mr. President, that we commit ourselves to achieving real \nresults through environmental initiatives. We must make sure that \nSuperfund dollars go to clean-up, not to lawyers. We must actually \nrestore endangered species and remove them from protections, rather \nthan cordon off large areas of our Nation with little or no results. We \nmust base our decisions on clear science with stated goals and flexible \nsolutions. We must give our job creators more flexibility in meeting \nnational standards as a means of eliminating the pervasive ``command \nand control'' approach that has infected so many Federal programs. And \nfinally, the Federal Government needs to promote a better partnership \nbetween all levels of government, job-providers, environmental interest \ngroups, and the taxpayers.\n  With this in mind I believe that on this Earth Day we must collect \nthe extremist rhetoric found on both sides of the environmental debate \nand flush it down the toilet--remember to flush twice, though, if it's \na new, EPA-mandated low-flow toilet, or it might not be gone for good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I \nunderstand the Senator from Vermont has a subject he needs to cover at \nthis time. We encourage Senators with amendments to come forward.

It is not going to be on the bill itself.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. What we are basically trying to do--I don't think it \nis necessary--is to divide this period of time between them, and it \nwould be appropriate for your side to have time at this point.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, as I have said many times on the floor of \nthe Senate, I am blessed to come from and in fact represent a State in \nwhich people share a deep and abiding concern for the environment. In \nmany ways, Vermont is an example to the Nation in its environmental \nethics and its environmental action.\n  We Vermonters are especially proud that much of the environmental \nprogress the Nation has achieved in the last 3 decades is also part of \nthe legacy of Vermont's own Robert Stafford. Senator Stafford's \nleadership in this body helped shape national environmental policy from \nthe time the environmental movement was in its infancy, and then \ncontinued well into its maturity. In his role as chairman of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works--a post that Senator Stafford \nassumed in 1981--Bob Stafford courageously and successfully stood up to \nthe powerful interests who tried to roll back our environmental \nstandards. Today, as we celebrate the 28th anniversary of Earth Day, I \nwould like to take a moment to reflect on the progress we have made to \nprotect our environment. But I also want to talk about the job that \nremains to be done.\n  In the past few weeks, one of Vermont's great treasures, Lake \nChamplain, has received a great deal of attention. This has also \noffered an opportunity to explain one of the threats to Lake Champlain \nfrom toxic pollutants that are drifting into our State. One of these \npollutants, mercury, should be of particular concern. Like lakes and \nwaterways in most States, Lake Champlain now has fish advisories for \nwalleye and lake trout and bass. All that is due to mercury.\n  When I was growing up and I could spend parts of my summers on Lake \nChamplain, I never had to worry about eating the fish that I caught. \nActually, I only had to worry about being good enough to catch them in \nthe first place. But someday, when I take my grandson out fishing, I \ndon't want to explain to him why he can't eat a fish he catches there. \nWhat I tell my grandson is largely a function of what direction we \ndecide to take in Congress to protect the environment. Depending upon \nwhat we do here, that will determine whether I can tell him to eat the \nfish or not. Are we going to rest on our laurels, or are we going to \nbuild on the courageous steps that Bob Stafford and others took to \nprotect our environment for future generations?\n  We should be proud of the great strides we have made to reduce the \nlevel of many air and water pollutants, to rebuild populations of \nendangered species, and to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites. \nAnd we are proud of that. But now we have to continue to address the \nenvironmental threats that do not have any easy solutions. One of these \nthreats is the mercury that seeps into our air and water every day from \ncoal-fired power plants and waste combustors and utility boilers. It is \none of the last remaining toxins for which there is no control \nstrategy.\n  When we originally wrote the Clean Air Act, we didn't understand the \ndangers posed by mercury, but we have seen the dangers in our own \nState. Two high schools in my own State had to be closed for a week \nbecause there were small amounts of mercury found in the classrooms. \nBut these were instances where you could actually see the mercury. The \nmore elusive problems are the ones where the mercury goes through the \nair and water and we don't see it. With the release of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's Mercury Study Protection Report to \nCongress, we have the information to solve the problem of mercury \npollution. We have the information to solve the problem. The question \nwe have to ask is: Do we have the will to solve it?\n  The report shows some very troubling levels of mercury in fish, and \nalso estimates in the United States there are more than 1\\1/2\\ million \npregnant women and their fetuses, women of childbearing age, and \nchildren who are at risk of brain and nerve development damage from \nmercury pollution.\n  There are new facts of mercury pollution, too. Look at this chart. In \n1993, there were 27 States with fish advisories for mercury \ncontamination. These are the States in red. There are 899 lakes, river \nsegments and streams identified as yielding mercury-contaminated fish. \nThat was just 5 years ago.\n  Now let's see what has happened as we go to 1997. Look at how the red \nis filling up the country. You can see that 39 States have issued \nmercury fish advisories for 1,675 water bodies. This is where we are \nwith mercury-contaminated fish; almost every State in the country, \n1,675 advisories.\n  In only 5 years, it is an increase of 86 percent. We are going in the \nwrong direction. We are soon going to see the map totally red.\n  What we should be doing, Mr. President, is trying to reverse course, \ngetting rid of this mercury pollution and going back to where we can \nhave a country without them.\n  We pump 150 tons of mercury into the atmosphere every year--every \nyear, year after year after year. It doesn't go away. It becomes more \npotent. We put a lot of love and time and energy and fiscal resources \ninto our children, but we are not protecting them from the possibility \nof being poisoned by a potent neurotoxin.\n  The critics of inaction are right. We can't tell to what degree \npeople with learning disorders, coordination problems, hearing, sight \nor speech problems have been harmed by mercury pollution. We don't know \nhow many little Sarahs or Johnnys would have been gifted physicians, \npoets or teachers but who now have no chance of reaching their full \npotential because they are exposed to mercury in the womb or during \nearly childhood.\n  Just as with lead, we know that mercury has much graver effects on \nchildren at very low levels than it does on adults. It is insidious.\n  Because we can't measure how much potential has been lost, some \nspecial interests say we should continue to do nothing.\n  Our late colleague, Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine, put it well when \nhe\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\nsaid, ``[t]he first responsibility of Congress is not the making of \ntechnological or economic judgments. Our responsibility is to establish \nwhat the public interest requires''--requires--``to protect the health \nof persons.''\n  We have enough information to act. We don't have to wait until we \nhave a body count. We have the information, now we need the will, and \nwe should have the will to act.\n  I propose we put a stop to this poisoning of America. Mercury can be \nremoved from products. It has been done. Mercury can be removed from \ncoal-fired powerplants, and it should be done. We should limit the \nmercury that enters our environment from coal-fired powerplants, waste \nincinerators, and large industrial boilers and other known sources.\n  Americans have a right to know what is being spewed out of these \nfacilities and into their backyards and into the food of their \nchildren. We in Congress have the responsibility to give them the \nknowledge and the tools to protect their children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Chair notifies the Senator \nfrom Vermont that initially there were 23 minutes to each side. Senator \nKennedy, by unanimous consent, claimed 15 minutes of the 23 minutes. \nTherefore, we are now into Senator Kennedy's time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, that wasn't precisely the way that I recall \nthe intent of the unanimous consent agreement, but let me just say \nthis. The EPA report estimates the cost nationally of controlling \nmercury from powerplants at $5 billion per year, and this is an \nindustry that generates more than $200 billion a year in revenue. That \nis less than 2.5 percent. It strikes me as being the equivalent of a \nfly on an elephant's back. We can do a lot better.\n  The residents of Colchester, VT have been fighting for 7 years to \nclean up a waste incinerator in their backyard that they were \noriginally told was clean enough to toast marshmallows in. Well, now we \nknow better and we need to require this and other facilities to \neliminate mercury emissions.\n  One of the largest sources of mercury is coal-fired power plants. \nWith States deregulating their utility industries, Congress today has a \nunique opportunity to make sure these powerplants begin to internalize \nthe cost of their pollution.\n  Many of the problems the Clean Air Act of 1970 was drafted to solve \nare being addressed. But one thing has not worked out the way Congress \noriginally envisioned. It seemed back then that old, dirty, inefficient \npower plants would eventually be retired and replaced by a new \ngeneration of clean and efficient plants. The concept worked with \ntailpipe controls on cars. Eventually the fleet turns over and the \ndirty ones are out of circulation.\n  But, 28 years later, many utilities continue to operate dirty, \ninefficient plants that were built in the 1950s or before. These plants \nare subject to much less stringent pollution controls than are new \nfacilities, and what we now have is a big loophole, and these plants \nare pouring pollution through it.\n  If we don't level the pollution playing field now, in a deregulated \nindustry the financial incentive will be to pump even more power and \npollution out of these plants for as long as they will last. As long as \nthe rules of the game allow this, these utility companies are acting in \na manner that suits solely their economic self interest. As a nation, \nwe cannot afford to subsidize their inefficiency, but our inaction does \njust that.\n  We will hear a lot of rhetoric about how much implementing this bill \nwill cost. I want to address those complaints up front. The cost \nargument does not hold water. I say it again, the EPA report estimates \nthe cost nationally of controlling mercury from power plants at $5 \nbillion per year, and this industry generates more than $200 billion a \nyear in revenue. That is less that two and a half percent, and that \nstrikes me as being the equivalent of a fly on an elephant's back.\n  Mercury pollution is a key piece of unfinished business in cleaning \nup our environment. The poisoning of America's lakes, rivers, lands, \nand citizens with mercury pollution can be stopped. It is unnecessary, \nand continuing to ignore it mortgages the health of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3409-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3410-S3423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Missouri \nhas a statement. I will be glad to follow him.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to my good friend \nand colleague from Massachusetts. I ask for 5 minutes to be yielded \nfrom the majority side.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished manager.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coverdell measure and in \nsupport of the Gorton-Frist amendment and in support of the Ashcroft \namendment. We have an opportunity as a body to make some very clear \nstatements about education that the people in our States are asking us \nto make.\n  I firmly believe that education is a national priority but a local \nresponsibility. This leads to a fundamental difference between this \nside and what might be referred to as a Washington establishment on \neducation.\n  I believe that those who know the names of the students personally \nare better at making decisions than those who don't know them. \nUnfortunately, Federal involvement in education over the years has \nstarted off with a great idea of providing resources in support for \nwhat we believe for our children is the highest priority, and that is \ngetting them a good education, but it has mushroomed into burdensome \nregulations, judicial intrusion, unfunded mandates and unwanted \nmeddling.\n  The results have been that local school officials who are accountable \nto parents and communities have increasingly less and less control over \nwhat goes on in their classrooms. In some cases, parents really feel \nthat they have lost control of their child's education. They have told \nme horror stories about how their children are not getting an education \nbecause of requirements that the Federal Government has put on the \nschools.\n  I believe that parents and local school boards are and must be the \nkey to true educational reform, not big Government. We should be \nempowering parents and teachers and school districts and States to \ndevelop challenging academic standards, programs and priorities, not \nmaking their jobs of educating children of America more difficult.\n  As my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, said, we already \nhave standards, we already have tests. As a result of those tests, we \nknow where the problems are in education, and we need to do something \nabout it. Yes, nationally we ought to focus on the problem, but we \nought not to try to solve with a ``Washington, DC, solution'' the \nproblems we face in every community and every city throughout Missouri \nand throughout America.\n  I have had a very interesting and informative experience over the \nlast year and a half talking to school board members, talking to \nteachers, talking to principals and talking to parents across my State \nof Missouri. It is from these discussions that I come back here with a \nrenewed commitment to keep local control over education.\n  We have school districts in Missouri hiring hordes of consultants and \ngrant writers instead of teachers because they know they have to play \n``Mother May I?'' with Washington, DC. We have some schools, the \nsmaller schools, that say they don't even bother to apply for the \nFederal funds because they don't have the time and the resources to \nprepare the application.\n  Leaders in school districts have told me of the unforeseen \nconsequences of getting a grant. They get a grant development program \nand the grant expires and the school district has to determine whether \nto take local money from existing resources to continue the program or \nto eliminate it.\n  One of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said very, very \nconvincingly today, and I love these words, ``The Federal Government \ndoesn't run schools, and the Federal Government doesn't fund schools.'' \nI\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\nagree with those principles. I just wish that he were correct in the \nfacts.\n  The Federal Government should not be micromanaging school districts. \nIn Missouri, 67 percent of the funds that go to the school districts \ncome from the Federal Government. These are general funds for K through \n12. They tell me, depending upon the school district, that anywhere \nfrom 40 to 85 percent of the red tape and the hassle and the \nregulations come from Washington.\n  I don't think that is right. Last year, when we adopted the Gorton \namendment to send money directly to the schools, some of my colleagues \nvery eloquently said, ``We don't want to have Federal dollars going \ndirectly to school districts because the school districts will waste \nthe money; they might build athletic facilities; or they will waste it \nin some other way.''\n  Mr. President, I have spent my adult career working with parents and \nteachers and school boards in Missouri. I have watched them work. I \nhave watched their education decisions. I have spent about the last 11 \nyears in this body watching Congress debate issues and watching the \nFederal bureaucracy administer programs. And when it comes to who \nwastes money, Mr. President, it is not even close. It is not a contest. \nThe Washington way wastes more money by far. The locally controlled \nschools are far better at applying those dollars to the needs of the \nchildren in their schools.\n  There is no disagreement that in some cases a local school district \nmay need money to build some more schools or it may need money to hire \nmore teachers. For some schools, new textbooks should be the top \npriority. For others, additional computers might be needed or a school \nsafety program might need to be implemented.\n  Who knows best? Those at the local level, held accountable by those \nthey serve, or the bureaucrats in Washington? A one-size-fits-all \napproach does not and will not work in education. Let us give our \nschools, our teachers, and our parents the resources and flexibility \nthey need to educate our children for a lifetime of achievement and \naccomplishment. I urge my colleagues to support the amendments and to \nsupport the bill, and I urge that they give a sound, strong endorsement \nto local control over education.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time on this side and yield the floor. \nAgain, I extend my sincere thanks to my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we all know what our priorities are in \neducation. We need to do all we can to support and improve our public \nschools. That means additional assistance to every State to repair \ncrumbling schools and to build new facilities. It means recruiting more \nteachers to meet the existing demand and to deal with the crisis of \nrising enrollments, especially in priority disciplines, in math and \nscience. It means reducing class sizes. It means more support for \nafterschool programs to keep kids off the streets, away from drugs, and \nout of trouble. It means a major effort to teach young children how to \nread because we know that literacy is the foundation of every other \naspect of learning. It means setting higher standards for schools to \nmeet in educating their students. We know these ideas will work. But \nschools across the country are in desperate need of funds to make them \nwork.\n  Our goal is to improve public schools, not abandon them. It makes no \nsense to call for greater priority for education and then earmark aid \nfor private schools instead of public schools. Public schools are \ninstituting these ideas and getting results. We should make sure that \nevery school and community has the resources to put in practice what \nworks so that no child is left out or left behind.\n  Mr. President, this chart here shows what is happening to the schools \nin this country. And this is according to the General Accounting \nOffice: 14 million children learn in substandard schools; 7 million \nchildren attend schools with asbestos, lead paint, or radon in the \nceilings or walls; 12 million children go to school under leaky roofs; \none-third of all American children study in classrooms without enough \npanel outlets and the electrical wiring to accommodate computers and \nmultimedia equipment.\n  This is a tragedy, a national tragedy. It is not only a physical \ntragedy in terms of the facilities are getting more and more antiquated \nevery single year, but it is also a tragedy in the kind of subliminal \nmessage--and it isn't so subliminal a message--that it sends to \nchildren and their parents. Because as grownups and as political \nleaders are talking about the importance of children in our country and \nin our society, and that the children are our future, on the other \nhand, we are sending our children into these kinds of conditions every \nsingle day. We are sending the message that we do not really care about \nthe kind of facilities where you are trying to learn, and we do not \nreally care very much about education. That is the message that is \nbeing hammered home every single day to these millions of children who \nare going to school in these kinds of conditions. That is wrong. We are \ntrying to address that. And that is a principal policy difference \nbetween the Republicans and the Democrats on the education issue.\n  Massachusetts is no exception. Forty-one percent of Massachusetts \nschools report that at least one building needs extensive repairs or \nshould be replaced. Seventy-five percent report serious problems in \nbuildings, such as plumbing or heating defects. Eighty percent have at \nleast one unsatisfactory environmental factor. It is difficult enough \nto teach or learn in modern classrooms, and it makes no sense to \ncompound the difficulty by subjecting teachers and students to \ndilapidated facilities. We cannot tolerate a situation in which \nfacilities deteriorate while enrollments escalate.\n  Mr. President, in far too many communities across the country, \nchildren are also learning in overcrowded classrooms. This year, K-12 \nenrollment reached an all-time high, and will continue to rise over the \nnext 7 years, and will increase by about 4 million children in K-12 \nover the period of the next 4 years.\n\n  That is why it is so important that we are going to have a major \neffort in terms of increasing the teaching profession and giving them \nthe skills to be able to teach these children to ever higher standards \nand to take into consideration the utilizations of the new electronics \nand to tie those into curriculum, all of that so that our children are \ngoing to have a world-class education. That is a new phenomenon. That \nis a national phenomenon--the expansion and growth of our children in \nour schools. We know this is happening.\n  And now we need 6,000 new public schools built and needed by the year \n2006 just to maintain the current class sizes. We know this is \nhappening. We have been given that information by the Department of \nEducation and by everyone that has studied this situation.\n  Due to the overcrowded schools, they are using trailers for \nclassrooms and teaching students in former hallways, closets, and \nbathrooms. And overcrowded classrooms undermine the discipline and \ndecrease student morale.\n  We have had the testimony during the earlier debates--I have given \nexamples of these kinds of conditions--and for the first time heard \nfrom an outstanding president of a very important school in neighboring \nVirginia the fact that because of these overcrowded conditions, a new \nphenomenon is developing in their school, and it is called hall rage--\nhall rage. I never heard those words used before.\n  What he was pointing out was, with the increasing number of students \nin these confined areas, that from the brushing against one another and \nthe kinds of violence that is taking place in the classroom, you see \nthe explosion in the number of fights, misunderstandings, and a \ndeterioration in both morale and discipline because of hall rage--too \nmany students trying to get to too many different places, and often in \nthese trailers for classrooms and in closets and other situations. That \nis what is happening in the United States of America. That is what is \nhappening.\n  We ought to give a helping hand to the local communities. We are not \ninterested in superimposing some Federal solution, some ``new \nbureaucracy,'' those old cliches. I have listened to the same cliches \nfor 30-odd years. You would think they would have new ones, talking \nabout the ``new bureaucracy,'' ``one size fits all,'' ``Washington\n\n[[Page S3412]]\n\ndoesn't know everything.'' You hear those every single day for 30 \nyears, and you would think they would find some new ones.\n  What we are finding out with overcrowded classrooms is, we have the \ndemand for additional teachers and we have the demand for additional \nkinds of support for students as well in other areas.\n  Mr. President, class sizes are too large. Students in small classes \nin the early grades make much more rapid progress than students in \nlarger classes. In the exchange earlier today, I pointed out what some \nof the States are doing, and the findings in Wisconsin, the findings in \nCalifornia, Flint, MI, very important findings in terms of increasing \nliteracy and academic achievement with these smaller classes. It is not \nthe answer to everything, but it is a pretty clear and compelling case \nto be made. And it was made so clearly by the Senator from Washington, \nSenator Murray, on the importance of getting into smaller classes. As a \nformer teacher and school board member, she is talking about what is \nhappening out on Main Street. This is a message that should have been \nlistened to. And we will have an opportunity to vote on her excellent \namendment in just a little while.\n  The benefits are greatest for low-achieving minority and low-income \nchildren with smaller classes. Smaller classes also enable teachers to \nidentify and work effectively with students who have learning \ndisabilities and reduce the need for special education at later grades.\n  The Nation's students deserve modern schools with world-class \nteachers. But too many students in too many schools in too many \ncommunities across the country fail to achieve that standard.\n  The latest international survey on math and science achievement \nconfirms the urgent need to raise standards of performance for schools, \nteachers, and students alike. It is shameful that America's 12th \ngraders ranked among the lowest of 22 nations participating in the \ninternational survey on math and science. Here we have prospectively, \nin the year 2000, on a voluntary basis, on the States and local \ncommunity tests, so that we can raise the standards of American \nchildren in areas of math and science--we have an amendment to strike \nthat, strike that proposal--tests that will be developed in a \nbipartisan way so parents have greater information to make decisions \nlocally to enhance academic achievement and accomplishment, a \ncompromise that was agreed to by 87 Members of this body, a bipartisan \ncompromise, and now we have an amendment to strike that at a time when \nwe are having these results and effectively denying the parents the \nopportunity to have knowledge and understanding about where their \nchildren are, in their school, in their community, in their State, \nrelevant to other communities across the country, if they want to, if \nthey believe that is important. I think that makes no sense whatever, \nand I hope the Ashcroft amendment will be defeated.\n  Teacher shortages forced many school districts to hire uncertified \nteachers or to ask certified teachers to teach outside their area of \nexpertise. That is what is happening in every area of the country. Each \nyear, over 50,000 underprepared teachers enter the classroom. One in \nfour does not fully meet State certification requirements. Twelve \npercent of new teachers have no training teacher at all. Students in \ninner city schools have only a 50 percent chance of being taught by a \nqualified science or math teacher. Listen to that: only a 50 percent \nchance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher.\n  Instead of putting the $1.6 billion in tax advantage for individuals \nwho will send their kids to private schools, let's do something about \nthose schoolteachers who are not certified in the areas of math and \nscience, and upgrade their skills. They will go back to the public \nschools and be able to enhance the quality of education for those kids. \nThis is a basic difference between our Republican friends and those on \nthis side on the issue of teachers and the importance of having high \nstandards on which to measure our children.\n  Another high priority is to meet the need for more afterschool \nactivities. Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years \nold, are home alone after school. Juvenile delinquent crime peaks \nbetween the hours of 3 and 8. Children left unsupervised are more \nlikely to be involved in antisocial activities and destructive patterns \nof behavior. It isn't just that there are greater opportunities for \nthem to get in trouble, it is that there are advantages of having those \nchildren in circumstances where they are able to go into local \ncommunity-based systems where they may get some help and assistance \nwith their homework over the afternoon or maybe participate in some \nsports events that are supervised, so when the parents get home after a \nlong, hard day, the children can have some quality time instead of \nhaving parents too often come home, know the kids have been watching \ntelevision, or not knowing where their kids are, and sending them to \ntheir room to do the homework, and the parent lacks that opportunity to \nspend quality time. No one denies if the parents want to work with the \nchild, well and good, but for the parents hard-pressed and working from \nearly morning to late in the evening, and who have the responsibility \nin terms of the family that value the afternoon kind of program, they \nought to be at least available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Reserving the right to object, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired on the minority side; the \nmajority side has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator would be using our side's time. I want to \nafford the Senator an opportunity to complete his remarks. May I yield \nanother 2\\1/2\\ minutes of my time to the Senator?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, we had set for 3 o'clock--as the Senator knows, I \nhave been trying to get people over here. I will yield as soon as \nanybody comes over. I have about 5 more minutes. I would like to be \nable to continue for 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It was my intention to try to respond to the time that \nthe Senator is using. I am trying to split the difference.\n  I yield 3 minutes of my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, literacy is another very high priority, \nto date. Too many children are reading at unacceptable levels--40 \npercent of the fourth graders fail to attain the basic level of \nreading.\n\n  Incredibly, Mr. President, the tax proposal that is the Coverdell \nproposal ignores each and every one of these pressing needs. The \nregressive Republican tax bill does nothing to improve public schools, \nnothing to address the need for public schools to build new facilities, \nnothing to reduce class size in school, nothing to provide qualified \nteachers, nothing to provide afterschool activities to keep children \naway from drugs, nothing to help all children learn to read, and \nnothing to help reach higher academic standards. It does nothing to \nimprove the quality of education for children in public schools. Tax \nbreaks for private schools is not the answer to the serious problems \nfacing the Nation's public schools.\n  There are serious problems in the Nation's public schools. We can do \nmuch more to turn troubled schools around and undertake a wide-range of \nproven reforms to create and sustain safe and high-performing schools. \nThere are no magic remedies to improve schools and improve student \nlearning. We need to use our limited resources wisely to get the most \nbenefits for our tax dollars.\n  The Republican approach would divert urgently needed funds away from \npublic schools into private schools. That is wrong for education, wrong \nfor America, and wrong for the Nation's future.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has \ncharacterized the differences here today as Republican and Democrat, \nand they are not. The dispute we are having here today is between a \ncommunity that is defending the status quo and rejecting change and a \ngroup of Senators who\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\nare committed to reform and change. And they are not Republicans and \nDemocrats, as the Senator from Massachusetts has suggested.\n  The measure that is before the Senate is cosponsored by Senator \nTorricelli from New Jersey, a Democrat. The school construction \nproposal that is before the Senate was authored by Senator Graham of \nFlorida, a Democrat. The assistance to these States to students that \nhave prepaid State tuition assistance is authored by Senator Moynihan \nof New York, a Democrat. And aiding employees by facilitating an \nemployers' ability to help continuing education is the suggestion of \nSenator Breaux from Louisiana, a Democrat. So this is a bipartisan \nproposal that is here. It is not a Republican proposal. There are many \nDemocrats who are at the forefront of what is being discussed and \ndebated here today.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts also characterizes this as an \neducation savings account as if there were nothing else in the \nproposal. As I have just said, yes, there is an education savings \naccount in our proposal that is directed to helping parents, parents \nwho have children in public schools, in private schools, and at-home \nschools. But there are also provisions in the proposal that aid the 21 \nStates in the Union that have prepaid tuition plans.\n  This proposal that is before the Senate, and I predict will pass the \nSenate, makes sure that when those funds come to the students, when \nthey actually need them to go to college, those funds are not going to \nget taxed at that time. The full benefit of those State-prepaid tuition \nprograms will be there for 1 million college students.\n  There are already 1 million students in the queue in 21 States, and \n17 more States are about to adopt such provisions. The plan before the \nSenate will aid employers in funding continuing education for 1 million \nemployees in America--1 million. What it does is it enables them to \nspend up to $5,250 annually to help with the continuing education \nprogram. And that is not going to be treated as income to the employee, \nis not going to be taxed, a disincentive to offering the program.\n  The plan deals with school construction, but it leaves the decision \nabout what should be constructed to local communities. Senator Graham's \nproposal expands financing tools for local communities and high-growth \ncommunities to deal with school construction.\n  So the proposal before the Senate is wide-ranging, from education \nsavings accounts that help parents and students--14 million of them to \nbe exact, and 20 million students to be exact --who will save in the \nfirst 5 years upwards of $5 billion, and over 10 years $10 billion. The \nsuggestion is that all these resources go to private schools. It is \nsimply not true. Seventy percent of the families that use these savings \naccounts, their children are in public schools. Public schools are a \nbig winner. The division of where the money goes is about 50/50 because \nfolks who have children in private schools save more. They know they \nhave to have more. But it's their money; it's not public money.\n  So all of these issues that the Senator has alluded to are embraced--\nmaybe not exactly the way he would like them--in the proposal before \nthe Senate: education savings accounts for parents, tax incentives for \nemployers to help employees, the protection of prepaid State tuition \nplans, and school construction.\n  Now, on top of that, we are going to have a chance to vote on an \namendment offered on this bill by Senator Gorton. Senator Gorton takes \na portion of the Federal assistance and removes all the regulations, \nlike it has to happen on a ``blue'' day and a ``green'' Tuesday, or \nwhatever. All the morass that the Senator from Tennessee, now in the \nChair, talked about earlier today--strip those away from about $10 \nbillion-plus that goes to the local States and they can do exactly what \nthe Senator from Massachusetts wants to see done. They can build \nschools, they can hire teachers, they can reduce class size, they can \ndevelop after-school programs, they can build parks, they can do \nwhatever they think, and that is $10 billion on top of which we have \ncreated a new pool of $10 billion.\n  The other side wants to look away from that voluntary money in those \nsavings accounts. This is money being brought forward by parents and \nfriends of parents of children. There is no new tax that has to be \nraised. No school district has to raise their taxes to get the $10 \nbillion. No State has to increase income taxes. The Federal Government \ndoesn't have to spend more money. By this simple, small incentive, we \nare causing American families to come forward with billions of new \ndollars to help public, private, and home schools. They will hire \ntutors. I think they are smarter dollars than a lot of dollars we talk \nabout here. Why? Because they are guided by the family to the specific \nproblem the child has. If a child has a math deficiency in a public \nschool, private, or home school, then the family can hire a tutor with \nthat savings account they generate. If they don't have a home \ncomputer--and I might point out that only 15 percent of the students in \ninner city schools have home computers--well, they could buy one with \nthese savings accounts. If they have a learning disability--dyslexia or \nsomething like that--then the family has a tool they can use to fix \nthat specific problem. Public dollars have a hard time doing that.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, on several occasions, has referred to \nthis tax incentive that will go to create these savings accounts. It is \ntrue that about $500 million is used as the tax incentive--just over \n$500 million. That is a newer figure. The figure the Senator used is a \nlittle larger than that, but that was the figure I had at the same \ntime. It is about $520 million in the first 5 years of tax relief to \nanybody that would open the account, by not taxing the interest \nbuildup. That modest incentive, that modest amount of tax relief is \nwhat generates $5 billion in savings.\n  The proposal that the Senator was talking about in terms of school \nconstruction is a $9 billion tax relief proposal. Who does that go to? \nThat goes to banks and insurance companies and Wall Street brokers. \nThey will get the tax breaks on the school bonds under the proposal to \nbuild schools. On the one hand, we have $500 million of tax relief over \n5 years to generate $5 billion of new savings. On the other hand, we \nhave $9 billion of tax relief going to the holders of the bonds on the \nschool proposal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield a minute on that issue?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't know which particular amendment the Senator is \ntalking on. On the school construction amendment by Senator Moseley-\nBraun, there is $3.3 billion to create $22 billion in school \nconstruction. I don't know which one the Senator is referring to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am using the 10-year figure. The figure you used is \ncorrect for the first 5 years.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. You are using a 10-year figure for her and a 5-year \nfigure for yourself.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. My 10-year figure would be about $1.1 billion. Let's \ntake the 5 years. In 5 years, it is $500 million in tax relief for 14 \nmillion middle-income families on the education savings account and \nover 5 years, over $3 billion of tax relief for the people that buy \nthose big bonds. That is a very select community that can play that \ngame. Then in 10 years mine becomes $1.1 billion for the 14 million \nfamilies, and they save because of that, $10 billion. No one saves a \ndime on the savings proposed for the school bonds. That doesn't \ngenerate anything, except school construction. But the beneficiaries of \nthe tax relief are a very select group of Americans. They fit in a very \nsmall percentage group.\n  The point I am making--that amendment obviated tax relief for the \nmiddle-class Americans, the 14 million families; it took it out and \nreplaced it with $9 billion in tax relief for, as I said, large \nfinancial institutions.\n  I know my time is about to expire. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 55 seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I want to make the point that all the subjects--school \nconstruction, smaller class size, reinforcing communities and parents--\nwe are talking about the same subjects. We may differ on our approach, \nand this doesn't cut down party lines; this cuts down status quo or \nreform, doing things differently, with more authority at the local \nlevel, more decisionmaking at the local level, more decisionmaking for \nfamilies. That is where the cut is. It\n\n[[Page S3414]]\n\nis not Democrat or Republican. My chief cosponsor is a prominent member \nof the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I want to reiterate that what we are talking about \nhelps 14 million families who are the carekeepers of over 20 million \nschoolchildren. And every school environment is helped--public, \nprivate, and home. Our proposal will aid 1 million college students, \n250,000 graduate students, 1 million employees, 500 new schools, $10 \nmillion in new savings. The Federal Government doesn't have this. This \nis coming from families, $10 million, a huge influx of new resources.\n  If the Gorton amendment passes, there will be over 10 additional \nbillions--not new expenditures, just freed up expenditures--for smaller \nclassrooms, for new schools, or for whatever those States and local \ncommunities feel are necessary to get at the crisis and challenge that \nwe all know and have both cited time and time again are occurring, \nparticularly in kindergarten through high school.\n  Mr. President, I believe the hour of 3 o'clock has arrived. It is my \nunderstanding that Senator Landrieu is scheduled to begin her amendment \nat this hour.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, she was going to make a best \neffort. She was over here at 1 o'clock and was over here this morning. \nSo we will inquire and try to determine her location, and then I will \nreport back to the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Very good.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2301\n\n(Purpose: To strike section 101, and to provide funding for Blue Ribbon \n                                Schools)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2301.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 101, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 101. BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Program Authorized.--\n       (1) Recognition.--The Secretary of Education is authorized \n     to carry out a program that recognizes public and private \n     elementary and secondary schools that have established \n     standards of excellence and demonstrated a high level of \n     quality.\n       (2) Designation.--Each school recognized under paragraph \n     (1) shall be designated as a ``Blue Ribbon School'' for a \n     period of 3 years.\n       (b) Awards.--\n       (1) Amount.--The Secretary shall make an award for each \n     school recognized under subsection (a) in the amount of \n     $100,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--If the Secretary is prohibited from \n     making an award directly to a school, the Secretary shall \n     make such award to the local educational agency serving such \n     school for the exclusive use of such school.\n       (3) Private schools.--Awards for private schools recognized \n     under subsection (a) shall be used to provide students and \n     teachers at the schools with educational services and \n     benefits that are similar to, and provided in the same manner \n     as, the services and benefits provided to private school \n     students and teachers under part A of title I, or title VI, \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n       (4) Limitation.--The Secretary shall not make more than 250 \n     awards under this section for any fiscal year.\n       (5) Wait-out period.--The Secretary shall not make a second \n     or subsequent award to a school under this section before the \n     expiration of the 3-year designation period under subsection \n     (a)(2) that is applicable to the preceding award.\n       (c) Applications and Technical Assistance Grants.--\n       (1) Applications.--Each school desiring recognition under \n     subsection (a)(1) shall submit to the Secretary an \n     application at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by \n     such information as the Secretary may require.\n       (2) Technical assistance grants.--The Secretary is \n     authorized to award grants to States to enable the States to \n     provide technical assistance to schools desiring recognition \n     under subsection (a)(1).\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out this section (other than subsection (c)(2)) \n     $25,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1999 through 2003.\n       (2) Technical assistance grants.--There is authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out subsection (c)(2) $2,000,000 for \n     each of the fiscal years 1999 through 2003.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I send this amendment to the desk to \noffer an alternative to my distinguished colleague from Georgia, an \nalternative in the way we would spend this $1.6 billion that we have \nbeen debating and have been debating for some time now.\n  Let me thank my colleague from Georgia for at least getting the \nSenate to begin a significant debate about the ways in which we can \nimprove the status of education in our Nation. I, frankly, am one \nSenator who believes that there is nothing really more important that \nwe can spend our time on now than talking about this important issue. I \nthink the debate has been very lively. It has come with controversy. \nBut I thank my colleague from Georgia for at least offering this idea, \nso that we can have a debate about the best way to spend our money when \nit comes to trying to improve our schools, which, in my opinion, is the \nnumber one priority of all Americans, regardless of whether they have \nchildren in school or not. We all know as a nation the value of our \neducation system, both public as well as private.\n  I was very open to this idea initially as it was presented. I have, I \nthink, demonstrated in the year I have been here an ability to be open \nto new ideas about how to solve this problem. I don't think the old \nways work. I don't believe the American public wants us to just throw \nmore money at a problem. I think they are looking at innovation and \ncreativity in improving our schools. I think the American people, \nparticularly people in Louisiana, have witnessed many schools that are \nworking, many pilot programs and initiatives, whether it is charter \nschools and more accountability, teacher training, teacher testing, or \nhigher student achievement and things that are working.\n  So I looked, with hope perhaps, at this bill, now called the \nCoverdell-Torricelli proposal, but after looking at the studies that \nhave come in about who would really benefit from this initiative to \nspend $1.5 billion, it is clear to me from the GAO report and other \neconomists reporting that the major benefit of this $1.5 billion to be \nspent over 5 years would go to a very small segment of parents and \nfamilies who have their children in private or nonpublic schools.\n  I want to be part of a team of Senators and leaders who support \nefforts that help all schools as fairly as they can. There are some in \nthis body and in Congress who do not want to do very much at all to \nhelp parochial or private schools. I am not in that group. I believe \nour Government within the framework of our Constitution should try to \nhelp all of our schools and all of our students. But this is not the \nbest way we can go about this, and that is why I am not going to be \nable to support the bill and would offer this amendment as a \nsubstitute, if you will.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator will yield \none moment so we can clarify an administrative detail.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It won't take a minute.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 3:45 \ntoday the Senate proceed to a series of votes on or in relation to the \nfollowing amendments: Gorton No. 2293, Hutchinson No. 2296, Murray No. \n2295, Ashcroft No. 2300, Levin No. 2299. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that if amendment No. 2300 is agreed to, the Levin amendment \nNo. 2299 be open to further amendment under the same time limitations \nunder the original order. I further ask unanimous consent that there be \n2 minutes of debate equally divided between each of the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, if I can continue, my amendment is called the blue \nribbon schools amendment. It is quite simple. It would take the money \nwe would otherwise be setting aside for these very small savings \naccounts that would reach only a small group of beneficiaries and \nspread it over all 50 States, to many schools in those States that have \nbeen designated basically by their peers to be blue ribbon schools and \nschools of excellence. It is time that we in this country stop at the \nFederal level--and I hope we can encourage States and local governments \nto stop--funding failure and start rewarding results and success.\n  That is what this amendment does. This amendment will take the money \notherwise spent by the distinguished Senator from Georgia and give \n$100,000 grants to all of the schools designated, and there are 250 so \ndesignated each year, as the most excellent schools in America. They \nare public; they are parochial; they are private. There have been 3,000 \nschools that have achieved this designation since this program started \n10 years ago.\n  It is currently operating this way. The schools are rigorously \nevaluated and 250 are chosen. They are invited to come to Washington. \nThey are given a plaque and a pat on the back and they are basically \nsent home. I think we need to do more than give them a pat on the back \nand a plaque to hang on their school wall, as proud as they are to \ndisplay this plaque, and begin to reward success and say, \ncongratulations, a job well done and here is $100,000 to help you \ncontinue that good job.\n\n  Many of these schools are succeeding despite the odds because they \nhave bitten the bullet; they have made tough choices; they are making \ngood decisions at the local level. I think the most important thing we \nin the Federal Government can do is to begin acknowledging success and \nrewarding success.\n  That is what this amendment does. It also provides a small amount of \nmoney to help the States administer this very cost-effective program \nbecause it is a locally based initiative. It is a panel of their peers \nwho makes these choices. It would be a great way to spend this $1 \nbillion to reward these schools.\n  Madam President, that is simply what this amendment does. It is a \nblue ribbon school amendment. I think it will go a long way to \nencouraging schools that are beating the odds to continue to do so, and \nwe will reward them with something significant. So they can take that \n$100,000 and apply it to technology, teacher training, and other \nopportunities for students. And this is available, I want to stress, \nfor parochial and private schools, as well as public, within the \nconstitutional framework so that we are better reaching across all of \nthe Nation to many of the schools and doing it in a fair way. That is \nwhat my amendment does, and I offer it as a substitute.\n  In closing, let me say this is only 1 of 10 or 15 ways on which I \npersonally think it is better to spend this $1.5 billion, that will \nhave a longer and a greater impact on improving education than \nestablishing these savings accounts.\n  I did not get to speak on Senator Glenn's amendment, but I will just \nsay another way to spend this $1 billion would be to expand the IRA \nfrom $500 to $2,000, which he so eloquently talked about yesterday. It \nwould be another good way to have a positive effect in encouraging \npeople to save early for their children's college education, which is \nso expensive.\n  So with all due respect to my colleague from Georgia for all of the \ngood remarks he has made, there are just better ways to spend the \nmoney. This blue ribbon school amendment is only one, but I commend it \nand recommend it to this body to consider.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have now an opportunity to make a choice as we are \ngoing to vote on this measure, the Coverdell bill, which has been \nestimated to be $1.6 billion over the period of the next 10 years. We \nwill have a choice either this evening or tomorrow as to how we are \ngoing to expend those funds, whether they will be used primarily, as \nthe Tax Committee says, for private schools or, as I understand the \nSenator's amendment, to recognize excellence in schools all across this \ncountry as a result of local decisions that are being made by parents, \nlocal community decisions, and to give a financial reward. $100,000 is \na considerable reward, but I imagine, since these schools are \ndedicating themselves to improving and strengthening their academic \nachievements and accomplishments, those resources are going to be used \nto further student advancement, thereby giving some real meaning to the \nlocal initiatives to put excellence first in terms of public education.\n  So on the one hand we are going to have a choice for recognizing \nexcellence at the local level selected by peer review or the funds will \nbe primarily used in terms of private education. Do I understand it \ncorrectly?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, the Senator from Massachusetts understands this \ncorrectly and has articulated it very accurately. The reason that I am \nunable to support Senator Coverdell's proposal is because it is clear \nfrom the studies that the vast majority of the benefit would go to just \na small portion of those in parochial or private schools.\n  I believe that we need to be more balanced in our approach to help \nall of our schools and all of our families, as balanced as we can be, \nand not try to put one above the other.\n  So, this amendment gives funding to parochial schools, to private \nschools, and to public schools, based on their efforts to be excellent. \nAnd, as the Senator knows, sometimes against great odds, in very poor \ndistricts, these schools--many parochial schools--are doing a great \njob. I believe they should be rewarded within the framework of the \nConstitution, which is clearly appropriate with this program.\n  So it is my hope that the Senate and the Congress will strongly \nconsider this approach, because this is exactly what we need to be \ndoing, rewarding and encouraging success.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield further, I imagine, then, \nafter they are selected, hopefully these will be models within the \nlocal community? People will say, ``These schools have been selected \nbecause of their enhanced academic achievement and excellence. I wonder \nwhat they did right.'' Parents in neighboring communities will \nunderstand it, others will understand it, and hopefully, as a result of \nthese kinds of awards, it will be an incentive for replicating the \nkinds of decisions at the local level that have resulted in excellence. \nIs that the objective as well?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is the objective. If I could read into the Record \nthe way the schools are chosen now, it is if they are student focused \nand have great student support, if their standards are challenging and \ntheir curricula challenging, if they are teaching active learning, if \nthey have developed partnerships with their communities, and if they \nhave strong leadership. Those are just some of the measures that are \nused.\n  So, yes, the Senator is correct. As they receive their blue ribbons \nand their plaques, they are being honored now in our Nation and they \nare held up to high esteem. The problem is, they basically leave here \nemptyhanded, because we send them back with a plaque and a ribbon. I \nthink we need send them home with some money and some real help, to put \nour money where our mouth is and say, ``Good job; here's some money to \nhelp you continue to do that good job. You make us proud. You have done \nit against the odds.''\n  We want to be a more reliable partner. That is what I think the \ngreatness is with this amendment. There are other approaches we could \nuse, but this is, I think, getting us on the right track.\n  I thank the Senator, and I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator withhold the time, perhaps, just in \ncase we need respond?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes. I reserve the time in the event we need to \nrespond, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nproposed by the Senator from Louisiana. Both she and I agree on many \ndifferent issues. I will come to why I oppose the amendment itself. But \nlet me say that I do agree with her in her statement that it is \nimportant to reward excellence, and to reward it appropriately,\n\n[[Page S3416]]\n\nin terms of our Nation's schools. It is especially important when, \nclearly, what we are doing today is not accomplishing it in the \naggregate. We do need to identify particular schools, reward them, \nchange what they are doing, so we will improve the overall standards of \nall schools.\n  In Tennessee, there have been many schools that have received and \nearned the Blue Ribbon Schools Excellence in Education awards. I am \nproud of them, to go by and see them. They are given a Presidential \nCitation, a flag of excellence signifying that school's exemplary \nstatus.\n  I understand the Senator from Louisiana wants to expand on this \nnotion of honoring success, but to do so by having the schools receive \nnational financial rewards of $100,000.\n  We agree on many points, in terms of encouraging success, but we \ndiffer on one key element. The one key element, all of our colleagues \nmust be aware of, because it is key in this amendment, and that is that \nthis amendment has been offered as a result of the Senator's opposition \nto the Coverdell Savings Account A+ Act. As a result of this \nopposition, the proposed amendment would strike section 101 of the \nCoverdell bill. In effect, it is a poison pill to the Coverdell savings \naccount initiative.\n  As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Task Force on Education, I \nhave had the opportunity over the last 6 months to conduct hearings and \nto hear from people who are at schools, who run schools in the local \ncommunities. I have heard again and again how important it is--\nrepeatedly--that we must look for creative solutions, for innovation, \nto the problems that plague our Nation's schools. Senator Coverdell's \nplans for savings accounts is a good, positive first step. The proposed \namendment would gut that totally. I do not believe it is the final \nsolution, but the proposal does take us in that very important \ndirection of empowering that parent-child team.\n  I would like to just take a moment to highlight the provisions of the \nCoverdell bill which I believe make it an effective tool, a positive \ntool, in helping students and families across the country which, if \nthis amendment were to pass, the Coverdell advantages would go away. \nWhat does the Coverdell A+ Accounts do? We expand the education savings \naccounts in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 by increasing the annual \ncontribution limit for education IRAs from $500 to $2,000. The bill, \nvery importantly, expands the definition of what is qualified education \nexpenses. They are currently limited to higher education. The Coverdell \nbill expands it to K-12--K-12 expenses, the sort of expenses we have \nalready talked about.\n  It could be anything from equipment to computers to books to \nsupplies, or if you are an individual with a disability, to give you \nthe tools that you might not otherwise have so you can learn, \nhomeschooling expenses, uniforms, transportation costs--all of these \nwould be encompassed by the Coverdell bill. If the amendment by the \nSenator from Louisiana is agreed to instead of the Coverdell bill, they \nwill all go away. We all know that it is the parents, the parents who \nwant the very best for their children. I believe it is important--which \nthe Coverdell bill does--to encourage parents to invest in their \nchildren's education, to give them that opportunity, to lower the \nbarriers to do so, to give them the incentives to invest in their \nchildren.\n  The President signed into law on August 5, 1997, the Taxpayer Relief \nAct, which authorized new education IRAs. But that was just for higher \neducation, not K-12. I am fully supportive of every measure we can put \non the table helping families plan for higher education expenses. I \nalso believe this effort should be expanded to provide tax allowances \nfor what families spend on elementary and secondary education. That is \nnot allowed today but will be allowed under the Coverdell proposal.\n  While our colleges and universities are the very best in the world--\nand this was put before our task force committee again and again--the \nfoundation on which those colleges and universities rest is not sturdy; \nit is weak. In fact, our elementary and secondary schools are not the \nenvy of the world, unlike our colleges and universities.\n  In a recent TIMMS, the third, math and science study, scores show \njust how poorly our student are measuring up to their international \ncounterparts. I referred to this earlier. This is the 12th grade \nmathematics general knowledge achievement compared to 21 other \ncountries. You don't need to read the chart, but these are countries \nthat do better than us, such countries as Austria, Slovenia does better \nthan us, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland. Only 2 nations--these are the \nnations we do equal to--only 2 nations out of 21 do worse than the \nUnited States in the 12th grade mathematics. The same can be said of \nscience. So we are not doing, in K-12, anywhere near what we should be \ndoing.\n  Even our colleges and universities have to take on that additional \nburden by reteaching students that they receive. Approximately 30 \npercent of freshmen in college today require remedial course work. We \nneed to direct our attention to this K-12 foundation, which the \nCoverdell bill does.\n  Under current law, we assist parents, students, and families with \nnumerous tax allowances for higher education. We have HOPE and Lifetime \nLearning Savings. We have the education IRAs for higher education. We \nhave the State prepaid tuition programs. We have U.S. savings bonds. In \nterms of loans for students, we provide deductions for interest \npayments--all for higher education. We are the best in the world. Now \nis the time to look at K-12 education.\n  I would like to talk just very briefly about why I think a new \napproach is needed. By agreeing to the amendment that is proposed by \nthe Senator from Louisiana, again, we are gutting the Coverdell bill. \nIn essence, we are saying let's not change the system at all, that we \nare doing OK. That is in essence what this amendment is doing. Are we \ndoing OK? This chart basically shows, in science, trends in average \nscience scale scores over the last 20 years, going from 1970 on your \nleft to 1996 on the right. This is age 17, the purple line. The green \nline is age 13. The orange line is age 7. And the whole point is that, \nover the last 20 years, we are not improving at all.\n  I just compared globally; we are doing worse. Out of 21 nations, in \nthe 12th grade, only 2 nations did worse than us. So, in spite of all \n500 programs that we have today, in spite of spending about $74 billion \nat the Federal level, we are doing no better.\n  Beneath the surface of this whole disappointment of stagnant student \nperformance and despite a commitment of increased resources--and let me \nshow very briefly on this chart what we have been doing as a nation.\n  This is 1971 to 1997, about a 27-year period. This is how much we \nspend per pupil in adjusted dollars today. That is what the red line \nis, constant 1996-1997 dollars. What it shows is that in 1970 we were \nspending, in today's dollars, about $4,000. Today, we are spending \nabout 50 percent more, about $6,000. We have had a stagnant performance \nat the same time we have had increased expenditures.\n  A vote for the amendment by the Senator from Louisiana says, let's \nnot change the system, let's keep doing exactly what we are doing \ntoday--something with which I heartily disagree.\n  Beneath the surface of this whole disappointment that we see in terms \nof stagnant student performance, there is an acute crisis in our urban \nschools. One out of every four public school students are enrolled in \nan urban school district.\n  A recent report examining our urban schools noted:\n\n       It is hard to exaggerate the education crisis in America's \n     cities. Words like scandal, failure, corruption and despair \n     echo in the pages of the Nation's newspapers.\n\n  Another area of concern is the Federal component in the landscape of \nAmerican education. I show this chart again not so much to show the \ndetails, but this is a chart that was generated by the General \nAccounting Office. As the task force chairman, I basically found it can \nbe depicted by a chart like this, that we have today at the Federal \nlevel a sprawling and unfocused effort which suffers from a \nprogrammatic reluctance to ask itself what works and what doesn't work.\n  Over the last couple of days, we have said that we have heard again \nand again maybe one more program will help out. This basically shows, \namong three target groups--this happens to be teachers, and the various \ndepartments and various Federal programs are around the border--how \nthey influence\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\nteachers. Just walk away from it, and you see that this is a spider web \nalmost of unrelated programs all targeted at the individuals. There are \nover 500 such programs right now.\n  What we need to do, if anything, is to consolidate and to improve. We \ndo need to change. We do need to allow that creativity, to allow that \ninnovation. A vote for the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana guts \nthe Coverdell bill. It says, let's not change, let's not structurally \nimprove the system.\n  In the last few minutes, I talked about the disparity between the \nassistance we provide for higher education and elementary and secondary \neducation. I have shown the data which show our children are not at the \nlevel we need for them to be if we are to remain competitive in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  I talked a little bit about the need for creative solutions in our K-\n12 system, the sort of solutions that are offered in the Coverdell \nbill. I mentioned provisions in the bill of the Senator from Georgia \nwhich will enable the parent-child team--and that is what we need to \nstay focused on--to make important education decisions in the early \nyears.\n  Coming back to the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana, awarding \nschools is on the right track. It is a good approach. We need to \nrecognize success. I might add, we need to replicate that success as \nwell. I will say, as an alternative to the Coverdell bill, it is \ntotally unacceptable. Savings accounts are too important for families \nin Tennessee and all across this Nation. We simply cannot afford to \ndesert this effort, despite the merits of these other proposals. \nSavings accounts, bonds for school construction, State prepaid tuition, \nthe underlying Coverdell bill provides all of this. To replace that \nbill with a program that does recognize merit but does nothing more is \nsimply unsatisfactory.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment of the Senator from \nLouisiana and support the underlying bill. I reserve the remainder of \nmy time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Just for clarification, how much time remains on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 1 minute 50 \nseconds; the opposing side has 2 minutes 33 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I will use the remainder of my time to \nthank my distinguished colleague from Tennessee for agreeing that this \namendment is, in fact, on the right track and for saying that it is \nabout time we begin rewarding success and innovation, it is about time \nwe become a reliable partner with our local schools that are achieving, \ndespite sometimes great difficulty, and to begin rewarding them. I \nthank him for his comments.\n  I do not disagree with him as he laid out all of the problems \nassociated currently with our public and general education system in \nthe United States. No one in this Chamber disagrees with the sad \nstatistics about lack of achievement, lack of discipline, et cetera, \nalthough I want to say for the Record that there are many, many, many \ngood public schools, private and parochial schools in this Nation, of \nwhich we should be proud. The fact is that we need to have every one to \nbe excellent, but we are falling from the mark.\n  Let me, if I can, Madam President, in the 1 minute I have left, call \nto your attention one of the real failings of the Coverdell proposal.\n  In order to save money, obviously, you have to save it for a long \nperiod of time for it to generate any benefit to the saver. One of the \nproblems with setting aside $500 to begin using in kindergarten is that \nyou don't have the money set aside long enough for there to be a \nbenefit to a family. So what we are saying is a $30 benefit is not \nreally that great a benefit. There are so many better ways we can spend \nthis money to really improve education.\n  If we want to have a savings plan, which I would support, and prepaid \ncollege tuition, which is certainly one I support, then let's do some \nreal saving in this country. Let's really save $500 or $2,000, which is \npart of the Coverdell proposal that I do agree with. Let's set aside \nmoney, increase it--which is what Senator Glenn tried to do--from $500 \nto $2,000 a year to enable families, from when their child is 1, if \nthey save until 17 at a 6 percent yield, to save $60,000. If they \nreceived a 12 percent return, they could save over $110,000 \napproximately. Then you are talking about real money, and you are \ntalking about real benefit, and you are talking about real savings, and \nyou are talking about a Tax Code that really might work and do \nsomething good. If we had adopted John Glenn's amendment, this is what \npeople in America would be doing, and I would be proud to sign my name \nto it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I offer this for the Record and thank \nyou for letting me offer the blue ribbon school amendment and the long-\nterm savings amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I want to make it very clear that the \neducation savings accounts would inure to the benefit of 14 million \nAmerican families. The initial amount of money saved would be $5 \nbillion.\n  The example that the Senator from Louisiana offers doesn't really \npaint the picture. The $30 she talks about is, of course, averaging \neverybody out, and that is the interest only. She has forgotten that it \nis the interest on a lot of principal.\n  We have said from the outset, one of the surprises about this \neducation savings account is the tax relief involved over 5 years is \nonly a little over $500 million. But that little amount makes Americans \ndo big things. Because of that simple, small incentive, they go out and \nsave $5 billion to put behind education.\n  This blue-ribbon proposal would end up helping maybe 400 schools in \nAmerica. They would be schools that have been generally better off. \nWhat we are talking about is helping 14 million families deal with the \nsituation in all the schools that 20 million children attend. That \nmight be a school that would in no way be able to compete for one of \nthese excellence awards. Very few of your inner city schools could meet \nthese standards.\n\n  So what do you want, 400 schools that get $300,000 a year for the \nbuilding, or 14 million families and 20 million kids having an ability \nto buy a home computer or a tutor? To me, there is no decision to make \nhere. Do you want lots and lots of Americans opening up savings \naccounts trying to help their children with whatever the specific needs \nare, or do you want a specialized program that rewards the students in \n400 schools? That is fine, but as a substitute for what we are talking \nabout, there is no comparison.\n  Madam President, I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2302 To Amendment No. 2301\n\n    (Purpose: To amend section 6201 of the Elementary and Secondary \n  Education Act of 1965 to provide for student improvement incentive \n                    awards, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I rise to offer a second-degree amendment to the \nLandrieu amendment, and I send it to the desk for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2302 to amendment No. 2301.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, the current discussion on education \nin the United States has been widespread. Both sides of the debate, I \nbelieve, truly have the best interests of our Nation's young people at \nheart. It\n\n[[Page S3418]]\n\nhas been a good discussion, and I commend the Senator from Georgia, \nSenator Coverdell, for his leadership on this issue.\n  We often differ on issues of school choice, Federal involvement in \nthe classroom, and State flexibility. The amendment that I offer today \naddresses one of this Nation's educational needs while doing so in a \nmanner which should not be controversial. This is the student \nimprovement incentive grant program.\n  The amendment I am offering today is quite simple in its nature. \nUnder the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, States are given a \nlevel of flexibility with how to use some of those funds. My amendment \nprovides yet another option for States.\n  Under my amendment, States would be allowed to use some of their \nFederal education funds to provide awards to public high schools based \non the schools' performances on statewide assessment tests, the content \nand substance of which would be entirely up to the State.\n  There are several important elements to this proposal. First, this is \nnot a new program but merely a new option from which States may choose. \nSecond, the assessments would be based entirely on State priorities and \ndesires. Third, no new funds are required. Thus, my proposal gives \nStates a new way to create a healthy competition amongst public high \nschools without imposing new Federal requirements, additional Federal \noversight, or increasing Federal spending.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, approximately 2 months ago it was \nwidely reported in the media that high school students in the United \nStates scored well below their peers in an international exam in math \nand science. In fact, of the 21 nations involved, U.S. students ranked \n19th. In comparison, however, U.S. fourth graders performed strongly \nagainst their international peers on similar exams. Somewhere along the \nway we are failing our students by not encouraging them to maintain the \nhigh standards that they have demonstrated early in their academic \ncareers.\n  My amendment will help change this trend by creating financial \nincentives to encourage greater academic performance in our secondary \nschools. At the same time, it achieves this goal while leaving the \ncontrol over education where it belongs, in the State and local \ncommunities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the student improvement incentive \ngrant amendment.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Just a point of clarification. The hour of 3:45 has \narrived. I believe under a previous unanimous consent agreement, the \nSenate is about to proceed to a series of votes on amendments, \nbeginning with Senator Gorton's, and that there would be 2 minutes for \neach amendment equally divided.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Consideration of the pending amendment is \ntemporarily suspended.\n  The pending question will occur on the Gorton amendment No. 2293, as \namended. The Senator is correct that there will be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, then the remaining time on the \namendment offered by Senator Kempthorne would occur immediately \nfollowing the last vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2293, as amended\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, the Gorton-Frist amendment is based on \ntwo philosophical principles. The first of those principles is that the \npresent system under which 7 percent of the dollars going into \neducation come from the Federal Government, together with 50 percent of \nall of the rules and regulations under which that education is \nprovided, is not necessarily either in theory or in practice the best \nway to set policies for our public schools or to fund those public \nschools.\n  It is based also on the philosophy that parents and teachers and \nprincipals and superintendents and elected school board members all \nacross the United States not only care more about the children in their \ntrust but are better able to set the educational policies for their \nchildren in their schools than are bureaucrats in Washington, DC, or \neven Senators in the U.S. Senate.\n  The Gorton-Frist amendment, however, forces these two philosophical \ndistinctions or principles on no one. Under this amendment, any State \nthat likes the present system of Federal control is authorized to \nretain it. Any State that believes educational policy should be set at \nthe State capital through a State school board or Governor or State \nsuperintendent of public instruction is free to adopt such a system. \nAnd any State that believes, as we do, that local control and local \nspending policies are best, is free to adopt that policy.\n  We also guarantee that no State will lose money under this amendment. \nI commend it to the President and to the Members of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I agree with the Senator from \nWashington that if the State wants to tax its own people and do \nwhatever it wants to, it should have the ability to do it. If the local \ncommunity wants to tax its people, they ought to be able to do whatever \nthey want. But what Senator Gorton is saying is, we are going to use \nFederal taxpayers' money, the money that is directed by the Congress.\n  We have designated three very important areas that are eliminated by \nthe amendment of the Senator from Washington.\n  First, drug-free schools. I do not find any parents from \nMassachusetts saying, ``Abolish drug-free schools.'' The Gorton \namendment will abolish it.\n  Secondly, for the training of teachers in math and science, I do not \nfind parents saying, ``We ought to abolish that program.'' The Gorton \namendment does it.\n  And third, in terms of raising high academic standards, the programs \nthat help and assist local schools to be able to do it, I do not find \nparents in my State saying, ``Abolish that program.'' It will be \nabolished by the Gorton amendment.\n  It makes no sense, Madam President. And there is no accountability \nunder the Gorton amendment how these funds are being spent and what the \neffect of it is in improving academic achievement and accomplishment. \nTo do it after 30 minutes of debate makes no sense whatsoever. I hope \nthat the amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question now occurs \non agreeing to the Gorton amendment No. 2293, as amended. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The question now occurs on the Hutchinson \namendment No. 2296. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided prior to the vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nvote in this series of four be limited to 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this is a dollars-for-the-classroom amendment that \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that we will do our best to ensure \nthat 95 cents out of every dollar actually gets to the classroom where \nthe needs are the greatest. Unfortunately, studies indicate that right \nnow as little as 65 cents of every Federal education dollar actually \ngets down to the classroom. Where does it go? Much of it goes to \nbureaucracies, Federal and State. We have 307 Federal education \nprograms.\n  This simply says let's give 95 cents out of every dollar to the \nclassroom. That will be $2,000 per classroom for every classroom in \nAmerica--additional money that the teachers and the local school boards \ncan determine how it should be spent. It maximizes local control. \nStates' needs are different. To say 100,000 teachers or to say let's \nspend Federal dollars for construction isn't the wisest approach. It is \nbetter to let those decisions be made locally where the needs differ \nacross the country.\n  The question on this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is, Are you for \nbureaucrats, or are you for books? I think we want it to go to the \nclassroom. Let's support this sense of the Senate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, those who support the education programs, \ntitle I and other programs that will be affected, want the greatest \namount of money to go to the local classrooms. So we support this \nmeasure. We have no problem whatsoever in supporting this measure. It \nis supported by the administration and by the Department of Education. \nWe want to make sure that as much of the funds as possible go right \ninto the classroom. We are absolutely in support of it. We hope the \namendment will pass overwhelmingly.\n  When the Senator initially offered his amendment, it provided not \nonly for this measure but to eliminate the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Washington. Now the Senator from Washington will have a chance to \nhave her amendment voted on.\n  I hope all of our Members will support this measure. It makes good \nsense. We all want the resources to go into the classroom for the \nbenefit of the children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas.

Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided before the vote.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment before us is very simple. It merely asks us to go on \nrecord as to whether or not we Members of the Senate believe we should \nsupport efforts to decrease class size in the early grades.\n  As a parent of a child in public education, two children who have \ngone through our public schools, as a former school board member, as a \nmember of the PTA, as a former educator myself who has been in the \nclassroom, who knows the difference between having 18 young 4-year-olds \nor 24 4-year-olds, who knows the difference between teaching and crowd \ncontrol, I will tell the Members of this Senate that decreasing class \nsize is one of the most important things we can do to increase the \neducation for our young children. Every Member here has talked about \nthe need for increased math skills, the need for our young children to \nbe able to read and write and have the skills they need. If we decrease \nclass size, every parent in this country will tell you that it will \nmake a difference. Studies show it. Parents know it. Teachers know it. \nIt is time for this Senate to recognize that and move, on our part, \nwith our responsibility, to decrease class size. I urge the adoption of \nthis amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this amendment calls for 100,000 new \nteachers paid for at the Federal level. It is an endorsement of the \nPresident's proposal. I reluctantly oppose it. Mr. President, 79 \npercent of the teachers in Arkansas are satisfied with class size, 65 \npercent of the teachers nationwide are satisfied with their class \nsizes. It is wrong to have a one-size-fits-all approach on the Federal \nlevel. We may need more teachers in some States, but we may not need \nthem in others. So I believe this is an area States are already \naddressing,\n  California and many other States have adopted programs to reduce \nclass size. It is not something the Federal Government needs to get \ninvolved in. It has a $7 billion price tag. Those funds can be better \nused, and more wisely used, in other areas. So I ask my colleagues to \noppose this sense-of-the-Senate resolution endorsing the 100,000 \nteacher, $7 billion expansion of the Federal role in public school \neducation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question occurs on \nthe Murray amendment, No. 2295.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this amendment prohibits Federal funding \nfor national testing in our schools unless there is explicit \ncongressional authority for such funding, so that no funding of the \nFederal Government could be used to supply or provide for national \ntests unless the Congress specifically authorized it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel of Nebraska be added as an \noriginal cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I believe the fundamental opportunity in education and \nthe opportunity for achievement by children relates to the involvement \nof parents in education. Whenever we begin to dictate curriculum from \nWashington, with a national test which will ultimately define \ncurriculum, we will have lost the genius of America's education system, \nwhich is local involvement in schools, parental involvement.\n  For that reason, I believe this amendment should be adopted. I am \npleased that Senator Lott has been in support of this amendment. I am \npleased that a number of other individuals are supporting it strongly \nand am glad to have the cosponsorship of Senator Hagel. I urge its \nadoption.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Nickles be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last November, 5 months ago, we worked \nout a bipartisan compromise. It received 87 votes here. It called for \nthe National Academy of Sciences to do a study about the possibility of \nlinking various State tests and commercial tests and called on this \nNational Assessment Governing Board, an independent board, to go ahead \nand develop some test questions. And essentially it set up a procedure \nwe could look at. It also prohibited the use of any funds for field \ntesting or pilot testing, anything in this fiscal year.\n  This amendment would gut all of that, would say the National Academy \nneeds to stop in its tracks, it cannot complete its work. It would say \nthat the National Assessment Board has to stop what it is doing and \nbreach its contract.\n  Later this year, in the appropriations cycle, we should revisit this \nissue and decide at that point whether to allow field testing. But we \nshould not be prohibiting continued study of the issue and development \nof questions by the National Board at this point. So I urge colleagues \nto oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  All time has expired.\n  The question now occurs on agreeing to the Ashcroft amendment No. \n2300. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Abraham pertaining to the introduction of S. 1970 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a very important education bill \nbefore us today. It builds upon the education savings accounts enacted \nlast year. It expands the amount of money that can be saved and expands \nits uses to include K-12.\n  About 14 million individuals are expected to sign up for these \naccounts by the year 2002. Contributions can be saved to cover college \nexpenses or used when needed to pay for a wide range of education \nexpenses during a student's elementary and high school years. Examples \nof eligible expenses include text books, computers, school uniforms, \ntutoring, advanced placement college credits, home schooling, after-\nschool care and college preparation courses.\n  A tutor can make the difference between success or a student falling \nhopelessly behind.\n  A computer can open the world to a child. Children growing up in \nhomes with computers will be the achievers. I am afraid children \ngrowing up in homes without computers will be at a disadvantage. This \nbill will allow money from an education savings account to be sent on a \ncomputer, software, lessons on how to use the computer.\n  The bill has several solid worthwhile provisions.\n  It raises the limits on annual contributions to an education IRA from \n$500 to $2,000 per year, and allows accounts to be used for K-12 \nexpenses. The bill allows parents or grandparents to make the \ncontribution in after-tax money each year.\n  The accounts would grow with interest, and withdrawals for \neducational expenses would be tax-free. A+ accounts, as under current \nlaw, are targeted to middle income taxpayers. Eligibility phases out \nbeginning at $95,000\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\nfor individuals and $150,000 for joint filers. Under these terms almost \nall New Mexicans would be eligible to set up one of these accounts.\n  The bill allows parents to purchase contracts that lock-in tomorrow's \ntuition costs at today's prices. This bill would make these savings \ncompletely tax-free.\n  Families purchasing plans would pay no federal income tax on interest \nbuild-up. Under current law, state-run programs allowed tax-deferred \nsavings for college. However, savings in such plans, when withdrawn, \nare taxable as income to the student. This provision would benefit 1 \nmillion students.\n  Twenty-one states have created tuition plans. New Mexico has not yet \nimplemented one but it does have a proposal under consideration. If the \nstate finalizes its pre-paid tuition plan future students would be able \nto benefit. Pre-paid tuition plans are a great way to secure the \nfuture.\n  The bill extends through 2002, the exclusion for employers who pay \nfor their employees' tuition and expands the program to cover graduate \nstudents beginning in 1998. The exclusion allows employers to pay up to \n$5,250 per year for educational expenses to benefit employees without \nrequiring the employees to declare that benefit as income and pay \nfederal income tax on the benefit. One million workers, including \n250,000 graduate students, would benefit from a tax-free employer-\nprovided education assistance provision.\n  The bill also creates a new category of exempt facility bonds \nfor privately-owned and publicly operated elementary and secondary \nschool construction high growth areas. The bill makes $3 billion in \nschool construction bonds over five years. This is enough to build 500 \nelementary schools.\n\n  I am pleased that the bill includes the amendment to provide new \ngrants to states that (1) test K-12 teachers for proficiency in the \nsubject area they teach and (2) has a merit based teacher compensation \nsystem.\n  In line with my belief that teacher competence is key to improving \nAmerican education, this bill creates incentives for states to \nestablish teacher and merit pay policies.\n  I believe the best teachers should be rewarded for their efforts to \neducate our children. A little competition in our public schools would \nbe a good thing for rewarding those teachers who excel at their \nprofession and motivating those who may need to improve their \nperformance.\n  This is but one step forward in our bid to improve the educational \nperformance of American students. This amendment supports the principle \nthat all children deserve to be taught by well-educated, competent and \nqualified teachers.\n  I hope the Senate will complete its work quickly on this bill and \nthat the President will sign it.\n  The MERIT amendment would use the Eisenhower Professional Development \nProgram (Title II) to provide incentive funds to states that establish \nperiodic assessments of elementary and secondary school teachers, \nincluding a pay system to reward teachers based on merit and proven \nperformance.\n  The legislation would not reduce current funding for the Eisenhower \nProfessional Development Program. Incentives will be provided to states \nthat establish teacher testing and merit pay programs. The amendment \npermits the use of Federal education dollars to establish and \nadminister these programs.\n  The Eisenhower program, established in 1985, gives teachers and other \neducational staff access to sustained and high-quality professional \ndevelopment training. In 1998, the Congress approved $28.3 million, $10 \nmillion more than in 1997, for the Eisenhower program to provide in-\nservice training for teachers in core subject areas.\n  The President requested $50 million for the Eisenhower program in \n1999, an increase of $26.7 million above the $28.3 million provided in \n1998. New Mexico received $2.4 million in 1997 for all 89 school \ndistricts. The President funds his 1999 request at the expense of Title \nVI, Innovative Program Strategies, which New Mexico also heavily \nutilizes. He requests no funding for this program, which received $350 \nmillion in 1998.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I announce that the order of business \nis to complete the Coats amendment. The author, Senator Coats, is here. \nI talked to the other side. We have some Senators who want to offer \nsome proposals of their own not related to this legislation. But if we \ncould--everybody is in agreement--we can proceed with the Coats \namendment.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator from Indiana withhold for just a moment?\n  We have now allowed several minutes to introduce a bill. Then we are \ngoing back to an amendment that should be on this bill. Then we have \nothers here who would like to speak for up to 30 or 35 minutes. I think \nwe are going to have to have some sort of an agreement on how it is \ngoing to work. Is this the only debate for amendments?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. There are two others.\n  Mr. FORD. Are they here?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. They are not here. If we could facilitate Senator \nCoats, we can go to Senator Feingold.\n  Mr. FORD. With the understanding that it is approximately 35 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I understand.\n  Mr. FORD. Just so there is no misunderstanding, we are all on the \nsame wavelength.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We are on the same wavelength.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the chairman and the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senator Coats is \nrecognized to speak for 2 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2297\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, what is the time situation on this \nparticular amendment? We were in the midst of offering it. We set it \naside. There is some time remaining. I would like to know what time is \nremaining under the original amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). When the bill was set aside, the \nSenator from Indiana had 2 minutes remaining on the time, and the \nopposition had 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I reserve that 2 minutes. There is someone \non the opposing side who wants to begin using their 15 minutes. This is \nobviously the time. Perhaps if there is no opposition----\n  Mr. FORD. I am certain there will be opposition. Mr. President, I am \nhere to try to help facilitate this. I don't know who will be here. I \nam under the impression we will have somebody who will oppose it. But \nas of now it is like on the other side. The other two Members are not \nhere to oppose it either, I don't imagine. We have 30 minutes to work \nit out.\n  I suggest that since the Senator from Indiana only has 2 minutes \nleft, we will wait to see if we can find somebody to use up our 15, and \nthe Senator could have 2 minutes tomorrow.\n  Mr. COATS. I think it was well-understood by everybody involved in \nthis amendment that I would offer it immediately after the stacked \nvotes. I am here prepared to finish up my time. I would like to get it \ndone, because my schedule is not going to allow me to wait for 35 \nminutes while someone does morning business.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator may proceed. If there is no one here, I will \nyield back our time and then the Senator can have it voted on within \nthe stacked votes in the morning.\n  Mr. COATS. I will be happy to do that. Mr. President, I will use up \nthe last 2 minutes.\n  Very briefly, I do not think this amendment is all that \ncontroversial. It simply provides an extra incentive for individuals or \norganizations that want to make charitable contributions to scholarship \nfunds which would provide scholarships for low-income children for \neducational purposes. As such, we are just simply offering an \nadditional deduction of 10 percent for that specific purpose. I \noutlined earlier the basis for that and the reasons why we need to do \nthat. I believe it complements the bill we are dealing with. The \ncurrent bill addresses essentially middle income and above taxpayers. \nThis goes to low-income taxpayers, and it gives them an opportunity to \nprovide the kind of education they think is appropriate for their \nchildren.\n  I hope my colleagues will accept it. The cost is offset by changes in \nthe Tax Code which have been approved by the Finance Committee. There \nis no controversy there. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the \namendment when the vote occurs tomorrow morning.\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum on the 15 \nminutes on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I yield the balance of time in opposition to \nthe Coats amendment. I understand the change is offset. Most people are \nhappy with it. Therefore, there is no opposition at the moment. I am \nsure some will vote against it, but I yield whatever time this side \nmight have. It is my understanding that we now go to Senator Feingold \nfor a statement as if in morning business.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized under \nthe previous order.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3410-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3423-S3426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in late February the Senate considered \ncampaign finance reform on the floor of the Senate for the second time \nin this Congress. Once again, we did not resolve the issue. Although a \nclear majority of this body now supports the McCain-Feingold bill, a \ndetermined minority once again prevented it from being adopted.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today to try to put \nour debate in some perspective. This is a particularly good time to \nrevisit the issue because of what has been happening just in the past \nfew days in the other body, in the House of Representatives. In fact, \nthe latest development on the other side of the Capitol has made it \nvery clear that the defenders of the current system are on the run, and \ncampaign finance reform is very much alive.\n  Last fall, the Speaker of the House promised an open debate on \ncampaign finance reform by the end of March. The other body, of course, \nis supposed to be the place where the majority can work its will. There \nis no filibuster rule in the House of Representatives--in effect, no \nrequirement that you have to get a three-fifths majority to pass \nlegislation, as has long been the case in the Senate.\n  At the end of March, when a bipartisan majority began to clearly \ncoalesce behind the McCain-Feingold bill, or the Shays-Meehan bill as \nit is called in the other body, the House leadership and other \nopponents of reform began looking for a way out. The House leadership \ndecided to bring up campaign finance reform under suspension of the \nrules. That is a procedure that is usually used to allow \nnoncontroversial bills to pass quickly. It was used here for a very \ndifferent purpose. It allows very limited debate and no amendments, and \nit requires a two-thirds vote for passage.\n  So the leadership of the other body brought up its own campaign \nfinance bill under the suspension procedure that would guarantee, in \neffect, the defeat of its own bill. In the end, this bill of the \nleadership of the House got only 74 votes, and 337 Members of the House \nvoted no.\n  Let's think about that. The major campaign finance bill offered by \nthe chairman of the committee of jurisdiction received only 74 votes in \nthe House of Representatives. The Democrats in the House were not even \nallowed to offer a substitute, which is customary in the other body. \nAnd here is the kicker. The main bipartisan reform bill which, by all \naccounts, actually had majority support in the House, did not even get \na vote. The leadership of the House did everything in its power to make \nsure that the McCain-Feingold bill would not pass, and they succeeded, \nbut only temporarily.\n  Supporters of reform in the House were understandably outraged. Just \nas the opponents of reform in this body relied on a filibuster and on \nparliamentary tactics such as filling the amendment tree to prevent a \nbipartisan majority from passing McCain-Feingold, opponents of reform \nin the House, the body that is supposed to reflect the will of \nmajority, in effect rigged the procedure to make sure that reformers \ndid not even get a vote on their bill.\n  Tactics of this kind can work for a while, but they cannot work \nforever. The American people are tired of tricks and tactics. They are \ntired of a partisan minority stopping the bipartisan majority from \nenacting reform. And now there are clear signs that public outrage over \nthese kinds of tactics is having an effect. In the other body, \nreformers gathered 205 signatures on a discharge petition that would \nrequire the other body to consider campaign finance reform under a fair \nand open procedure. They needed just 13 more Members of the House to \nsign the discharge petition to force the issue to the House floor \ndespite the opposition of the leadership. This would have been almost \nunprecedented.\n  It is clear that Members of the Congress are feeling the heat. Five \nMembers agreed to sign the petition over the recess after they heard \nfrom their constituents how important it is to have a real vote on \nreform in the House this year, and four more announced in the last 2 \ndays they will sign the petition.\n  Mr. President, what we found out today is that the leadership in the \nHouse reconsidered its hard line position because a meltdown was \noccurring. I was informed just a little bit earlier that there has been \nan announcement that the leadership of the other body will now bring \ncampaign finance reform back to the House floor by May 15, and this \ntime there at least supposedly is going to be an open rule and a \nbipartisan bill will get a vote.\n  This is very good news, and I congratulate the bipartisan reformers \nin the House for their persistence and effectiveness. They have shown \nthat the will of the people can prevail if only we in the Congress have \nthe courage to fight for it. If the House passes a bipartisan bill in \nthe next few weeks, fortunately, the spotlight will come back here \nagain.\n\n  The distinguished majority leader of our body was asked on Monday, \nwhat will he do if the House passes McCain-Feingold? His answer? \n``Nothing.'' And everyone laughed. I don't think they are laughing \ntoday, because the reformers in the House have succeeded in their \neffort to force a fair vote. We will see if the American people will \nstand for this kind of obstructionism if a bill comes back from the \nHouse. I do not think they will. I think the Senate will have to deal \nwith this issue again this year and soon.\n  So I can say to the American people today as I have before, this \nfight is not over. The opponents of reform may be winning these \nparliamentary battles, but they are losing the legislative war. The \nAmerican people know that our current system must be changed. A \nmajority of this Senate, and now of the House, knows that our current \nsystem must be changed. Sooner or later, we will prevail. I am \nabsolutely certain of that.\n  I have spent a great deal of time reviewing the debate on campaign \nfinance reform from both this past February and last fall. As most \npeople who watched the debate know, there was a lot of argument on this \nfloor about whether the first amendment to the Constitution would be \nviolated by the provisions of our bill in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment \ndealing with so-called issue advocacy by outside groups. I think these \narguments based on the Constitution were grossly exaggerated and they \nwill be shown to be inaccurate over time in the context of the actual \nstate of constitutional law.\n  But there were a lot of other things said about our bill, a lot of \nother justifications offered for killing reform, and today I want to \nconcentrate on what I call the three worst excuses for voting against \nthe bipartisan McCain-Feingold bill. These arguments simply do not hold \nwater. And since we will be back sooner or later--and I suspect \nsooner--to discuss these matters, let me say a bit about them today.\n  Here is the first poor excuse for voting against our bill. We heard \ntime and time again, both last fall and last February, that we do not \nneed changes in the law, we just have to enforce the current law. Now, \nthat gave the opponents the opportunity to excoriate the Clinton \nadministration for its fundraising excesses in 1996 and to try to dodge\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\nresponsibility as Senators to try to clean up the system.\n  But I have a number of responses. First, we have to remember that the \nMcCain-Feingold bill actually had a whole lot of provisions that were \ndesigned to specifically deal with the alleged lawbreaking of the last \nelection. Our bill makes it perfectly clear that fundraising for \nFederal campaigns cannot take place on Federal property. In other \nwords, no more ``no controlling legal authority,'' no more debate about \nwhether dialing for dollars from your office is OK if you are asking \nfor soft money rather than hard money. Under our bill, you cannot use \nyour office, which is paid for by the taxpayers to raise money. Period.\n  In the McCain-Feingold bill, we also ban all foreign money from U.S. \nelections first by banning all soft money contributions to political \nparties. The legislation would prohibit any source, foreign or \ndomestic, from contributing these unlimited and unregulated amounts of \nmoney to the national political party. But our bill also makes clear \nthat foreign nationals are prohibited from making any sort of campaign \nexpenditure--coordinated with a candidate or party or an independent \nexpenditure--in connection with any Federal, State, or local election.\n  So while we will not put people in jail with this legislation or \nforce prosecution of lawbreakers, we can make absolutely sure that the \nloopholes, or alleged loopholes, in the law that those accused of \nwrongdoing have fallen back on will, in fact, be permanently closed.\n  But beyond that, we reject the notion that the scandals we saw in \n1996 were just due to lawbreaking. They were due to problems with the \nlaw itself. The biggest scandal stems not from what is illegal today \nbut from what is perfectly legal--soft money.\n  Let me put it this way. Why was the White House charging $100,000 a \nnight for a night in the Lincoln bedroom? Why did coffee with the \nPresident or dinners with key leaders of the Congress cost people some \n$50,000? Because it is legal to contribute $50,000 or $100,000 or even \nmore to a political party in this country. Unless we change that law, \nthe ever-increasing demand for money will lead our party leaders to \nstretch the bounds of propriety. We have to take responsibility. We \nhave to do our part as lawmakers.\n  What about the huge amounts of money spent by groups on so-called \nissue ads that looked just like campaign ads but fell just outside the \nboundaries of the Federal election law? That is not a problem with \nillegal activities. It is a problem with the law, and we need to \naddress it.\n  Mr. President, poor excuse No. 2 for opposing bipartisan reform. I \nheard a lot of people who oppose McCain-Feingold say that what we \nreally need to do to solve the campaign finance issue is to have full \nand instantaneous disclosure of contributions and spending. My first \nresponse to that argument is that McCain-Feingold includes the most \nextensive disclosure provisions of any campaign finance legislation \nintroduced in the Senate in this Congress. But not a single Senator who \nargued against this bill and said that disclosure is what we really \nneed would even acknowledge the important disclosure provisions in our \nbill.\n  What does it do? We require all candidates to file their disclosure \nreports electronically and require the FEC to post this information on \nthe Internet within 24 hours of its receipt.\n  We prohibit campaigns from depositing campaign contributions of over \n$200 into their treasuries until all required disclosure information \nhas been collected. We step up the reporting of independent \nexpenditures in the closing days of the campaign. We even lower the \nreporting threshold for campaign contributions from $200 to $50, and we \nrequire political advertisements to carry a tag line identifying who is \nresponsible for the content of the advertising.\n  These provisions are very important and they are helpful and they do \na great job, but they are not enough in themselves to restore the \npublic's faith in our system and in us. We already know that $262 \nmillion in soft money was contributed to the national political parties \nin 1996. We already know that Philip Morris gave over $3 million in \nsoft money in the 1996 cycle, and that RJR Nabisco, Joseph Seagram & \nSons, Atlantic Richfield, and AT all gave over $1 million. Federal \nExpress gave almost a million.\n  It is still a scandal that the tobacco companies did contribute \nmillions of dollars to our political parties while the Congress is \nconsidering extraordinarily important legislation that will decide the \nfate of that industry and of the children that its product kills, even \nif those contributions are disclosed. It is interesting that some of \nthe same Senators who proclaim the miracle benefits of disclosure are \nunwilling to bring under the Federal election laws the activities of \nsecretive groups funded by wealthy donors that run ads attacking \ncandidates in the last weeks of the campaign.\n  So disclosure is not the answer. It is an answer, but it is not the \nanswer.\n  How can we really expect a lot of hard-working Americans, many of \nwhom do not even have a computer, to spend their free time examining \nFEC reports to make sure that we are not under the influence of special \ninterest contributions? Who are we kidding with this idea that full \ndisclosure alone will solve all our problems? Most people do not know \nwho the richest people in America are and who they work for. Most \npeople do not know what legislative agenda is pursued by the PACs that \nfund our campaigns. Most people will not be able to recognize a \npotentially corrupting contribution from just some name on a report.\n  So we still need reasonable limits on contributions. We still need a \nban on soft money. We still need to outlaw fundraising on Federal \nproperty. We still need to address the phony issue ads of unknown \norigin that attack candidates in the last day of a campaign and simply \navoid the Federal election laws. Disclosure is a great thing and I am \nproud that our bill includes some tough new provisions, but disclosure \nalone is not the answer.\n  One very interesting thing about our debate last fall was that very \nfew of the opponents of our bill ever wanted to discuss the central \nfeature of our bill--a ban on soft money. I do not blame the opponents \nof our bill for not wanting to discuss it. Soft money is an \nembarrassment to the American political system. It should shame the \ndefenders of the status quo. Soft money was at the very heart of the \nscandals of 1996. But a few hearty souls have ventured out onto the \nfloor to defend soft money. I want to take my remaining time to address \ntheir arguments. They have given the absolute worst excuse for opposing \nour bill--that the soft money ban is either unconstitutional or a bad \nidea.\n\n  Soft money is the mother of all loopholes. It is the most ingenious \nmoney laundering scheme in American history. Corporations and labor \nunions are prohibited from giving money directly to candidates. It has \nbeen that way for most of the century. Instead, what they do is they \ngive the money to the candidate's party. That means, instead of having \nto use a PAC, the corporation can reach into its shareholders' moneys \nand a union can reach into its members' dues.\n  The sky is truly the limit for these contributions. You can give \n$5,000, you can give $50,000, you can give $500,000. There is no reason \nunder this loophole why you could not give the party $5 million by \nyourself. There are no limits on soft money--none at all.\n  This laundering scheme allows the parties to dump tens of millions of \nunregulated dollars into congressional elections and into Presidential \nelections. Just last fall the Republican Party ran an unprecedented \nissue ad campaign in the special congressional election for the seat \nvacated by former Representative Susan Molinari of New York. The party \nreportedly spent $800,000 on ads attacking the Democratic candidate for \nthat office. Much of that money was soft money, money that is supposed \nto be illegal in Federal elections.\n  In the 1996 cycle, the two political parties raised and spent over \n$262 million in soft money. That is $262 million that was raised and \nspent completely outside of the scope of Federal election law.\n  The trend with respect to soft money is frightening. In 1992, the two \nparties raised and spent a combined $86 million in soft money. In just \n4 years, that has gone from $86 million to $262 million. It tripled in \njust 4 years. And this year, even with the scandals and the very sharp \nattention to the issue, the money\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\nmachine just keeps churning away. The FEC just announced that the \nparties raised $74 million in 1997, the most money ever raised in an \noff-election year, and more than twice as much as they raised in 1993, \nthe year after the 1992 Presidential election.\n  Those are just the overall amounts of soft money, and the numbers are \ntruly staggering. But what is most troubling about the soft money \nsystem is the shameless solicitation of these multi-hundred-thousand \ndollar contributions from corporations, labor unions, and wealthy \nindividuals.\n  Both political parties are offering big contributors special access \nto high-ranking Government officials in exchange for a $100,000, \n$250,000, or a $500,000 contribution. Maybe you get to sit at the head \ntable with the President. Maybe you get to have a special meeting with \na congressional committee chairman. Maybe you get to participate in a \ntrade mission to a foreign land.\n  But let's not pretend that someone is making a $500,000 contribution \npurely in the interest of good government and good democracy. Just this \npast year Philip Morris, facing the growing challenge of lawsuits \naround the country and possible congressional action on tobacco \nlegislation, gave another $450,000 to the Republican Party and $60,000 \nto the Democrats. What is that all about? I think we know what it is \nall about.\n  Remember Roger Tamraz, one of the most colorful characters to appear \nbefore Senator Thompson's investigation last year? When asked if he \nfelt he got his money's worth for his $300,000 contribution, Tamraz \ntold the Government Affairs Committee that next time he would give \n$600,000. When asked if one of the reasons he made the contribution was \nto get special access, Tamraz responded by saying it wasn't one of the \nreasons, it was the only reason.\n  Mr. President, there is massive public support for a ban on soft \nmoney. Three former Presidents, over 200 former Members of Congress, \ncountless editorial boards across the country, and even many people in \nthe business community want to end this disgrace. Therefore, I am not \nsurprised that virtually no one who is opposed to our legislation has \nstepped forward to offer a defense of this shameful system.\n  How can anyone defend a system that rewards the Roger Tamraz's of the \nworld? How can anyone defend the $500,000 contributions flowing into \nFederal elections and the auctioning off of special access to high-\nranking Government officials?\n  What do the few supporters of this corrupt and corrupting system say? \nWell, a number of Senators complained that banning soft money would \n``federalize all elections.'' One even argued that the Supreme Court in \nBuckley had actually permitted the use of soft money by the political \nparties, and somehow enhanced its legitimacy in the Colorado case.\n  Actually, the Colorado case concerned hard money expenditures made by \nthe parties, supposedly independent of its candidates. The Court did \nmention soft money, but assumed that it may not be used to influence \nFederal elections. The whole reason we need to ban soft money is that \nit is abundantly clear that it is being used to influence Federal \nelections. That is why 126 legal scholars wrote us to say that it would \nclearly be constitutional to ban soft money.\n  As for federalizing all elections, that argument is like the one made \nby a Senator who is worried that banning soft money will hurt State \nparties. He complained that State parties will have to use hard money \nfor voter registration and things like bumper stickers and buttons. The \nsoft money provision in McCain-Feingold does allow the State parties to \ncontinue to raise money from corporations and unions if their States \nallow it, but not for Federal election activities. They can use soft \nmoney for voter registration up to 4 months before a Federal election.\n  They can use soft money, non-Federal money to support State \ncandidates. They just can't use it to run these ads that mention \nFederal candidates.\n  That is not ``federalizing all elections.'' That is just making sure \nthat money that would be illegal, if given to candidates, cannot be \nused to benefit their elections by doing an end run around the Federal \nelection laws. What use is prohibiting the national parties from \nraising and spending this illegal money if it can simply be diverted to \nState parties to turn around and do exactly the same thing with it?\n  Mr. President, there were a few opponents of McCain-Feingold who had \nthe candor last fall to admit that, of course, Congress can \nconstitutionally ban soft money. The Senator from Washington, Senator \nGorton, and the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, both fine \nlawyers, indicated that that was their position. But they argued that \nwe shouldn't do it because it would hurt the political parties and \ncreate an ``imbalance'' in the system. They fear that without soft \nmoney, parties would be ineffective, and the most irresponsible ads, \nthe ones run by independent groups, would be encouraged.\n  That is a pretty interesting argument. These Senators appear \nunwilling to address the evasion of the election laws by outside \norganizations, unwilling even to try to craft a provision dealing with \nthe phony issue ads and let the Supreme Court finally address the issue \nadvocacy versus express advocacy problem by letting the Court know what \nthe Congress thinks the law should be and then, because they don't like \nthese unaccountable ads, which they themselves refuse to do anything \nabout, they want to leave open the biggest and most objectionable \nloophole of all in our Federal election law today--soft money.\n  Our great political parties and, indeed, our political system are \nsoiled by this soft money system. We ought to be racing to get rid of \nit. We ought to be trying to clean up our reputation. We ought to try \nto redeem ourselves in the eyes of the American people.\n  Are we really going to take the position, as we head into the 1998 \nelections, that our political parties, with their rich and important \nhistories in this country, cannot thrive, cannot survive, without soft \nmoney? Are the parties so divorced from what real people want that they \nhave to rely for their financial support on huge contributions from \ncorporations and wealthy individuals who seek special access to pursue \ntheir own special interests?\n  I, Mr. President, am one who believes that the parties can survive \nwithout soft money. They did it up until the late 1980s. Remember, the \nlaw permits the parties to raise up to $20,000 per year in hard money \nfrom each contributor. But the parties have gotten lazy. They don't \nlike having to raise money piece by piece, $20,000 by $20,000, voter by \nvoter. They would rather hold dinners at big Washington hotels, send \nout invitations to lobbyists promising special access and then just sit \nback and collect a few big soft money checks. They are addicted to \nthese huge sums of money and the nasty attack ads they can buy if the \nparty lawyers are clever enough in how they spend the money.\n  That is right, Mr. President, I don't think our political parties are \nworth supporting anymore if they don't have anything to offer except \nfancy fundraisers for corporate lobbyists. If they can no longer appeal \nto the people of this country to fund their legitimate activity, maybe \ntheir time has come and gone. That is why protecting the political \nparties' ability to raise soft money is the very worst excuse for \nopposing the McCain-Feingold bill. It simply admits that our political \nsystem has utterly failed; that our parties are bankrupt morally and \nintellectually, even if they have full bank accounts; that our \nrepresentative democracy has become a corporation democracy, where the \namount of power you have depends on how much money you have.\n  I refuse to accept the judgment that we are doomed to have this kind \nof campaign finance system in America, the greatest democracy on Earth. \nThat is why I am still fighting for campaign finance reform in this \nCongress. If the opportunity presents itself, if it looks like more of \nmy colleagues are ready to reject the excuses--and I suspect there will \nbe more--I will be ready to bring the McCain-Feingold bill, or any \nportion of it, before this Senate again.\n  I think the American people should know where this Senate stands on \nthe issue of soft money. I think the people who sent us here deserve to \nknow whether we think it is right that our\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\nelections are dominated by this unlimited, unregulated money or not. \nBecause we know that they don't think it is right, the time has come to \nact.\n  Most of the pundits say we lost in February, but I think we won a \nbattle. We won because we showed that a bipartisan majority of the \nSenate wants reform, and a bipartisan majority of the Senate will stick \ntogether and fight for reform. The battle for reform on both sides of \nCapitol Hill is proceeding, and it will go forward until the American \npeople win the war and get their Government back.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

RICHARD E. GREENLEAF\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a distinguished \nscholar and son of New Mexico. This year, Dr. Richard Greenleaf, \nProfessor of Latin American History and Director of the Center for \nLatin American Studies at Tulane University, ends a remarkable career \nof more than a half century of research and teaching. Dr. Greenleaf has \nnow returned to new Mexico to enjoy his retirement.\n  A few weeks ago, Dr. Greenleaf's students and colleagues gathered at \nTulane University to honor their mentor and friend. One of Dr. \nGreenleaf's former students, Dr. Stanley Hordes of the Latin American \nInstitute of the University of New Mexico, wrote an essay to \ncommemorate that event. The essay recounts Dr. Greenleaf's \nextraordinary career and warmly expresses the deep affection his \nstudents hold for him.\n  For all his accomplishments, I salute Dr. Greenleaf. I welcome him \nhome to New Mexico, and I join all those who are indebted to him for \nhis lifetime commitment to scholarship and teaching.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Hordes' tribute to \nDr. Greenleaf be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tribute was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Dedication of the Richard E. Greenleaf Conference Room, April 3, 1998\n\n       Dr. Richard Edward Greenleaf, France Vinton Scholes \n     Professor of Colonial Latin American History, and Director of \n     the Center for Latin American Studies at Tulane University \n     was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas on May 6, 1930. He grew up \n     in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and took his Bachelor's, Master's \n     and Doctoral degrees at the University of New Mexico, where \n     he studied under the dean of inquisition scholars, Professor \n     France V. Scholes. Dr. Greenleaf's doctoral dissertation, \n     ``Zumarraga and the Mexican Inquisition 1536-1543,'' served \n     as the basis for his many excellent publications on the \n     history of the Holy Office in Latin America.\n       Dr. Greenleaf authored eleven major scholarly books, served \n     as co-author of, or contributor to seventeen others, and \n     published almost four dozen articles in the field of Latin \n     American and Borderlands history. He has served on the \n     editorial boards of several major publications, including the \n     Handbook of Latin American Studies, The Americas and the \n     Hispanic American Historical Review, and was the recipient of \n     many distinguished awards, among them Silver Medal, Sahagun \n     Prize: Mexican National History Award, and the Serra Award of \n     the Academy of American Franciscan History for Distinguished \n     Scholarship in Colonial Latin American History.\n       Richard Greenleaf began his teaching career at the \n     University of Albuquerque in 1953. Shortly thereafter, he \n     moved to Mexico City, where he taught at the University of \n     the Americas, later serving as Chair of the Department of \n     History and International Relations, Academic Vice-President \n     and Dean of the Graduate School. In 1969, he accepted a \n     faculty position at Tulane, assuming the directorship of the \n     Center for Latin American Studies the following year, and the \n     chairmanship of the History Department in 1978. In 1982, he \n     was installed in the France Vinton Scholes Chair in Colonial \n     Latin American History. In his long and distinguished \n     teaching career, Dr. Greenleaf has served as mentor to \n     numerous doctoral students, and countless master's and \n     undergraduate students, all of whom are greatly indebted to \n     him for his inspiration and guidance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3426-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNITION OF YVONNE ULLAS, WASHINGTON STATE TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

We think we have a challenging job in the \nSenate, but every day Ms. Ullas is charged with stimulating the minds \nof 24 active first graders.\n  The Naches primary school has prepared this book with their advice \nfor President Clinton and have asked that I send it over to the White \nHouse.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana; to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n       Whereas, Congress, through the Federal Agriculture \n     Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (FAIR Act), mandated that \n     the secretary of agriculture consolidate the then existing \n     thirty-two federal milk marketing orders into no fewer than \n     ten nor more than fourteen orders by no later than April 4, \n     1999; and\n       Whereas, the FAIR Act also authorized the secretary of \n     agriculture to review and reform the pricing and other \n     provisions of the consolidated orders; and\n       Whereas, on January 23, 1998, the secretary of agriculture \n     issued the proposed rules for federal milk order \n     consolidations and reforms; and\n       Whereas, these proposed rules included two options for \n     pricing milk used in Class I (fluid milk products), which are \n     noted and referred to as Option 1A and Option 1B; and\n       Whereas, Option 1A is similar to the present geographic \n     price structures; however, Option 1B would reduce the minimum \n     federal order prices in Louisiana more than $1.00 per hundred \n     weight; and\n       Whereas, while demand has been rising due to increasing \n     population, milk production in Louisiana and the entire \n     Southeast has declined during each of the past seven years; \n     as a result, larger quantities of milk are imported from \n     other regions at higher cost than local milk; and\n       Whereas, implementation of Option 1B, even with the highest \n     transition option, would aggravate the loss of dairy farms \n     and local milk production; and\n       Whereas, such loss will be devastating to the dairy farmer, \n     the rural communities, and the consumers: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to support, \n     and urges and requests the secretary of agriculture to \n     incorporate, Option 1A as the pricing procedure in all \n     federal milk marketing orders in his final decision on \n     consolidation and reform of these orders.

A bill to prohibit the publication of identifying \ninformation relating to a minor for criminal sexual purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the internet predator prevention act of 1998\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nInternet Predator Prevention Act of 1998. This legislation will give \nmuch needed protection to the millions of American families with \nchildren.\n  In the past two decades, the Internet has grown dramatically. In \n1981, there were only 213 computers hooked into the Internet. In \nJanuary of last year, it was estimated that 17,753,266 computers were \nwired into the Internet. And the number of web sites has also increased \nsignificantly in just the last several years: In June of 1993, there \nwere only 130 reported web sites. By January 1996, that number had \ngrown to more than 100,000. The Congressional Research Service reports \nthat studies on the internet have found that 9 million to 47 million \npeople are using the Internet each year.\n  This enormous new ``cyberworld,'' which crosses state and national \nboundaries as well as race, gender and age barriers, has created a \nplethora of new communities, new business opportunities, and \nunfortunately, new crimes. It seems as if every month, we are hearing \nstories of children who have been exploited and hurt because of \ncontacts they have made on the Internet.\n  I am struck by two particular incidents that arose in my home state \nof Illinois in just the past year. In August of 1997, I was contacted \nby the mother of a 9-year-old Joilet girl whose name and number had \nbeen posted on a series of web pages, bulletin boards and chat rooms \nthat was designed to attract child molesters. This family only learned \nof the posting when they began to receive illicit phone calls from \nstrangers at odd times of the night. A second family from Illinois had \na similar experience when a stranger began ``logging on'' using their \n10-year-old daughter's name. The child's name and the family's home \ntelephone number was posted on the Internet in a chat room for \npedophiles. These parents were lucky enough to learn that their child's \nname had been posted on one of these sites before their children were \nplaced in greater danger.\n  Across this nation, there have been numerous other instances in which \nparents have learned that their children's names, addresses, and phone \nnumbers have been posted on Web pages, bulletin boards, and chat rooms \nwhere pedophiles and child molesters lurk.\n  This ought to be a crime. No one should be allowed to set a child up \nfor a potentially dangerous situation that could have a lasting and \nirrevocable impact. The Internet should serve as a resource and \nlearning took, and not a vehicle for exploitation.\n  Currently, there are very few state laws that exist that address this \nissue. The few laws that do exist are vague and do not carry the weight \nneeded to prosecute pedophiles for their crimes. The quick growth of \nthe Internet has made it difficult to control Internet postings and, in \nthis case, state and other traditional boundaries cannot and do not \napply. Often times, a child and his or her exploiter may live in \ndifferent states on different sides of the country. The crime taking \nplace, however, is not any less significant than if they were in the \nsame room.\n  I believe that the Federal government can play an important role in \nstopping child exploitation on the Internet. The federal government has \nthe ability to regulate interstate activity and federal law has \njurisdiction over all 50 states and territories. A federal law will be \nable to navigate the complexity of the issues the Internet raises \nregarding interstate commerce and can be used to prosecute criminals \nregardless of what state the perpetrator lives in.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation which I believe will address this \ngrowing problem. My legislation would make it a crime to post a child's \nname, address, or telephone number on an Internet web site, chat room \nor bulletin board in order to make that child available for criminal \nsexual acts with an adult. This bill uses the least restrictive means \nof regulating against one of the most offensive acts a human being can \ncommit toward another: the exploitation of a child.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the quick \npassage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1965\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to study \nwhether the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore should be protected as a \nwilderness area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       THE GAYLORD NELSON APOSTLE ISLANDS STEWARDSHIP ACT OF 1988\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The Gaylord \nNelson Apostle Islands Stewardship Act of 1998.'' I am very pleased \nthat my senior colleague from Wisconsin joins me as an original author \nof the bill, and also that my colleague in the other body, Congressman \nObey is joining me in introducing the companion legislation as he \nrepresents the area of Wisconsin where the Apostle Islands are located.\n  Mr. President, on this Earth Day, the 29th Earth Day, I have chosen \nto name this legislation in recognition of the accomplishments of Earth \nDay's founder, a former member of this body and former Governor of my \nstate, Gaylord Nelson. Many outside Wisconsin may not know that, in \naddition to founding Earth Day, Senator Nelson was also the primary \nsponsor of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore Act. That Act, which \npassed in 1970--the same year Earth Day was founded, protects\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\none of Northern Wisconsin's most beautiful areas, and it is a place \nwhere every year my family and I spend our favorite vacation.\n\n  Though Senator Nelson has received many awards, I know that among his \nproudest accomplishments are those bills he crafted which have produced \nreal and lasting change in preserving America's lands, such as the \nApostle Islands.\n  The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore includes 21 forested islands \nand 12 miles of pristine shoreline which are among the Great Lakes' \nmost spectacular scenery. Centuries of wave action, freezing, and \nthawing have sculpted the shorelines and nature has carved intricate \ncaves into the sandstone which forms the islands. Delicate arches, \nvaulted chambers, and hidden passageways honeycomb cliffs on the north \nshore of Devil's Island, Swallow Point on Sand Island, and northeast of \nCornucopia on the mainland. The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore \nincludes more lighthouses than any other coastline of similar size in \nthe United States, and is home to diverse wildlife including: black \nbear, bald eagles and deer. It is an important recreational area as \nwell. Its campgrounds and acres of forest, make the Apostles a favorite \ndestination for hikers, sailors, kayakers, and bikers. The Lakeshore \nalso includes the underwater lakebed as well, and scuba divers register \nwith the National Park Service to view the area's underwater resources.\n  I also know that Senator Nelson, if he were still a member of this \nbody, would have been wholeheartedly pursuing the full implementation \nof the ecological vision that Wisconsinites and all Americans share for \nthe Lakeshore. Unfortunately, as do many of the lands managed by the \nNational Park Service, the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore finds \nitself, now 28 years later, with both some significant financial and \nlegal resource needs. If we are to be true stewards of America's public \nlands, we need to be willing to make necessary financial investments \nand management improvements when they are warranted. Thus, I am \nintroducing this legislation in an attempt to resolve the unfinished \nbusiness that remains at the Lakeshore, as well as to renew our \nNation's commitment to this beautiful place.\n  Mr. President, the legislation has three major sections. First, it \ndirects the Park Service to conduct a wilderness suitability study of \nthe Lakeshore as required by the Wilderness Act. The legislation \nauthorizes $200,000 for that purpose.\n  This study mandate is needed to ensure that we have the appropriate \nlevel of management at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. The \nWilderness Act and the National Park Service policies require the Park \nService to conduct an evaluation of the lands it manages for possible \ninclusion in the National Wilderness system. Such a study would result \nin a recommendation to Congress about whether any of the federally-\nowned lands currently within the Lakeshore still retain the \ncharacteristics that would make them suitable to be legally designated \nas wilderness. The Congress would then have an opportunity to review \nsuch information. If Congress found that such information indicated \nthat some of the federal lands within the Lakeshore were in need of \nlegal wilderness status, Congress would have to subsequently pass \nlegislation to confer such status.\n  We need this study, Mr. President because, though 28 years have \npassed, we are not certain whether we are under- or over-managing the \nLakeshore. During the General Management Planning Process for the \nLakeshore, which was completed nearly a decade ago in 1989, the need \nfor a formal wilderness study was identified. Although a wilderness \nstudy has been identified as a high priority by the Lakeshore, it has \nnever been funded.\n  Since 1989, most of the Lakeshore, roughly 80 percent of the acreage, \nis being managed by the Park Service as if it were federally designated \nwilderness. As a protective measure, all lands which might be suitable \nfor wilderness designation were zoned to protect any wilderness \ncharacteristics they may have pending completion of the study. However, \nwe may be managing lands as wilderness in the Lakeshore that might, due \nto use patterns, no longer be suitable for wilderness designation. \nCorrespondingly, some land area may have become more ecologically \nsensitive and may need additional legal protection.\n  Second, this legislation also directs the Park Service to protect the \nhistoric Raspberry Island and Outer Island lighthouses. The bill \nauthorizes $3.9 million for bluff stabilization and other necessary \nactions. There are six lighthouses in the Apostle Island National \nLakeshore--Sand Island, Devil's Island, Raspberry Island, Outer Island, \nLong Island and Michigan Island. Engineering studies completed for the \nNational Park Service have determined that several of these lighthouses \nare in danger of structural damage due to the continued erosion of the \nred clay banks upon which they were built. The situations at Outer \nIsland and Raspberry Island, the two which this legislation addresses, \nwere determined to be in the most jeopardy.\n\n  The Raspberry Island situation is most critical. The Raspberry Island \nlighthouse was completed in 1863 to mark the west channel through the \nApostle Islands. The original light was a rectangular frame structure \nsurmounted by a square tower that held a lens 40 feet above the ground.\n  A fog signal building was added to Raspberry Island in 1902. The red \nbrick structure housed a ten-inch steam whistle and a hoisting engine \nfor a tramway. The need for additional personnel at the station led to \na redesign of the lighthouse building in 1906-07. The structure was \nconverted to a duplex, housing the keeper and his family in the east \nhalf, with the two assistant keepers sharing the west half. A 23-\nkilowatt, diesel-driven electric generator was installed at the station \nin 1928. The light was automated in 1947 and then moved to a metal \ntower in front of the fog signal building in 1952.\n  Raspberry Island light is now the most frequently visited of Apostle \nIslands National Lakeshore's lighthouses. Recent erosion is threatening \nthe access tram and the fog signal building.\n  The Outer Island light station was built in 1874 on a red clay bluff \n40 feet above Lake Superior. The lighthouse tower stands 90 feet high \nand the watchroom is encircled by an outside walkway and topped by the \nlantern.\n  Historic architects have indicated to the Park Service that Outer \nIsland lighthouse may already be suffering some structural damage due \nto its location on the bluff and the situation would be much worse if \nLake Superior were exceedingly high.\n  Engineers believe that preservation of these structures requires \nprotection of the bluff beneath the lighthouses, stabilization of the \nbanks, and dewatering of the area immediately shoreward of the bluffs. \nAlthough the projects have in the past been included within the Park \nService-wide construction priorities, they have never been funded.\n  Finally, this legislation adds language to the act which created the \nLakeshore allowing the Park Service to enter into cooperative \nagreements with state, tribal, local governments, universities or other \nnon-profit entities to enlist their assistance in managing the \nLakeshore. Some parks have specific language in the act which created \nthe park allowing them to enter into such agreements. Parks have used \nthem for activities such as research, historic preservation, and \nemergency services. Apostle Islands currently does not have this \nauthority, which this legislation adds.\n  Other National Park lands and lands which are managed by the Park \nService, such as the Lakeshore, have such authority. Adding such \nauthority to the Lakeshore will be a way to make Lakeshore management \nresources go farther. The Park Service has the opportunity to carry out \njoint projects with other partners which could contribute to the \nmanagement of the Lakeshore including: state, local, and tribal \ngovernments, universities, and non-profit groups. Such endeavors would \nhave both scientific management and fiscal benefits. In the past, the \nLakeshore has had to pass over opportunities because the specific \nauthority has been absent.\n  In his 1969 book on the environment, entitled America's Last Chance, \nSenator Nelson issued a political challenge: ``I have come to the \nconclusion that the number one domestic problem facing this country is \nthe threatened destruction of our natural resources\n\n[[Page S3431]]\n\nand the disaster which would confront mankind should such destruction \noccur. There is a real question as to whether the nation, which has \nspent some two hundred years developing an intricate system of local, \nState and Federal Government to deal with the public's problems, will \nbe bold, imaginative and flexible enough to meet this supreme test.''\n  Though, fortunately, the Apostle Islands are not, because of former \nSenator Nelson's efforts, ``threatened with destruction,'' I believe \nthat Senator Nelson meant two things by his challenge. Not only did he \nmean that government must act immediately and decisively to protect \nresources in crisis, but he also meant that government must be \nresponsible and flexible enough to remain committed to the protection \nof the areas we wisely seek to preserve under our laws.\n  Thus, Mr. President, on this Earth Day I am proud to introduce this \nlegislation as a renewal of the federal government's commitment to the \nApostle Islands National Lakeshore. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1966\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for mass transportation in national parks \nand related public lands; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                        the transit in parks act\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing new legislation \nto help ease congestion, protect our nation's natural resources, and \nimprove mobility and accessibility in our national parks and wildlife \nrefuges. The ``Transit In Parks Act'' or TRIP bill is a new federal \ntransit grant initiative that is designed to provide mass transit and \nalternative transportation services for our national parks, our \nwildlife refuges, federal recreational areas, and other public lands \nmanaged by three agencies of the Department of the Interior.\n  When the parks first opened in the second half of the nineteenth \ncentury, visitors arrived by stagecoach along dirt roads. Travel \nthrough parklands, such as Yosemite or Yellowstone, was difficult and \nlong and costly. Not many people could afford or endure such a trip.\n  The introduction of the automobile gave every American greater \nmobility and freedom, which included the freedom to travel and see some \nof our nation's great natural wonders. Early in this century landscape \narchitects from the National Park Service and highway engineers from \nthe U.S. Bureau of Public Roads collaborated to produce many feats of \nroad engineering that opened the national park lands to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Yet greater mobility and easier access now threaten the very \nenvironments that the National Park Service is mandated to protect. The \non-going tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for our national park system. Today, record numbers of \nvisitors and cars has resulted in increasing damage to our parks. The \nGrand Canyon alone has five million visitors a year. It may surprise \nyou to know that the average visitor stay is only three hours. As many \nas 6,000 vehicles arrive in a single summer day. They compete for 2,000 \nparking spaces. Between 32,000 and 35,000 tour buses go to the park \neach year. During the peak summer season, the entrance route becomes a \ngiant parking lot.\n  In the decade from 1984 to 1994, the number of visits to America's \nnational parks increased 25 percent, rising from 208 million to 269 \nmillion a year. This is equal to more than one visit by every man, \nwoman, and child in this country. This has created an overwhelming \ndemand on these areas, resulting in severe traffic congestion, visitor \nrestrictions, and in some instances vacationers being shut-out of the \nparks altogether. The environmental damage at the Grand Canyon is \nvisible at many other parks: Yosemite, which has more than 4 million \nvisitors a year; Yellowstone, which has more than 3 million visitors a \nyear and experiences such severe traffic congestion that access has to \nbe restricted; Zion; Acadia; Bryce; and many others. We need to solve \nthese problems now or risk permanent damage to our nation's natural, \ncultural, and historical heritage.\n  The legislation I am introducing builds upon two previous initiatives \nto address these problems. First is the study of alternative \ntransportation strategies in our national parks that was mandated by \nthe Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, ISTEA. \nThis study, completed by the National Park Service in May 1994, found \nthat many of our most heavily visited national parks are experiencing \nthe same problems of congestion and pollution that afflict our cities \nand metropolitan areas. Yet, overwhelmingly, the principal \ntransportation systems that the Federal Government has developed to \nprovide access into our national parks are roads primarily for private \nautomobile access.\n  Second, last November, Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater and \nSecretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt signed an agreement to work \ntogether to address transportation and resource\n\n[[Page S3432]]\n\nmanagement needs in and around national parks. The findings in the \nMemorandum Of Understanding entered into by the two departments are \nespecially revealing:\n\n       Congestion in and approaching many National Parks is \n     causing lengthy traffic delays and backups that substantially \n     detract from the visitor experience. Visitors find that many \n     of the National Parks contain significant noise and air \n     pollution, and traffic congestion similar to that found on \n     the city streets they left behind.\n       In many National Park units, the capacity of parking \n     facilities at interpretive or science areas is well below \n     demand. As a result, visitors park along roadsides, damaging \n     park resources and subjecting people to hazardous safety \n     conditions as they walk near busy roads to access visitor use \n     areas.\n       On occasion, National Park units must close their gates \n     during high visitation periods and turn away the public \n     because the existing infrastructure and transportation \n     systems are at, or beyond, the capacity for which they were \n     designed.\n\n  The challenge for park management is two-fold: to conserve and \nprotect the nation's natural, historical, and cultural resources, while \nat the same time ensuring visitor access and enjoyment of these \nsensitive environments.\n  The Transit in Parks Act will go far to meeting this challenge. The \nbill's objectives are to develop new and expanded mass transit services \nthroughout the national parks and other public lands to conserve and \nprotect fragile natural, cultural, and historical resources, to prevent \nadverse impact on those resources, and to reduce pollution and \ncongestion, while at the same time facilitating appropriate visitor \naccess and improving the visitor experience.\n\n  This new federal transit grant program will provide funding to three \nFederal land management agencies in the Department of the Interior--the \nNational Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the \nBureau of Land Management--that manage the 375 various parks within the \nNational Park System, including national battlefields, monuments and \nnational seashores, as well as the national wildlife refuges and \nfederal recreational areas. The program will allocate capital funds for \ntransit projects, including rail or clean fuel bus projects, joint \ndevelopment activities, pedestrian and bike paths, or park waterway \naccess, within or adjacent to national park lands. The bill authorizes \n$50 million for this new program for each of the fiscal years 1999 \nthrough 2003. It is anticipated that other resources--both public and \nprivate--will be available to augment these amounts in the initial \nphase.\n  The bill formalizes the cooperative arrangement entered into last \nNovember between the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of \nthe Interior to exchange technical assistance and to develop procedures \nrelating to the planning, selection and funding of transit projects in \nnational park lands.\n  The projects eligible for funding shall be developed through the \nISTEA planning process and selected in consultation with the Secretary \nof the Interior. The bill provides funds for planning, research, and \ntechnical assistance that can supplement other financial resources \navailable to the Federal land management agencies.\n  It is anticipated that the Secretary of Transportation shall select \nprojects that are diverse in location and size. While major national \nparks such as the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone are clearly appropriate \ncandidates for significant transit projects under this section, there \nare numerous small urban and rural Federal park lands that can benefit \nenormously from small projects, such as bike paths or improved \nconnections with an urban public transit system. Project selection \nshould include the following criteria: the historical and cultural \nsignificance of a project; safety; and the extent to which the project \nwould conserve resources, prevent adverse impact, enhance the \nenvironment, improve mobility, and contribute to livable communities.\n  The bill also identifies projects of regional or national \nsignificance that more closely resemble the Federal transit program's \nNew Starts projects. Where the project costs are $25 million or \ngreater, the projects shall comply with the transit New Starts \nrequirements. No single project shall receive more than 12 percent of \nthe total amount available in any given year. This ensures a diversity \nof projects selected for assistance.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Secretary of Transportation, in \ncoordination with the Secretary of the Interior, to undertake a \ncomprehensive study of alternative transportation needs in the national \nparks and other public lands eligible for assistance under this \nprogram. The objective of this study is to better identify those areas \nwith existing and potential problems of congestion and pollution, or \nwhich can benefit from mass transportation services, and to identify \nand estimate the project costs for these sites.\n  This program can create new opportunities for the Federal land \nmanagement agency to partner with local transit agencies in gateway \ncommunities adjacent to the parks, both through the ISTEA planning \nprocess and in developing integrated transportation systems. This will \nspur new economic development within these communities, as they develop \ntransportation centers for park visitors to connect to transit links \ninto the national parks and other public lands.\n  The on-going tension between preservation and access has always been \na challenge for the National Park Service. Today, that challenge has \nnew dimensions, with overcrowding, pollution, congestion, and resource \ndegradation increasing at many of our national parks. This \nlegislation--the Transit in Parks Act--will give our Federal land \nmanagement agencies important new tools to improve both preservation \nand access.\n  Just as we have found in metropolitan areas, transit is essential to \nmoving large numbers of people in our national parks--quickly, \nefficiently, at low cost, and without adverse impact. At the same time, \ntransit can enhance the economic development potential of our gateway \ncommunities.\n  So today, as we celebrate Earth Day and throughout this entire week \nas we mark National Parks Week, I cannot think of a more worthy \nendeavor to help our environment and preserve our national parks, \nwildlife refuges, and federal recreational areas than by encouraging \nalternative transportation in these areas. My bill is strongly \nsupported by the American Public Transit Association, the National \nParks and Conservation Association, the Surface Transportation Policy \nProject, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Environmental \nDefense Fund, and I ask unanimous consent that these letters and \nadditional supporting material be included in the Record immediately \nfollowing my remarks.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation and to recognize the enormous environmental and economic \nbenefits that transit can bring to our national parks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following be printed \nin the Record:\n  Text of the Bill;\n  Section-by-section summary;\n  Washington Post November 26, 1997, article: ``Strict Limits on Cars \nset for 3 National Parks''; and\n  Letters of support; from the American Public Transit Association, \nfrom the National Parks and Conservation Association, Surface \nTransportation Policy Project, Natural Resources Defense Council and \nEnvironmental Defense Fund.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1967\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Statement of Policies, Findings, and Purposes:\n       To encourage and promote the development of transportation \n     systems for the betterment of national parks and related \n     public lands and to conserve natural, historical, and \n     cultural resources and prevent adverse impact, relieve \n     congestion, minimize transportation fuel consumption, reduce \n     pollution and enhance visitor mobility and accessibility and \n     the visitor experience.\n       To that end, this program establishes federal assistance to \n     certain Federal land management agencies and State and local \n     governmental authorities to finance mass transportation \n     capital projects, to encourage public-private partnerships, \n     and to assist in the research and deployment of improved mass \n     transportation equipment and methods.\n       III. Definitions:\n       (1) eligible ``Federal land management agencies'' are: \n     National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau \n     of Land Management (all under Department of the Interior).\n       (2) ``national parks and related public lands''; eligible \n     areas under the management of these agencies.\n       (3) ``qualified mass transportation project''; a capital \n     mass transportation project carried out within or adjacent to \n     national parks and related public lands, including rail \n     projects, clean fuel vehicles, joint development activities, \n     pedestrian and bike paths, waterborne access, or projects \n     that otherwise better protect the national parks and related \n     public lands and increase visitor mobility and accessibility.\n       IV. Federal Agency Cooperative Arrangements:\n       Implements the Memorandum of Understanding between the \n     Departments of Transportation and the Interior for the \n     exchange of technical assistance, the development of \n     transportation policy and coordination, and the establishment \n     of criteria for planning, selection and funding of capital \n     projects under this section. The Secretary of Transportation \n     selects the projects, after consultation with Secretary of \n     the Interior.\n       V. Assistance:\n       To be provided through grants, cooperative agreements, or \n     other agreements, including leasing under certain conditions, \n     for an eligible capital project under this section. Not more \n     than 5% of the amounts available can be used for planning, \n     research and technical assistance, and these amounts can be \n     supplemented from other sources.\n       VI. Planning Process:\n       The Departments of Transportation and Interior shall \n     cooperatively develop a planning process consistent with the \n     ISTEA planning process in sections 5305 through 5306 of the \n     Federal Transit laws.\n       VII. Government's Share of the Costs:\n       In determining the Federal Transit Administration share of \n     the project costs, the Secretary of Transportation must \n     consider certain factors, including visitation levels and \n     user fee revenues, the coordination in the project \n     development with a public or private transit authority, \n     private investment, and whether there is a clear and direct \n     financial benefit to the applicant. The intent is to \n     establish criteria for a sliding scale of assistance, with a \n     lower Government share for large projects that can attract \n     outside investment, and a higher Government share for \n     projects that may not have access to such outside resources. \n     In addition, funds from the Federal land management agencies \n     can be counted as the local share.\n       VIII. Selection of Projects:\n       The Secretary shall consider: (1) project justification, \n     including the extent to which the project conserves the \n     resources, prevents adverse impact and enhances the \n     environment; (2) project location to ensure geographic \n     diversity and both rural and urban projects; (3) project size \n     for a balanced distribution; (4) historical and cultural \n     significance; (5) safety; (6) the extent to which the project \n     would enhance livable communities; (7) the reduction of \n     pollution, including noise and visual pollution; (8) the \n     reduction of congestion and the improvement of the mobility \n     of people in the most efficient manner; and (9) any other \n     considerations the Secretary deems appropriate. Projects \n     funded under this section must meet certain transit law \n     requirements.\n       IX. Projects of Regional or National Significance\n       This is a special category that sets forth criteria for \n     special, generally larger, projects or for those areas that \n     may have problems of resource management, pollution, \n     congestion, mobility, and accessibility that can be addressed \n     by this program. Additional project selection criteria \n     include: visitation levels; the use of innovative financing \n     or joint development strategies; coordination with the \n     gateway communities; and any other considerations the \n     Secretary deems appropriate. Projects under this section must \n     meet certain Federal Transit New Starts criteria. This \n     section identifies some locations that may fit these \n     criteria. Any project in this category that is $25 million or \n     greater in cost will have a full funding grant agreement \n     similar to Federal Transit New Starts projects. No project \n     can receive more than 12% of the total amount available in \n     any given year.\n       X. Undertaking Projects in Advance:\n       This provision applies current transit law to this section, \n     allowing projects to advance prior to receiving Federal \n     funding, but allowing the advance activities to be counted so \n     the local share as long as certain conditions are met.\n       IX. Project Management Oversight:\n       This provision applies current transit law to this section, \n     limiting oversight funds to 0.5% per year of the funds made \n     available for this section.\n       XII. Relationship to Other Laws:\n       This provision applies certain transit laws to all projects \n     funded under this section and permits the Secretary to apply \n     any other terms or conditions he deems appropriate.\n       XIII. State Infrastructure Banks:\n       A project assisted under this section can also use funding \n     from a State Infrastructure Bank or other innovative \n     financing mechanism that funds eligible transit projects.\n       XIV. Asset Management:\n       This provision permits the Secretary of Transportation to \n     transfer control over a transit asset acquired with Federal \n     funds under this section in accord with certain Federal \n     property management rules.\n       XV. Coordination of Research and Deployment of New \n     Technologies:\n       This provision allows grants for research and deployment of \n     new technologies to meet the special needs of the national \n     park lands.\n       XVI. Report:\n       This requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit a \n     report on projects funded under this section to the House \n     Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, to be included \n     in the Department's annual project report.\n       XVII. Study of Transit Needs in National Park Lands:\n       This authorizes $500,000 for a comprehensive study of \n     alternative transportation needs in national parks and \n     related public lands to be completed by January 1, 2000, and \n     specifies the study elements.\n       XVIII. Authorization:\n       $50,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for the \n     Secretary to carry out this program for each of the fiscal \n     years 1999 through 2003.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 26, 1997]\n\nStrict Limits on Cars Set for 3 National Parks--Rail and Bus Systems To \n                           Ease Traffic Jams\n\n                           (By Joby Warrick)\n\n       The Clinton administration is imposing a virtual ban on \n     cars in busy sections of the Grand Canyon and two other \n     national parks as part of a strategy to ease the traffic jams \n     that have tarnished America's most spectacular natural \n     attractions.\n       Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Transportation \n     Secretary Rodney E. Slater yesterday jointly announced plans \n     for mass transit systems that will dramatically change the \n     way most visitors experience the Grand Canyon, Yosemite \n     National Park in California and Zion National Park in \n     southwestern Utah. The plans call for ripping up roads and \n     dozens of acres of existing parking lots and using buses and \n     trains to ferry tourists into the parks.\n       The transit systems--which could be introduced in other \n     parks--are designed to relieve the chronic congestion that is \n     one of the most serious challenges facing park \n     administrators. Because of record numbers of visitors, many \n     of the nation's most-beloved tourist destinations are in \n     danger of being ``loved to death,'' Babbitt said.\n       ``The road to [Grand Canyon's] South Rim is now jammed with \n     cars,'' Babbitt said. ``The once fresh and clear air now \n     smells of diesel fumes and asphalt, the stunning view now \n     marred by filling stations and smog, the sound of breeze-\n     rustled pines now drowned by the echo of engines and horns.''\n       Ever-larger crowds forced Yosemite officials to begin \n     turning away visitors on the busiest days. But Babbitt said \n     buses and trains will allow all the parks to ``keep the \n     `Welcome' sign out.''\n       Under the pilot programs announced yesterday, visitors to \n     the parks could be riding trains or buses by 2001. At Grand \n     Canyon National Park, a $14 million light rail line would \n     carry up to 4,000 riders an hour from a remote parking lot to \n     a new visitor center at the park's South Rim. The center will \n     be paid for with funds from park entry fees, which are not \n     expected to increase.\n       Once in the park, visitors can travel to destinations using \n     a fleet of clean-burning buses that will run on electricity \n     or natural gas. Overnight guests could continue to use cars \n     to drive to hotels or campsites within the park.\n       Similar systems using buses will be established at Zion and \n     at Yosemite, which two weeks ago announced a plan designed to \n     cut traffic levels by 50 percent.\n       The announcement comes a year after President Clinton \n     ordered the agencies to develop alternative transportation \n     strategies to curb overcrowding in the most popular national \n     parks. The administration also has banned some flights at the \n     Grand Canyon.\n       Park officials applauded details of the new transit plans. \n     Robert Arnberger, superintendent of Grand Canyon National \n     Park, said the park's resources were being ``hammered'' by a \n     daily onslaught of 6,100 vehicles. Competition among \n     motorists for the park's 2,000 parking spaces have prompted \n     fights, at least one attempted murder charge and ``God knows \n     how many divorces.''\n       Environmental groups also praised the decision and urged \n     the administration to push for more aggressive restrictions \n     in air traffic around national parks.\n\n[[Page S3436]]\n\n       ``We want to see the sun reflecting off waterfalls and \n     canyons--not the bumper of the car in front of us,'' said \n     Bill Meadows, president of The Wilderness Society. ``Even in \n     Disney World, cars don't go right to the heart of the park.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                          Transit Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n         Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Thank you for forwarding us a draft \n     copy of the ``Transit in Parks (TRIP) Act'' which would amend \n     federal transit law at chapter 53, title 49 U.S.C.\n       The Act would authorize federal assistance to certain \n     federal agencies and state and local entities to finance mass \n     transit projects generally for the purpose of addressing \n     transportation congestion and mobility issues at national \n     parks. Among other things, the bill would implement the \n     recent Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of \n     Transportation and Interior regarding joint efforts of those \n     federal agencies to encourage the use of public \n     transportation at national parks.\n       In December 1997, I was pleased to write to the Secretaries \n     of Transportation and Interior in support of their MOU, and I \n     am just as pleased to support your efforts to improve \n     mobility in our national parks. Public transportation clearly \n     has much to offer citizens who visit these national \n     treasures, where congestion and pollution are significant--\n     and growing--problems. Moreover, this legislation should \n     broaden the base of support for public transportation, a key \n     principle APTA has been advocating for many years. In that \n     regard, we will be reviewing your bill with APTA's \n     legislative leadership.\n       I applaud you for introducing the legislation, and look \n     forward to continuing to work with you and your staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William W. Millar,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    National Parks\n\n\n                                 and Conservation Association,\n\n                                                   April 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the National Parks and \n     Conservation Association and its nearly half a million \n     members, I want to thank you for your foresight and \n     leadership in proposing a bill that would enhance transit \n     options for access to America's national parks.\n       As you know, from 1975 to 1996, the national parks have \n     experienced a surge in visitation, from 190.4 million to \n     265.8 million visitors per year. With this increased public \n     interest in these special places has come substantial \n     additional burdens on the resources that have drawn such \n     public acclaim. As more people crowd into our national parks \n     (typically by auto) fragile habitat, endangered plants and \n     animals, unique historical treasures, and nationally \n     recognized symbols of our cultural heritage will become \n     damaged from air and water pollution, noise intrusion, and \n     inappropriate use.\n       Your bill's establishment of a new program within the \n     Federal Transit Administration, dedicated to enhancing \n     transit options in and adjacent to the national parks, can \n     have a powerful, positive effect on the future integrity of \n     the parks and their resources by reducing the need for access \n     by automobile. Development of transportation centers and auto \n     parking lots outside the parks, and the use of buses, vans, \n     and rail systems would provide much more efficient means of \n     handling the crush of visitation. As a complement to the \n     Federal Lands Highway Program which provides funds \n     principally for park road projects through the Federal \n     Highway Administration, your legislation would properly \n     recognize the critical role that mass transit can play in \n     protecting the parks and enhancing the visitor experience.\n       In accomplishing its goal, your bill would further the \n     Memorandum of Agreement signed by the U.S. Department of the \n     Interior and the U.S. Department of Transportation last \n     December. This memorandum would boost the role of alternative \n     transportation solutions for national parks, particularly \n     those most heavily impacted by visitation, including \n     Yellowstone, Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, and Zion. Your bill \n     would also provide an excellent opportunity for the National \n     Park Service to enter into public/private partnerships \n     between the federal government and states, localities, and \n     the private sector to provide a fuller range of \n     transportation options than exists today. These partnerships \n     could leverage funds that the National Park Service currently \n     has great difficulty accessing.\n       NPCA looks upon your bill as a creative new mechanism to \n     fulfill the principal federal mandate governing the national \n     parks, which is ``to conserve the scenery and the natural and \n     historic objects and the wildlife therein, and to provide for \n     the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as \n     will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future \n     generations.'' We look forward to working with you to move \n     this legislation to enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas C. Kiernan,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Surface Transportation\n\n\n                                               Policy Project,\n\n                                                   April 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the Surface \n     Transportation Policy Project, a coalition of over 30 \n     national and 200 local and regional groups that work to make \n     transportation policy contribute to healthy communities and a \n     healthy environment, I would like to commend you for the \n     legislation you are introducing to provide a direct funding \n     source for alternative transportation projects in our \n     national parks. Your leadership in bringing attention to this \n     emerging issue will be a major building block in what we hope \n     will be a broad effort to lessen the environmental impacts of \n     visitation on these most important natural areas.\n       We believe that public transportation can be the right \n     choice for many parks, particularly those where visitors \n     enter from only one or two major access corridors, and a \n     majority of them visit a small number of popular destinations \n     within the park. In these circumstances, allowing people to \n     leave their cars behind will both enhance the park experience \n     for all visitors, who will not have to negotiate heavy \n     traffic in order to have a quality outdoor experience, and \n     will benefit visitors who will not have to fight for parking \n     spaces at popular attractions.\n       The STPP coalition appreciates your leadership on this \n     issue. Please let me know if there is anything we can do to \n     help you advance this important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Roy Kienitz,\n     Deputy Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Natural Resources Defense Council--Environmental Defense \n           Fund,\n                                                   April 22, 1998.\n     Senator Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Natural Resources Defense \n     Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, we are writing to \n     express our support for your bill, the Transit in Parks Act, \n     which will provide dedicated funding for transit projects in \n     our national parks. Too many of our parks suffer from the \n     consequences of poor transportation systems: traffic \n     congestion, air and water pollution, and disturbance of the \n     natural ecosystem. We believe that increased funding for \n     transit will help mitigate some of these problems. A good \n     working transit system in a number of our national parks will \n     make the park experience not only more enjoyable for the many \n     families that travel there, it will help improve \n     environmental conditions. High ozone (smog) levels that \n     impair peoples breathing and exacerbates asthma, and haze, \n     which can obliterate the views at our parks, will both be \n     abated by a decrease in the number of cars and congestion \n     levels.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this issue and your \n     dedication to the health of our national parks. We look \n     forward to working with you to move your legislation forward.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Adams,\n         Executive Director, Natural Resources Defense Council.\n     Fred Krupp,\n         Executive Director, Environmental Defense Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FORD (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Hollings, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1968. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Transportation to implement a pilot program to improve \naccess to the national transportation system for small communities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                    the air service restoration act\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Air \nService Restoration Act. Over the last several months, there has been a \ngrowing debate about the airline industry, competition, slots and \nservice. This Act seeks to reshape this debate by focusing on problems \nthat small communities have with a deregulated aviation system. \nDeregulation has provided many benefits to many communities. But, as \nthe General Accounting Office has noted, there are many small \ncommunities which have been left behind.\n  Some of these communities, these ``pockets of pain'' as noted by the \nGAO, would like nothing better than for the Congress to re-regulate the \nindustry. However, Mr. President, I do not believe that is the answer--\nand that is not what this bill seeks to do. Rather, our legislation \nproposes to facilitate public-private actions which focus on developing \nmarket opportunities for small communities. In this way, communities \ncan develop air service that fits the needs and desires of the \ncommunity; rather than Washington regulating service.\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\n  This bill is not about competition, but rather the lack of service. \nAs the General Accounting Office noted, since deregulation, communities \nhave seen a decline in the types of service and quality of service. \nThat decline can be attributed to a variety of factors: airports nearby \nwith better, or cheaper, service, the loss of a major employer in the \ncommunity, or a lack of information about what it takes to create a \nmarket.\n  But, there are ways to reverse these trends. Let me give you an \nexample. One town in Virginia had about 18,000 enplanements annually, \nbut gradually declined to under 10,000. The airport set out very \naggressively to find out what happened, and why. Ultimately, the \nenplanements went back up, and service is now increasing.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, not all our communities have the \nresources to aggressively pursue or create market needs. The Federal \ngovernment must play a role in helping our small communities. It can \nnot stand by as communities lose service, or get cut off from the \nnational air transportation system. Travel, tourism and businesses are \ntoo dependent on the system, and each of our small communities must be \na part of the system.\n  This legislation brings together the Federal government, local \ngovernment, airports, air carriers and the business communities in \npartnership to develop ways to increase the use of our nation's small \nairports. Without these services, small communities can not attract new \njobs. It is that simple. We have too much invested in our small towns \nto let them simply lose their access to the national air transportation \nsystem.\n  In Owensboro, Kentucky, our airport, in conjunction with community \nbusiness leaders, is developing an air park: attracting businesses, and \ncreating jobs. That type of activity should be encouraged.\n  There are a number of carriers that will not like some of the \nprovisions in the bill--for example, the bill gives DOT the authority \nto require joint fares and interlining. These provisions may be \nnecessary to make sure that a small community has the ability to \nconnect with major hubs. Such authority would only be required in \nlimited circumstances.\n  Mr. President, we need to begin to look at solutions to the problems \nfaced by our small communities--and the need for these communities to \nhave access to our national aviation transportation system. The \neconomic survival of these communities in a global marketplace depends \non the ability to connect to the marketplace. It is my hope and belief \nthat this legislation re-focuses the debate on this issue--connecting \nAmerica's small communities to the greatest, most efficient, and safest \nair transportation system in the world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1968\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Air Service Restoration \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) a national transportation system providing safe, high \n     quality service to all areas of the United States is \n     essential to interstate commerce and the economic well-being \n     of cities and towns throughout the United States;\n       (2) taxpayers throughout the United States have supported \n     and helped to fund the United States aviation infrastructure \n     and have a right to expect that aviation services will be \n     provided in an equitable and fair manner to every region of \n     the country;\n       (3) some communities have not benefited from airline \n     deregulation and access to essential airports and air \n     services has been limited;\n       (4) air service to a number of small communities has \n     suffered since deregulation;\n       (5) studies by the Department of Transportation have \n     documented that, since the airline industry was deregulated \n     in 1978--\n       (A) 34 small communities have lost service and many small \n     communities have had jet aircraft service replaced by \n     turboprop aircraft service;\n       (B) out of a total of 320 small communities, the number of \n     small communities being served by major air carriers declined \n     from 213 in 1978 to 33 in 1995;\n       (C) the number of small communities receiving service to \n     only one major hub airport increased from 79 in 1978 to 134 \n     in 1995; and\n       (D) the number of small communities receiving multiple-\n     carrier service decreased from 136 in 1978 to 122 in 1995; \n     and\n       (6) improving air service to small and medium-sized \n     communities that have not benefited from fare reductions and \n     improved service since deregulation will likely entail a \n     range of Federal, State, regional, local, and private sector \n     initiatives.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of my \ncolleagues, and most especially Senators Hollings, Ford, and Dorgan, in \nintroducing the ``Air Service Restoration Act of 1997.'' This \nlegislation is the result of many months of effort, first, to \nunderstand what has happened to air service in small and rural \ncommunities in the last twenty years and, then, to develop a \ncomprehensive strategy for restoring and promoting air service to these \nareas--many of which have suffered such a dramatic decline in service \nand increase in fares that the U.S. Department of Transportation refers \nto them as ``pockets of pain.''\n  By most accounts the 1978 deregulation of the airline industry has \nbeen a huge success--with lower fares, better service, and more \ncompetition enjoyed by most of the nation, as well as an airline \nindustry that has reached unprecedented levels of financial success and \nstability. But for all its successes, airline deregulation has one, \npotentially fatal, flaw--the creation of an ever-widening gap between \nthe air transportation ``haves'' and ``have-nots'', with small and \nrural communities across the nation left to choose between high-cost, \npoor-quality service or no service at all. Clearly we have not and are \nnot meeting our responsibility to foster and maintain a truly national \nair transportation system.\n  West Virginia's communities are unquestionably among the hardest hit \nin the nation when it comes to air service declines. Prior to \nderegulation, West Virginia was served by at least five major \ncommercial air carriers. We enjoyed a comprehensive route structure and \ncomfortable levels of jet service at competitive prices. In the twenty \nyears since, every major carrier, with the notable exception of U.S. \nAirways, abandoned its direct service to West Virginia. Jet service all \nbut disappeared. Three airports--Elkins, Martinsburg, and Wheeling--\nlost commercial passenger service altogether.\n  At the same time, West Virginia passengers experienced fare increases \nof 20-30 percent, in real terms, with service from regional or commuter \nairlines using smaller, turboprop planes. Some of these are solid \nairlines and offer good service, and we are thankful that they have \nstayed with us. But for many years their West Virginia product has been \nfar inferior to that provided other communities--their planes are \nsmall, their schedules thin and their prices high. Not surprisingly, \nWest Virginia businesses and passengers have responded by flying less \nor going elsewhere. At a time when the rest of the nation has \nexperienced a 75 percent increase in air traffic, passenger \nenplanements in our state have declined at every airport, with a \nstatewide decrease of nearly 40 percent.\n  My top priority over the past twenty years--the same twenty years as \nairline deregulation--has been to bring good jobs and opportunity to \nWest Virginia. Whether it's a specific project or a broad policy issue, \nfrom trade to connecting schools to the information highway, most of my \nwork is about creating economic growth in my home state. In the last \nseveral years I have begun to see and hear more and more that the lack \nof convenient and affordable air service is holding us back, stunting \neconomic growth in West Virginia just as it is in small and rural \ncommunities across the country. And unless we act now to restore and \npromote air service to under-served areas, we will never be able to \nclose the economic development gaps in any meaningful and sustained \nway.\n  Part of the change that I believe needs to take place can and must \noccur at the state and local level, where business and community \nleaders know\n\n[[Page S3440]]\n\nwhat their needs are and can develop a real stake in the future of \ntheir airports by educating consumers, attracting air service, and \nfilling airplanes. But aviation is a national issue, with global \nimplications. No small or rural community should be expected to \novercome the cumulative effect of twenty years of deregulation on its \nown. They need help, they've asked for help, and they deserve help.\n  The legislation that we introduce today is part of what I hope will \nbe a new era in our national aviation policy--an era that builds on the \nsuccesses of deregulation and takes responsibility for its failures. \nThe centerpiece of the bill is a five-year $100 million pilot program \nfor up to 40 communities, with grants of up to $500,000 to each \ncommunity for local initiatives to attract and promote service. \nCommunities would provide local matching funds of up to 25 percent, and \ncould do so directly or indirectly, through mechanisms such as seat \nguarantees. The Department of Transportation would have the authority \nto facilitate links between pilot communities and major airports by \nrequiring joint fares and interline agreements between dominant \nairlines and new service providers.\n  To administer the grant program and provide a resource for small \ncommunities both in and out of the pilot program, the bill creates a \nnew Office of Small Community Air Service Development at the Department \nof Transportation dedicated to promoting and restoring air service to \nsmall communities. Among other tasks, this office would be responsible \nfor ensuring that accurate and meaningful passenger traffic data is \navailable regarding service to small communities, as it is today for \nlarger communities.\n\n  To clarify the priority for small communities in receiving and \nretaining service to slot-controlled airports, the bill directs the \nDepartment to ensure that any slots given to air carriers for small \ncommunity air service will be withdrawn if the carrier fails to provide \nthe service.\n  To address a major infrastructure concern of small and rural \nairports, the bill establishes a pilot program allowing communities \nthat face the loss of an air traffic control tower to instead share the \ncost of funding the tower, on a contract basis, in proportion to the \ncost-benefit ratio of the tower.\n  Finally, the bill calls on the Department to review the airline \nindustry's current marketing practices--practices which many believe \nare exacerbating the decline in air service to small communities--and, \nif necessary, promulgate regulations to curb abuses that inhibit market \nentry.\n  The legislation we introduce today will begin to afford small and \nrural community air service the priority they deserve in our national \ntransportation policy. It is my hope and intent to pursue this \nlegislation in the context of the 1998 reauthorization of the Federal \nAviation Administration and Airport Improvement Program, and I look \nforward to working together with others of my colleagues, several of \nwhom have shown a real commitment to achieving needed solutions in this \narea.\n  In the global marketplace of today air service has become perhaps the \nsingle most important mode of mass transportation. When it comes to \neconomic growth, there is no substitute for good air service. If we are \nto ensure that all communities throughout the nation are prepared to \ncompete in the next century, we have no choice but to improve their \ntransportation options.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 1969. A bill to provide health benefits for workers and their \nfamilies; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                THE HEALTH CARE FOR WORKING FAMILIES ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Health Care for \nWorking Families Act.\n  Today we resume the battle for health insurance for all Americans.\n  We face a continuing crisis in health care for millions of workers \nand their families. Forty-one million Americans are uninsured. The \nnumber grew by more than one million last year, and if we do nothing, \nit will continue to grow at the same alarming rate.\n  The vast majority--85%--of these uninsured Americans--are workers or \nmembers of their families. These citizens work hard--40 hours a week, \n52 weeks of the year in most cases--but all their hard work cannot buy \nthem the health insurance they need to protect their families, because \nthey can't afford it and their employers won't provide it.\n  Every uninsured American is an American tragedy waiting to happen. \nInfants lose their chance to grow up strong and healthy because they do \nnot get critical prenatal care. A young family loses its livelihood \nbecause a breadwinner cannot afford essential medical services. Middle-\naged parents see the savings set aside to send their children to \ncollege or pay for their retirement swept away by a tidal wave of \nmedical debt.\n  These conditions should be unacceptable in America today. The time \nhas come to take a simple but important step toward the day when every \njob carries with it a guarantee of affordable family health care.\n  Every business is expected to pay a minimum wage, and to obey the \nchild labor laws. Every business is expected to provide safe and \nhealthy working conditions, and to protect against injury on the job \nthrough worker's compensation. Every business is expected to contribute \nto retirement through Social Security, and to the health needs of the \nelderly through Medicare. It is long past time for businesses also to \ncontribute to the cost of basic health insurance coverage for their \nworkers.\n  Some small firms have special problems that may call for special \nsolutions. But there can be no excuse for large firms to shirk their \nresponsibility to provide affordable health insurance for their \nworkers.\n  Under the bill we are introducing today, businesses with 50 or more \nworkers will be required to provide health insurance coverage. \nApproximately half of all uninsured employees and their families--15 \nmillion people--will gain the coverage they need and deserve. This \nlegislation is a giant step toward the day when every American will be \nguaranteed the fundamental right to health care.\n  Many--even most--businesses already provide insurance. The vast \nmajority of large business, in particular, fulfill this obligation. But \ntoo many others do not. In more and more cases, unfair competition from \nfirms that refuse to provide insurance for their workers is compelling \nother firms to reduce health benefits or drop coverage altogether.\n  Health insurance for working Americans does not have to mean \ncomplicated regulations or excessive government intervention. The \nlegislation we are introducing today is simple--less than ten pages. It \nwill not cost taxpayers a dime. It includes no specific mandated \nbenefits or burdensome red tape. It simply says that every business \nwith 50 workers or more must offer its employees coverage equal in \nvalue to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Standard Option Plan that is \navailable to every Senator and Representative and must pay at least 72% \nof the cost--the same proportion that taxpayers contribute for every \nmember of Congress.\n  The American people deserve health care for their families that is \nevery bit as good as the health care they provide to every member of \nCongress. The incremental reform enacted in recent years has helped \nmany families, but it is far from sufficient. The time has come for \nCongress to take a larger step.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1969\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care for Working \n     Families Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) every industrialized country in the world except the \n     United States guarantees the fundamental right to health care \n     to all its citizens;\n       (2) 41,000,000 Americans are without health insurance \n     coverage;\n       (3) the number of uninsured Americans is growing every \n     year;\n\n[[Page S3441]]\n\n       (4) the vast majority of uninsured Americans are workers or \n     dependents of workers;\n       (5) for more than half a century, Congress has enacted laws \n     to ensure that work is appropriately rewarded, including laws \n     establishing a minimum wage and a 40 hour work week, laws \n     ensuring safe and healthy working conditions, and laws \n     requiring employers to contribute to the cost of retirement \n     security through Social Security and Medicare; and\n       (6) as the United States approaches the 21st century, it is \n     time to enact requirements guaranteeing that jobs carry with \n     them affordable, adequate health insurance benefits.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to establish \na program to provide assistance in the conservation of neotropical \nmigratory birds; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n        the neotropical migratory bird conservation act of 1998\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1998.'' This \nlegislation, which I am introducing today with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Daschle, is designed to protect over 90 endangered \nspecies of bird spending certain seasons in the United States and other \nseasons\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\nin other nations of the Western Hemisphere. I think it is fitting that \nwe introduce this legislation on Earth Day, that day we have dedicated \nto increasing awareness of environmental issues.\n  Every year, approximately 25 million Americans travel to observe \nbirds, and 60 million American adults watch and feed birds at home. \nBirdwatching is a source of great pleasure to many Americans, as well \nas a source of important revenue to states, like my own state of \nMichigan, which attract tourists to their scenes of natural beauty. \nBirdwatching and feeding generates fully $20 billion every ear in \nrevenue across America.\n  Birdwatching is a popular activity in Michigan, and its increased \npopularity is reflected by an increase in tourist dollars being spent \nin small, rural communities. Healthy bird populations also prevent \nhundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses each year to farming \nand timber interests. They help control insect populations, thereby \npreventing crop failures and infestations.\n  Despite the enormous benefits we derive from our bird populations, \nmany of them are struggling to survive. Ninety species are listed as \nendangered or threatened in the United States. Another 124 species are \nof high conservation concern. The primary reason for these declines is \nthe degradation and loss of bird habitat.\n\n  What makes this all the more troubling is that efforts in the United \nStates to protect these birds' habitats can only be of limited utility. \nAmong bird watches' favorites, many neotropical birds are endangered or \nof high conservation concern. And several of the most popular \nneotropical species, including bluebirds, robins, goldfinches, and \norioles, migrate to and from the Caribbean and Latin America.\n  Because neotropical migratory birds range across a number of \ninternational borders every year, we must work to establish safeguards \nat both ends of their migration routes, as well as at critical stopover \nareas along their way. Only in this way can conservation efforts prove \nsuccessful.\n  Mr. President, that is why Senator Dashle and I have introduced the \n``Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act.'' This legislation will \nprotect bird habitats across international boundaries by establishing \npartnerships between the business community, nongovernmental \norganizations and foreign nations. By teaming businesses with \ninternational organizations concerned to protect the environment we can \ncombine capital with know-how. By partnering these entities with local \norganizations in countries where bird habitat is endangered we can see \nto it that local people receive the training they need to preserve this \nhabitat and maintain this critical natural resource.\n  This act establishes a three year demonstration project providing $4 \nmillion each year to help establish programs in Latin America and the \nCaribbean. These programs will manage and conserve neotropical \nmigratory bird populations. Those eligible to participate will include \nnational and international nongovernmental organizations and business \ninterests, as well as U.S. government entities.\n  The key to this act is cooperation among nongovernmental \norganizations. The federal share of each project's cost is never to \nexceed 33 percent, and half the nonfederal contribution must be in \ncash, not in-kind contributions.\n  The approach taken by this legislation differs from that of current \nprograms in that it is proactive and, by avoiding a crisis management \napproach, will prove significantly more cost effective. In addition, \nthis legislation does not call for complicated and expensive \nbureaucratic structures such as councils, commissions or multi-tiered \noversight structures. Further, this legislation will bring needed \nattention and expertise to areas now receiving relatively little \nattention in the area of environmental degradation.\n  This legislation has the support of the National Audobon Society, the \nAmerican Bird Conservancy and the Ornithological Council. These \norganizations agree with Senator Daschle and I that, by establishing \npartnerships between business, government and nongovernmental \norganizations both here and abroad we can greatly enhance the \nprotection of migratory bird habitat.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to join Senator \nSpencer Abraham to introduce the Neotropical Migratory Bird \nConservation Act.\n  First, let me commend my colleague, Senator Abraham, for all of his \nwork to develop this legislation. This bill addresses some of the \ncritical threats to wildlife habitat and species diversity and \ndemonstrates his commitment, which I strongly share, to solving the \nmany challenges we face in this regard.\n  The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act will help to ensure \nthat some of our most valuable and beautiful species of birds--those \nthat most of us take for granted, including bluebirds, goldfinches, \nrobins and orioles--may overcome the challenges posed by habitat \ndestruction and thrive for generations to come. It is not widely \nrecognized that many North American bird species once considered common \nare in decline. In fact, a total of 90 species of migratory birds are \nlisted as endangered or threatened in the United States, and another \n124 species are considered to be of high conservation concern.\n  The main cause of this decline is the loss of critical habitat \nthroughout our hemisphere. Because these birds range across \ninternational borders, it is essential that we work with nations in \nLatin America and the Caribbean to establish protected stopover areas \nduring their migrations. This bill achieves that goal by fostering \npartnerships between businesses, nongovernmental organizations and \nother nations to bring together the capital and expertise needed to \npreserve habitat throughout our hemisphere.\n  As we celebrate Earth Day, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. It has been endorsed by the National Audobon Society, the \nAmerican Bird Conservancy and the Ornithological Council. I believe \nthat it will substantially improve upon our ability to maintain \ncritical habitat in our hemisphere and help to halt the decline of \nthese important species.\n\n

SUMMIT\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Brownback, \nand Mr. Feingold) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred\n\n[[Page S3444]]\n\nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 212\n\n       Whereas Chinese dissident Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 \n     pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed at Tiananmen \n     Square in 1989 was released on April 18, 1998, from a Chinese \n     jail;\n       Whereas Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan were released from \n     prison ostensibly for medical reasons, it is clear that their \n     release into exile was intended as a political gesture to \n     diminish public U.S. criticism of China's human rights \n     practices;\n       Whereas China's ``most famous dissident'' Wei Jingsheng was \n     released on November 16, 1997, from a Chinese jail;\n       Whereas, in addition to Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, \n     thousands of other political, religious, and labor dissidents \n     are imprisoned in China and Tibet for peacefully expressing \n     their beliefs and exercising their internationally recognized \n     rights of free association and expression, including--\n       (1) Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to 6 years in prison in \n     November 1994 and honored by UNESCO in May 1997, who has a \n     heart condition;\n       (2) Chen Longde, a leading human rights advocate now \n     serving a 3-year reeducation through labor sentence imposed \n     without trial in August 1996, who has reportedly been subject \n     to repeated beatings and electric shocks at a labor camp for \n     refusing to confess his guilt;\n       (3) Li Hai, sentenced to nine years in prison on December \n     18, 1996, for collecting information on those imprisoned \n     after the 1989 crackdown; he was convicted of ``prying into \n     and gathering . . . . information about persons sentenced for \n     criminal activity during the June 4, 1989, period;''\n       (4) Yang Qinheng, apprehended February 26, 1998, and \n     assigned to 3 years' ``reeducation through labor'' in March \n     for ``disturbing social order'', who had called for \n     independent trade unions;\n       (5) Shen Liangqing, former public prosecutor and \n     petitioner, who was apprehended on February 25, 1998, and \n     assigned to 2 years' labor on April 4, 1998, for \n     ``unauthorized contact with foreign journalists'';\n       (6) Tu Guangwen, an organizer of a street protest, who was \n     sentenced by the Jiangxia district court on February 19, \n     1998, to 3 years' imprisonment after being convicted of \n     ``gathering a crowd to disrupt orderly traffic'' during a \n     demonstration by laid-off workers; and\n       (7) Ngawang Choephel, a Tibet Fullbright scholar sentenced \n     to 18 years in prison by Chinese Authorities in December 1996 \n     on charges of ``espionage;''\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China, \n     as detailed in successive annual reports on human rights by \n     the United States Department of State, routinely, \n     systematically, and massively violates the human rights of \n     its citizens, including freedom of speech, assembly, worship, \n     and peaceful political dissent;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     restricts the ability of religious adherents, including \n     Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, and others, to practice \n     outside of state-approved religious organizations, and \n     detains worshipers and clergy who participate in religious \n     services conducted outside state-approved religious \n     organizations, as well as those who refuse to register with \n     the authorities, as required;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     routinely, systematically, and massively continues to commit \n     widespread human rights abuses in Tibet, including instances \n     of death in detention, torture, arbitrary arrest, detention \n     without public trial, long detention of Tibetan nationalists \n     for peacefully expressing their religious and political \n     views, and intensified controls on religion and on freedom of \n     speech and the press, particularly for ethnic Tibetans; and\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     engages in reprehensible, brutal, and coercive family \n     planning practices, including forced abortions and forced \n     sterilization, resulting in widespread infanticide, \n     particularly of female infants: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) in the upcoming, proposed summit between President \n     Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China, President Clinton \n     should demand the immediate and unconditional release, \n     consistent with established international principles of human \n     rights, of all persons remaining imprisoned in China and \n     Tibet for political or religious reasons; and\n       (2) the President should submit a report to Congress as \n     soon as possible after the proposed summit in China \n     concerning his progress in securing the release of persons \n     remaining imprisoned in China and Tibet, as described in \n     paragraph (1); and\n       (3) the release of one prisoner into exile does not change \n     the fundamental flaws within the Chinese judicial and penal \n     system;\n       (4) the U.S. policy of granting concessions to the Chinese \n     government in exchange for the release of high profile \n     prisoners is an offense to the thousands of dissidents \n     remaining in prison; and\n       (5) the President should not offer to lift the sanctions \n     imposed on China after the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen \n     Square.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, yesterday's papers were replete with \nstories praising the People's Republic of China for releasing Wang Dan, \na leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstration at Tiananmen Square \nwhich was crushed by China's military. This release follows, by less \nthan six months, the release of Wei Jingshen--arguably China's best \nknown human rights dissident. While these are certainly positive \ndevelopments, it is important to note that both of these releases are \ntainted by the fact that neither dissident was allowed to stay in their \nown country, but were instead exiled to the United States for ``medical \ntreatment.'' These exiles conveniently allow China to gain favor with \nthe United States while simultaneously allowing them to silence two of \ntheir loudest critics by banishing them to the United States.\n  Mr. President, the truth is that China appears to be using its \ndissidents as pawns in an international game of chess with the United \nStates to gain military, technological and other favors from the \nClinton Administration. In fact, the release of these two prisoners \nappears to be payment for the United States decision not to support a \nresolution condemning China's human rights record at the recently \ncompleted U.N. Conference on Human Rights and for the United States \ncertification of China to join a pact on ballistic missile technology. \nIt is amazing that this great country, which has long stood beside \npolitical prisoners around the world, is willing to be a player in \nChina game of siphoning out political prisoners in return for \ninternational favors.\n  Let us not forget that the People's Republic of China continues to \nhave one of the worst human rights records in the world. A record that \nincludes torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, forced abortion and sterilization, crackdowns on independent \nCatholic and Protestant bishops and believers, brutal oppression of \nethnic minorities and religions in Tibet and Xinjiang, absolute \nintolerance of free political speech or free press, and most recently, \nthe harvesting and selling of human organs.\n  Likewise, let us not forget that China continues to threaten its \nneighbors, most notably Taiwan and let us not forget that China \ncontinues to violate international agreements on non-proliferation, \nhaving recently been caught negotiating to sell chemicals to Iran which \ncould be used to produce weapons-grade uranium.\n  Mr. President, we must end this deadly and humiliating game with \nChina, and demand the immediate release of the hundreds, if not \nthousands, of political, religious, and labor dissidents currently \nimprisoned in China for having peacefully expressed their beliefs and \nfor having exercised their basic human rights. This list includes the \nlikes of Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to six years in 1994; Chen \nLongde, a leading human rights advocate serving a three year ``re-\neducation'' sentence which began in 1995; Li Qingxi, a unionist \narrested in 1998, and many, many others. While I hope that the recent \nrelease of two of China's most notable dissidents was just the \nbeginning, and that the remaining political prisoners held in the \nPeople's Republic of China will soon be released, I see little evidence \nthat this is the case.\n  Therefore, I urge my fellow Senators to support my Sense of the \nSenate Resolution calling on the President to demand that China release \nall such prisoners prior to their upcoming U.S.-China summit meeting, \nand that the President report to this body on the progress being made \nby the administration in securing the release of these prisoners \nimmediately following this planned summit.\n  Mr. President, this is a reasonable resolution--a resolution that \nonce again puts this body on record supporting those that would give up \ntheir freedom in support of the freedom of their fellow countrymen. I \ncan think of no more important issue. I thank my Senate colleagues for \ntheir support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3443-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3444-S3445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 213--CONGRATULATING THE UNITED STATES ARMY RESERVE\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for Mr. Helms (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Faircloth, \nMr. Kempthorne, Mr. Warner, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Smith of New Ham, Mr. \nMcCain, Mr. Robb, Mr. Levin, Mr. Hutchinson, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Ashcroft, \nMr. Kennedy, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Hagel, Mr.\n\n[[Page S3445]]\n\nCoats, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Lieberman, \nMr. Lott, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Stevens)) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Qualified teachers in small classes can provide \n     students with more individualized attention, spend more time \n     on instruction and less on other tasks, cover more material \n     effectively, and are better able to work with parents to help \n     the parents further their children's education.\n       (2) Rigorous research has shown that students attending \n     small classes in the early grades make more rapid educational \n     progress than the students in larger classes, and that those \n     achievement gains persist through at least the 8th grade. For \n     example:\n       (A) In a landmark 4-year experimental study of class size \n     reduction in grades kindergarten through grade 3 in \n     Tennessee, researchers found that students in smaller classes \n     earned significantly higher scores on basic skills tests in \n     all 4 years and in all types of schools, including urban, \n     rural, and suburban schools.\n       (B) After 2 years in reduced class sizes, students in the \n     Flint, Michigan Public School District improved their reading \n     scores by 44 percent.\n       (3) The benefits of smaller classes are greatest for lower-\n     achieving, minority, poor, and inner-city children. One study \n     found that urban 4th-graders in smaller than average classes \n     were \\3/4\\ of a school year ahead of their counterparts in \n     larger than average classes.\n       (4) Smaller classes allow teachers to identify and work \n     sooner with students who have learning disabilities and, \n     potentially, can reduce those students' need for special \n     education services in the later grades.\n       (5) Students in smaller classes are able to become more \n     actively engaged in learning than their peers in large \n     classes.\n       (6) Efforts to improve educational outcomes by reducing \n     class sizes in the early grades are likely to be successful \n     only if well-qualified teachers are hired to fill additional \n     classroom positions and if teachers received intensive, \n     continuing training in working effectively in smaller \n     classroom settings.\n       (7) State certified and licensed teachers help ensure high \n     quality instruction in the classroom.\n       (8) According to the National Commission on Teaching and \n     America's Future, the most important influence on student \n     achievement is the expertise of their teachers. One New York \n     City study comparing high- and low-achieving elementary \n     schools with similar student characteristics, found that more \n     than 90 percent of the variation in achievement in \n     mathematics and reading was due to differences in teacher \n     qualifications.\n       (9) Our Nation needs more qualified teachers to meet \n     changing demographics and to help students meet high \n     standards, as demonstrated by the following:\n       (A) Over the next decade, our Nation will need to hire over \n     2,000,000 teachers to meet increasing student enrollments and \n     teacher retirements.\n       (B) 1 out of 4 high school teachers does not have a major \n     or minor in the main subject that they teach. This is true \n     for more than 30 percent of mathematics teachers.\n       (C) In schools with the highest minority enrollments, \n     students have less than a 50 percent chance of getting a \n     science or mathematics teacher who holds a degree in that \n     field.\n       (D) In 1991, 25 percent of new public school teachers had \n     not completed the requirements for a license in their main \n     assignment field. This number increased to 27 percent by \n     1994, including 11 percent who did not have a license.\n       (10) We need more teachers who are adequately prepared for \n     the challenges of the 21st century classroom, as demonstrated \n     by the fact that--\n       (A) 50 percent of teachers have little or no experience \n     using technology in the classroom; and\n       (B) in 1994, only 10 percent of new teachers felt they were \n     prepared to integrate new technology into their instruction.\n       (11) Teacher quality cannot be further compromised to meet \n     the demographic demand for new teachers and smaller class \n     sizes. Comprehensive improvements in teacher preparation and \n     development programs are also necessary to ensure the \n     effectiveness of new teachers and the academic success of \n     students in the classroom. These comprehensive improvements \n     should include encouraging more institutions of higher \n     education that operate teacher preparation programs to work \n     in partnership with local educational agencies and elementary \n     and secondary schools; providing more hands-on, classroom \n     experience to prospective teachers; creating mentorship \n     programs for new teachers; providing high quality content \n     area training and classroom skills for new teachers; and \n     training teachers to incorporate technology into the \n     classroom.\n       (12) Efforts should be made to provide prospective teachers \n     with a greater knowledge of instructional programs that are \n     research-based, of demonstrated effectiveness, replicable in \n     diverse and challenging circumstances, and supported by \n     networks of experts and experienced practitioners.\n       (13) Several States have begun serious efforts to reduce \n     class sizes in the early elementary grades, but these actions \n     may be impeded by financial limitations or difficulties in \n     hiring qualified teachers.\n       (14) The Federal Government can assist in this effort by \n     providing funding for class size reductions in grades 1 \n     through 3, and by helping to ensure that the new teachers \n     brought into the classroom are well-qualified.\n\n     SEC. ____02. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress should support \n     efforts to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes in \n     first, second, and third grades to an average of 18 students \n     per class all across America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     HUTCHINSON AMENDMENT NO. 2296\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON proposed an amendment to amendment No. 2295 proposed \nby Mrs. Murray to the bill, H.R. 2646, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after ``TITLE ____'' and insert the following:\n                          --SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n     SEC. ____01. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of the United States know that effective \n     teaching takes place when the people of the United States \n     begin (A) helping children master basic academics, (B) \n     engaging and involving parents, (C) creating safe and orderly \n     classrooms, and (D) getting dollars to the classroom.\n       (2) Our Nation's children deserve an educational system \n     which will provide opportunities to excel.\n       (3) States and localities must spend a significant amount \n     of Federal education tax dollars applying for and \n     administering Federal education dollars.\n       (4) Several States have reported that although the States \n     receive less than 10 percent of their education funding from \n     the Federal Government, more than 50 percent of their \n     paperwork is associated with those Federal dollars.\n       (5) While it is unknown exactly what percentage of Federal \n     education dollars reaches the classroom, a recent audit of \n     New York City public schools found that only 43 percent of \n     their local education budget reaches the classroom; further, \n     it is thought that only 85 percent of funds administered by \n     the Department of Education for elementary and secondary \n     education reach the school district level; and even if 65 \n     percent of Federal education funds reach the classroom, it \n     still means that billions of dollars are not directly spent \n     on children in the classroom.\n       (6) American students are not performing up to their full \n     academic potential, despite the more than 760 Federal \n     education programs, which span 39 Federal agencies at the \n     price of nearly $100,000,000,000 annually.\n       (7) According to the Digest of Education Statistics, in \n     1993 only $141,598,786,000 out of $265,285,370,000 spent on \n     elementary and secondary education was spent on instruction.\n       (8) According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics, in 1994 only 52 percent of staff employed in \n     public elementary and secondary school systems were teachers.\n       (9) Too much of our Federal education funding is spent on \n     bureaucracy, and too little is spent on our Nation's youth.\n       (10) Getting 95 percent of Department of Education \n     elementary and secondary education funds to the classroom \n     could provide approximately $2,094 in additional funding per \n     classroom across the United States.\n       (11) More education funding should be put in the hands of \n     someone in a child's classroom who knows the child's name.\n       (12) President Clinton has stated: ``We cannot ask the \n     American people to spend more on education until we do a \n     better job with the money we've got now.''.\n       (13) President Clinton and Vice President Gore agree that \n     the reinventing of public education will not begin in \n     Washington but in communities across the United States and \n     that the people of the United States must ask fundamental \n     questions about how our Nation's public school systems' \n     dollars are spent.\n       (14) President Clinton and Vice President Gore agree that \n     in an age of tight budgets, our Nation should be spending \n     public funds on teachers and children, not on unnecessary \n     overhead and bloated bureaucracy.\n\n     SEC. ____02. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Department of \n     Education, States, and local educational agencies should work \n     together to ensure that not less than 95 percent of all funds \n     appropriated for the purpose of carrying out elementary and \n     secondary education programs administered by the Department \n     of Education is spent for our Nation's children in their \n     classrooms.\n\n[[Page S3452]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        COATS AMENDMENT NO. 2297\n\n  Mr. COATS proposed an amendment to the bill, H.R. 2646, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end add the following:\n     TITLE ____--ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE TO MAKE SCHOLARSHIP DONATIONS\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, today I am submitting an amendment to \nthe resolution to ratify the accession of Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This \namendment addresses future new membership in the alliance.\n  28 countries in central Asia and eastern Europe that have applied for \nNATO membership or may aspire to join at a future date when they can \nmeet NATO criteria. Today we are considering extending the NATO \nsecurity umbrella to only three countries--Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic. It is important that we have a clear understanding that \nthe expansion process may go much further than this initial round.\n  In January 1994, the Administration adopted the Partnership for Peace \nprogram to provide a framework for NATO's evaluation of states that are \nconsidered to be candidates for alliance membership. In addition to the \nfirst three countries invited to join NATO, nine other Partnership for \nPeace countries have begun the formal application process for \nmembership--Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, \nSlovakia, Slovenia, and the Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia. \nMoreover, another 15 countries have expressed an interest in NATO by \njoining the Partnership for Peace. These countries include Armenia, \nAustria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Finland, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgystan, \nMoldova, Russia, Switzerland, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. \nAlthough not associated with Partnership for Peace, Croatia has \nexpressed hope that they too will be admitted some day.\n  The extensive territory covered by these NATO hopefuls begs for more \ninformation on the nature and mission of the alliance in the future. My \namendment would require an annual report to the Senate on United States \nGovernment discussions with the governments of each of these countries \non their possible accession. The reports would include the expected \ntimetable for those\n\n[[Page S3457]]\n\ncountries to meet the criteria for NATO membership and how the \nAdministration believes the functioning of NATO would be altered if \nthey were to become a member.\n  Just how far are we willing to extend the NATO alliance? I am not \nquestioning whether Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic deserve to \nbecome alliance members. All three have made remarkable gains since the \nend of the Cold War. But in the future, other of these 25 nations will \nmeet the criteria to join NATO and may be no less deserving of \nmembership. Now is the time for the Senate to begin thinking about the \nlong-term indications of a decision to open NATOs doors to the East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3456-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to call my \ncolleagues' attention to the April 30, 1998 Grand Opening of the new, \nand permanent, home of Gilda's Club, Metro Detroit in Royal Oak, \nMichigan. Gilda's Club is a support community for men, women and \nchildren who are living with cancer as well as their families and \nfriends.\n  Gilda's Club is named for the late comedienne Gilda Radner, a Detroit \nnative who died at the age of 42 after a courageous fight against \ncancer. Gilda first became known for her portrayals of irreverent \ncharacters on ``Saturday Night Live.'' She also appeared on Broadway \nand in movies. Shortly before she died, Gilda wrote ``It's Always \nSomething,'' a book about her experience living with cancer. Gilda's \nClub was born from Gilda Radner's wish for all people with cancer to \nhave as strong a support group as she had.\n  Gilda's Club aims to provide a friendly, residential haven for cancer \npatients and their friends and families. In this home-like setting, \npeople living with or affected by cancer can share their experiences, \nparticipate in workshops and lectures, and attend social events. \nGilda's Club is designed to enhance medical treatment with the \nemotional and social support which can be so crucial for those living \nwith the disease.\n  Thousands of people from communities throughout Michigan pulled \ntogether to make Gilda's Club's permanent home a reality. Many \norganizations and businesses have hosted fundraising events and have \ncommitted their own money to the cause. A comedy event is held once a \nyear to raise funds for Gilda's Club, and thousands of people walk in \nthe Annual 5K Gilda's Club Family Walk and Block Party. In 1997, this \nevent involved more than three thousand walkers and raised more than \n$175,000.\n  Mr. President, people living with cancer have long been able to rely \non gifted and dedicated doctors to help them fight the disease which \naffects their bodies. Gilda's Club, Metro Detroit offers a critical \nsupplement--emotional uplift--to the care cancer patients receive from \ntheir physicians. By promoting hope and healing, Gilda's Club will have \nan impact on thousands of people. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nrecognizing the efforts of the many people who have made Gilda's Club, \nMetro Detroit possible, and in extending our prayers and high hopes to \neveryone who walks through its doors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3457-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3457-S3458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, last week, the mastermind of one of \nthis century's most horrific crimes against humanity died apparently \npeacefully in his sleep. Pol Pot, founder and leader of the Khmer \nRouge, architect of the grisly genocide which claimed at least one \nmillion Cambodian lives between 1975 and 1979, died at the age of 73. \nWhile some may see Pol Pot's death as final closure on one of the most \nshockingly brutal and despotic reigns in history, his death should not \nabsolve the international community from seeking justice for the people \nof Cambodia.\n  The scars from Pol Pot's four-year reign of terror remain in \nCambodia, and on the face of humanity. History will judge us. Did they \ndo enough? Did they do what they could? Did they even care? If those \nassessments were written today, the community of nations would be found \nwanting. The fact that Pol Pot lived to his dying day having never been \npunished for his crimes is the best evidence of that.\n  When Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge captured the Cambodian capitol of \nPhnom Penh in April 1975, he and his lieutenants began a barbaric \ncampaign to exterminate intellectuals, foreigners, bureaucrats, \nmerchants, and countless others who did not fit Pol Pot's vision of a \n``pure'' Cambodia. Many thousands more were forced into slave labor \ncamps, eventually dying from starvation, torture, and disease. I have \nmet some of the survivors of that nightmare who escaped to Thailand and \nultimately resettled in the United States, including in Vermont. They \nare a living tribute to the invincibility of the human spirit.\n  Four years later in 1979 Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge were forced from \npower, but they left behind a ghastly swath of death and carnage that \ncounted at least one million Cambodians dead and a country that to this \nday is trying to cope with the ghosts of that era. Virtually every \nCambodian now alive knows or is related to someone who perished under \nthe Khmer Rouge.\n  Although Pol Pot was the architect of the killing fields of Cambodia, \nthose in his inner circle were responsible for carrying out his \ncommands. Many of Pol Pot's chief lieutenants still roam the Cambodian \ncountryside, reportedly along the Thai border. Men like Khieu Samphan, \nformer President of Kampuchea; Nuon Chea, former second in command and \nsomeone described as Pol Pot's ``alter ego;'' and Ta Mok, a Khmer Rouge \nleader whose portfolio included killing Cambodians who had worked for \nthe old Lon Nol government. Ta Mok was nicknamed ``the Butcher.''\n  The wanton killing did not end decades ago. In 1996 British mine \nclearer Christopher Howes and his Cambodian interpreter, Houn Hourth, \nwere abducted by Khmer Rouge soldiers and later led to a field and shot \nin the back. According to recent reports of interviews with Khmer Rouge \nofficials, aides close to Pol Pot ordered the killing. Mr. Howes posed \nno threat to Pol Pot or the Khmer Rouge. He was in Cambodia working to \nmake the country safer for the Cambodian people by helping remove one-\nby-one the millions of landmines sown in the fields. Today, Cambodia is \ninfested with mines which continue to maim and kill the innocent.\n  I am encouraged that the Administration appears ready to seek some \nformal mechanism to bring to justice key members of Pol Pot's inner \ncircle. A number of possible approaches have been suggested, including \na war crimes tribunal for Cambodia like the existing tribunal for the \nformer Yugoslavia, or an international penal tribunal that includes \nCambodian participation. These ideas and others merit further \ndiscussion as we examine appropriate ways to seek justice for the \nCambodian people.\n  The United Nations has also named a three-person team to investigate \nthe remaining Khmer Rouge leaders. This too, is an encouraging sign.\n  Whatever it takes, we must not let the fact that Pol Pot eluded \njustice diminish our resolve to apprehend and punish the members of his \ninner circle who are also guilty of crimes against humanity. History \nwill judge us harshly if we turn our backs now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two editorials be printed in the Record.\n  The editorials follow:\n\n               [From The New York Times, April 17, 1998]\n\n                        Pol Pot Escapes Justice\n\n       Pol Pot, elusive to the end, died just as the world finally \n     seemed to be serious about bringing him to justice. No \n     punishment, however, could have fit the evil he committed. \n     From 1975 to 1979, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge wiped out a large \n     fraction of Cambodia's people, and left the rest with a \n     country submerged in violence and pain.\n       The Khmer Rouge regime was surely the most bizarre in \n     modern history, its philosophy made up of one part Maoism and \n     three parts paranoia. It emptied the cities and marched \n     Cambodians to the countryside to starve on state farms. \n     Having an education, or even wearing glasses, could get one \n     killed as a class enemy. Thousands of Khmer Rouge's own \n     cadres were forced to confess to spying and tortured to \n     death. There is probably no adult in Cambodia today unscarred \n     by the loss of a close relative. Political life, too, is \n     still poisoned. The nation's spectacular misrule stems in \n     part from the scarcity of educated people and the political \n     habits learned in four years of terror.\n       The Vietnamese invasion that ousted the Khmer Rouge in 1979 \n     forced Pol Pot and his men into the jungle, where they \n     continue to wage a guerrilla war to this day. Many Khmer \n     Rouge troops have received amnesty and become wealthy and \n     influential members of Hun Sen's Government, including Mr. \n     Hun Sen himself. Pol Pot's death will rob investigators of \n     the chance to try him and to hear about the crimes of Khmer \n     Rouge leaders who are still in positions of power.\n       Pol Pot, who became a Communist while on a scholarship in \n     Paris in the early 1950's, never apologized. In an interview \n     last October, the only one he had granted since 1978, he said \n     that whatever he had done he did for his country. He disputed \n     that millions had died but acknowledged that hundreds of \n     thousands had. Those killings were necessary, he said, \n     because the Vietnamese wanted to assassinate him and swallow \n     up Cambodia. His conscience was clear.\n       This was said by an old man so weakened by malaria and \n     stroke that he could barely walk. He always had a gentle \n     manner and soft voice, and in the interview smiled \n     constantly. He did not seem a man who could have presided \n     over the deaths of more than a million people. Three months \n     before the interview, however, the Khmer Rouge put him on \n     trial, not for the crimes of his regime but for his murder of \n     a political rival and the man's family. The camera showed the \n     Khmer Rouge troops watching the trial chanting robotically, \n     ``Crush, crush, crush.'' He, of course, had taught them that. \n     The soft-spoken old man of the interview was a mirage. His \n     disciples showed who Pol Pot really was.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From The Washington Post, April 17, 1998]\n\n                             After Pol Pot\n\n       The reported death of Pol Pot in the Cambodian jungle means \n     that one of this century's most egregious mass murderers will \n     not stand trial or be held accountable for his crimes. But it \n     should not mean that Pol Pot's accomplices now will be let \n     off the hook, and it does not mean that other nations with an \n     interest in Cambodia's future should ease their pressure for \n     a restoration of democracy there.\n       Between 1975 and 1979 more than 1 million and probably \n     closer to 2 million Cambodians were executed or died from the \n     effects of torture, deliberate starvation and brutal \n     overwork. Pol Pot was the nation's communist leader at the \n     time; he presided over the deaths of one-fifth of his \n     population. But he was not alone. According to painstaking \n     documentation assembled by the Cambodia Genocide Project at \n     Yale University (partially funded by the State Department), a \n     standing committee, on March 30, 1976, formally established \n     an integrated national network of extermination centers. \n     These were responsible for an estimated 1 million deaths of \n     people who are now buried in 20,000 mass graves. Eight to 10 \n     members of that committee are still alive and at large.\n       The tendency on the part of the international community \n     will be to abandon efforts to bring to trial those guilty of \n     crimes against humanity. With Pol Pot gone, attention will \n     fade; some believe his colleagues killed him for just that \n     reason. Moreover, some of Pol Pot's onetime comrades are in \n     league with Cambodia's current leader, Hun Sen. It would make \n     diplomats' jobs easier to let them be. It would also be an \n     affront to justice and to Cambodia's many victims.\n       The same international fatigue is emerging with respect to \n     Hun Sen, who seized\n\n[[Page S3459]]\n\n     power in a coup last July. Officials from the United States, \n     Japan, Cambodia's neighbors and other nations will meet in \n     Bangkok on Sunday to decide whether to resume some aid to his \n     regime, at least to help organize an election he wants to \n     hold in July. Hun Sen hopes the election will legitimize his \n     authoritarian rule. Some in Bangkok will want to go forward \n     because Hun Sen has allowed deposed prime minister Prince \n     Ranariddh to return to Cambodia, supposedly a gesture of \n     reconciliation.\n       But political killings of Ranariddh supporters continue, \n     and no one has been brought to justice for more than 40 past \n     murders; Hun Sen's opponents live in fear and with limited \n     access to the media; no impartial courts or electoral \n     commission exist. Until these conditions change, a credible \n     election is impossible. The United States and its allies \n     should not put themselves in the position of blessing any \n     other kind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3458-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3459-S3460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EARTH DAY 1998\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to take the \nopportunity to address our environment and energy resources this Earth \nDay 1998.\n  My perspective is derived from my quarter-century in the United \nStates Senate, wherein I have devoted much of my time to environmental \nand energy concerns. When I started my tenure here in 1973, the \ncommemoration of Earth Day was three years young. During the ensuing \nyears, I have witnessed great strides towards the improvement of our \nnation's environment. We are uniquely fortunate to be prosperous enough \nto consciously choose to promote environmental concerns and conserve \nresources. This Earth Day 1998 should focus on creating ways to not \nonly continue these improvements in our own country, but also assist \nother nations in improving their ability to protect the world's \nenvironment. The earth is currently the only home we all share.\n  I would like to think that I have contributed to the continuing \nUnited States environmental improvement during my years of public \nservice. I actively participated in the multi-year debate on the 1977 \namendments to the Clean Air Act, and I am pleased to say, played a key \nrole in shaping the 1990 amendments which has reaped substantial \ndecreases in air pollutants since the first Earth Day in 1970.\n  Through passage of the Clean Water Act and reauthorization of the \nSafe Drinking Water Act, the United States of America has vastly \nimproved the quality of its rivers, lakes, and coastal waters, and has \nthe safest drinking water in the world. Communities, while suffering \nsome hardships, have been able to decrease emissions, provide clean, \nsafe public areas for their citizens, and still remain a world economic \nleader. We have learned that costly regulation is not the solution, but \ncooperation with and incentives for the business community, as well as \nproviding local control over local concerns, improves everyone's way of \nlife.\n  It is from the vantage point of my years of service in environmental \nand energy issues that I speak today about the divergence in regulation \nand policy from the best interests of our global climate. Several \nexamples can be gleaned from the recent debates regarding emission \nstandards and the global climate change document which emerged from \nKyoto, Japan in December.\n  Remember, since 1970, air pollution in this country has been steadily \ndeclining, despite the fact that the U.S. population has increased by \nalmost 30% and vehicle travel has more than doubled. Now, I believe \nanyone will tell you they want clean air. However, one must also \nrealize that any environmental improvement comes at some economic cost \nin our industrialized world. The United States may be responsible for \n20 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, but it also \nresponsible for producing 26 percent of the world's goods and services. \nAnd we still have some of the most stringent environmental standards \naround. We need to keep finding ways to improve air quality, while \nmaintaining a standard of living that is envied the world over.\n  American cities have just recently been able to achieve the stringent \nair quality standards, and air quality is improving. In my home state \nof New Mexico, Albuquerque was one of the first U.S. cities to be \nremoved from the list of violators of national carbon monoxide \nstandards. Let's let all communities continue to improve, rather than \nimpose strict and costly new air quality standards before we know that \nthey are based in sound science.\n  I believe that many of my distinguished colleagues here in the Senate \nknow I have long been a strong proponent of basing governmental \ndecision making on sound science. Indeed, in both the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 1990 and the Safe Drinking Water Act of last Congress, I \nfought hard to make sure ``sound science'' provisions were included in \nthe legislation as a matter of policy. There has been some question \nabout the scientific validity of the global warming theory. Theories do \nchange. It was not all that long ago that my children were being taught \nin school that we were approaching another ice age.\n  However, assuming that global climate change is occurring and \nemissions need to be reduced to improve the global climate, what is the \nlogic of exempting developing countries from any global treaty aimed at \nreducing those emissions? Many developing countries, like China or \nIndia, are predicted to rapidly exceed developed countries' emission \nlevels. Shouldn't every country be bound to reduce their carbon dioxide \nemissions? Why should this country bear the burden in this inequitable \narrangement that will not reduce net emissions levels?\n  Do not misunderstand me. We all have to live on this planet; we all \nshould live well and live in a clean environment. I do not believe \nthese goals are contradictory. Progress is not a curse. This nation is \nblessed to be leaders in Environmental protection and to also enjoy \nmodern conveniences. I do applaud the fact that the climate change \ndebate has focused some attention on looking to alternative and cleaner \nfuel sources.\n  I do sometimes find it ironic that those environmental activists who \nspeak the loudest about a dirty environment oppose development of the \nsafest, cleanest energy source available in quantities to sustain our \nmodern needs: nuclear energy.\n  As we leave the 20th Century and head for a new millennium, we truly \nneed to confront these strategic energy issues with careful logic and \nsound science.\n  We live in the dominant economic, military, and cultural entity in \nthe world. Our principles of government and economics are increasingly \nbecoming the principles of the world. We can afford a clean world. As \ndeveloping countries try to emulate our nation's success, we will find \nourselves competing for resources that fuel modern economics.\n  I have pledged to initiate a more forthright discussion of nuclear \npolicy. We often define environmental debates in terms of ``us versus \nthem.'' When it comes to global environment there is no them. We are \nall environmentalists. Nobody belittles the fundamental need for clean \nair and water. Some activists make their cause all-important, from \nwhichever direction they come, and do not focus on what is right or \nfair. I believe that the emotional response is not always the logical \nalternative.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I have faced criticism \nfrom both sides on some of my positions. Now, the President has \noutlined a program to reduce U.S. production of carbon dioxide and \nother greenhouse gases below 1990 levels by some time between 2008 and \n2012. Unfortunately, the President's goals are not achievable without \nseriously impacting our economy.\n  Our national laboratories have studied the issue. Their report \nindicates that to get to the President's goals we would have to impose \na $50/ton carbon tax. That would result in an increase of 12.5 cents/\ngallon for gas and 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour for electricity--almost a \ndoubling a of the current cost of coal or natural gas-generated \nelectricity. However, Nuclear energy can help meet the global goal.\n  I was very disappointed that the talks in Kyoto did not include any \nserious discussion about nuclear energy. As I have pointed out before, \nin 1996 alone, nuclear power plants prevented the release of 147 metric \ntons of carbon, 2.5 million tons of nitrogen oxides, and 5 million tons \nof sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. Nuclear power is now only \nproviding 20% of the United States' electricity, but those utilities' \nemissions of greenhouse gases were 25% lower than they would have been \nfrom fossil fuels.\n\n[[Page S3460]]\n\n  In the aspect of recognizing nuclear energy as a clean, economic fuel \nalternative, the United States has thus far failed to take the lead. \nOther countries, such as France, Japan, and Russia, have recognized the \nimportance of nuclear energy sources. And there are many more \nbeneficial uses of nuclear technologies, from the destruction of \ndangerous organisms in our food to enjoying healthier lives from \nmedical procedures dependent on nuclear processes. The notation on our \ncalendar should read that today, Earth Day, is the day we should begin \nto catch up with other countries that have prudently decided to use \nmore nuclear power because it is good for the environment and makes \ngood sense.\n  I realize, however, that we cannot address the issue of nuclear \nenergy without discussing the problem of nuclear waste. This should not \ndeter us from a prudent course; we must, and we can, find ways to \naddress nuclear waste safely. Currently there are exciting scientific \nideas being developed to utilize the 60-75% of energy available in \nspent nuclear fuel rods while still reducing the half-life of residual \nmaterial.\n  I encourage debate this Earth Day on ways to improve the world's \neconomy while maintaining a clean environment. Exploring nuclear energy \nissue is but one way. And indeed, the issue of energy use and \nenvironment is pertinent on more than one day a year. Let us just \nreflect on the possibilities for the new millennium as we proudly \nreview our past successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3459-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE J.P. ``COTTON'' KNOX FAMILY--A 20TH CENTURY AMERICAN FAMILY\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat 20th century American family from the state of Illinois--the J.P. \n``Cotton'' Knox family. Through the industrial age, the Great \nDepression, two world wars, and presidents from Teddy Roosevelt to Bill \nClinton, the Knox family has spanned the American Century. We take a \nmoment today to reflect on their history and their contribution to our \nnation.\n  It all began with J.P. ``Cotton'' Knox, born November 16, 1880, and \nhis wife Esther Loretta Knox, born April 11, 1885--both in Sangamon \nCounty, Illinois. They started courting at the turn of the century, \nmarried in 1907 and lived on a small farm west of Curran in Sangamon \nCounty where J.P. shucked corn by hand in the moonlight.\n  During the first quarter of the 20th century, the family grew \nrapidly. Thomas Dickerson, J.P. and Esther's first child, was born July \n8, 1908. James Donald came next on November 24, 1909 and was followed \nby Kathryn Loretta on May 9, 1912, John Louis on July 23, 1914, Charles \nCarroll on November 21, 1916, Lawrence William on January 26, 1919, \nHoward Eugene on March 29, 1921, Paul Edward on January 18, 1923, and \nJoseph Patrick on February 10, 1925. Each child was born healthy and at \nhome except for Howard Eugene, who was born in the hospital because of \na scarlet fever epidemic.\n  In the second quarter of the 20th century, the family struggled \nthrough the Great Depression along with the rest of the nation. Kathryn \nhad grown old enough that she was able to serve as relief pitcher and \nback-up quarterback for her mother. J.P. was elected Coroner of \nSangamon County in 1932 and instilled in his children the importance of \nvoting because it was a duty and a privilege as an American.\n  Perhaps the most remarkable chapter in the family's history came when \nthe United States entered World War II following the bombing of Pearl \nHarbor in December 1941. Thomas, the oldest, was 33 and married with \nthree children when the war began. As CEO of Doyle Freight Lines based \nin Saginaw, Michigan, he was declared an essential man in an essential \nindustry. The Governor of Michigan appointed him as coordinator of \ntransporting supplies to military bases in certain Midwest states. \nAfter the war, he was listed in Who's Who in the Midwest.\n  The other brothers, one by one, joined the military, even though some \ncould have remained on the homefront. Lawrence, who worked in the FBI \nin Washington, was exempt from military service but chose to enlist in \nthe Marines. Joseph was the last child left home with J.P. and Esther. \nHe could have applied for a deferment but chose to serve with the \napproval of his parents. Three weeks after graduating from high school \nin 1943, he was in the Navy. Carroll was the only brother who did not \ngo overseas, and served as a medical corpsman in the Navy in San Diego, \nCalifornia. Of the seven brothers who served, three were in the Navy, \nthree in the Army and one in the Marines.\n  J.P. and Esther would have been all alone had it not been for Kathryn \nand her three children who lived with them when Kathryn's husband \njoined the Navy. Kathryn provided tremendous support to her parents, \nwho had a lot to worry about with six of their eight sons in harm's \nway. She kept their morale high until, amazingly, all seven of the Knox \nboys in the military returned home safely with honorable discharges \nafter the war. Combined, they gave 20 years, six months of service, \nincluding nearly 13 years overseas.\n  The third quarter of the 20th century had just begun when J.P. passed \naway in 1951. He was eulogized with a one-quarter page editorial by \nV.Y. Dallman, editor of the Illinois State Register in Springfield, \nIllinois. Esther passed away in 1972. All nine children were employed \nin various fields and raising families of their own. Joseph followed in \nhis father's political footsteps, serving several terms as Clerk of the \nCircuit Court of Sangamon County and Public Health Commissioner for the \nCity of Springfield. To this day, he insists the voters were not voting \nfor him, but rather for the Knox family. His was simply the name that \nhappened to be on the ballot.\n  In the last quarter of the 20th century, three of the Knox children \npassed away--Thomas in 1986, Howard in 1987 and Louis in 1993. Six \nsiblings remain--all in reasonably good health.\n  As the 21st century approaches, we wish the Knox family well and \nthank them for their service to the country and the state of Illinois. \nAnd I ask that my statement be included in the Record so that future \ngenerations of the J.P. ``Cotton'' Knox family will know that their \nforebears were proud to be Americans and proud to serve their \nnation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3460-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 83D ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n83d anniversary of the Armenian genocide. On this sad occasion, my \nthoughts and sympathies are with the Armenian people as they remember \nthe horrors of the events 83 years ago.\n  It is with a great sense of sorrow that we mark the 83d year since \nthe tragic genocide and exile of the Armenian people. The senseless \nmurder and expulsion of 1.5 million Armenians through a staged campaign \nof the Turkish Ottoman Empire has been one of the most sobering events \nin modern history. The Armenian Genocide has the uneviable distinction \nof being the first genocide in the 20th century. This fact alone \nunderscores the seriousness of the events between 1915 and 1918, and it \nshould remind us of the need to keep all those who perished during the \nGenocide alive in our memory.\n  We pause now to ensure that the Armenian Genocide will never slip \ninto the recesses of history. While humankind has the ability to \nsponsor acts of great kindness and sacrifice, we also have the capacity \nfor great evil. Along with the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide \nsignifies our ability to promote evil, but if we close our eyes to the \ntragedies of the past, we risk the chance of repeating them in the \nfuture.\n  Sadly, the Armenian American community has its roots in the Armenian \nGenocide. Many individuals living here in the United States either lost \nfamily members at the hands of the Ottomans, or are survivors \nthemselves. They have risen above adversity to become prominent and \nsuccessful citizens despite a tragic past. The Armenian American \ncommunity has been vocal in expressing its anguish about the Genocide. \nIt is my hope that their perseverance in marking this event each year, \nas well as our own efforts here in the United States Senate, will be \nenough to allow us to remember the lessons of the Genocide. We are \nconstantly forced to relearn the effects of evil unchecked, but I hope, \nin this case, we will be guided to a better future.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3460-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n                            NGAWANG CHOEPHEL\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Secretary Albright is planning to \ntravel to China soon to discuss a wide range of important issues with \nChinese officials. Her trip is in anticipation of a subsequent visit by \nPresident Clinton. On her agenda will be the issue of human rights, and \nI want to use this opportunity to remind other Senators of the case of \nNgawang Choephel, a Tibetan ethnomusicologist and former Middlebury \nCollege student. Mr. Choephel came to this country on a Fulbright \nScholarship, and in September 1995 he was arrested in Tibet for making \na film about traditional Tibetan music and dance. On December 26, 1996, \njust one month after I spoke to Chinese President Jiang Zemin \npersonally about Mr. Choephel, he was sentenced after a secret trial to \n18 years in prison.\n  This case goes to the heart of our ongoing difficulties with the \nChinese Government on human rights. I have repeatedly asked for, and \nnever received, a shred of evidence that Mr. Choephel was engaged in \nany illegal or political activity. His crime, it appears, was that he \nwas Tibetan and wanted to preserve Tibetan culture.\n  Mr. President, every country has the right to prosecute individuals \nwho engage in conduct that threatens the safety of others. But no \ncountry has the right to violate internationally recognized human \nrights which are the rights of all people regardless of nationality. As \nlong as a person can be imprisoned for doing nothing more than making a \nfilm about Tibetan culture, our relations with China will continue to \nsuffer. By releasing Mr. Choephel, the Chinese Government would risk \nnothing, but it would represent an important step to those of us who \nare looking for credible signs that the Chinese Government genuinely \nwants to improve its human rights record.\n  An April 21, 1998 editorial in the Rutland Daily Herald notes the \nrelease of Chinese dissident Wang Dan, and calls for the release of \nNgawang Choephel. I ask that excerpts of the editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n                           Don't Forget Tibet\n\n       The release of a leading dissident by the Chinese \n     government has shown the Chinese leadership to be willing to \n     make the right political gestures in anticipation of a visit \n     later this spring by President Clinton.\n       Now is a good time to remind the Chinese that Americans \n     believe Tibet to be an important human rights issue and that \n     future relations with the United States would be improved by \n     better treatment of Tibet. it is a good time, too, to remind \n     the Chinese of a Tibetan with a Vermont connection who has \n     been sentenced to serve 18 years in jail.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Ngawang Choephel had fled Tibet with his mother when he was \n     2 years old. He eventually found his way to Middlebury \n     College where he was a student of ethnomusiclogy. He returned \n     to Tibet to record the music and dance of his native land, \n     but he was arrested in the summer of 1995 and sentenced to 18 \n     years.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Releasing one or two well-known dissidents is not enough to \n     establish a record of respect for human rights when other \n     thousands remain behind prison walls for crimes no more \n     offensive then the recording of folk songs.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Ngawang Choephel is just one among thousands who remain \n     behind. As long as he is not forgotten, Clinton and the \n     Chinese may also remember how much more needs to be done \n     before China has established itself as a nation with proper \n     respect for the rights of the individual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3461-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3461-S3465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE CONTENT OF UNITED STATES ENGAGEMENT WITH CHINA\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on April 3, 1998 I addressed a \nconference at Stanford University on the subject of ``The Content of \nU.S. Engagement with China.'' This conference, on an issue which I \nbelieve to be of paramount importance, was convened by The Center for \nInternational Security and Arms Control and the Institute for \nInternational Studies in conjunction with the Stanford University and \nHarvard University Preventive Defense Project. I thought my colleagues \nwould find my remarks to be of interest, and I ask that they be printed \nin the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n              Engaging China: The Direction of the Future\n\n  For the last twenty years I have believed that the single most \nimportant undeveloped bilateral relationship in the world is the \nrelationship between China and the United States of America. And I have \nbeen puzzled as to why so little attention has been given to its \ndevelopment.\n  Now, after many years of little presidential interaction between \nWashington and Beijing, President Clinton's decision to move up his \nvisit to China from November to June I think means that each President \nis looking at the relationship in a different way. And I believe that \nthis Administration is now ready to fully engage China.\n  So, what does engagement mean? What should be the content of such a \npolicy? How should it be carried out? And why has it taken so long?\n  While the debate between engagement and containment with China is by \nno means dead, this clear and unequivocal effort to engage Beijing now \nat the highest level marks an historic turning point in U.S.-China \nrelations--and what may well be the most defining bilateral \nrelationship of the coming century.\n  As we move forward in this new effort at engagement, it is worthwhile \nto explore the issue of why it has been so difficult to reach this \npoint, and then discuss what ``engagement'' should look like, and some \nof the practical steps the United States can take to carry out this \neffort.\n\n\n             Obstacles to a Sustained Policy of Engagement\n\n  Anyone who has participated in China policy debates in recent years \nknows first-hand how difficult it has been to sustain any goal-\noriented, consistent policy of engagement. Several reasons come to \nmind.:\n  First is the events at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. Just as \nTiananmen Square was a much more significant event for China than the \nChinese government would like to admit, it also substantially impacted \nthe ability of the U.S. to pursue a policy of engagement.\n  For many Americans, the events of June 4, 1989 remain their dominant \nview of modern China--a view shaped by horrifying pictures of tanks \nadvancing on students and workers, and the one white-shirted, slight \nman, clutching a shopping bag, defiantly facing down an advancing tank. \nThese images are etched indelibly on the minds of virtually everyone \nwho saw the extensive television coverage. It left a mark of \nunvarnished brutality on the government of China and on the People's \nLiberation Army. Many in this country came to view China as nothing \nmore than a brutal dictatorship.\n  From that day on in Washington, China policy became event-driven, \nlurching from one crisis to the next--every media revelation on human \nrights, every trade dispute, every diplomatic confrontation over \nTaiwan, the future of Hong Kong, and the plight of Tibetans. U.S. \npolicy toward China was held hostage daily by whatever ``message'' we \nwere sending to respond to a particular issue--from the summary and \nprolonged detention of students involved in Tiananmen Square, to the \nincarceration of Harry Wu, to the arbitrary imprisonment of scholars \nand dissidents. Issues like prison labor, and abortion dominate the \nviews of certain members of Congress to this very day.\n  Secondly, Americans have trouble accepting a non-elected government \nas a legitimate partner, particularly when that government is \nCommunist. American political instincts are so entrenched when it comes \nto communism that they often override even our own stated interests. \nPerhaps this is due to the long Cold War with the Soviet Union. But \nAmericans remain distrustful of a ``Red China'' despite the fact that \nChina has adopted Western-style market capitalism and is reaching out \nto the West. Many in Congress see the tight control over political \nexpression and unjust incarceration of dissenters as that which should \nbe the controlling factor of our foreign policy with China.\n  Thirdly, China's modernization of its military, its increasing \nnationalism, and the military saber-rattling toward Taiwan in reaction \nto the Cornell visit of Lee Teng-hui--which culminated in a tense show \nof force involving missile launches and aircraft carriers--encouraged \nmany here to vilify China as the new Evil Empire and likely military \nadversary. The book China Can Say No introduced a very real element of \nhostility, and the American corollary, The Coming Conflict with China, \nargued, in response, that conflict is indeed inevitable, that the \nBeijing government\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\nshould be contested and weakened, and that the U.S. policy demeanor \nshould be one of ``cold encounters.''\n  Lost in all of this, largely because of the ignorance of so many \nAmericans about the history and culture of China, has been the progress \nmade in China toward a dramatically improved standard of living and \nfreer lifestyle for so many tens of millions of people. One has but to \nconsider the China of the Cultural Revolution, with the enormous loss \nof life and freedom suffered during the period of the ``Gang of Four,'' \nto understand that the gains and changes that have been made in China \nare more profound than those that have occurred in virtually any large \ncountry anywhere else in the world in such a short twenty year period \nof time.\n  One point driven home to me is that most Americans have remarkably \nlittle knowledge of China's 5,000-year history, its culture, and its \ngovernance. When I was studying history here at Stanford, taking a \ncourse in modern China, the professor said to me, ``Beware, Dianne, \nAmericans do not understand China.'' That is absolutely correct. It \ndoes not register on most Americans that China, throughout its history, \nhas been governed by one man--usually a despotic emperor, and then \nrevolutionary war heroes. As Jiang Zemin said to me a couple of years \nago in Beijing: ``The U.S. cannot expect a country ruled by man for \n5,000 years to make the transition to a rule of law overnight.''\n  China's humiliation at the hands of European powers during the Opium \nWars, its subsequent isolation from the West for over 100 years, and \nthen its suffering at the hands of the Nationalists, the Communist \nRevolution, and the Cultural Revolution, and the ramifications of all \nof these events on its people, are largely unknown to Americans.\n  I was amazed to learn that a poll conducted during the transition of \nHong Kong to Chinese sovereignty showed that only 12 percent of \nAmericans knew that Hong Kong was, prior to the transition, governed by \nGreat Britain. Most thought Hong Kong to be an independent entity being \nreturned to China. This lack of knowledge makes it difficult for many \nAmericans to understand why development of this relationship is so \ncomplex and important to our national interest.\n  Additionally, the fact that our own government is divided with one \nparty charting foreign policy from the White House and the other trying \nto dictate it from Congress does not make a consistent policy easy to \nachieve. That division does, however, facilitate the opportunity for \nindividuals and interest groups to weigh in heavily with the Congress \nwith whatever agenda they may have to criticize the Administration. The \neasiest path, of course, is to do little in the face of this criticism \nand lack of understanding. To some extent, this same ambivalence is \nmirrored on the Chinese side. Since the visit of Lee Teng-hui to the \nUnited States, we have seen the impact of rising Chinese nationalism, \nnot just as a leadership issue, but as a deeply felt conviction \nthroughout the countryside.\n  It is my deep belief that China today is America's most important \nundeveloped bilateral relationship, and that our own national interests \nsuggest that whoever is President must be committed to engage this \nrising giant on an ongoing and consistent basis, regardless of other \npressing domestic and international issues. China policy cannot afford \na sense of drift, long periods of inaction, or even a fear of spelling \nout the importance of engagement and all of its ramifications and \npluses to the American people.\n\n\n              Defining Engagement: A Strategic Partnership\n\n  So what should a policy of engagement be? First of all, it should be \na policy that is clear, consistent, and goal-oriented. It should be \naimed at developing the trust, mutual respect, and --most importantly--\nthe dialogue and diplomacy necessary to accomplish two things: 1) \nminimize the likelihood of conflict between the United States and \nChina, and 2) encourage China's development as an open, responsible, \nand stable world leader capable of helping maintain a safe and secure \nAsia. If there is going to be appreciable progress toward this goal in \nthe next 10-15 years, it will come about through the development of a \nstrategic partnership between the United States and China.\n  This strategic partnership must be based, first and foremost, on a \nrecognition of shared security interests, including: a stable and \nsecure Western Pacific, in which all countries have secure borders and \nare at peace; eliminating the spread of weapons of mass destruction; \nstable economic conditions in the Asian-Pacific region; and the free \nflow of commerce and people through Asian and global sea lanes.\n  This strategic partnership must also be based on mutual trust, \ndeveloped over time, through repeated contact and constant \ncommunication. Mutual trust requires the development of a common \nunderstanding that the interests of one side do not threaten the other; \nan understanding by the United States that China's rising strength need \nnot necessarily pose a threat to the U.S.; and an understanding by \nChina that the U.S. role in Asia is not aimed at containing China or \npreventing it from playing its rightful role in the region.\n  Finally, this strategic partnership must be based on a set of mutual \nunderstandings about issues of importance to each side, especially the \nissue of Taiwan, non-proliferation, and agreed-upon rules of trade.\n  Taiwan: The most critical area of shared understanding must be \nTaiwan. The new Chinese Ambassador in Washington, Li Zhaoxing, recently \nmet with me in my office and reiterated unequivocally that the key \nissue remains Taiwan. Beyond that, all issues are negotiable. So, the \nUnited States' adherence to the ``One China'' policy, and the \nprinciples set forth in the three Sino-American Joint Communiques, \nremain the bedrock of any American policy of engagement.\n\n  Specifically, the U.S. should make sure China understands that the \nUnited States is committed first and foremost to a peaceful resolution \nof the Taiwan issue, brought about through talks between the Chinese \nand the Taiwanese. In this regard, we can take encouragement from the \nfact that Cross-Straits dicussions are expected to resume in Beijing \nlater this month for the first time since mid-1995.\n  As a matter of American policy, we need to be vigilant in ensuring \nthat the United States will do nothing to support Taiwanese \nindependence, and will consistently encourage Taiwan to pursue a course \nof moderation and avoid provocative acts. At the same time we must make \nclear that we will not countenance any military action against Taiwan, \nand that any aggressive action is clearly adverse to U.S. national \ninterests.\n  Nuclear Nonproliferation: China's need for constant reassuring \nregarding U.S. intentions toward Taiwan mirrors American concerns about \nChinese efforts at stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction. \nThe U.S. and China have achieved some equilibrium on the issue of \nTaiwan, and have moved much closer to a common understanding on the \nissue of non-proliferation.\n  China today has signed or is now supporting virtually every \nmultinational treaty and agreement on nuclear non-proliferation, \nincluding the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty, most recently by joining the Zangger Committee to control \nand monitor exports of nuclear technology. And, at the summit in \nOctober, China committed not to engage in any new nuclear cooperation \nprojects with Iran, fulfilling a longtime U.S. policy goal.\n  There are still questions about whether or not China has fully turned \nthe corner in its approach to nuclear non-proliferation, but the signs \nare encouraging. China has been supportive of U.S. efforts to halt \nnuclear proliferation in North Korea and is participating in the four-\nparty talks and supportive of the Agreed Framework. China has also \nagreed to cease assistance to any unsafeguarded nuclear facility, which \nis especially critical in the case of Pakistan. Today, both India and \nPakistan are capable of launching nuclear devices in a matter of days, \nand hopefully China now understands that it makes little sense to have \na group of states with major nuclear weapons capacity just over its \nborders.\n  Now is the time for the United States, when President Clinton goes to \nChina in June, to propose a cooperative approach to nonproliferation as \na major initiative with President Jiang\n\n[[Page S3463]]\n\nZemin. The United States can build on the successes already achieved by \nseeking to encourage China to become a full member of the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime (MTCR), which will require China to abide, \nnot just by the regime's guidelines, but by the technology transfer \nrestrictions contained in its annexes. This is key to a \nnonproliferation agreement.\n  Trade: Special attention should be paid to the dynamics of the U.S.-\nChina trade relationship, because the trading relationship, with its \ndomestic ramifications, is such that it can undermine other aspects of \na strategic partnership. Hence, there is a real need for a shared \nunderstanding and agreement on the rules of trade between the two \nparties. It is clear that a major United States interest is to have \nChina--which will soon be the world's third-largest economy and growing \nat unprecedented rates of GDP--abide by the same rules of trade as the \nrest of the international community.\n  To that end, a major goal of our policy of engagement should be to \nencourage China's participation in international economic regimes, and, \nmost notably, the World Trade Organization. As Nicholas Lardy of the \nBrookings Institution has written, the United States goal of China's \naccession into the WTO on ``commercially viable terms'' must dovetail \nwith a realistic assessment of how fast China can achieve the standards \nnecessary for full membership.\n  A phase-in period is no doubt appropriate given the enormous changes \nthe Chinese economy will have to endure, especially if China continues \nto show good faith and is moving in the right direction--as the new \nPremier Zhu Rongji seems inclined to do.\n  As a further encouragement for China to make the necessary \nadjustments in its trade practices, Congress might end the application \nof the Jackson-Vanik amendment to China, thereby making China's MFN \nstatus permanent. I intend to cosponsor legislation later this year \nwith the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator William Roth \nof Delaware, and others, which would guarantee that upon China's \naccession to the WTO under terms agreed to by the United States, \nChina's MFN status would be made permanent. If necessary, the \nlegislation could be structured so that Jackson-Vanik could be \nreinstated if China failed to meet its commitments under the WTO. But \nthe important thing is to end the unnecessary and disruptive practice \nof subjecting the entire U.S.-China relationship to an annual review.\n  There are other steps the United States can take to ensure a further \ndeepening our strategic partnership with China in the trade area. Each \nyear, the leaders of the world's great industrialized democracies meet \nin what has been known as the G-7 and, now that Russia is a \nparticipant, the Summit of the Eight. These leading nations meet to \ndiscuss their common interests and agendas in world economics, trade, \nand security.\n  While China is not yet a democracy, it is a rising power in Asia and \nthe world, and, as such, should interact with this summit. As with \nRussia, full membership is not necessary at the outset. But China's \npotential role in shaping global peace and economic stability should be \nrecognized and encouraged. It would serve the interests of the United \nStates and our allies at this summit to be able to discuss with Chinese \nleaders how China and the Western powers can interface and work \ntogether.\n  Most observers agree that China has played a helpful role in \nresponding to the financial crises gripping much of Asia, and there is \ngood reason to be very seriously concerned. Despite a decline in \nforeign investment and Chinese exports, China has held the line against \npressure to devalue its currency, and has pledged to offer financial \nassistance to its troubled neighbors. China also has pledged to \ncontinue and accelerate its reform of state-owned enterprises and the \nrestructuring of its government, with full knowledge that it will have \nto deal with probable social disruption as a result. This responsible \ninternational economic behavior, which has been praised by Secretary of \nthe Treasury Robert Rubin, bodes well for the strategic partnership we \nare trying to build.\n  When I first went to China twenty years ago, virtually all businesses \nwere owned by the state. Today, about 25 percent is owned privately, 25 \npercent is cooperative, and about 50 percent is still owned by the \ncentral government.\n  These highly subsidized state-owned enterprises are hugely \ninefficient, but they employ tens of millions of people. Zhu Rongji is \ndetermined to shut down these white elephants. As he closes them, \nunemployment is sure to increase. Already in China there is a huge \nunemployed migrant population in the millions, moving from city to \ncity, with little hope and little opportunity. As these reforms are \ncarried out and inefficient companies are shut down, the situation that \nthe Chinese have the most concern about, instability, is a real \npossibility. Also, there is growing unrest in minority areas. These \nevents together will test China's commitment to reform, but the early \nindications are that the commitment of the new Prime Minister is \nstrong.\n\n\n                       Steps Toward Mutual Trust\n\n  The strategic partnership we are trying to build requires the \ndevelopment of a sense of mutual trust. I do not believe this can be \naccomplished at secondary levels, but rather must be developed over \ntime, leader to leader, with a lot of listening needed on the U.S. \nside--something we are not very accomplished at doing. This takes time \nand persistence. There will be setbacks. But I do not believe that \nsecond-level delegations sweeping into Beijing for a day or two, giving \nultimatums, can accomplish much. To this end, the United States and \nChinese leaders need to develop methods of ongoing communication. It is \namazing to me to know that, from the resumption of diplomatic relations \nwith China in 1978 until the present day, there has been no red \ntelephone--no ability for the two leaders to talk, exchange \ninformation, or discuss points of concern. Hard to believe, but true.\n  I will never forget visiting Jiang Zemin at Zhongnanhai in August of \n1995 and having him tell me that he did not know of the U.S. decision \nto grant a visa to Lee Teng-hui to visit Cornell University until he \nread about it in the newspaper--and I saw it written all over his face, \nthe loss of face. The Chinese believed that they had been reassured in \nMay of that year--just weeks before--that such a visit would not take \nplace. When it did, the relationship was shaken to its foundation, \nculminating in Chinese missile exercises aimed at intimidating Taiwan \nand U.S. aircraft carriers being sent to the Taiwan Strait.\n  I am also of the view that it is possible, perhaps even probable, \nthat the ministries of China often act independently of Beijing, such \nas in the case of the sale of $75,000 worth of ring magnets to \nPakistan. I know that in the case of the intellectual property debate, \ninformation was given by the government of Guangdong Province to \nBeijing indicating that all pirate CD factories in the province had \nbeen closed, when they had not.\n  These cases are small examples of when conversations, and a sharing \nof key information at critical times, between the leaders of each \ncountry--outside of the foreign ministries--can prevent all kinds of \ndifficulties. That is why I am so pleased that a telephone link between \nthe two leaders is set to become operational in May of this year. Other \nforms of direct contact are important as well. The exchange of visits \nbetween the two presidents we are now seeing should be made an annual \noccurrence. In addition, regular, ongoing high-level visits from both \nsides at the Secretary of State/Foreign Minister level, as well as \ncabinet-level visits in other important areas of mutual interests, are \nvital to developing understanding and trust.\n  These senior-level talks must also be supplemented by working-level \ncommittees that meet at least twice yearly in each other's capitals to \ndiscuss non-proliferation, transnational threats such as narcotics \ntrafficking and terrorism, economic cooperation, trade issues, science \nand technology cooperation, and human rights. Many of our trade \ndisputes with China--over phytosanitary standards, or the calculation \nof the trade imbalance and what can be done to improve the imbalance, \nfor instance--will never be settled unless there is continuing, ongoing \ndialogue at both the senior and working levels.\n\n[[Page S3464]]\n\n  A lack of communication can assert itself in big and small ways. In \nJanuary of 1996, Sam Nunn, John Glenn, and I met with the Chinese \nDefense Minister, Chi Haotian, in Beijing. After discussing the \ntensions in the Taiwan Strait, I asked him if there were any other \ndirect problems between our countries. He said, ``Yes, there was one--\nthe problem of U.S. military overflights of Chinese territorial \nwaters.'' He indicated that some American fighter planes were flying \ntoo close to the Chinese coast and may have violated Chinese airspace. \nFrom Beijing, I then called Secretary of Defense William Perry. He \nindicated that he would look into it right away and take care of it, \nwhich he did. The U.S. and the Chinese side were able to reach an \nunderstanding on these flights fairly easily.\n\n  But this incident really showed me the danger inherent in the absence \nof ongoing communication. Secretary Perry also recognized this gap, and \nhe began a very important process of building an expanded military-to-\nmilitary dialogue, a process which I strongly support and believe \nshould be continued. In the last two years, there has been an exchange \nof visits by the Defense Ministers, occasional meetings between \nofficers of the two sides, and a handful of port visits. All are \nhealthy.\n  The October summit helped to advance this process with an agreement \non regular high-level and mid-level exchanges, between both officers \nand specialists in each country's war colleges. An agreement was also \nreached on a communication system to avoid accidental encounters \nbetween U.S. and Chinese naval forces at sea. This military-to-military \ndialogue is important. In order to broaden and deepen these exchanges, \nthe United States might conduct some joint exercises with the Chinese \nmilitary--perhaps initially just search-and-rescue, or disaster relief \ncooperation--a priority.\n  Another aspect of a strategic partnership is to combat the \ntransnational criminal threats--such as terrorism, drug trafficking, \nand alien smuggling--that disrupt each of our societies, and the \nChinese have been very cooperative in these efforts. Hopefully, the two \npresidents will build on this cooperation in June by reaching agreement \nto allow the U.S. to station DEA agents in China, and perhaps an FBI \nplacement.\n  This cooperation could be combined with law enforcement-related \nexchanges in modern investigative techniques, forensics, case-building, \nand proper training in crowd control techniques. It should be \nremembered that, until recently, the Chinese had no local police and \nrelied on the army in many domestic situations, including Tianamen \nSquare in 1989.\n\n\n                      Human Rights and Engagement\n\n  One cannot talk about what should be contained in a policy of \nengagement of China without discussing how human rights policies should \ninteract with other aspects of U.S.-China policy. The truth is that the \nhuman rights situation in China remains deeply disturbing. Fundamental \nfreedoms--expression, political acitivity, assembly, and religion--\nremain sharply restricted no matter what the Chinese say. Dissidents \ncontinue to languish in prison. Arbitrary arrest, torture, and the \nimprisonment of political prisoners continue.\n  The situation is even worse in Tibet, which remains a troublesome and \nunfathomable issue. There is no question but that the Chinese have \ncontinued to harden their policies against the Tibetan people. This has \ntaken the form of a crackdown on dissent (merely to have a picture of \nthe Dalai Lama in a home is a cause for arrest), and brutalizing those \nwho do not conform. Han Chinese continue to build a major Chinese \npresence in the capital of Lhasa, which is rapidly looking more Chinese \nthan Tibetan. Most discouraging, the Chinese maintain their refusal to \nmeet with the Dalai Lama, despite his repeated assurances that he has \ndiscarded Tibetan independence as a point of contention.\n  This issue has been a very personal one for me. I was initially \nbrought into the Tibet issue by my husband, Richard Blum, who has been \na longstanding friend of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and first \nintroduced me to him in 1978. In 1979, when I became Mayor of San \nFrancisco, I was the first American official to receive His Holiness. \nSo the issue has become a very personal one for me. Nine years ago, \nRichard and I began a small quest. That was to arrange a meeting \nbetween the Chinese leadership and His Holiness. In 1991, we first \ncarried letters to the Chinese leadership from the Dalai Lama. These \ndiscussions have continued for several years.\n  Then, last September, I thought there was going to be a breakthrough. \nI was asked by Beijing to come to China to deliver a written message \nand proposal from the Dalai Lama, which I had been holding since June. \nWe flew to Beijing on a weekend and presented the letter to President \nJiang Zemin. The meeting did not go well, and I was very disappointed \nafter it. But before I left Beijing, I received word that the door was \nnot closed to the Dalai Lama's offer. And I have held out hope that \nthere is still an opportunity to capitalize on this offer.\n  Then, very recently, I saw an article distributed by Xinhua, which \nfalsely depicts the position of the Dalai Lama. The article cites a \nrecent issue of the journal China's Tibet. The article says: ``The \nDalai Lama has never sought genuine talks with the Central government \nof China in the last ten years.'' The article goes on to repeat \naccusations that the Dalai Lama is working to split Tibet from China \nand is seeking Tibetan independence.\n  Simply put, these charges are not true. The Dalai Lama has repeatedly \nmade statements, publicly and privately, that should have long since \nsatisfied Chinese concerns. And I, personally, have delivered two of \nthem--one in 1991, and one last September.\n  Until recently, I have been unable to say anything about this, \nbecause these contacts have been basically private. But on March 10 of \nthis year, the Dalai Lama released a statement, which goes to the heart \nof this subject. The Dalai Lama's statement, while acknowledging some \nprogress in human rights in China, says:\n\n       In stark contrast to these positive aspects of development \n     in China proper, the situation in Tibet has sadly worsened in \n     recent years. Of late, it has become apparent that Beijing is \n     carrying out what amounts to a deliberate policy of cultural \n     genocide in Tibet. The infamous ``strike hard'' campaign \n     against Tibetan religion and nationalism has intensified with \n     each passing year.\n\n  Further on in the statement, the Dalai Lama makes clear what he is \nseeking from the Chinese leadership:\n\n       With regard to a mutually acceptable solution to the issue \n     of Tibet, my position is very straightforward. I am not \n     seeking independence. As I have said many times before, what \n     I am seeking is for the Tibetan people to be given the \n     opportunity to have a genuine self-rule in order to preserve \n     their civilization and for the unique Tibetan culture, \n     religion, language, and way of life to grow and thrive. My \n     main concern is to ensure the survival of the Tibetan people \n     with their own unique Buddhist cultural heritage. For this, \n     it is essential, as the past decades have shown clearly, that \n     the Tibetans be able to handle all their domestic affairs and \n     to freely determine their social, economic, and cultural \n     development.\n\n  In light of this background, I propose three directions for U.S. \npolicy on human rights in China:\n  First, the Tibet issue should be elevated to the highest priority of \nthe U.S. human rights agenda. Just a few months ago, the Secretary of \nState appointed Gregory Craig to be the State Department's Special \nCoordinator for Tibet. The United States should launch a major \ninitiative, as part of President Clinton's visit, to convince the \nPresident of China that he should take the Dalai Lama at his word, and \nsit down and meet with him. After all, the Dalai Lama is the spiritual \nleader of some six million Tibetans, and as such, his view and \nproposals deserve to be heard by the government of his people.\n  Secondly, the United States must also actively promote and help China \ndevelop the rule of law, which is the most important guarantor of \nindividual freedoms. A truly independent judiciary, which it is not \nnow, due process of law, and modern civil, criminal, and commercial \ncodes are all vital to this effort. The Administration has already \nproposed a new $5 million program, which I strongly support, to be \nadministered under the auspices of the Asia Foundation for this \npurpose. This program can be the single most important thing we can do \nto make major changes possible in the area of human rights.\n  Finally, the United States should continue to press for the release \nof political dissidents, for reform of the prison system, the abolition \nof child\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\nlabor and prison labor, and increased religious tolerance. There has \nbeen some progress, first with Wei Jingsheng's release, and more \nrecently with Wang Dan's.\n\n\n                          What Kind of China?\n\n  The key question that a policy of engagement attempts to address is: \nWhat kind of China do we hope to be dealing with in 2015? As most of \nour deepest partnerships around the world are with democratic nations, \nthe ideal answer of course is that we would see a fully democratic \nChina. But the history of transitions to democracy suggests to us that \nChina may not have made that entire transition in another decade or \ntwo. Yet if the current trends toward openness and individual freedoms \nin Chinese society continue, I believe it will happen, probably along \nthe Taiwan model.\n  Specifically, we should be looking for the following:\n  an increasingly open country and society, with sharply reduced \nbarriers to interaction with the West;\n  a China in which the people have a voice in their governance, at the \nlocal, provincial, and even national level--which is now beginning with \nthe widespread village elections initiative;\n  a China in which the rule of law, due process, an independent \njudiciary, and modern civil, criminal, and commercial codes, and the \nprotection of individual rights have been firmly established as the \nbasis of human endeavor; and,\n  a responsible leadership, which allows itself to be held accountable \nfor its decisions and actions, both at home and abroad, and is willing \nand able to ensure its own peace and stability, and play a role in \nestablishing peace and security all along the Pacific Rim.\n  I deeply believe in engaging China fully. And as China changes--and \nit will--engagement will become both easier to practice and easier to \nbuild support for at home. All those who are pursuing this effort have \nthe United States best interests at heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3461-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3465-S3466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING U.S. ARMY RESERVE ON ITS 90TH ANNIVERSARY AND \n   RECOGNIZING CONTRIBUTIONS OF STROM THURMOND, PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 213 \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Helms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 213) congratulating the United States \n     Army Reserve on its 90th anniversary and recognizing the \n     important contributions of Strom Thurmond, the President Pro \n     Tempore of the Senate, who served with distinction in the \n     United States Army Reserve for 36 years.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the resolution that I am offering \ntoday, along with 28 other Senators, is intended to commemorate the \n90th Anniversary of the United States Army Reserve and to honor the \nsoldiers who have served in the USAR, including our good friend and \nSenate President pro tempore, Senator Strom Thurmond, who served with \ndistinction as an Army Reservist for 36 years.\n  Winston Churchill once remarked that ``the reservist is twice the \ncitizen.'' Indeed, the accolade ``twice the citizen'' serves as the \ntitle of the definitive history of the U.S. Army Reserve that was \nwritten by the late Colonel Richard B. Crossland and Colonel James T. \nCurrie, whose assistance was invaluable in drafting this resolution. \nThe concept that reservists fulfill multiple roles as citizens in their \ncommunity while simultaneously training for war and other military \noperations was never more true than today.\n  Today's Army Reserve of almost 487,000 Ready Reserve and Standby \nReserve soldiers and 600,000 Retired Reserve soldiers is a far cry from \nits predecessor, the Medical Reserve Corps, which was authorized by \nstatute on April 23, 1908. On that date, President Theodore Roosevelt \nsigned an act ``to Increase the Efficiency of the Medical Department of \nthe United States Army.'' The act provided for the commissioning of a \nfew hundred Reserve medical doctors, in order to avert future shortages \nof officers, such as the one that had occurred during the Spanish-\nAmerican War.\n  Mr. President, since that modest beginning, the USAR has grown to \nbecome a community-based force with over 1200 facilities across the \nUnited States and more than 2000 units in the United States and its \nterritories.\n  While comprising only about 20 percent of the Army's organized units \nand receiving only about 5 percent of the Army's budget , today's Army \nReserve includes 46 percent of the Army's combat service support (CSS) \nassets and more than a quarter of the Army's combat support (CS) \nassets. These assets include medical, engineer, transportation, civil \naffairs, legal, military police, and psychological operations units \nwhich are essential to any military operation.\n  From World War I when the USAR contributed more than 160,000 soldiers \nto the United States Army, through World War II, Korea, Vietnam and \nDesert Shield/Desert Storm, the soldiers of the USAR have been ready \nwhen the President called upon them.\n  Even today, as we spend more and more of our limited defense \nresources on so-called ``contingency operations'' and ``operations \nother than war,'' the soldiers of the USAR and their families are \nmaking the sacrifices necessary to serve their country.\n  Each year, the Army Reserve deploys approximately 20,000 soldiers to \n50 countries worldwide on a variety of missions. In Bosnia alone, the \nArmy Reserve has contributed almost 15,000 citizen-soldiers, \nrepresenting more than 70% of the Army's reserve component \nmobilization.\n  Mr. President, I recently received a letter from Colonel Herbert N. \nHarmon (USMCR), National President of the Reserve Officers Association, \nwho suggested that I introduce this resolution.\n  I am honored to do so.\n  Mr. President, it is appropriate that Senator Thurmond and the \ncitizen-soldiers of the USAR be honored on the occasion of the Army \nReserves 90th Anniversary on April 23, 1998. For, in many ways, Senator \nThurmond's service as a reservist is the story of the consummate \ncitizen-soldier.\n  His remarkable record of service as a reservist began in 1924 when he \nreceived a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Infantry. By the \ntime he transferred to the Retired Reserve in 1965, Senator Thurmond \nhad risen to the rank of Major General, the highest rank available to a \nReserve Officer.\n  Then First Lieutenant Thurmond volunteered the day war was declared \nagainst Germany even though his position as a South Carolina Circuit \nJudge exempted him from service in World War II. He received a \ncommission in the active Army, became a member of the First U.S. Army \nand was attached to the 82nd Airborne Division for the Normandy \ninvasion. It was during that action that he sustained an injury for \nwhich he was awarded a Purple Heart.\n  While serving in Europe, Senator Thurmond served in all battles of \nthe First Army, which fought through France, Belgium, Holland, \nLuxembourg, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. In addition to the Purple \nHeart, he received numerous other awards and commendations for his \nheroism and valor, including the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal \nwith V device and the Army Commendation Ribbon just to cite a few.\n  Mr. President, it would be difficult to overstate Senator Thurmond's \ncontribution to the security of our country and our gratitude for his \nexceptional service. Suffice it to say that he is, perhaps, the single \nmost qualified person ever to serve as the Chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and that I am honored to have had the privilege of \nserving with him for these past 25 years.\n  I am also grateful for the service and the sacrifices of the soldiers \nwho willingly serve in, and the families who support, the Army Reserve. \nTheir dedication, commitment, and accomplishments are properly noted on \nthis occasion.\n  Mr. President, I urge Senators to support this resolution and to join \nme in honoring Senator Thurmond and the soldiers of the United States \nArmy Reserve. It's the right thing to do and I am confident that \nSenators will agree.\n  I ask that the letter from Col. Herbert N. Harmon be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The letter follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\n\n\n\n                                  Reserve Officers Association\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: On April 23, the United States Army \n     Reserve will observe the 90th anniversary of its founding as \n     the first federal Reserve force established by the Congress. \n     During those 90 years the Army Reserve has served proudly and \n     effectively as a full partner in our nation's Army. Indeed, \n     today it is no exaggeration to say that the Army cannot \n     conduct any sustained operation without the support of the \n     Army Reserve. It is appropriate that the contributions of our \n     Army Reserve be recognized on this occasion.\n       Enclosed is a draft resolution that congratulates the Army \n     Reserve on its 90th birthday; commends the citizen-soldiers \n     of the USAR for their service and sacrifice; and recognizes \n     Senator Strom Thurmond, President Pro Tempore of the Senate, \n     and former national president of this association, who served \n     with distinction for 36 years in the Army Reserve, rising to \n     the rank of major general. We ask that you introduce this \n     resolution honoring the Army Reserve and Senator Thurmond.\n       We thank you for your support of our men and women in \n     uniform and for your support of this resolution honoring the \n     Army Reserve and Senator Thurmond. If we may be of assistance \n     to you in this matter, please let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Herbert N.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to; the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 213) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mayo and William J. Mayo, and \n     Captain Eddie Rickenbacker;\n       Whereas the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, Strom \n     Thurmond, who received the Purple Heart for injuries received \n     while participating in the Normandy invasion with the 82d \n     Airborne Division on D-Day, served with distinction in the \n     United States Army Reserve for 36 years, rising to the rank \n     of Major General;\n       Whereas the United States Army Reserve contributed more \n     than 160,000 soldiers to the United States Army during World \n     War I;\n       Whereas the United States Army Reserve was recognized by \n     General George C. Marshall for its unique and invaluable \n     contributions to the national defense during World War II;\n       Whereas more than 240,000 soldiers from the United States \n     Army Reserve were called to active duty during the Korean \n     War;\n       Whereas 35 units of the United States Army Reserve were \n     sent to Vietnam, where they served honorably and well;\n       Whereas the United States Army Reserve contributed more \n     than 90,000 soldiers to Operations Desert Storm and Desert \n     Shield in 1990 and 1991;\n       Whereas the United States Army Reserve has contributed more \n     than 70 percent of the reserve soldiers mobilized in support \n     of Operation Joint Endeavor/Joint Guard in Bosnia;\n       Whereas the United States Army Reserve constitutes a very \n     high percentage of the mission essential combat support and \n     combat service support forces of the Army;\n       Whereas the Army cannot go to war without the 1,100,000 \n     trained Ready Reserve and Retired Reserve personnel of the \n     United States Army Reserve;\n       Whereas the United States Army Reserve is a community-based \n     force with over 1,200 facilities in communities across the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas the United States Army Reserve has made these \n     contributions to the security of our country in return for a \n     very small percentage of the Army budget: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the United States Army Reserve on the \n     occasion of the 90th anniversary of its establishment on \n     April 23, 1998;\n       (2) recognizes and commends the United States Army Reserve \n     for the selfless and dedicated service of its past and \n     present citizen-soldiers who have preserved the freedom and \n     national security of the United States; and\n       (3) recognizes Strom Thurmond, the President Pro Tempore of \n     the Senate, for 36 years of service with distinction in the \n     United States Army Reserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/22/senate-section/article/S3465-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING THE GRAND FORKS HERALD\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.
