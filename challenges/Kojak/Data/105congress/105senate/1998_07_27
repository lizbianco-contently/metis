Mr. President, what happened in the Capitol last Friday \nafternoon was a tragedy for our Nation. But for all of us here it was \nsomething more. It was a death in the family.\n  We work here every day together, as Senators and as officers of the \nSenate, staff members, pages, policemen. We see them, and we pass them, \nover and over again. We talk to them. Some of them we get to know quite \nwell.\n  I have had the occasion myself to develop a very personal \nrelationship with the man that was my security detail when I was the \nwhip in the House, a man named George Awkward. He did for me what John \nGibson did for Tom DeLay as the whip in the House. We got to be very \npersonal friends. He had pizza at night, when we would get home late, \nwith my wife and with me and my children.\n  So I know how much these men and women put their lives on the line, \nand how much they mean to us on an individual basis, but also how far \ntoo often we walk past them; we take them for granted; we don't realize \nthat they really are there for a very important purpose--protection of \nour constituents and of all of us and of this magnificent building in \nwhich we serve.\n  Detective John Michael Gibson and Private First Class Jacob Joseph \nChestnut were members of our congressional family. They died defending \nus.\n  They died defending this Capitol building, this temple of law, where \narmed violence is a sacrilege against our democratic institutions.\n  So much has been said in their praise, and yet we need to say more.\n  So much has been offered in their honor, but we still look for ways \nto express our admiration, our gratitude, and most of all, our sorrow.\n  We search for words to comfort their families, and it is not easy to \nfind them. Some losses stay with us forever.\n  But far more important than our words and our condolences is the \nassurance of Scripture, that our Chaplain just gave--that ``greater \nlove than this has no man, than that he lay down his life for his \nfrinds.''\n  That is what the speaker of those words did, almost 2,000 years ago, \nand that is what officers Chestnut and Gibson did 3 days ago.\n  In fact, it is what they were ready to do every day of their career, \nevery day when they left their homes and loved ones knowing that they \ncould face a deadly peril in their daily routine.\n  We do not think often enough of the quiet bravery it takes for \nofficers like those two--the men and women who come to work, here at \nthe Capitol and in communities throughout the country, knowing that \nthis might be the day they encounter mortal danger in the course of \ntheir duties.\n  In my own area of the country--the gulf coast of Mississippi--we \nrecently lost a policeman in the line of duty in Long Beach, MS, and it \nmade an indelible mark on that community and on our whole region.\n  Senators have already been informed that Officers Chestnut and Gibson \nwill lie in state tomorrow in the great Rotunda of the Capitol.\n  This is an extraordinary honor that we are paying to them. In the \npast only Presidents, Supreme Court Justices, and generals like \nPershing and MacArthur, former Senator Pepper, have lain in repose in \nthe Rotunda. But I think it is appropriate that these two men, who gave \ntheir lives just down one flight of stairs defending that room always \npacked with constituents, would have this moment to be honored the way \nthey deserve in that room.\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\n  There will be times throughout the day for Members and staff and the \ngeneral public to pay their respects to these two men to say a prayer, \nto consider how much we owe these fallen colleagues and their families \nand all those like them throughout the country.\n  It is important to note that the public will be welcome in the \nCapitol during that time, and welcome to join us in our solemn tribute \nin the Rotunda, with the exception of only one hour in the afternoon \nwhere there will be a private opportunity for Members of Congress to \nobserve and to pay our respects to these men.\n  It is most fitting that the public, our constituents from all over \nthe country and all over the world, should be there with us, as they \nwill be, for Officers Chestnut and Gibson and their colleagues were \ndefending them, too.\n  I can understand the wish in some quarters to make the Capitol \nabsolutely impregnable, or even to close it to the general public so \nthat nothing like this could ever happen again. We will, of course, \nexamine closely all of our security procedures again as we continue to \ndo almost daily to see whether anything can be done to improve it. But \nwe have to keep in mind that this Capitol is, more than any other \nedifice in the country, and certainly I believe in the world, the \npeople's house.\n  When I walk out of my majority leader's office and take three steps, \nI am standing with constituents from all across America. They are there \nevery day. Sometimes they seem surprised that they would see Senators \nand Congressman walking amongst them. But that is the way it should be. \nThis building is accessible and it amazes our visitors, domestic and \nforeign, many of whom have had chance encounters with Members of \nCongress, the President's Cabinet, in the halls, in the dining rooms, \nin the elevators. The reason the Capitol is so open is that our society \nis so open. We pride ourselves on that fact.\n\n  The people's access to their Capitol is the physical manifestation of \ndemocracy. It represents something rare and precious, something all \nAmericans take for granted. It represents the bond between those in \nhigh office and those who put them there. It represents, in short, our \nfreedom.\n  For that freedom, throughout our history, men and women have been \nwilling to stand guard, to fight if necessary, and to die on many \nfields in many places in the world.\n  They have done all that to protect their homes, to shield their loved \nones, and to preserve their Nation. Some of those brave individuals are \nmemorialized in the Capitol itself in statues of bronze and marble. \nThey stand among us, mute but strangely eloquent about the price of \nliberty.\n  Tomorrow, amid those grand statues of heroes past, we will honor two \nof our own to whom heroism was simply duty. For those two, for Officers \nJacob Chestnut, affectionately known as J.J., and John Gibson, this \nopen Capitol, with wide-eyed kids learning the Nation's history, with \nstrangers from abroad awed by its grandeur, with Americans of all \ncreeds and races and religions celebrating their common faith in God, \nand in one another, this Capitol itself will be their enduring \nmonument.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9001-5", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

We will confer with the leaders of both bodies on both sides of \nthe aisle as to the appropriate time to have that vote, and we are \nreviewing the language at this time.\n  In addition to that, we will resume consideration later on today of \nthe credit union bill which was debated last Friday. I understand that \nSenator Hagel will be present later on to offer his amendment regarding \ncredit union loans. Senator Shelby is tentatively scheduled to offer \nhis amendment at about 3:30.\n  By previous consent, a rollcall vote with respect to the Gramm \namendment will occur at approximately 5:30, or shortly thereafter, but \nnot later than 5:45. It is also hoped that we will vote in relation to \nthe Hagel amendment immediately following that vote, and therefore two \nstacked votes are expected at around 5:30 this afternoon, with the \npossibility of one other.\n  After the Senate completes consideration of the credit union bill, it \nwill move to available appropriations bills. We have three or four that \ncould be available this week. Health care legislation is on the agenda \nfor the week, plus any conference reports that become available and any \nlegislative or executive items, and we do expect, because of the \ncooperation we received on appropriations bills, we will be able to \nmove a number of Executive Calendar nominations this week. This is the \nfinal week prior to our August recess period, when we will have an \nopportunity to go to our respective States, so I know our days and \nnights will be quite busy. It is necessary we do that to complete our \nwork.\n  I thank all Senators in advance for their cooperation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, I rise today to honor John Gibson and Jacob \n``J.J.'' Chestnut, the officers who gave their lives Friday in the line \nof duty.\n  For Members of the Senate, I would remind them that John Gibson was \none of the individuals who was a part of our security detail on our \nmost recent retreat. Yesterday morning, after an early morning run, I \nstopped by the Capitol where people had placed flowers at the steps, \nand I talked with a young officer who told me how proud he was of J.J. \nJ.J. was the kind of person who, after 20 years of service in the \nmilitary, took under his wing the new men and women who were coming \ninto the Capitol Hill Police Force service and to help them on a \npersonal basis, giving them tips about the kinds of things to which \nthey needed to pay attention with their training, the kinds of things \nthey ought to try to accomplish when they are dealing with our \nconstituents when they come into the Capitol.\n  Many times, I am sure, we forget the difficulty of the duty that they \nhave, on the one hand to be trained to the extent to react the way they \nreacted on Friday, unselfishly, putting themselves in harm's way so \nthat others may survive, but at the same time having the responsibility \nof treating our constituents, our friends, our neighbors, when they \ncome to the Capitol, with such graciousness. It is a really difficult \njob, and I just want to express to the members of the Capitol Hill \nPolice Force, all of those who participate in providing security, our \ndeep appreciation for what they do on a day-to-day basis. Each day we \ncome to work, we pass these officers. As the majority leader said, some \nof them we know by name, others we have become friends with.\n  I particularly remember C.J. Martin over at the Delaware entrance in \nthe Russell Building, how each morning we would discuss some very \npersonal things about our lives, the kinds of common bonds, if you \nwill, that we shared. And so, while I didn't know J.J. Chestnut and \nJohn Gibson to the degree that I have known other members of the police \nforce here, I know that they were very special people. Again, listening \nto that young officer talk about how J.J. would stand at that door, \nerect in that military stance, with great pride, frankly, in the job \nthat he performed, and the reaction that he had, again, with the people \nas they came in, we don't take what they do for granted, and we want \nthem to know that we are concerned about them and we are concerned \nabout their families.\n  I had the opportunity on Friday evening to visit the families of J.J. \nChestnut and John Gibson and to express to them our deep concern and \nour love for them, wanting them to know that we cherish their fathers, \ntheir husbands, that they mean a great deal to us, that we will do what \nwe can to comfort them, that we won't forget them, that we will \nremember the families.\n  While the officers are the ones who lost their lives, now it is a \ntough and\n\n[[Page S9003]]\n\ndifficult time for the families. Each one of us, I know, has had the \nexperience of losing someone close to us and we can feel the pain of \nthe tragedy that took place, and we want those families to know that we \nhave not forgotten them and that we will do what we can over the years \nto see that they are not forgotten.\n  Friday, in talking with the young sons of ``Gibson,'' as they refer \nto him, I can only imagine the hurt and pain that those boys 14 and 15 \nyears old must be feeling. I say to all of us, regardless of the role \nthat we play in the Senate or in the House, we are all one big family.\n  In a sense, there are many families within the family. There is the \nfamily of officers and the special grief that they must be experiencing \ntoday, as they are required to carry out their duties at a moment in \nwhich their minds and hearts must be focused on their lost officers and \ntheir families. So I ask everyone, if they would, during this day and \nthe next several days, to pray for those families--for comfort, for \nlove, and for hope.\n  Again, I can remember a particular time in which my younger brother \npassed away. I was so angry about his loss; people would come up to me \nand say, ``Connie, time will take care, time will heal,'' and I was so \nangry I said, ``I don't want it to be healed. I don't want time to take \ncare of it. I am angry.''\n  But I hope that the families, especially the children, will deal with \nthose feelings inside, that they will share those thoughts to get them \nout so they don't carry around that hurt and that pain. We want them to \nknow that we truly love them, that we will miss their fathers, their \nhusbands, and we will try to make the Senate and House and the Capitol \na place in which they can be proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9002-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CHESTNUT\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, for the past 5 years I have had the \nhonor of sponsoring the resolution designating National Peace Officers \nMemorial Day. This year we added the names of 159 officers to the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Since the inception of this \nmemorial, 14,662 peace officers have been added to the wall.\n  Next year, two more names will now be added to the wall. These \nmemorials and others around the Nation serve as proof that the \nindividuals who serve this Nation, as our guardians of peace, do so at \ngreat personal risk. There are few communities in America that have not \nbeen touched by the senseless death of a peace officer by violent \nmeans.\n  This community of Capitol Hill has been touched by tragedy. On \nFriday, two of our own, Officers John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut, were \nfelled by an assailant while they performed their duties.\n  America should know that for all the influence of this city and this \nplace, this is, in some ways, like a small town. We know the people in \nthis community as well as we know the people in our own communities \nback home. The employees who work here day to day become very familiar \nfaces to those of us who are sent here temporarily by our States.\n  The Capitol Hill Police have a very special duty and a very special \ntrust. They guard this place, this summit of freedom, this people's \nhouse, and keep it safe for the citizens of the world. The Capitol Hill \nPolice perform this duty with an unwavering commitment to our safety. \nAnd they are willing, as Officers Gibson and Chestnut proved, to lay \ndown their lives for all of our safety.\n  John Gibson, who I knew personally--a tremendous professional in \nevery sense of the word. When I saw his photograph in the paper, the \ndifference was every time that I would see John or have a word with him \nhis face always had a smile.\n  J.J. Chestnut, who worked in one of the entrances to this great \nbuilding, like so many of our officers, was perceived to be more than \njust a police officer to the wonderful citizens who come to this \nmagnificent building. I think they sense that instead of just a police \nofficer, they are being greeted by ambassadors in the people's house.\n  I believe that our Capitol Police Department exemplify the finest in \nAmerica. I have never heard any statement that any of our police \nofficers have been badge-heavy. I have simply heard great reviews of \nthe professionals who carry the badge of the Capitol Police Department.\n  I know many of the Capitol Police officers personally. I have \nlistened to stories about their families. I have seen photographs of \ntheir kids--just parent talking to parent who share a funny story or \nobservation or simply a good word at the end of the day. But in the \nend, put most simply, they are here to take care of us.\n  As we near the end of this century, we are often impelled to observe \nthis country is cynical. It is, I suppose, in the American character to \nquestion our condition and bemoan the things that are not now as we \nremember them to be. But in truth, the sacrifice of these men and their \nfamilies are akin to the selfless ideal that has made this country \ngreat. The bravery and the commitment to community that these men \npossessed will be carried on by their families.\n  I have had the honor to meet with the families of slain officers from \nmy home State. The strength and the perseverance that is exemplified by \neach of them is an inspiration to me.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to these families and others who have \nbeen devastated by this type of senseless violence. There is no answer \nto the meaningless violence that occurs, but we must celebrate and \nmemorialize the lives of the officers who serve and protect us.\n  To the Capitol Hill Police, I would like to simply say, I am sorry \nfor your loss and for our loss because we are family here, to say how \nproud all of us are of you and to thank you for your service that you \ngive to us each and every day, and to say to the families of Officer \nGibson, Officer Chestnut: Your husband, your father, demonstrated \nservice beyond self in the most dramatic way--by sacrificing their \nlives for our safety, for our freedom.\n\n  Our prayers are with John, with Officer Chestnut, with their \nfamilies, and with the other officers who continue that tradition of \nbeing truly some of the finest anywhere in the Nation or the world. You \nare our friends, you are our guardians, so that we can do our duty here \nin the Nation's Capitol. God bless these two officers and God bless \nwhat they mean to all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it has struck me often in my 10 years here in the \nSenate that one can look at the life we lead here in different ways. In \none sense, in a sense that is most visible, we do the work of the \ncountry: We hold hearings, we meet with constituents, we legislate. \nThis is the Congress of the United States.\n  But in another sense, it has struck me increasingly over the years I \nhave been honored to be here that there is another level of experience \nin this Capitol, which is that we are, in our own way, a small town of \nour own. We are a community. Yes, we have the Members of Congress and \nwe have all who serve in our offices so well. We have the officers of \nboth Chambers and those who work to keep these Chambers going. But \nthere is a broader community here that we are all part of. It is the \npeople who keep the buildings in such good repair.\n  We have doctors, we have nurses, we have clergy people, we have \nrepresentatives of the media who live in this community with us who \ncover us. We even\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\nhave our own newspapers. And we have police officers. We are a small \ntown in the way that life is lived in so many small towns across \nAmerica. But we are very different from most any of those small towns \nin that hundreds of thousands of fellow Americans--indeed, people from \nall over the world--come and walk through this great citadel of \ndemocracy, this great symbol of freedom, peacefully and respectfully, \ncoming through our community.\n  On Friday, as we all know, one madman disrupted the tranquility of \nour community and took two of our own, Special Agent John Gibson, \nOfficer Jacob Chestnut. There is a sense of palpable sadness and grief \nin this Capitol today, a sense of mourning at the loss of these two \nofficers, because they were members of our community. We saw them every \nday. We exchanged greetings with them. We deeply regret and in some \nways, I am sure, feel anger at what happened on Friday to take these \ntwo fine men, these two heroes, from us.\n  As we mourn their loss, I do think it is important for us to remember \nthe extraordinary and unique war that law enforcement officers play in \nthis small town, our little community, the Capitol of the United \nStates, which is similar to the part they play in every other community \nacross America. Think of what happened in those few tragic, jolting \nmoments on Friday afternoon when danger occurred and the sound of \nbullets resonated through the halls of the Capitol. Most everyone in \nthe Capitol ran for cover, locked their office doors, jumped under \ntables and desks, got out of the way of danger. But the law enforcement \nofficers, the Capitol Police throughout this Capitol, including these \ntwo fallen heroes, rushed to the danger. That is their job, to protect \nthe rest of us. It is an extraordinary difference in a quiet, normal \nmoment on a midsummer Friday afternoon. Suddenly, one madman pierces \nall of that, and every officer, every Capitol Police officer in our \nsmall town, rushes to the danger, rushes to their duty station. These \ntwo responded with instinctive but extraordinary, heroic impulses to \nstop this man, and ultimately did, and save so many lives through their \nheroism.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned this just to pay tribute in some small way \nto Special Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut, but to remind us how much \nwe owe these people in this small town of ours, and in every city and \ntown across America, and why we ought not to just treat them with a \nwarm hello but feel, as we do today, in some measure every day the \ngratitude we have to them and express that in the best way we can, \nwhich is not only as friends and fellow citizens of our communities, \nbut when we have a chance, as employers, to treat them appropriately \nand according to the extraordinary responsibilities that they bear in a \nmoment of crisis.\n  Mr. President, by coincidence this morning, I was reading from \nJeremiah's Book of Lamentations and I read the commentary on \nLamentations in which were cited the comments of an ancient rabbi who \nwas interpreting the Psalms, David's Book of Psalms. In dealing with \nthe sadness, the sense of gloom that is so at the heart of the Book of \nLamentations, this sage of old, in commenting on Psalms, expressed a \nthought that is familiar to all religions, which is, ``If I had not \nfallen, I could never have arisen. If I had not sat in darkness, I \ncould never have seen the light of God.''\n  So in this time of deep and heavy darkness for our community here on \nCapitol Hill, we pray with faith together and the faith that unites us \nin our community, unites us as faith has always united people in \nAmerican communities, that Special Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut \nare seeing the light of God, that they are being welcomed in the warm \nembrace of eternal life, greeted as the heroes that they are. We pray, \nalso, that God will grant strength and comfort to their families, to \ntheir friends, to their fellow officers in the Capitol Police corps, \nand in some measure to all of us in this small town, Capitol Hill, who, \ntoday, mourn their loss.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent the period \nfor morning business be extended by an additional 15 minutes--I know \nthere is at least one other colleague on the floor and there may be \nothers--so that we might spend a moment in additional tribute to the \ntwo officers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I just want to add my voice to those who \nhave already spoken and those who will.\n  Friday was a difficult day for all of us here as part of the family. \nThat has been more eloquently described than I can describe it both \ntoday and elsewhere. Like many of the Members, I happened to be in my \noffice less than 100 yards away from where the shooting took place. I \nwas unaware of the shooting. I heard the sirens and I heard the \nhelicopter when it approached to take the victims to the trauma center. \nAt that point, I tuned in and observed what was happening.\n  There was a sense on the part of all of us that something very tragic \nhad occurred to members of the family. It wasn't until the names were \nreleased that we knew which members of the family had been affected. I \nrealized when the names were ultimately released and saw the pictures \nthat Officer J.J. Chestnut was the person who had been on that post any \nnumber of times. Many of us who come and go from the Nation's Capitol \nlate in the evening find that is one of the few doors that is open. So \nwe get to know the people who are there, and they are always greeting \nus with a smile.\n  In truth, I didn't know that I knew or had a relationship with \nSpecial Agent Gibson until I found out from my wife and mother-in-law \nthat during a recent visit he had accompanied them throughout a tour of \nthe Capitol, and they had been very grateful for the professional \ncourtesies and kindness that he had extended to them. I found out that \nhe was a resident of Lake Ridge, VA. It just so happens that the other \nperson who was wounded, Angela Dickerson, was a tourist and taking a \nfamily on a tour, also happens to be from Chantilly, VA. I noted that \nJ.J. Chestnut was a Vietnam veteran and is going to be accorded full \nmilitary honors when he is buried Friday in Arlington.\n  These were very, very special people. The initial feeling among many \nwhen we heard that there had been gunfire inside the Capitol was that \nsomehow the security system had broken down. I was relieved and \npleased, as I think all of our Members were, to know that in this case \nthe system had actually worked, and it had worked superbly. The men who \nultimately gave their lives had done so in precisely the way they were \ntrained to protect the Capitol and all who serve in it. I think that is \na testament to the professionalism of the Capitol Police and to all of \nthe members of this extended family.\n  I didn't go out and talk to the media on Friday, but two down-State \nreporters came to my office, unsolicited, and I talked to them for a \ncouple of minutes. One asked me, ``What should we do?'' I said, ``I \nhope we don't do much of anything. We will take a look at the \nprocedures, but we want to keep the people's house as open as we \npossibly can.'' I think this is a symbol of democracy, and these two \nmen died in defending that symbol. But we want to be careful not to \ntake the wrong actions.\n  What we can do, and what we ought to do, is remember to thank those \nwho serve us--whose service we sometimes take for granted. On the way \nout of the Capitol later that evening, I stopped and thanked the \nCapitol Police officers who were still on duty. They were still doing \ntheir duties professionally, although they were grieving. I happened to \ngo to an engagement that I had that evening and I was late coming back. \nIt didn't conclude until almost midnight. I said, ``I want to go back \nto the Capitol. The midnight shift will have come on now and they are \ngoing to take it pretty hard as well.'' I had a chance to quietly visit \nwith some of the other members of the Capitol Police.\n  Many of us are trying to find a way to say to those men and women who \nserve so ably, and sometimes without the recognition that they deserve, \nthat we are grieving with them, that we appreciate what they did, what \nthey continue to do. I suggest to people who might not be a part of the \nextended family here in the Capitol that all of us feel that if you \nwant to find a way to\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\nexpress your appreciation, stop your local policeman on the street and \nsay ``thank you'' because they, too, are providing a kind of service \nthat, in many cases, we end up taking for granted; yet, it is \ncritically important. When the chips are down, these folks respond. And \nas my distinguished colleague from Connecticut noted a minute ago, when \nmany seek cover, that is the time they put themselves directly in \nharm's way to ensure that access to our Nation's Capitol and the \nfreedom to move about for all of us who benefit from their services \ngoes uninterrupted.\n  With that, I will close. I just wanted to say to all of those who \ncontinue to serve: Thank you. We don't always remember to say that. To \nthe families of J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson, in particular, we share \nyour loss. You are in our thoughts and prayers, and to all who serve us \nin ways too numerous to count, we do appreciate what you have done for \nus and what you continue to do for us. We will continue to remember the \nextraordinary service and the ultimate sacrifice that was made by these \ntwo fine officers in defense of our Nation's Capitol.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n        Our Hearts Go Out to the Families of the Slain Officers\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I just want to say that all of us in \nthe Capitol have one overriding thought in our minds right now, and \nthat is that our hearts go out to the families of the two officers who \nwere slain in the line of duty last Friday.\n  All of us were in a different place. But I will never forget where I \nwas when learning this tragic news. I had left the Capitol that morning \nand had returned home to Texas. I was just stunned. And when I learned \nthat these officers had passed away after their injuries, I was \nheartsick, as all of us were.\n  There is no question that the Capitol Police are friends to all of \nus. When I came into the Capitol this morning and saw the black tape \nacross their badges, it all hit. And I want to say there is not anyone \nhere who has worked with these fine men and women who doesn't \nappreciate every day the job they do protecting all of us and every \nvisitor to the Capitol.\n\n\n                God Bless J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to take just a moment to join \nthose of my colleagues who have already spoken with respect to our \nprofound shock at the death of Jacob ``J.J.'' Chestnut and John Gibson, \ntwo Capitol Police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty on \nthis past Friday, and to express my very heartfelt sympathies to their \nfamilies.\n  J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson have been engaged over their working \ncareers in the dedicated mission of protecting the lives of their \nfellow citizens, literally thousands of people who move in and out of \nthe Capitol Building each day, those who work here, those who visit \nhere, both our own citizens and from abroad.\n  As we all know, on Friday, the people's house, the U.S. Capitol, was \nviolated by a gunman. Officer Chestnut and Special Agent Gibson put \nthemselves on the line, as do all law enforcement officials, each and \nevery day, both at work and, since they are committed to law \nenforcement, even when they are off work, literally all the time, in \norder to protect the physical well-being--indeed, to protect the \nfreedoms that so many of us have taken for granted.\n  In its editorial today, Roll Call, which, of course, as we all know, \nis the newspaper devoted to reporting the activities on Capitol Hill, \nsaid this:\n\n       Sometimes, given the comparative low level of violence \n     around the Capitol complex and given that Capitol Police \n     officers are usually seen cheerfully directing traffic and \n     gently herding tourists, it's forgotten that ours--\n\n  Meaning the Capitol Police Force--\n\n     is a real police force. We who live and work around the \n     Capitol know--but others don't--that our police also fight \n     crime in the neighborhood as well as watch the Capitol. But \n     now all of America understands that the Capitol Police do not \n     just stand guard, but also stand ready to be heroes. That \n     knowledge was derived last week at heartrending cost.\n\n  We call them heroes today, and they truly are, but Officer Chestnut \nand Special Agent Gibson were also husbands, fathers, grandfathers--\nalready heroes to their wives, to their children and grandchildren, to \ntheir other family members, and to their neighbors who respected them \nnot only for their uniforms but for the laws they vowed to uphold and \nthe lives they protected on a daily basis. It is these loving people \nthey leave behind, having given of themselves to protect the lives of \nothers and in defending one of the great symbols of this democratic \nNation, perhaps the preeminent symbol of our democratic Nation--the \nUnited States Capitol.\n  Mr. President, may God bless J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson. They are \ntrue heroes, and I join with my colleagues in expressing my condolences \nto their family members.\n\n\n                          Deep Sense of Sorrow\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join other colleagues of ours who today, \nand I hope tomorrow as well, will find time to express their deep sense \nof sorrow over the loss of two of our Capitol Hill police officers last \nFriday, as well as to express their sincere condolences to the families \nand friends of these two very fine officers, J.J. Chestnut and John \nGibson.\n  The events of last Friday, July 24, certainly will leave an indelible \nmark on this community--this Capitol community, if you will--and our \nNation. The tragic legacy of this incident will not only be the courage \ndisplayed opposing this senseless act of savagery but will also be the \npremature loss of these two fine, brave men.\n  J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson were not just courageous officers, they \nwere fine human beings. They were friends of many here and in the House \nof Representatives. All of us in this Chamber cannot help but take this \nloss personally, because Officers Chestnut and Gibson worked every day \nto ensure the safety of each and every one of us in this Capitol \nBuilding. I think that every American should look into their hearts and \nthank these two men for their sacrifices, because they also worked to \nprotect all of those who visit this great Capitol Building, this symbol \nof democracy, as well as the freedoms which the Capitol represents.\n  All Americans should give thanks and say a prayer for these two fine \nmen and all of the men and women in uniform throughout our Nation who \ntake that oath to ensure our safety every day. Our police officers are \nhusbands, they are parents and friends, they are neighbors--in many \nways, ordinary citizens just like the rest of us. But in one very \nimportant way, these individuals are quite extraordinary. Every day \nwhen they put on their uniforms, their work clothes, and they say \ngoodbye to their families and go to work, they literally put their \nlives on the line so that we may enjoy the safety and the freedoms that \ntoo often, I think, we take for granted. We describe their actions as \nheroism, but they simply view them as their duty.\n  President John Kennedy once said:\n\n       The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than \n     the courage of a final moment; but it is no less a \n     magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy. A man does what \n     he must--in spite of the personal consequences, in spite of \n     obstacles and dangers and pressures--and that is the basis of \n     all morality.\n\n  While we will forever remember Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson \nfor their actions on July 24, they deserve our respect and admiration \nnot only for the way they performed their duties on that day but for \nthe way they and those who share a similar uniform carry themselves \nevery day throughout their lives--always working in the service of \nothers, with great courage and character.\n  It is important that we remember not only those who gave their lives \nbut also express our gratitude to those who are left to carry on their \nmission.\n  Officers Chestnut and Gibson's colleagues must put these events \nbehind them and carry on with their everyday lives and continue \nperforming the services that are so important. We are all very grateful \nfor the sacrifices they make every day and the commitment to their \ncommunities that these men and women display.\n  It has been ordered that their bodies will lie in state in the \nCapitol rotunda tomorrow, the same Capitol where they gave their lives \nin service to their country. This honor is usually reserved for our \nNation's most prominent leaders, Presidents, Supreme Court Justices, \nand Generals. But I know all of us in this Chamber feel that this is an \nappropriate tribute to the two men whose commitment to their country\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\nand their community is surpassed by none.\n  J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson leave behind loving wives and children. \nI offer my heartfelt condolences to both families and their friends, \nand, on behalf of this body, I know I speak for all of our colleagues \nin saying they will long be remembered for their friendship and their \ncourage.\n\n\n                  Tribute to the Capitol Police Force\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to make a personal comment about \nthe tragedy that occurred in this building on Friday and add my voice \nto those that have been raised in tribute to the professionalism, the \ncourage, and the compassion of the members of the Capitol Police Force.\n  I remember, when I first came to Washington as an intern in 1950 as a \nstudent from the university, the Capitol Police Force was \naffectionately referred to as the ``campus cops.'' It was a patronage \njob, and people who served on the Capitol Police Force in those days \nwere appointed by their Senators. Usually, they were law students who \nwere going to school at George Washington University that taught the \nentire curriculum at night. So the Capitol Police could earn their way \nthrough law school by sitting at their various stations in the Capitol \nduring the daytime and taking their classes at night. One of the more \nprominent attorneys in Salt Lake City got his law degree that way and \nsaid he did all of his studying at his desk as a Capitol policeman and \ncommented, ``If I had ever been called upon to draw my weapon, I \nwouldn't have known what to do. I would have been scared to death if \nanybody had ever confronted me in my position as a policeman.''\n  That was the situation 40, 45 years ago. The professionalism of those \nwho did draw their weapons and handled them expertly in the crisis that \noccurred last Friday demonstrates how far we have come and how great a \ndebt those of us who labor here, hopefully doing the people's business, \nhave to those who have produced that kind of professionalism and \nproduced that kind of change from what we once had. It is a sad \ncommentary that we need this kind of professional force and we don't \nhave the kind of society that could get by with ``campus cops'' of the \nkind that were here that many years ago, but it is comforting to know, \nin the face of that need, we have people of the caliber that we do have \nserve us. I add my voice to those that have been raised in tribute to \nthose who serve us in that capacity.\n\n\n                tribute to officers chestnut and gibson\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the memory of \nthe two Capitol Hill Police officers who gave their lives in the line \nof duty Friday afternoon.\n  Jacob J. Chestnut and John Gibson were dedicated officers whose \ndeaths are mourned by all of us on Capitol Hill, and by many across \nAmerica.\n  A sense of genuine grief grips us as we come to terms with the \ntragedy that unfolded in our midst on Friday. At the same time, we \nstand in awe of the heroism they and other officers displayed in ending \na gunman's rampage and saving the lives of innocent citizens.\n  Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson were committed to the United States, \nhaving sworn to protect lawmakers, citizens, and the peace as Capitol \nPolice Officers. While I did not have the honor of knowing them \npersonally, I am truly grateful for their dedication and service--as \nwell as the dedication and service of all who serve as police officers.\n  As a father of six and grandfather of eleven, I know how important \nfamily is. The loss of a son, father, husband, and friend is \ndevastating. My thoughts and prayers and those of my wife Nancy are \nwith those who knew and loved these two quiet heroes.\n  Officer Gibson has left behind his wife, Evelyn, and three children. \nWhile the loss of Officer Gibson as a father and husband is \nimmeasurable, I know his memory will be a source of strength for his \nfamily.\n  Officer Chestnut is survived by his wife, Wen-Ling, and five \nchildren: Joseph Chestnut, William Chestnut, Janet Netherly, Janece \nGraham, and Karen Chestnut. Grief has surely stricken this family and \nthe death of their cornerstone can never be as deeply felt by others, \nbut Officer Chestnut died a hero, protecting his country as he had \nsworn to do both during his years in the Air Force and as a Capitol \nPolice Officer.\n  Mrs. Chestnut, Mrs. Gibson--please accept our condolences are \nprayers. We are all indebted to both your husbands for their dedication \nand their selfless, heroic acts.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9003-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN HONOR OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL DAVID McCLOUD\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about another \nvery tragic incident which took place this last weekend. Yesterday, \nLieutenant General David J. McCloud, commander of all the military \nforces in Alaska, was killed when his YAK-54 stunt plane went down over \nFort Richardson. Lewis Cathrow, of Alexandria, Virginia, was also \nkilled in this tragic crash.\n  I had the pleasure of knowing David McCloud; although not nearly as \nwell as I would have liked. He and his wife Anna came to Alaska this \npast December, when he took over as commander of the Alaskan command. \nAs some of my colleagues may be aware, this post carries the \ndistinction of being responsible for all of the more than 21,000 active \nduty and reserve personnel from all branches of the Army, Air Force, \nNavy, and National Guard in Alaska. But it also means that he is a key \nmember of our community. And, Mr. President, this is how David should \nbe remembered, as a member of our community.\n  David McCloud died doing what he loved--flying. Before he took the \npost in Alaska, he told me of his plan to purchase a stunt plane, and \nhow he had flown virtually every type of plane in our Air Force fleet, \nincluding the B1-B bomber and most of the fighter models used by our \nAir Force during the last 30 years.\n  General McCloud will be sadly missed by many. My deepest condolences \ngo out to his wife, Anna, and to his family and friends. They will be \nin my thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9006-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am offering this amendment today on \nbehalf of myself, Senators Bennett, Nickles, Roberts, Helms, Shelby, \nEnzi, and Grams.\n  Before I address this amendment, I want to say that I am grateful, as \nall our members on the Banking Committee, for Chairman D'Amato bringing \nthis important piece of legislation up, focusing on it with some \ndispatch, getting it out of committee and onto the floor of the Senate. \nAlso, I wish to thank the ranking member of the Banking Committee, \nSenator Sarbanes, for his leadership as well.\n  As I suspect, both Chairman D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes are not \ngoing to agree with my amendment. Nevertheless, I am grateful that they \nhave focused on this issue and provided the kind of leadership that is \nimportant on these financial service matters.\n  Mr. President, I support credit unions and the cost-efficient service \nthey provide to their members.\n  Our amendment, which we are offering today, is not designed to hurt \ncredit unions. To the contrary, our amendment is designed to keep \ncredit unions strong, secure, and focused on their special role of \nserving consumers. It does that by preventing the unchecked expansion \nof credit unions into commercial lending. Currently, there are no \nlimitations on how much commercial lending in which a credit union may \nengage.\n  Let me emphasize that our amendment does not prevent credit unions \nfrom making commercial loans.\n  Our amendment has essentially three main points:\n  First, we would lower the commercial lending cap contained in H.R. \n1151 from 12.25 percent of a credit union's assets to 7 percent of a \ncredit union's assets. This would establish for the first time a cap on \ncommercial lending by credit unions. But the cap currently contained in \nH.R. 1151 is arbitrary, and because of an accounting loophole, is \nessentially meaningless.\n  We share with the authors of H.R. 1151 the belief that credit union \ncommercial lending should be limited. But we also believe those limits \nshould be relevant and be meaningful. The 12.25 percent of assets \ncommercial lending cap now in H.R. 1151 is completely arbitrary. Our \namendment's 7-percent cap is tied directly to the amount of capital \nthat H.R. 1151 requires a ``well-capitalized'' credit union to keep in \nreserve.\n  Let me explain what this means.\n  Credit unions, like all other financial institutions, are required by \ntheir regulators to keep a certain amount of ready capital on hand as a \ncushion in case of hard times--a sort of ``rainy day'' fund. H.R. 1151 \nwould, for the first time, establish a target amount of capital that a \nwell-capitalized credit union should keep in reserve, and would \nprohibit credit unions from making commercial loans if they fall too \nfar below that target. By tying commercial loans dollar for dollar to \ncapital reserves, we strengthen the safety and soundness of credit \nunions that choose to engage in business lending. We must make sure \nthat credit unions cannot risk more of their loan portfolio on \ncommercial ventures than they have reserve capital ready to back up the \nloans if those loans go bad.\n  We protect the consumer. We protect the credit union members. Credit \nunions would have a 3-year grace period to comply with this cap.\n  Our amendment will help H.R. 1151 to better achieve its main purpose, \nwhich is described, by the way, in the Banking Committee report on H.R. \n1151. This is the actual language coming out of the Senate Banking \nCommittee. And I quote:\n\n       . . . [to] ensure that credit unions continue to fulfill \n     their specified mission of meeting the credit and savings \n     needs of consumers, especially persons of modest means, \n     through an emphasis on consumer rather than business loans.\n\n  Second, our amendment would require that all of a credit union's \ncommercial loans must count toward its cap.\n  Current National Credit Union Administration policy, which would be \ncodified by H.R. 1151, excludes any commercial loans made to a single \nmember that totals less than $50,000 from being counted as commercial \nloans.\n  Mr. President, you heard it right. That is right. Current \nregulations, which H.R. 1151 would codify, say that a commercial loan \nis not a commercial loan if it is less than $50,000.\n  With this loophole, there is no accurate, full, or honest accounting \nfor commercial lending in credit unions. This makes no sense. No other \nfinancial institution enjoys this sort of charade and slight of hand. \nThis loophole makes any commercial lending cap meaningless, because it \npermits an unlimited number of commercial loans so long as each of \nthose loans is less than $50,000.\n  Our amendment would require truth in accounting--truth in \naccounting--for all commercial loans.\n  Third, our amendment codifies current NCUA policy that requires a \ncredit union to use qualified personnel to administer commercial loans. \nOur language states that a commercial loan officer must have 2 years \nexperience in his field. This is a commonsense provision that needs to \nbe codified. For those smaller credit unions that feel this would be a \nnew regulatory burden, there are three responses.\n  We are simply codifying current NCUA policy, and we provide a 3-year \nphase-in for compliance with this provision. The experience requirement \nwill not force credit unions who make a few small commercial loans to \nhire a full-time staffer. The NCUA's general counsel has stated that \nthis requirement could be met by hiring contract assistance on a case-\nby-case basis.\n  This is a very basic safety and soundness provision.\n  Let me be very clear about what our amendment does not do.\n  Our amendment does not--does not--restrict credit for farmers, small \nbusiness owners, or low-income areas that rely on credit unions.\n  That's because H.R. 1151, as reported by the Banking Committee, \nalready contains several generous exceptions to the commercial lending \ncap--and our amendment does nothing to change these important \nexceptions. The four exceptions are:\n  First, a credit union that is primarily engaged in business lending, \nwhich includes agricultural and small business lending, will not be \nsubject to the commercial lending cap. That means those credit unions \nthat qualify for this exemption can make agriculture or small business \nloans without any limits.\n  Second, a credit union that is chartered for the purpose of business \nlending will not be subject to the cap. This means an agriculture co-op \ncredit union would be exempt from the cap.\n  Third, a credit union that serves predominantly low-income members \nwill be exempt from the cap. This ensures that low-income areas, many \nof them located in urban areas, are not hurt by the new commercial \nlending restrictions.\n  Fourth, a credit union that is determined to be a ``community \ndevelopment financial institution,'' as defined in existing banking \nlaw, will be exempt from the cap. This exception is intended to help \nlow-income community development efforts across the Nation.\n  Mr. President, only 13 percent of the 11,400 credit unions across \nthis country, including Federal- and State-chartered, have any \ncommercial loans at all. That is according to the Credit Union National \nAssociation.\n  Our amendment has absolutely no effect on the other 87 percent of \ncredit unions that choose not to make commercial loans.\n  And even of that 13 percent of credit unions that are in the \ncommercial lending business, the vast majority will not be restricted \nby the 7 percent of assets cap that our amendment proposes.\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\n That is because commercial loans currently constitute only 1 percent \nof total credit union assets, according to the Credit Union National \nAssociation.\n  Why should credit unions be subject to a meaningful commercial \nlending cap? There are several answers to that question.\n  First, credit unions, as stated in the preamble of the Federal Credit \nUnion Act of 1934, were created by Congress to make, and I quote from \nthe preamble: ``credit more available to people of small means.'' To \nachieve this goal, Congress exempted credit unions from paying Federal \nincome taxes. Credit unions do not pay any Federal income taxes. When \nthrifts were exempt from income taxes before 1952, Congress prohibited \nthem from making any commercial loans because of their tax-exempt \nstatus.\n  A second reason to have meaningful limits on commercial lending is to \nensure fair competition--competition between small banks and credit \nunions in the commercial lending arena. Credit unions' tax exemption \nallows them to offer lower interest rates on loans and higher interest \nrates on savings accounts and certificates of deposit.\n  The third reason to have meaningful limits on commercial lending is \nto protect taxpayers by ensuring the safety and soundness of the credit \nunion system. The Federal Government stands behind each credit union \ndepositor, insuring deposits up to $100,000. If a serious financial \ncrisis in the credit union system depleted the Credit Union Share \nInsurance Fund--which is Federal deposit insurance for credit unions--\nthen the Federal Government would have to step in with taxpayer funds \nto protect depositors against loss.\n  I have several concerns about credit union safety and soundness:\n  First, unlike banks and thrifts, credit unions--as non-profit \nentities--cannot issue stock to replenish their capital reserves during \nhard times. That's a real weakness when a quick capital infusion is \nneeded--such as during a time of defaults, such as during the 1980s \nwhen we all recall the tragedy of the S, when capital levels fell \nquickly and new capital was required immediately.\n\n  Second, we've seen commercial loans put credit unions in danger \nbefore. Rhode Island experienced a credit union crisis in 1991 that \nresulted in the failure of a State-chartered private deposit insurance \nfund. The crisis was, in part, caused by excessive and risky commercial \nlending. Thirteen of the State's credit unions were permanently closed, \nand the state sought Federal assistance to repay depositors.\n  Third, by their own admission, credit unions make loans to those who \ndon't qualify for credit at banks.\n  This is their strength. This is the strength of a credit union, \nserving those who do not receive service at traditional financial \ninstitutions. However, this is also a very important area of concern, \nbecause this means credit unions are many times making very high risk \nloans to people whose credit history makes them ineligible for loans \nelsewhere.\n  Fourth, all banks and thrifts are required to abide by risk-based \ncapital standards. This means they must set aside more capital, \ndepending on how risky their loans are. Unfortunately, credit unions \ndon't have risk-based capital standards today. Now, H.R. 1151 makes a \nweak, valiant but weak, attempt to address this issue by regulating \ncapital standards for ``complex credit unions,'' but that effort is \nneither clear nor meaningful. That is why our 7-percent-of-assets cap, \nwhich ties credit union commercial loans dollar for dollar to capital \nreserves, makes sense. This protects the credit union members whose \nmoney is at risk.\n  In summary, our amendment strengthens the safety and soundness of \ncredit unions with open and honest accounting. It brings market \nfairness to the relationship between tax-exempt credit unions and tax-\npaying small community banks, and it refocuses the original intent of \ncredit unions on consumer loans and services. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this important amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me give you a little history as I see it with \nrespect to this bill and why this amendment, in my view, makes sense.\n  We are here because the Supreme Court has ruled that the NCUA, the \nregulatory body dealing with credit unions, has been misapplying the \nlaw since 1982. The Supreme Court in response to lawsuits that were \nbrought before it has ruled that credit unions have grown in violation \nof the law, or have engaged in actions that are a violation of the law \nsince 1982.\n  Since those credit unions were following the dictates of the NCUA, \ntheir regulator, it would be unfair to penalize the credit unions; they \nwere playing by the rules as they understood them. And when the \nrulemaker itself was the agency that was making a mistake, it is not \nfair to penalize the people who followed those rules. But we have to \nchange the rules if they have been improperly applied, and that is what \nthe result of the Supreme Court decision has presented us.\n  We have decided, as a Congress, that we are going to change the \nrules, that we are going to now codify that which has been done since \n1982, and I think it is right and proper that we do so. I am in favor \nof doing that, however much that may disappoint the banks that were \nhoping that with the winning of this lawsuit they could turn the clock \nback to 1982. But we cannot. We must say that those who have \nappropriately opened accounts at credit unions will have those accounts \nprotected, and that we will not turn the clock back that many years.\n  As we have done this, we have raised the maximum size of an employee \ngroup which is eligible to affiliate into a multiple common bond credit \nunion from 500 to 3,000. That is a sixfold increase, and the 3,000 \nemployee threshold encompasses 99 percent of all businesses in America. \nThere are only 16 private companies in my entire State that employ more \nthan 3,000 people. So this is a major step forward to support and \nencourage the credit union movement, and I believe it is the real heart \nof the bill that is before us, and I support this activity.\n  But in the process of dealing with the Supreme Court ruling and \nmaking the change about the maximum size of employee groups, the \nBanking Committee has taken a look at the credit union situation \noverall and has come to the conclusion, rightly in my view, that in \norder to protect the safety and soundness of credit unions, there \nshould be a limit on the amount of commercial loans that credit unions \nmake.\n  The only controversy that we have with respect to the amendment \nbefore us is not should there be such a limit but, rather, where should \nthe limit be. As it came out of the committee, the limit was at 12.25 \npercent of assets, and I supported that. But I recognized that it \nneeded to be looked at more carefully, and as I have looked at it more \ncarefully, along with the other Senators who have cosponsored this \namendment, I have come to the conclusion that the limit should be \nslightly less than the 12.25 that was in the bill from the committee. \nIt should be at 7 percent, which is the amount set aside by regulation \nas to credit union capital.\n  Why the lower amount? Well, there are several reasons. One of them \nthat Senator Hagel has already addressed has to do with safety and \nsoundness and the experience in other States, specifically Rhode Island \nthat had some serious difficulties. We don't want a repeat of those \ndifficulties, and a lower limit is a greater bulwark against those \ndifficulties than the one which is higher.\n  I am interested that the telephone calls we get in our office as this \namendment gets talked about out in the credit union world almost always \nfollow the same dialog.\n  They say, ``Why is Senator Bennett proposing an amendment that the \ncredit unions don't like? We thought he supported credit unions.''\n  Then the member of my staff answering the call said, ``Senator \nBennett is supporting an amendment that would put a limit on commercial \nloans.''\n  Then the caller said, ``But credit unions don't make commercial \nloans.''\n  Which then puts us in the position to say, ``If that in fact is true, \nwhy do you object to a limit?\"\n  Most credit union people who talked to me believe that credit unions \nmake\n\n[[Page S9009]]\n\nloans only to individuals. And the credit unions that have come to see \nme from the State of Utah have all stressed the fact that commercial \nlending is a very small percentage of their business. Indeed, they say, \n``No, we do not go above 5 percent of our total capital involved in \ncommercial loans.''\n  And, to them I say, once again, ``If you don't go above 5 percent, \nwhy would you object to a limit that is at 7 percent? You can continue \nto do exactly what you are doing under the Hagel amendment, with no \ndifficulty.''\n  Then, finally, one of them who was seized with a burst of candor \ncornered me when I was in the State this last time and said, ``We want \nto grow our commercial loan business, and if you put in the 7 percent \ncap that you are talking about, we will hit that within a matter of \nmonths. We are growing very rapidly. We want the cap higher so we can \ngrow beyond that level.''\n  This gentleman--and I use the word ``gentleman\" appropriately, \nbecause he certainly was in the way he handled himself in our \nconversation--has, as his background, a career in commercial banking. \nHe, for reasons good and sufficient unto himself, decided he was going \nto leave the bank that he had worked at most of his life and go to work \nfor a credit union.\n  Naturally, the thing he wanted to do with his new employer is use his \nskills to the very best advantage. And since his whole history is in \ngrowing commercial loans at the bank for which he had worked, he \ndecided he would now work to grow commercial loans in the credit union \nwhere he worked. And he has been very successful. The credit union \nportfolio of commercial loans under his direction is growing rapidly, \ngrowing rapidly to the point that, as I say, if you put a cap at the 7 \npercent we are talking about with this amendment, his credit union will \nhit that within a matter of months. And he said, ``Can't you stick with \nthe 12.25 percent that came out of the committee, because we will not \nhit that for maybe a year or so?\"\n  So, as I said, the issue is not, should we have a cap; the issue is \nonly where should it be. And, because he wants, naturally and properly, \nto see the amount of portfolio that he is overseeing grow to as big an \namount as it possibly can, he wants the cap to be as high as it can. I \nam very sympathetic to him and, to be honest, I don't think there is a \nsafety and soundness problem in his institution. I think he is properly \ntrained as a banker, so that he can handle commercial loans in a credit \nunion atmosphere and do very well.\n  But the public policy issue that we have to decide here on this floor \nis, do we want credit unions in that kind of business in a major way? \nThe 12.25 percent limit in the bill that came out of the committee \nanswers that question, ``Yes.'' That is a fairly major involvement for \ncredit unions. And we run the risk of having those who are not equipped \nwith former commercial bankers, like the man who talked with me, going \nup to that limit and endangering the savings and the assets of their \nother members.\n  One of the aspects of the amendment that is before us to which credit \nunion representatives object says that, if you are going to make \ncommercial loans, you have to have someone in your organization who has \nat least 2 years of business lending experience--in other words, \nsomeone like the man who came to see me while I was back in Utah, who \nclearly had plenty of years' experience.\n  Again, I am interested that credit union representatives object to \nthis requirement at the same time they insist they are not in the \nbusiness of making commercial loans. You cannot have it both ways. If, \nindeed, you want to get in commercial lending in a big way, you ought \nto have the requirement that you have someone with experience in \ncommercial lending in a big way. You can't say, ``We want a higher \nlimit for the amount of commercial lending we can do, but we want no \nrequirement that we have anybody around who understands commercial \nlending.'' This is a recipe for the kind of thing that the Senator from \nNebraska has described as already happening in some States.\n  So, I come back to the basic issue before us: What should be the \nproper public policy role of credit unions in the financial services \nmix? I believe credit unions have earned an honored place in that mix. \nI believe they have demonstrated for the last 60 years that they \nprovide a vital function and that they should be encouraged to continue \nthat vital function, and, indeed, in that function they should be \nencouraged to grow, and we should create a circumstance in which they \ncan grow and prosper. I believe that this bill does that.\n  But the policy question is, Should we as a Congress, while fixing the \nproblems created by the Supreme Court decision, at the same time \nencourage them to grow in a field where, by their own statements and \nadmissions, they have not been in the past? Should we use this bill \nsetting aside a Supreme Court decision as the vehicle to encourage new \nventures on the part of credit unions that are ill equipped for those \nventures? I think the answer is no, we should not. And, therefore, \nafter studying the matter between markup and the full committee and the \nfloor, I join with Senator Hagel in saying the limit level should be \nlower rather than higher with respect to the amount of involvement \ncredit unions should have in commercial lending.\n  I don't understand why they object to the lower level, because they \nthemselves tell me, ``We are not interested in commercial lending. That \nis not our bread and butter. That is not our area of expertise. That is \nnot what we are doing.''\n  And then I say, ``Then why do you object if we put a situation in \nplace that keeps you in your traditional area?''\n  Finally, I share this one last thought with you, Mr. President. With \nrespect to how important this amendment is to credit unions, in the May \n29 National Journal's Congress Daily, the NAFCU vice president, Pat \nKeefe, is quoted as saying, ``From our point of view, this is not \nmajor.''\n  Mr. Keefe was referring to an amendment that would have imposed \ntighter restrictions than the one we are talking about. I think he \nspeaks for the vast majority of credit union members who have been in \ntouch with my offices. This is not major for them. I think it is \nsignificant for the community banks. I think it is a responsible \ndecision for us to take.\n  Let me make it clear, if we do not agree to this amendment, I will \nstill support the bill, as I did in the committee, where it had a limit \nat 12.25 percent. Just because I think the 7 percent is more prudent \ndoes not mean that I think this is a deal killer. So, in that sense I \nguess I am signaling, ``This is not major.'' But, to me, it is major \nbecause it is a demonstration of where the public policy ought to be \nwith respect to the thrust and main direction of the credit union \nmovement. They think it is not major. To me, it is. I hope we agree to \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment submitted by the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I don't believe that the Senator intends to hurt the credit unions, \nbut I think an unintended consequence of his amendment will impose some \nvery real burdens, burdens on 4,000-plus credit unions, the small mom-\nand-pop credit unions, by including in that cap those loans that are \nmade for $50,000 and under. And, indeed, they are made to the members \nwho want to start businesses, who have an idea, and they believe, given \nsufficient capital, they can go out there and take an entrepreneurial \nidea, or maybe they have been working for someone and want to start \nthat business with a small loan. Who better to know and judge than a \nfellow member? Indeed, it requires a burden as it relates to the kind \nof people who will now have to be utilized to make that loan. That is a \nburden. Are we now going to be getting in there, micromanaging the \nsmall, well-capitalized credit union with better than 7 percent, 8 \npercent, 9 percent? I think that this will have an unintended \nconsequence. I know it will. I have heard from people inside credit \nunions. They have told me.\n  Now, Mr. President, people will ask, how do we get to 7 percent? And, \nby the way, how did we get to 12.25 percent? Those are interesting \nquestions. Who determines where a credit union s business lending \nshould or shouldn't stop?\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\n Let's start with the history of this provision.\n  There was no limitation, Mr. President, none whatsoever, prior to the \nmarkup. There wasn t any in H.R. 1151. We approached this in the best \nway we could. There were no risk-based standards. For the first time we \nset them up, and we say 7 percent for well-capitalized. That was never \nintended to be the criterion--to say, ``Therefore, you can only make \ncommercial loans up to 7 percent.''\n  To take one application when we, for the first time in the history of \nthe credit union movement, say, ``Well-capitalized, 7 percent; adequate \ncapital, 6 percent; and, by the way, if you go under that 6 percent, \nyou can't make any commercial loans,'' I think that is a tremendous \nstep, because we recognize we can't do business as usual. We want to \nprotect the taxpayer, and that is exactly what we did.\n  We came up with 12.25 because we did not want to create chaos, and we \nwanted to give those who were involved in commercial loan activity an \nopportunity to disengage without creating a problem that would be \ndifficult, if not impossible, to handle. By setting that, there will \nstill be a significant number at 12.25 percent. There will be 85 \ninstitutions that make 5,400 loans for $250 million, and they will be \ngiven 3 years to comply with the cap. So we looked at institutions, and \nwe looked at the numbers of members and we arrived at a number.\n  The amendment at the desk, in addition to creating a burden that is \ngoing to be very difficult for small credit unions to make in terms of \nwho can and can't grant these business loans, it now picks up an \nadditional number of institutions. Mr. President, 177 already exceed \nthe cap. We are talking about well-capitalized institutions that are \nmaking loans, have been making loans, and don't have problems, and \nbecause we arbitrarily come to 7 percent--and I say ``arbitrarily.'' \nThere is no reason to suggest again that because we deem a bank to be \nwell-capitalized at 7 percent, therefore, we should cap the whole \nindustry at 7 percent. I don't understand it. We will now throw 8,700 \nof those loans, $360 million, and 177 institutions into an area where \nthey have to begin to disengage to get under this arbitrary number. And \nit is arbitrary.\n  We worked with the credit unions for quite a while and with the \nadministration in attempting to come to a number. They weren't happy \nabout our imposing these standards, but we did because it was the right \nthing to do to protect the taxpayer.\n  Let me say this to you. Let's look at the totality of this. The \nunintended consequences of this are going to say, where we have some \nwell-run institutions that are providing their members and their \ncommunity with these loans and, obviously, there is a need for them, \nthat we are going to preclude them and say, ``Oh, no; just 7 percent.''\n  Heretofore, we had no limit. I think really we can second-guess \neverybody and anything, and we can make an appeal to the community \nbankers: ``We're your best friends, because look what we did.'' Do I \nreally think that is what we should be engaging in? I hope not. Only 13 \npercent of all of the institutions--that is, 1,551 out of 11,000--make \nthese loans.\n  Let me leave you with one last thought. If every institution were \nable to--and I am talking about every credit union, all 11,000, \nrecognizing that only 13 percent make commercial loans--were to be \nengaged in business lending, the total would come to something under \n$40 billion nationwide by 11,000 institutions.\n  Come on, I say to my colleagues, let's be serious. What are we trying \nto do here? That would be approximately 3 percent of all the commercial \nloans, $1.1 trillion in commercial loans that are out there.\n  What are we doing? What are we saying? I think what we are doing is \ntrying to say we are the friend of the community banker, and this is \nwhat we are going to do, we are going to be limiting these folks. \nInstead of saying we have limited, instead of saying this bill does now \nlimit, this bill does have criteria which we never had before, we are \ngoing to one-up it, and that is not going to help.\n  You may say the credit unions will accept this. I have to tell you, \nwe will go to conference, and little does one know what will take place \nwhen we get into that conference. I would like to avoid that. I would \nlike to say we have done something that even the Secretary of the \nTreasury has supported in his letter to Majority Leader Lott.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Trent: I appreciate your scheduling H.R. 1151, the \n     Credit Union Membership Access Act, for Senate floor action \n     beginning July 17. I am writing to urge expeditious Senate \n     passage of the bill--as approved by the Banking Committee on \n     April 30--without any extraneous amendments.\n       In revising the statute governing federal credit unions' \n     field of membership, the bill would protect existing credit \n     union members and membership groups, and remove uncertainty \n     created by the Supreme Court's AT decision.\n       The bill's safety and soundness provisions would represent \n     the most significant legislative reform of credit union \n     safety and soundness safeguards since the creation of the \n     National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in 1970. The bill \n     would institute capital standards for all federally insured \n     credit unions, including a risk-based capital requirement for \n     complex credit unions. It would create a system of prompt \n     corrective action--specifically tailored to credit unions as \n     not-for-profit, member-owned cooperatives. It would also take \n     a series of steps to make the Share Insurance Fund even \n     stronger and more resilient.\n       These reforms involve little cost or burden to credit \n     unions today, yet they could pay enormous dividends in more \n     difficult times.\n       The bill rightly reaffirms and reinforces credit unions' \n     mission of serving persons of modest means. Section 204 would \n     require periodic review of each federally insured credit \n     union's record of meeting the needs of such persons within \n     its field of membership. This requirement is flexible, \n     tailored to credit unions, and will impose no unreasonable \n     burden. It rests on the Congressionally mandated mission of \n     credit unions and on the benefits of federal deposit \n     insurance. Such deposit insurance gives credit union members \n     ironclad assurance about the safety of their savings, and \n     thus helps credit unions compete for deposits with larger, \n     more widely known financial institutions (just as it helps \n     community banks and thrifts). Section 204 is particularly \n     appropriate in view of how the bill liberalizes the common \n     bond requirement and thus facilitates credit unions' \n     expansion beyond their core membership groups.\n       Finally, I would like to comment on the safety and \n     soundness of credit unions' business lending. Credit unions \n     may make business loans only to their members, and cannot \n     make loans to business corporations. Under the National \n     Credit Union Administration's regulations, each business loan \n     must be fully secured with good-quality collateral, the \n     borrower must be personally liable on the loan, and business \n     loans to any one borrower generally cannot exceed 15 percent \n     of the credit union's reserves. Credit unions' business loans \n     have delinquency rates that are comparable to those on \n     commercial loans made by community banks and thrifts, and \n     charge-off (i.e., loss) rates that compare favorably with \n     those of banks and thrifts. We believe that existing \n     safeguards--together with such new statutory protections as \n     the 6 percent capital requirement, the risk-based capital \n     requirement for complex credit unions, and the system of \n     prompt corrective action--represent an adequate response to \n     safety and soundness concerns about credit unions' business \n     lending.\n       We look forward to working with you and other Senators to \n     secure expeditious passage of a clean bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The letter is addressed to Senator Lott, the majority \nleader, with copies sent to myself and Senator Sarbanes, the ranking \nmember. He concludes by saying:\n\n       We believe that existing safeguards--together with such new \n     statutory protections as the 6 percent capital requirement, \n     risk-based capital requirement for complex credit unions, and \n     the system of prompt corrective action--represent an adequate \n     response to the safety and soundness concerns about credit \n     unions' business lending.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe the 7 percent will constitute a very real \nand severe burden and hardship. As I mentioned, 85 credit unions \nalready exceed the cap. It is mischief making. The unintended \nconsequences will not improve the safety and soundness of credit union \noperations. That is just not the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be very brief, but I want to \nfollow on the chairman in expressing my opposition to this amendment. \nThe chairman\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\njust quoted from a letter from Secretary Rubin, but I would like to \nexpand that quotation a bit. In his last paragraph, Secretary Rubin \nsaid:\n\n       Finally, I would like to comment on the safety and \n     soundness of credit unions' business lending.\n\n  So he addressed this very issue.\n\n       Credit unions may make business loans only to their \n     members, and cannot make loans to business corporations. \n     Under the National Credit Union Administration's regulations, \n     each business loan must be fully secured with good-quality \n     collateral, the borrower must be personally liable on the \n     loan, and business loans to any one borrower generally cannot \n     exceed 15 percent of the credit union's reserves. Credit \n     unions' business loans have delinquency rates that are \n     comparable to those on commercial loans made by community \n     banks and thrifts, and charge-off (i.e., loss) rates that \n     compare favorably with those of banks and thrifts. We believe \n     that existing safeguards--together with such new statutory \n     protections as the 6 percent capital requirement, the risk-\n     based capital requirement for complex credit unions, and the \n     system of prompt corrective action--represent an adequate \n     response to safety and soundness concerns about credit \n     unions' business lending.\n\n  It is important to note, of course, that the Secretary is speaking \nwith the benefit of an 18-month--actually, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah was the one who put the requirement in in the previous piece \nof legislation for the Treasury to undertake such a study. That study \ncame in a few months ago and then was available to the Treasury, in \nterms of making recommendations as we address this legislation, and \navailable, of course, to the Members of the Congress.\n  The Secretary pointed out in his letter:\n\n       The bill's safety and soundness provisions would represent \n     the most significant legislative reform of credit union \n     safety and soundness safeguards since the creation of the \n     National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in 1970. The bill \n     would institute capital standards for all federally insured \n     credit unions, including a risk-based capital requirement for \n     complex credit unions. It would create a system of prompt \n     corrective action--specifically tailored to credit unions as \n     not-for-profit, member-owned cooperatives. It would also take \n     a series of steps to make the Share Insurance Fund even \n     stronger and more resilient.\n       These reforms involve little cost or burden to credit \n     unions today, yet they could pay enormous dividends in more \n     difficult times.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to note that this legislation, \nas it came to us in the committee, had no limitations. And under the \ncurrent law and regulations, there are no limitations. So what the \ncommittee is doing here is putting in a limitation where none had \nheretofore existed. So it is not as though the committee simply ignored \nthe assertions that are now being made. The committee reached a \ndecision and struck a balancing point. And that is what is reflected in \nthe legislation.\n  But as I said, this does place statutory restrictions on member \nbusiness loans for the first time. In fact, undercapitalized credit \nunions would not be permitted to increase their net commercial lending. \nIn fact, the restrictions that are in this legislation are tighter than \nwhat now applies under the regulations of the National Credit Union \nAdministration.\n  These loans can only be made to members, not to an outside business \ncorporation. This is consistent with the credit union's mandate to \nprovide services to members, not a broad array of customers, and in and \nof itself places a significant constraint on credit union commercial \nlending overall.\n  I understand the arguments that are being made. I think the committee \nreached a reasonable process. The $50,000-loan issue, I think, is an \nimportant one in terms of the requirements placed upon credit unions. \nIn fact, it is the NCUA, under its regulations, that determines that \nthe dollar amount of risk is very small, small enough that they have \nregulations that excluded loans less than $50,000 from being counted as \na member business loan.\n  This is the current state of affairs. There are not all that many \nsuch loans. But for some credit unions, it is quite important in terms \nof their member activities. It also avoids the necessity of trying to \nseparate out what is a commercial loan and what is a business loan.\n  If you buy a pickup truck and use it for business activities, does \nthat then become a commercial loan? And how would the credit unions \nhave to address those kinds of questions?\n  I say to my colleagues, recognizing the issue that is being raised by \nthe amendment, I simply say that the committee was not oblivious to \nthis issue. We tried to address it, I think, in a sensible and balanced \nand forthright way. That is why we have the limitations that are \ncontained in the legislation that is before us.\n  I urge my colleagues not to alter those limitations and, therefore, \nto reject this amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The distinguished Senator from \nUtah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by the \nchairman and the ranking member of the committee. They underscore my \nearlier statement that the issue here is not, should we have a limit on \ncommercial lending, but rather, where should it be and what should its \nterms be?\n  I agree with the Senator from Maryland that the committee did, \nindeed, address this; did come to the conclusion there should be some \nlimits on commercial lending, and reached a compromise position that \nmade it possible for us to unanimously report the bill with this limit \nin it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to make the observation that I think there are \nsome of my colleagues who believe there should not be any limits.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I accept that correction.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The committee crossed that threshold, as it were, by \nits decision. And I would reflect that here. I do think there are some \nof our colleagues in this body that do not think there should be \nlimits. They do not concede the point that the Senator is making.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I think he is correct \nthat there are some in the body who do not think there ought to be a \nlimit.\n  If I could just make one comment, the reason there is no limit now is \nbecause the original drafters of the legislation creating credit unions \nnever conceived there would be any commercial lending by credit unions. \nIt reminds me a little of the old story, ``Please Don't Eat the \nDaisies,'' where the kids said, ``Well, you never told us not to.'' And \nthe mother said, ``It never occurred to me that you would, and \ntherefore, I didn't give you those restrictions in the first place.''\n  But now it has started. I think the committee has rightly and \nproperly said, we want to keep credit unions focused in the area where \nthey have traditionally been focused, providing the service they have \ntraditionally provided. We are going to allow some commercial lending \nbecause they have gotten into that area.\n  But there is empirical evidence that credit unions can get in trouble \nwith their commercial lending. We want to take advantage of that \nevidence and put a limit on it. So the question is, Should the limit be \n12.25 percent? Should it be 7 percent? And should the $50,000 exemption \ncontinue?\n  I realize in responding to the Senator from Maryland that the $50,000 \nthreshold does put some new unchartered territory on this issue. We do \nnot have as much information as we would like. But I will share with \nthe Senate the information that we do have.\n  During 1992 and 1993, the NCUA required credit unions to collect \ninformation on business loans under the threshold, which at that time \nwas $25,000 rather than $50,000. I think it goes to the issue that the \nchairman raised about the burden that would be placed on credit unions \nto deal with this kind of requirement. There has been a period in our \nhistory when it was there. The NCUA used its authority to put that \nrequirement in place.\n  During 1992, the only year for which we have complete information, \ntotal business loans both above and below the threshold were 1.62 \npercent of the total outstanding loans. In other words, once again, the \ncredit unions were saying, by their actions, ``We are not primarily \ninvolved in commercial lending.'' Of this 1.62 percent, loans above \n$25,000 constituted 1.42 percent, with loans under $25,000 constituting \nthe remaining .20 percent.\n  I think this tells us that the terms of this amendment can be adhered \nto. I think we have some past experience\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\nthat says this will not be a burden and particularly, again, this will \nnot be a burden on the small credit unions who do not do this anyway. \nAll we are really saying to them is we do not want you to do it, we do \nnot want you to get into territory that could cause you difficulty.\n  The question has been raised, How about buying a pickup truck? Is \nthat a business loan or a personal loan? In the hearings some of the \ncredit union representatives said to me, ``Senator, you have to \nunderstand, in a credit union every single commercial loan is backed by \nthe personal guarantee of the individual members of the credit union.'' \nAnd I said--and I repeat here on the floor--``I have borrowed a lot of \nmoney in my lifetime. I borrowed it from commercial banks. I borrowed \nit for commercial reasons. And in every single instance, I have had to \nmake a personal guarantee. In every single instance, the bank wanted my \npersonal guarantee. Sometimes they wanted my wife's personal guarantee. \nSometimes I had the feeling they wanted the promise of our first-born \nchild if we didn't produce--even though this was a business loan--the \nrepayment appropriately.''\n  So the credit unions are not giving us anything specifically \ndifferent when they say these are loans only made to members, and they \nhave the members' personal guarantee. That is standard business \npractice everywhere across the board.\n  As I said before, for me, this is a public policy debate of, what is \nit we are trying to do in terms of shaping the direction of the \nfinancial services industry?\n  As I have said many times before, the financial services industry \nregulatory framework was created at a time when everybody knew where \nthey were--credit unions were a very specific niche. They knew what \nthey did. Commercial banks were a very specific niche. They knew what \nthey did. The same is true of insurance companies and stockbrokers and \nsavings and loans. Everybody had a clear understanding and nobody \ncompeted across those lines.\n  Today, the competition runs across lines everywhere--insurance \ncompanies hand out checkbooks. I told a story before when my father \ndied, we notified the life insurance company of his death and awaited a \ncheck of the face value of his insurance policy. Instead, we got a \ncheckbook with a notice saying, ``This money has been deposited in this \naccount as of the date of your husband's death''--it was addressed to \nmy mother--``Here is a checkbook. You may write checks on that account \nand interest will accrue from the date of your husband's death.'' In \nother words, don't be in a big hurry to take your money away from the \ninsurance company; use it as you would a checking account.\n  When I purchased some stocks in one situation and I wanted to redeem \nthose stocks under the old regulatory pattern that I was familiar with, \nI had to go down to the broker and the broker would give me a check. \n``No, no, no, no, no,'' the broker says, ``we will give you a checkbook \nand you can write checks up to the value of your margin account against \nthe margin value of your stocks''--clearly crossing the lines between \nbanks, brokers, and insurance companies and so on.\n  Now, we are beginning to say we have to create a new regulatory \nstructure for the new reality of the financial services world. We \nrecognize that everybody is in everybody else's business. All we are \ndebating here on this floor is to what degree do we want credit unions \nto get out of their traditional business into the commercial lending \nbusiness. I am not sure that says they should make no commercial loans. \nI think that is appropriate, particularly for the larger and more \nstable institutions to which the chairman has referred. But as a matter \nof policy, I think we are saying, I hope we are saying in this \namendment, we want credit unions to stay where they have been \ntraditionally.\n  If we say, ``No, the credit unions should get into commercial lending \nin a big way,'' then at some point we are going to have to address the \nissue of taxation. We have not done that in this bill. We should not do \nthat in this bill. It would not be appropriate in this bill. But as a \npublic policy matter, if credit unions are going to get into commercial \nlending in a major way, the Congress is going to have to address the \nreality of the tax subsidy that they currently enjoy. I would just as \nsoon avoid that question for awhile. I think keeping the credit unions \nin a more limited area of commercial lending will help us do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me address something here. Let's put this in \nperspective. For the first time, this committee has limited, limited \nseverely--there were no limits before now--when you said you can't do \nmore than 12\\1/4\\ percent of your assets. If every institution were to \ndo that--which they are not and no one says they are, not even the \nproponents of this legislation claim that they are going to be doing \nthis--you still would amount to less than 3 percent of all of the \ncommercial loans, if every credit union maximized its commercial loan \npotential, and they are not doing that. There is no effort to do so.\n  To come in and arbitrarily say, ``No, no, now we will take a \nlimit''--you place a limit of 12\\1/4\\ percent--``but this is not good \nenough, so we will lower to 7. In addition, now we will take the small \nloans that 5,000 of these institutions make and we will require you to \nhave a person with 2 years' business lending experience on staff to \nmake even the smallest of loans.''\n  I wonder if my friend knows that is one of the provisions in this \namendment.\n  Now, let's take a look--you will hear that this lending cap is to \n``Save the taxpayer.'' That is hokum. If you took all of the \n``chargeoffs'' on bad loans, it is .23 percent from commercial banks. \nAnd guess what? Credit unions are at .19 percent.\n  Again, we are for the first time imposing strict standards that \ncredit unions never had before. Now my gosh, if we came with the same \nbill that the House put here, then I would be here to join my colleague \nin saying: ``No, we need to make sure that they are well capitalized. \nNo, we will not let banks that are not adequately capitalized and that \nare in trouble make loans. No, we are going to see to it that you have \nthe kind of loan offices that commercial banks have.''\n  Why do we want to weight this down? How many angels on the head of a \npin? That is the type of debate we are having. Should it be 7 percent? \nWell, why did we come up with 12\\1/4\\? Because there would be some \ndisruption, but credit unions could handle it. Now we want to go in and \ncreate a situation where you will have 177 credit unions that now make \n8,700 loans, $360 million, and they will have to begin to disengage. \nWill some of the commercial banks like that? Sure, sure they will.\n  Let's understand what this will do. Some of the small bankers, you \ncan go back and say, ``Look what we did, we got them out of the \nbusiness.'' That is what it comes down to. I just suggest, if the \nSenator's amendment is serious, why not go to 6 percent or 5 percent?\n  What about the tax issue? I have heard more mutterings about that. \nThere is a genuine effort because people don't like the competition. In \nsome cases they perceive it as unfair, and, indeed, where a small \ncommunity bank is paying taxes and he is side by side with a local \ncredit union that is every bit as large and they are doing a good job \nand they are not paying taxes, I understand and I feel for that person.\n  I am cosponsoring the legislation offered by our good friend from \nColorado, Senator Allard, who has introduced a way to begin to help \nsome of the banks. Maybe we have to look at other ways in which we can \nhelp community banks. But let's not unfairly go from where we had no \ncap whatever with a good-faith effort, working with the administration, \nworking with the National Credit Union, working with the credit unions \nthemselves. We came to 12\\1/4\\ percent and somebody says, ``No, we can \ndo better; we will make it 7 percent.'' There is no rationale, no tie-\nin, to the amount of the commercial loans. If you had a staggering loss \ncoming from commercial loans, I would say yes, do it. There is no \nevidence of it. The record does not support that. So why are we doing \nit?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, may I respond to my friend and chairman. He \nmade some good points, legitimate\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\nquestions, as did the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee.\n  Let me first assure my friend from New York what this amendment is \nabout. It is not about mischief-making. It is not about burdening \ncredit unions. It is about things like open, honest accounting. I just \ndon't understand why anyone would reject or object to a clear \nunderstanding of what the commercial loan portfolio is for any credit \nunion. Why would you object to taking any loan, a commercial loan, \nunder $50,000, and putting it in an appropriate accounting category in \na portfolio? It is not about burdening the accounting process. It is \nabout open, honest accounting.\n  When my friend talks about burdening these small credit unions by \nforcing them to bring in professionals who have had a minimum of 2 \nyears in commercial lending, you mention my amendment, did I understand \nmy amendment. I understand it, I think, fairly well, and I will read \nyou from what we say in here. We talk about the NCUA's general counsel \nposition on this, as has stated that the requirement that we put in \nthis amendment could be met by hiring contract assistants on a case-by-\ncase basis. Now, this should be, like any financial institution, about \nsolid accounting. I don't know of anybody who doesn't agree with that \nor who would not want that, so that the members of a credit union know \nexactly how large the commercial portfolio is of the credit union they \nbelong to.\n\n  There are a couple of other things I want to address, including the \nissue of large credit unions who would have to scale back within a \nmonth or two, or would have to cash in their loans. I read, Mr. \nPresident, from the Banking Committee document here on page 10 of the \nreport. It talks about the four exemptions; the four exemptions are \npretty clear. You know about these: ``Loans for such purposes as \nagriculture, self-employment, small business, large up-front \ninvestment, maintenance. . . .'' And it goes on and on. These are all \nareas that are exempt from my amendment.\n  Let's also talk about what this bill is doing and what the House bill \ndid in response to the Supreme Court decision. We now, in effect, have \nno common bond anymore at all. There is no common bond at all. Now, if \nthere is no common bond left in the credit union policy philosophy--\ngetting somewhat to what my colleague and friend from Utah has been \ntalking about--then is it not appropriate to probe somewhat, saying, \nwell, if we all want to live with the 1934, 1937 statute that says no \ntaxes, but also no common bond, and no this, no that--I am not sure \nthat is a very wise thing to do.\n  If we are going to have some changes--and markets change and the \nfinancial service industry is dynamic, as demands change, needs change, \nsupply changes--then it is appropriate to focus on some of these areas \nI believe we have focused on. The chairman is right. His mark that came \nout of committee was much better, much more responsible, much more \naccountable than the House version. He is exactly right.\n  What Senator Bennett and I and others are saying is that we need to \ncontinue to focus on some of these areas of great concern, because when \nyou open up credit unions to where they are now going to be opened up, \nwhere there is absolutely no common bond, and then you say, well, you \ncan go forward and lend commercially, yet, don't bother us with the \nfacts, we are not going to count any commercial loan less than $50,000, \nand we really don't have a good accounting as to how much is in the \ncommercial loan portfolio, then I am not sure how accountable and \nresponsible that is.\n  So those are just a couple of items that I wanted to address. These \nare important issues. These are important questions. This is an \nimportant issue. With that, I appreciate an opportunity to further \nexplain some of the dynamics of our amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will make just one comment on the \nstatement of my friend, the chairman of the committee. I agree with him \nabsolutely that there are no massive failures. We do have the one \nexample that occurred in the State of Rhode Island, and it is reflected \nin the additional views of Senator Reed of Rhode Island when he wrote, \nwith respect to the bill that came out of the committee, that he was \nconcerned that the cap adopted by the committee is higher than the \nlevel of commercial lending that credit unions are currently engaged \nin, and he is concerned that it might lead to a repeat of the problems \nthey had in Rhode Island.\n  I agree completely with the Senator from New York that we do not face \na crisis here. My support of the amendment stems from my conviction \nthat the amendment would help us avoid a crisis in the future. The \namendment would establish a cap that is above the level of activity \nthat is currently going on, with the exception of a very few major \ncredit unions who have 3 years in which to work things out. It would \nestablish a cap above where things currently are, allowing people \nplenty of room to round off their present activity. But it would send \nthe public policy message that says: We want credit unions to remain in \ntheir traditional niche in the financial services area. And it is for \nthat reason that I have decided to support this amendment, because that \nis where I want credit unions to remain.\n  As I said earlier in my statement, all of the people who call me to \ntalk about this bill insist that credit unions don't make commercial \nloans now. These are the members of the credit unions who are calling \nin who are unaware of the fact that their credit unions are making \ncommercial loans. Therefore, I can't understand why they get upset when \nwe say we are putting in a limit. It is not arbitrary in the sense that \nit is a limit above current levels; it is a limit above where people \nare currently operating and is simply sending the message that we don't \nwant the current situation to change. That, after all, is the primary \npurpose of this bill.\n  Without this bill, the Supreme Court changes the current situation \nand changes it drastically. The bill is crafted to say: No, we don't \nwant to change; we want the present situation with respect to credit \nunions to be protected. Therefore, we are going to pass a bill that \nwill change the law to protect where we are. Our amendment simply says, \nwith respect to commercial lending and the levels of commercial \nlending, we will protect where we are.\n  Now, I recognize there are those who disagree. I recognize that the \ncommittee decided to put the cap at a slightly higher level than one \nthat would protect where we are, that would allow some growth from \nwhere we are in commercial lending. I don't think the Republic will \nfall if we allow that growth to occur. But I do think that if the \nthrust of this legislation is to keep in place the current situation of \ncredit unions, our amendment is the logical way to keep in place the \ncurrent situation with respect to commercial loans.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I don't think it is altogether accurate \nto say that the current bill seeks only to keep in place the exact \ncurrent situation. As the Treasury pointed out in a letter from \nSecretary Rubin to the leadership, ``The bill's safety and soundness \nprovisions would represent the most significant legislative reform of \ncredit union safety and soundness safeguards since the creation of the \nNational Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in 1970.'' So that, in \neffect, we made very substantial changes on the safety and soundness \nissue, and the Treasury Secretary later in his letter, when he was \ndiscussing the very issue of the safety and soundness of credit unions \nbusiness lending, came back and made reference to these changes: ``. . \n. the risk-based capital requirement for complex credit unions, and the \nsystem of prompt corrective action--represent an adequate response to \nsafety and soundness concerns about credit unions' business lending.''\n  So we did, in effect, make some significant changes on the safety and \nsoundness issue. The Treasury has referenced those changes in analyzing \nthe question of credit unions' business lending and thereby reached its \nconclusion that that did not pose a safety and soundness issue.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Maryland \nthat\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\nthe bill does represent a significant step forward in the regulatory \nframework with credit unions. I think his clarifying remarks are \ncorrect and welcome.\n  The point I was making, which I think is still a valid one, is from \nthe standpoint of the consumer, from the standpoint of the credit union \nmember. The great angst on the part of credit union members, when the \nSupreme Court decision came down, was reflected in their visits with me \nrepeatedly in my office. It was that: We are going to lose everything \nwe have and you must pass this bill to protect what we have.\n  I heard that over and over again in town meetings throughout the \nState of Utah, and over and over from people who called. From the \nstandpoint of the credit union member, they are pleading for \nlegislation that says: Let us keep what we have. Do not allow this \ndecision to take away from us that which we have come to enjoy and get \nbenefit from.\n  My reference was to the reaction on the part of the consumer and the \ncredit union member rather than on the part of the regulator.\n  I think what we have done in the committee does that and, at the same \ntime, as the Senator from Maryland points out, creates some stability \nfor the credit union situation that was not there prior to this act.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, very briefly, if we were seeking to \nleave the consumer or the user of the credit union exactly in the \nposture in which they now find themselves prior to the Supreme Court \ndecision, we would have no limitation on credit union business lending, \nbecause that was the existing state of affairs.\n  So in that sense, the problem of an issue was raised. There was an \neffort to respond to that problem. But if one is to use the argument \nthat all we should do in this legislation is to return to the status \nquo--that that is the whole purpose of the legislation--then we have no \nlimitation, because the status quo was without limitation.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator is once again correct in \nterms of the regulatory situation that existed. I am talking about the \nmarket situation that existed, and our amendment would not change the \nmarket situation. It would not change the amount of commercial lending \nthe credit unions are doing.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to speak on behalf of the \nHagel amendment, because I, too, am very concerned about the safety and \nsoundness of our nation s credit unions.\n  Mr. President, I was State treasurer of Texas and dealt with banks \nand certainly credit unions, as well as other kinds of financial \ninstitutions.\n  I think the banking system that we have, while it could use some \nimprovement--and perhaps there is going to be legislation in the future \nthat is going to have a few more areas of deregulation--nevertheless, I \nthink the banking system that has niches for the different banking \ninstitutions and the balancing of those niches has served us well.\n  I think the credit unions have particularly been a breath of fresh \nair in our banking system, because they have been able to offer \nsomething that banks and savings and loan associations and other \nfinance institutions have not been able to offer. They have had unique \ncharacteristics in that they have been member-owned and member-operated \ninstitutions.\n  Credit unions do not operate for profit and, therefore, do not pay \ntaxes. Credit unions have limitations on their membership, generally \nbased on affinity among the members. They rely on volunteer boards of \ndirectors that come from their membership. They have been able, because \nof the lack of taxes and because of this affinity, to give great \nservices to their members. They have been able to offer mortgages, \nautomobile loans, and personal loans that have been very favorable to \ntheir members. And they have served a terrific purpose.\n  I want credit unions to stay strong in order to continue giving these \nkinds of services to their members. We are expanding the types of \nmembership they can have. It is certainly going to be a bigger arena. \nBut, nevertheless, I don't think we should take that next step into \nallowing a risky commercial loan portfolio without the requisite \nreserves that are required by banks and which I think are important for \nsafety and soundness.\n  The Hagel amendment limits commercial loan activity to 7 percent of \nassets. That is what the bill requires for the reserves for a well \nfinanced and strong credit union. We want to make sure that the \ndeposits of credit union members are not put more at risk than the \nreserves that are required to be kept, particularly when you get into \ncommercial lending, which is much more risky than the home mortgages \nand automobile loans and the personal loans that credit unions have \nmade.\n  I remember what happened when Congress started trying to eliminate \nthe differences among the financial institutions. And that is what \ncaused the S crisis. We had S going into real estate lending \nwithout the requisite reserves. All of us paid a heavy price for that. \nI do not want to jeopardize the strength of our credit union.\n  I hope that when we pass this amendment, if we pass this amendment, \nit will provide for the strengthening of the credit union. I will \nsupport this bill. I think it is a wonderful bill in many respects, \nbecause it is going to give more people more access to credit unions. \nBut I think we have to make sure, as we do it, that we protect the \nsafety and soundness of the deposit of credit union members, as well as \nthe credit union industry itself.\n  The last thing I want is to come back here at the end of my next term \nand have to look at a credit union crisis because we didn't take the \nvery cautious step of requiring this same reserve requirement as the \nlimit on commercial loans.\n  That is it in a nutshell.\n  I think the fact that Senator Hagel's amendment matches the reserves \nwith the amount of commercial loans that will be available is a very \ncorrect decision. It is the right thing to do. It will keep the safety \nand soundness of credit unions, and it will allow more people to have \naccess to those commercial loans, as well as access to the credit \nunions in general. But mainly we want to make sure that everyone is \nprotected and that we don't run into any trouble in the future.\n  I hope very much that we will pass this bill. I hope we will pass the \nHagel amendment so that we have a win all the way around--giving more \naccess to more people to join the credit union; giving more people \naccess to the lower interest home mortgages, car loans, personal loans, \nbut making sure that we protect those deposits so that the credit \nunions will be able to continue to give a little bit higher rate of \ninterest to those that it is paying; and so that the deposits will be \nsafe; so that the credit union itself will be safe; so that we will not \nhave to face a financial crisis in the future that Congress would have \nto address with taxpayer dollars as we have seen with the S crisis.\n  I thank Senator Hagel and the others for their leadership. I think \nthis is a good, sound move. I hope we can pass this amendment and then \npass the bill that will create bigger and better credit unions in our \ncountry.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me address something, because the \nmore you get into this, you begin to learn.\n  Soundness and safety: It is an issue that we are all concerned about, \nbecause we have been here. We have gone through this. And we have seen \nsome extraordinary situations, which cost the taxpayers. That is why \nthe committee, the ranking member, and the Republicans and Democrats \nworking together, said we have a structure for the first time of \nprovisions that will address that--we have done that--risk-based \ncapital, based upon soundly capitalized institutions--6 percent for \nsome, and 7 percent for the others-- and giving to the administration \nthe ability to close these places down.\n\n  Now, look, when we start talking about commercial loans posing a \nproblem historically and looking at where we are today, they haven't. \nThat is a canard. Indeed, if we take a look and see what it constitutes \nin terms of their total portfolios, it is under 2 percent. All of their \nloans are under 2 percent without any limitation.\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\n  So let me suggest to you, I think when we come in and say we are \ngoing to limit business lending no matter what, we are saying to each \ncredit union, those that do--forget about the thousands that don't--\nunder no circumstances are you going to go up over 12.25. To say that \nsafety and soundness is going to be protected because somehow we are \nlimiting commercial loans, that doesn't square up with the facts. It \njust does not. If, indeed, the credit union commercial loan failure \nrate has been less than those same loans made by commercial banks, how \ncan you say that limiting this activity will provide greater safety and \nsoundness?\n  That is the record. The failure rate has been less from credit unions \nthan it has from commercial banks in commercial lending, and they loan \nless, including the loans for under $50,000. And why are we opposed to \ncounting those loans for less than $50,000? I will tell you why. \nBecause you are going to keep honest people honest. Maybe I shouldn't \nsay this because the guy who is the entrepreneur who wants that loan \nwill come to his credit union. OK, they say it is a commercial loan, \nand you are going to begin getting into businesses or classifying \nwhether it is personal or whether it is commercial. So they said, look, \nup to $50,000, we know the people; they are dealing within the \ninstitution. It is a member. We are not going to get into the business \nof classifying whether it is commercial or not. We are going to say, \npresumptively, any loan up to $50,000 gets an exemption. We don't go \nthrough this business of having to classify these loans then have staff \nmaking loans meet certain experience levels which this amendment does.\n  The present situation is that for making those business loans over \n$50,000, you must have 2 years of lending experience.\n  Now, why did the National Credit Union Administration do that? \nBecause they recognized the need as credit unions got into loans of \nhigher cost and more exposure. It is prudent to have somebody on staff \nwho has that experience. That is why they did it.\n  Now the consequence of this amendment will be a burden where credit \nunions are going to have to hire loan officers to make small, \ncommercial loans of $25,000, $20,000, $15,000, or $30,000. Do you \nreally think that this isn't going to have an adverse impact on the \nsmall credit union that would have to do this? Heretofore, small \nbusiness loans were on the basis of knowing that member, knowing that \nhe or she has a good record, knowing that there is a good business \ninvestment opportunity.\n  Now, look, in addition to that, we have tightened those standards and \nsaid credit unions can't even make business loans unless they hit \ncertain criteria of capital. We didn't have any capital standards \nbefore. Yet, I think when one says this is safety and soundness, it is \nnot. The record doesn't indicate that.\n  What it is--and I respect those who say we want to limit their \nability to develop this business and say under no circumstances will it \nbe more than what your capital is--that is what it is doing. It is \nlimiting the ability of credit unions to involve themselves in \ncommercial lending.\n  I think including the $50,000 loans will be going too far. That is \nwhy the credit union people and people who represent small businesses \nurge that we not support this amendment because what it will do is make \nit harder to get loans. I have a letter from the Small Business \nSurvival Committee. I am going to ask it be made a part of the record. \nThe American Small Business Association similarly asked us not to \nrestrict the availability of commercial credit any further.\n  Times are booming today, but they may not always be booming. Then \nwhere do people go? Now you can go to your local bank, and they seem to \nhave plenty of money to go around. What happens when things tighten up? \nThen we are going to make it difficult, if not impossible, for people \nwho would have had the ability, if necessary, to go to their credit \nunions and to get maybe that $25,000 small business loan.\n  I ask unanimous consent these two letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Small Business\n\n\n                                           Survival Committee,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 1998.\n       Dear GOP Senator: The Small Business Survival Committee \n     (SBSC) continues to strongly urge the Senate to fully support \n     the Credit Union Membership Access Act, H.R. 1151. Every day, \n     over a thousand Americans are turned away from credit union \n     membership because of the Supreme Court ruling which \n     nullified President Reagan's modification of the 1934 Federal \n     Credit Union Act. A large proportion of these individuals are \n     workers in small businesses who find themselves locked out by \n     the outdated and arbitrary ``common bond'' requirement. It \n     only makes sense that federal laws written in 1934 be \n     reformed for our modern economy.\n       However, placing restrictions on ``member business loans,'' \n     as supported by the banking industry, only serves to impede \n     the growth of the small business sector. SBSC will key vote \n     any amendments on the Senate floor which further restrict \n     access to capital through new regulations on member business \n     loans. A vote for these restrictions is a vote against small \n     business.\n       The banking industry has invested great quantities of its \n     time and resources lobbying for more taxes and regulations on \n     credit unions. Rather than lobbying to restrict what they \n     traditionally do not do themselves (provide loans for small \n     businesses), a more productive approach may be to advocate \n     lifting arcane and unnecessary laws on themselves--\n     particularly for the survival of small community banks.\n       In the area of member business loans, SBSC urges the Senate \n     to emulate House language which studies the issue for a year \n     to determine what, if any, action is needed. Inadvertently \n     denying capital to plumbers, farmers, churches, and down-\n     sized credit union members who wish to start a business are \n     not the type of credit union reforms that should be advanced \n     by a pro-small business, pro-family Congress.\n       SBSC urges the Senate to send the Credit Union Membership \n     Access Act, as passed out of the Senate Banking Committee, to \n     the President for signing without restrictive amendments. \n     Thank you for taking SBSC's views into account.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    American Small\n\n\n                                       Businesses Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 1998.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato: Protecting the rights of small \n     businesses remains a fundamental priority of the American \n     Small Business Association (ASBA). In this regard, on behalf \n     of America's small businesses we ask for your support and \n     immediate consideration of the Credit Union Membership Access \n     Act.\n       Prompted by the February 1998, Supreme Court decision to \n     limit the expansion of federal credit unions, the U.S. House \n     of Representatives overwhelmingly approved (411-8) the Credit \n     Union Membership Access Act (H.R. 1151) on April 1, 1998. If \n     enacted by the Senate, this legislation would allow federal \n     credit unions to derive their membership from a variety of \n     occupations. This is essential to small business. These \n     organizations count on the presence of multi-group credit \n     unions to keep rates and loan fees affordable and competitive \n     and to provide access to capital many would otherwise be \n     without.\n       According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), small \n     business employees constitute more than 52 percent of the \n     private sector workforce. Generally defined as organizations \n     having fewer than 500 people, SBA further reports that 99.7 \n     percent of all businesses fall into this category. In fact, \n     they represent the largest and fastest growing portion of the \n     economy in the United States. Multiple-group credit unions \n     ensure the availability of financial services to these \n     organizations and to many low-income residents. They are \n     member-owned, not-for-profit cooperatives which encourage \n     savings and investment in those who might otherwise not \n     consider it an option. Should the Senate not pass the Credit \n     Union Membership Access Act, the Supreme Court ruling will \n     immediately limit access for these individuals.\n       The Credit Union Membership Access Act is pro-consumer and \n     pro-competition. It preserves the right to choose for \n     millions of Americans and ensures that small businesses will \n     have the ability to offer their employees the same benefits \n     already available to those in the largest of corporations. On \n     behalf of America's small businesses, we ask for your \n     immediate consideration and support of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Blair Childs,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I just want to again reiterate on the safety and \nsoundness issue that the Department of the Treasury was charged by the \nCongress in the Economic Growth and Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 to \nundertake a major study of credit unions, and the Department did that. \nThis is the report from the Treasury Department which was submitted to \nus on December 11 of 1997. So they took some 15 months to do it.\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\n  In his letter to the leadership, Secretary Rubin underscored that the \nsafety and soundness provisions in this bill, which in effect largely \ntrack what the Secretary recommended, were the most significant \nlegislative reform of credit union safety and soundness safeguards \nsince the creation of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in \n1970 and went on then to find that the business lending provisions \nposed no difficulty, that they represented an adequate response to \nsafety and soundness concerns about credit unions' business lending.\n  I won't take a back seat to anyone in my concern about safety and \nsoundness, but I think that has been addressed in this legislation. The \nTreasury, which did this extensive study and made these quite broad \nrecommendations, took a look at the bill and has concluded that the \nbill represents a very major and significant legislative reform of \ncredit union safety and soundness safeguards, and in light of those \nprovisions that are in the bill thought that they were adequate to any \nconcerns with respect to safety and soundness about credit unions' \nbusiness lending.\n  We have the people who did this comprehensive study--they took 15 \nmonths--make their recommendations, some of which were quite \nsignificant. The committee responded to that, and in the light of what \nthe committee has done, the Treasury has taken the official position \nthat concerns about credit union business lending have been addressed \nadequately in this legislation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment that is \nsponsored by the Senator from Nebraska. I support this amendment which \nwould place limitations on the amount of commercial lending by credit \nunions. I am concerned that if the credit unions concentrate on \ncommercial loans, they will lose their current individual customer \nfocus. They may lose the special identity that separates them from \nbanks and thrifts. I fear that if the special identity of the credit \nunion is lost, Congress may feel the need to treat them identically to \nbanks and thrifts. That could lead to levying taxes on credit unions.\n  Currently, credit unions are tax exempt because they are considered \ncooperatives. In order for a credit union to effectively serve its \nmembers, particularly in light of H.R. 1151, which has the potential to \ngreatly increase the membership of the credit unions, it should \nconcentrate on consumer lending. This will encourage it to maintain \nfocus on its member owners. Money loaned to businesses isn't available \nfor consumer lending, meaning that there will be fewer mortgages, car \nloans and other forms of consumer credit for the members.\n  I am particularly pleased that this amendment also includes the \ndeletion of the exemption of a loan less than $50,000 from being \ndefined as a member business loan. As an accountant, I am concerned \nabout the consequences of not requiring full and complete disclosure of \nlending by credit unions. I place great emphasis and value on the \naccuracy of financial institutions' records. I have asked several \ncredit unions how much commercial lending they engage in now, and none \nhave been able to state precisely the amount because of this strange \nexemption that currently exists in the regulations. This causes me \ngreat concern, because the most stringent safety and soundness \nprovisions are ineffective if accurate records and accurate \nrecordkeeping practices do not exist. I feel it is of utmost importance \nto require that all member business loans be designated as such, not \njust those above $50,000. Markets and financial institutions perform \nbest when there is transparency and accuracy of information. We have \nseen the consequences of that not being available.\n\n  The United States has become the model for financial markets, in part \nbecause of the transparent accounting methods that are required of \nfinancial institutions and publicly traded companies. I believe credit \nunions should also be obligated to be transparent in their loan \nactivities. It is only common sense to delete this exemption for \ncommercial loans less than $50,000. There is absolutely no reason for \ninaccurate accounting.\n  In conclusion, this amendment will require credit unions to remain \nfocused on consumer lending. Credit unions were intended to serve the \nbasic needs of families and individuals since the Federal Credit Union \nAct in the 1930s. This amendment will help credit unions remain unique \ninstitutions, setting them apart from other financial service \nproviders.\n  I believe a vote for this amendment is a vote for credit union \nmembers. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my views on credit union \ncommercial lending, as well as my support for the motion to table the \nHagel amendment.\n  Mr. President, I generally support the ability of credit unions to \nengage in commercial lending. Indeed, I am aware that for many members, \ncredit union loans are the only available sources of capital for \nbusiness investment. Also, when considering banking industry \nconsolidation and the potentially adverse implications to small \nbusiness lending, I believe that commercial lending by credit unions \nhas an important role.\n  However, Mr. President, commercial lending can significantly increase \nthe risk profile of credit unions. This is evidenced by recent National \nCredit Union Administration (NCUA) data which illustrates that the \ndelinquency rate on credit union business loans--3.1 percent--is more \nthan three times the delinquency rate on credit unions' overall loan \nportfolio--0.97 percent.\n  More importantly, in 1991, my home state of Rhode Island experienced \na credit union crisis that resulted from the failure of a state-\nchartered private deposit insurance corporation. This crisis affected \none in five citizens and was predicated in part on excessive and risky \ncommercial lending by privately-insured credit unions. Indeed, 13 of \nthe state's credit unions were permanently closed, and the state had to \nseek federal assistance to repay depositors.\n  In view of these facts, I was pleased that the Banking Committee \nadopted an amendment to limit commercial lending by credit unions to \n12.25 percent of outstanding loans. However, Mr. President, as \nreflected in my additional views to the Committee Report to H.R. 1151, \nI do not think this cap goes far enough. Specifically, I have argued \nthat the cap is inadequate because it is significantly higher than the \nlevel of commercial lending that credit unions are currently engaged \nin--0.75 percent of outstanding loans. I have also argued that because \nloans under $50,000 are counted toward the 12.25 percent cap, credit \nunions could engage in commercial lending to a much greater extent than \nthe limit imposed in the bill.\n  In response to concerns over commercial lending, Senators Hagel and \nBennett have introduced this amendment to limit commercial lending to \nseven percent of outstanding loans. In addition, the amendment would \ncount loans under $50,000 toward the cap and codify NCUA requirements \nthat loan officers have at least two years of commercial lending \nexperience. I would like to commend Senators Hagel and Bennett for \ntheir recognition of this issue and their attempt to address commercial \nlending concerns.\n  However, I believe the Hagel amendment goes too far. My specific \nconcern is that it both significantly reduces the commercial lending \ncap, while also eliminating the $50,000 exemption. Taken together, \nthese provisions could impose undue burdens on credit unions with \noutstanding commercial loans.\n  Because loans under $50,000 are not considered ``commercial\" under \ncurrent regulations, the NCUA does not keep data on these loans. As a \nresult, we simply do not know what percentage of outstanding loans \nwould be characterized as ``commercial'' under the Hagel amendment. \nThus it is possible, and likely, that the percentage of commercial \nloans could increase dramatically if this amendment were passed, which \ncould put many credit unions that would otherwise satisfy a seven \npercent cap in violation of the amendment, forcing them to withdraw \nfrom commercial lending.\n  As I indicated in our Committee's report, I believe the cap should \nbear a reasonable relationship to the amount of commercial lending that \ncredit unions are currently engaged in. To the extent that the Hagel \namendment creates uncertainty regarding existing commercial lending, we \nmust be careful not to establish an overly-restrictive cap. While I \nexpressed concerns\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\nabout the $50,000 exemption in my additional views, those concerns were \ntied to the higher lending cap of 12.25 percent.\n  Mr. President, a preferred approach to the Hagel amendment would be \nto reduce the aggregate lending cap, while retaining the $50,000 \nexemption. This approach would eliminate the uncertainty associated \nwith the Hagel amendment, while establishing a meaningful limit on the \nfuture expansion of commercial lending.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the pending \nlegislation, H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act. My \ncomments will be addressed to the overall bill as well as the \nindividual amendments that have been offered or will be offered.\n  On May 11, 1933, during the 73rd Congress, the Federal Credit Union \nAct was introduced. I have an interesting connection to this \nlegislation. The Federal Credit Union Act was introduced by Senator \nMorris Sheppard of Texas. Senator Sheppard was my grandfather. I happen \nto be standing at the desk that he used while he was in the Senate.\n  The impetus for Federal legislation was the fact that in 1933, \ncommercial banks had little interest in consumer lending. Simply \nstated, the small borrower was not a desired customer of commercial \nbanks 65 years ago. Additionally, America was a country comprised of \nvery large employers. It made sense for these large groups of \nindividuals with a common bond, to join together to form credit unions \nto meet their credit needs. So back in the 1930s, when credit unions \nwere formed, credit union members were typically groups of city \nworkers, postal employees, and employees of the telephone company.\n  Over the next 60 years, however, we saw the number of large companies \ndecline, and today, most people work for very small companies. In fact, \nin my state of Florida, 99% of all businesses have less than 1000 \nemployees. Additionally, 97% of all companies in Florida employ fewer \nthan 100 people.\n  Since 1933, when my grandfather introduced the Federal Credit Union \nAct, the world has fundamentally changed. The credit unions of today \nare different from those of times past.\n  I might also add, so are commercial banks. Today, commercial banks \naggressively try to entice individuals of all incomes to do business \nwith their financial institutions. They have aggressively reached out \nto consumers. To make my point, all one has to do is look at the mail \nyou receive and realize how many credit card applications you have \nreceived. There is an aggressive outreach on the part of commercial \nbanks to be engaged in lending to the average consumer today.\n  The credit unions of today are different from those of times past.\n  Now there are multibillion-dollar credit unions that in many cases \ndwarf the size of thousands of commercial banks and thrifts. Some of \nthese multi-billion dollar credit unions have hundreds of employee \ngroups and are located in multiple States. In many of these instances, \nthese large credit unions cannot be differentiated from commercial \nbanks--they offer home equity loans, have large credit card portfolios, \nloan money to small businesses, offer safe deposit boxes, and sell \nmutual funds. In fact, a credit union in Alaska even serves as a \nFederal Reserve depository.\n  Mr. President, Congress has always supported credit unions. I, too, \nstrongly believe there is a role for credit unions. By trying to \nimprove this bill, no one, including me, is attempting to eliminate the \ncredit union charter.\n  Small, community based credit unions are vital to our communities \nbecause they provide individuals access to credit. Credit unions have \nplayed a very important role in extending credit to people who need \nfinancial help.\n  However, in spite of my support of the credit union charter, I remain \ntroubled by several provisions in the Senate Banking Committee passed \nbill that is before us today. I must admit, the bill we are debating \ntoday is far better than the bill the Senate Banking Committee received \nfrom the House. With the addition of caps on commercial lending and by \nincluding the Department of Treasury's prompt corrective action \nlanguage, we will be able to ensure the safety and soundness of the \nhealthy Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. I am pleased with this \nprogress, but much more progress must be made if I am to support this \nbill in the end.\n  My overriding apprehension about the pending legislation deals with \nthe issue of fairness. Most credit unions pay their members higher \ninterest rates on checking and savings accounts and offer lower \ninterest rates on mortgages, student loans, and credit cards than most \ncommercial banks. Credit unions on average, charge lower fees and \nrequire lower minimum deposits. There is one simple reason for this \ncapacity of credit unions to pay higher rates and charge lower fees: \nthey are exempt from federal income taxes. This is an unfair \ncompetitive advantage.\n  During the Senate Banking Committee's discussion on this bill, the \ncommittee adopted a provision that directs the Department of Treasury \nto conduct a study of the differences between credit unions and other \nfederally insured depository institutions with respect to the \nenforcement of all financial laws and regulations. Treasury will also \ncompare the impact of all Federal laws, including Federal tax laws, as \nthey are applied to credit unions and other federally insured \ndepository institutions. This study will identify the regulatory and \ntax advantages credit unions have over banks, and suggest ways Congress \ncan address these differences. This study will be a start, but by no \nmeans will it level the playing field. Upon completion of the study, I \nhope the Senate will hold hearings on how to reduce the inequities \nwhich exist among federally insured depository institutions.\n  As I stated earlier, the Senate bill is far better than the House \npassed bill, but I still have some real concerns regarding provisions \nin the legislation. Specifically, my primary problem is the inclusion \nof language similar to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Imposing \nthe same onerous burdens on credit unions would help to level the \nplaying field; however, I do not support the Community Reinvestment Act \nas it has evolved, and I oppose subjecting credit unions to these \nrequirements. In fact, I would prefer to see the entire Community \nReinvestment Act repealed.\n  Because of CRA, banks are now often forced to make unsound and risky \nloans in economically disadvantaged areas. If they do not make these \nhigh risk investments, they are accused of discrimination. I strongly \nbelieve that most of these allegations are false.\n  In contrast to banks, credit unions, by their nature, already lend to \ntheir members. It is ludicrous to impose CRA on credit unions.\n  Think about it for a moment. Credit unions were established for \nindividuals with a common bond. It makes no sense whatsoever that the \ninstitution in which you are a member would turn around and \ndiscriminate against you. It just doesn't make sense.\n  In a letter to the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), I \nasked several questions as to whether or not there have been any \nmeritorious discrimination complaints against credit unions. In his \nresponse, the chairman stated there was no evidence of credit unions \nbeing guilty of discriminating against their members. Given the credit \nunion chief regulator's response, I think it makes no sense to impose \nthe burdens of CRA on credit unions.\n  Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment of \nSenator Phil Gramm to delete these onerous provisions from the bill. \nWhat looks harmless today will quickly evolve to burdensome, costly, \nand unnecessary regulations in the future.\n  The same concern with CRA is also addressed by Senator Shelby's \namendment to exempt banks with less than $250 million in assets from \nthe Community Reinvestment Act. I strongly support the amendment of \nSenator Shelby now, just as I did in the Banking Committee's markup.\n  Be assured that exempting small banks from CRA is not about opening \nthe door to allow them to discriminate. Not only is discrimination \nwrong, it is illegal. Fair lending laws like the Fair Housing Act, the \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act are \nstill the law of the land. I believe these laws protect the American \npeople, and as I mentioned, laws such as CRA are an unnecessary burden \non business.\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\n  My final concern with this legislation deals with the large increase \nin the number of commercial loans that credit unions are making. I \nsupport the Hagel-Bennett amendment because it accomplishes two things. \nFirst, it limits the amount credit unions can lend to their members for \nsmall commercial ventures, such as agriculture or small business start \nups.\n  Again, the reason we are tightening commercial lending is not because \nwe are trying to vent some distrust with respect to how credit unions \nmake their loans.\n  But from my experience, having been in the business of commercial \nlending for almost 16 years, these are two very complicated and risky \nareas of lending.\n  As I say, I support the Hagel-Bennett amendment, because it \naccomplishes two things: Well-managed, well-capitalized credit unions \ncan lend up to 7 percent of their capital; exempts from the 7 percent \ncap credit unions which were chartered for the purpose of commercial \nlending.\n  Second, the Hagel-Bennett amendment addresses the manner in which \ncredit unions make commercial loans. Many credit union loan officers \nare not trained to evaluate commercial loans. The Hagel-Bennett \namendment requires credit union employees who make or administer \ncommercial loans to have at least 2 years of experience in the area of \ncommercial lending. This provision is already part of the NCUA's \nregulations on member business loans, and the Hagel-Bennett amendment \nmerely codifies this regulation.\n  Be aware that much of what I am saying is the result of my experience \nas a member of the Senate Banking Committee when the Resolution Trust \nCorporation was established to bail out the savings and loan industry. \nI believe that if we do not take precautions now, such as those \noutlined in the Hagel-Bennett amendment, we could be looking at \nsignificant losses and exposure to the taxpayers in the future.\n  In closing, I stress my support of the vital role credit unions play \nin today's financial services marketplace. Do not mistake my desire to \nimprove this legislation with an agenda to end credit unions. I \nstrongly feel that credit unions should exist. There are 268 credit \nunions in my State of Florida, with just under 3\\1/2\\ million members. \nMy goal today is to ensure that every credit union is a viable, safe \nand sound institution, one unburdened by unnecessary regulatory \nrequirements.\n  Mr. President, I cannot support H.R. 1151 in its present form. I hope \nthat my colleagues will support both the Gramm and Hagel-Bennett \namendments which ensure the safety and soundness of credit unions. I \nalso urge my colleagues to support the Shelby amendment which will \nlevel the playing field between commercial banks and credit unions.\n  Thank you. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader and the \nminority leader, I ask unanimous consent that following the 5:30 p.m. \nvote, there be 2 minutes for debate to be equally divided on the Hagel \namendment and that a vote then occur on the motion to table the \namendment with no second-degree amendment in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I do not know how many Members would like to speak to \nthis, but I would think, given the time situation that we have, that \nthose Members on either side who would like to either speak on the bill \nor state their support or opposition to the amendment that is now \npending, that they should attempt to do so. Because at 3:30, I believe, \nSenator Shelby will be coming down to the floor in order to offer his \namendment, and we will then lay aside this amendment for the purposes \nof discussing the amendment put forth by my colleague from Alabama. \nThen thereafter, from 4:30 to 5:30, Senator Gramm of Texas is scheduled \non the floor where we will then entertain the Gramm amendment, which \nwill be the pending business and which will be the vote that we take up \nat 5:30. I believe at that point my colleague, the ranking member of \nthe committee from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, will make a motion to \ntable. And with that the votes will begin.\n  So my suggestion, to those colleagues who would like to be heard on \nthis amendment or on the overall bill, is that they use this time to \ncome to the floor within a half hour because I think the schedule will \nthen begin to get somewhat crowded.\n  If no one is seeking recognition, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3338\n\n(Purpose: To amend the bill with respect to exempting certain financial \n       institutions from the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977)\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Gramm, Mack, Faircloth, Grams, Allard, \nEnzi, Hagel, Helms, Nickles, Murkowski, Brownback, Sessions, Inhofe, \nCoats, and Thomas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 207. COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT EXEMPTION.\n\n       The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901 et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 808. EXAMINATION EXEMPTION.\n\n  ``(a) In General.--A regulated financial institution shall not be \nsubject to the examination requirements of this title or any \nregulations issued hereunder if the institution has aggregate assets of \nnot more than $250,000,000.\n  ``(b) Adjustments.--The dollar amount referred to in subsection (a) \nshall be adjusted annually after December 31, 1998, by the annual \npercentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners \nand Clerical Workers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.''.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, this amendment that I have offered this \nafternoon would authorize a small bank exemption in the Government-\nmandated credit requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act, known \nas CRA. Community banks by their very nature serve the needs of their \ncommunities. They do not need, I believe, a burdensome Government \nmandate to force them to allocate credit or to originate profitable \nloans.\n  Friday, I spoke in this Chamber about the regulatory burden of the \nCRA on small community banks in the United States. I cited then \nstatistics that show small banks are less efficient than large \ninstitutions and suffer from excessive regulations.\n  My colleagues should know that the amendment I have just offered \nwould exempt only 11.2 percent of bank assets nationwide. This is \nnearly the same amount of assets as one of the largest financial \ninstitutions in America, BankAmerica. Can you imagine that? All the \nsmall banks of America, with $250 million in deposits or assets or \nless, have 11.2 percent of the assets, and one bank, and probably \nseveral others, has a lot more than all of these banks put together.\n  I thought it might be helpful to hear from a small bank with less \nthan $80 million in assets. They have written to me to complain about \nthe regulatory burden of the CRA. This institution is probably typical \nof small community\n\n[[Page S9019]]\n\nbanks nationwide. And the institution officer asked to remain anonymous \nfor obvious reasons, for they are worried about repercussions from \noverzealous Federal regulators or bureaucrats. I would feel the same \nway. But the CEO of the small bank in my State wrote as follows:\n\n       As a local community bank, we willingly and proudly provide \n     banking services to all segments of the population. However, \n     the Community Reinvestment Act is overly burdensome, costly \n     and makes it difficult for us to compete and to offer our \n     customers the service they deserve. Presently, [I have] an \n     employee in the bank who spends 35 percent of his time just \n     making sure we are in compliance with the Community \n     Reinvestment Act. These duties include: (1) Quarterly reports \n     to the board of directors detailing the community activities \n     of our officers and directors; (2) Plotting each loan on a \n     map of the county; (3) Reviewing all loans on a weekly basis \n     for the purpose of breaking down income levels by number and \n     total dollar volume; (4) Reviewing all loan denials and \n     approvals weekly for the purpose of ensuring compliance with \n     CRA; (5) Providing an on-going self-assessment of the bank's \n     CRA plan and performance.\n\n  I have dozens of letters similar to these, but the one from which I \njust read articulates the burden as well as any of them.\n  Opponents of our amendment suggest here that the CRA regulations have \nbeen reduced and are not burdensome. The CRA regulations may have been \nreduced, but the burden is still there. Bankers have to study hundreds \nof pages' worth of guidance manuals and attend seminars to assure CRA \ncompliance. In fact, some banks have staff whose only job is to ensure \nCRA compliance. Of course, compliance costs with small bankers are not \nthe only costs of the CRA. The very mandate of credit allocation \nincreases the cost of banks in and of itself, and I would like to take \na moment to explain here this afternoon why the Community Reinvestment \nAct is nothing more than a Government-mandated credit allocation, much \nlike the mandated credit allocation in East Asia that has caused the \ncurrency crisis, among other things. The chart would show this.\n  What are the small bank performance standards? I will go through \nthese. According to the Code of Federal Regulations, CFR, section \n25.26, the ``Performance criteria'' for small banks depend on (i) \nbank's loan-to-deposit ratio; (ii) percentage of loans located in the \nbank's assessment area; (iii) bank's record of lending for borrowers of \ndifferent income levels and businesses and farms of different sizes; \n(iv) geographic distribution of the bank's loans; (v) bank's record of \ntaking action in response to written complaints about its performance \nin helping to meet credit needs in its assessment areas.\n  Mandate (i) judges all small banks around the country on their loan-\nto-deposit ratio. However, the loan-to-deposit ratio for one bank may \nnot be appropriate for another bank. One banker told me his record of \n``community lending'' was questioned by a Federal bank regulator based \non a low loan-to-deposit ratio. The banker responded, ``My bank is in \nthe middle of a retirement community. There are not too many senior \ncitizens applying for community development loans.'' How does the \nFederal Government know what the appropriate loan-to-deposit level is \nfor Winfield, AL, or Lafayette, LA, or some other town in America?\n  Mandate (ii) judges all small banks around the country based on the \nloans made in a specific assessment area. Why should the Federal \nGovernment dictate to any business who his customers should or should \nnot be? What if there is no loan demand in that area?\n  Mandate (iii) judges all small banks on their lending based on the \n``different income levels.'' The performance criteria in Section 25.26 \nnever mentions credit worthiness or the consideration of risk. When the \nfree market allocates capital and credit, risk is always the \ndistinguishing factor--and it should be.\n  Mandate (iv) forces all small banks to lend not only in a specific \nassessment area, but under a geographic distribution established by the \nFederal Government. One banker told me the regulator was challenging \nhis geographic distribution of lending and asked the banker why he had \nnot made loans in a certain area. The banker responded, ``I can't make \nany community loans there. Nobody wants to build in the middle of a \nlake.'' There was a large lake there, but the bureaucracy didn't know \nit or recognize it. The point is simple: Federal regulators do not know \nthe small communities across America like the people that live there, \nand work there every day.\n  Mandate (v) judges a bank's record of responding to its customers. \nBusinesses across America do this voluntarily without the Federal \nGovernment judging its performance. It is called customer service. The \nresponsiveness of a business to its customer's needs is usually \nmeasured by the success of the business. In the free market, no \nbusiness will stay in operation if it does not satisfy the needs of its \ncustomers.\n  The costs of Government-mandated credit allocation results in \nincreased cost to consumers. First, CRA raises the costs of inputs to \nbanks by forcing them to comply with the regulatory burden of CRA--we \nare entering the 21st century and bankers are still forced to stick \npins in maps on the walls of the bank in order to indicate where loans \nare made. Second, making loans according to a Federal formula increases \nthe risks, and therefore the costs, of borrowing to consumers.\n  The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond published its 1994 Annual Report \non ``Neighborhoods and Banking'' where it reported its findings on the \ncosts of CRA. The report found:\n\n       [T]he regulatory burden (of CRA) would fall on bank-\n     dependent borrowers in the form of higher loan rates and on \n     bank-dependent savers in the form of lower deposit rates. And \n     to the extent that lending induced by the CRA regulations \n     increases the risk exposure of the deposit insurance funds, \n     taxpayers who ultimately back those funds bear some of the \n     burden as well.\n\n  The Fed report goes on to say: ``* * * CRA imposes a tax on banks * * \n*''\n  The costs and risks associated with CRA are ultimately shouldered by \nthe consumer. We know that. There is no justification for Congress to \narticially increase the costs of borrowing to the consumer. By \nmaintaining the status quo of CRA, Congress actually hampers investment \nand growth by increasing loan rates and lowering deposit rates. \nCongress should adopt policies that help reduce the cost of borrowing, \nthat help reduce the regulatory burden. Congress should adopt a small \nbank exemption to the Community Reinvestment Act. That would, again, \nonly exempt 11.2 percent of the assets in banks in America, but it \nwould be a God save for the community banks all over America.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Alabama, Senator Shelby.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I want to speak generally about credit \nunions and also on the amendment, if I may.\n  I wanted to talk about credit union legislation because it is one of \nthe most important things we will be doing, certainly, this year. I \nhave spent many hours meeting with Wyoming citizens on both sides of \nthe credit union legislation. In fact, in the last year and a half, I \nhave had 32 meetings relative to this bill. So there is a great deal of \ninterest in it. It is the kind of involvement that we ought to have in \npublic issues. It is democracy, certainly, at work.\n  I also have some kind of perspective to it, in that I helped organize \na credit union, back when I was with the Wyoming Farm Bureau a number \nof years ago, a very small one designed to work with the employees \nthere at the Farm Bureau.\n  I think, having worked with not only the Farm Bureau but the Rural \nElectric Association, I am aware of the value of cooperatives, the \nvalue of people being able to come together and do some things for \nthemselves, the ability to tailor the services that are needed in a \nparticular place to that particular need. Certainly, Wyoming is one of \nthe smallest--indeed, it is the smallest State in the Union with regard \nto population. We do have different needs than occur in New York or \noccur in Pennsylvania. So as we talk about services and distribution of \nservices, it makes a good deal of difference.\n  I also think credit unions have fitted themselves to these needs, as \nhave community banks. They have fitted themselves, too. I believe there \nis an increasingly clear definition between\n\n[[Page S9020]]\n\nsome of the international banks and some of the community banks. It \nused to be everything was a bank was a bank was a bank. Now I think \nthat has changed, and properly so. We need both kinds of banks.\n  Wyoming has 39 credit unions and about 145,000 members in Wyoming. \nThat represents about a quarter of our State population. So it is a \nunique and needed service. The median asset level in Wyoming credit \nunions is only $6.9 million. The smallest credit union has assets of \nabout a half million dollars; the largest, $86 million. So we do have a \nunique situation. Things happen on a smaller scale there, and we need \nto continue to have that opportunity to serve. The things that are \ndebated here, in credit unions, the changes that have taken place, the \nreason for the lawsuit, has very little to do with the kinds of \noperations we have in our State.\n  I support the final passage of this bill. Perhaps the most important \nprovision is to grandfather the millions of credit union members who \nwere added to the multiple-group credit unions before the February 28 \nSupreme Court decision. As we know, these types of memberships were \ninvalidated. No one wants to see the present credit union members lose \ntheir accounts, and this will ensure that they do not.\n  Another important provision is to enhance the supervisory oversight \nof federally chartered credit unions to make sure they are sounder, \nsafer, and more efficient.\n  I think we would not be debating this legislation today if the \nregulatory authority, the National Credit Union Administration, had \nused its regulatory power to do more of those things to carry out the \noriginal intent of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934. Arguably, the \nNCUA has been more of an advocate than a regulator. I think that has to \nchange.\n  As with every other federally chartered organization or institution, \nFederal credit unions must serve within that niche that is prescribed \nfor them by law. I have told my friends in the credit unions that there \nare certain advantages to the way they are structured, certain \nadvantages go to them as being cooperatives and being member-owned. \nThat is good, and I endorse that.\n  On the other hand, there have to be, then, some limitations to the \nkinds of things that they can do. I think commercial lending should not \ngo unlimited. I support the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska \nwhich would allow for commercial lending, which they are seeking. I \nalso support the Shelby amendment which exempts small community banks \nfrom the requirement of the Community Reinvestment Act. I hear all the \ntime of the amount of the administrative and regulatory time spent in a \nvery small bank; more time reporting than there is in lending.\n  So I hope that not only the banks, but the credit unions can get out \nfrom under that basic paperwork requirement. The expenses of meeting \nthese costs, as the Senator from Alabama just indicated, are, of \ncourse, passed on to the owners and depositors.\n  I am supportive of the efforts to relieve those unnecessary mandates. \nThat is what we ought to be doing whenever we can. I believe this is an \nappropriate place to do that.\n  Clearly, banks and credit unions have a proper, legitimate, rightful, \nand important place in our financial system. We simply need to define \nwhat those roles are.\n  Our challenge is to successfully address the Supreme Court's ruling \nin a way that will allow consumers access to credit and financial \ninstitutions, have fairness among them, and strengthen the regulatory \nand safety aspects of them. I believe this bill will do that.\n  I support the unique status of credit unions, and I believe the bill \nbefore us, with amendments, maps out an appropriate role for the \nfuture.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I would like to address the Shelby \namendment, which is before this body, and also make reference to the \namendment offered by my good friend and colleague from Nebraska, \nSenator Hagel.\n  I rise in opposition to the Shelby amendment. The Shelby amendment \nwould exempt, as we all know now, banks of less than $250 million in \nassets from the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act.\n  As I stated before when we were debating this issue on Friday, I \ndisagree with the substance of this amendment, but before I turn to the \nsubstance, let me suggest what I know the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee and the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, have said over and \nover again with regard to this amendment, and that is, to those who \nmight be inclined to support this amendment, the adoption of this \namendment will result in the collapse of the credit union bill. That is \na fact. A vote for it will certainly achieve that result.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Shelby goes outside the issues at \nplay in the credit union bill and seeks, in a very controversial \nmanner, to reduce the responsibilities of banks to their communities.\n  As a number of my colleagues have noted previously, the \nadministration has already stated very emphatically that it will veto \nany legislation that has this CRA exemption contained within it. Let \nthere be no mistake, a vote in favor of the Shelby amendment is a vote \nagainst the credit union legislation.\n  Let me briefly address a few of the issues that surround this \namendment.\n  The supporters of this amendment make two seemingly powerful \narguments in its favor. The first argument they make is that the CRA \ncreates a regulatory burden so onerous that the imposition of it on \ncommunity banks places them at a disadvantage versus the credit unions \nagainst whom the banks must compete.\n  The second argument offered by those who support this amendment is \nthat this amendment, the Community Reinvestment Act itself, forces \nbanks to make unprofitable loans and thus constitutes Government \ninterference of the worst kind.\n  Neither of these amendments bears up against careful scrutiny.\n  First, with respect to regulatory burden, the bank regulators, under \nthe leadership of the Comptroller of the Currency, significantly \nreduced the regulatory burden on banks when the new CRA enforcement \nrules went into effect on January 1, 1996.\n  At that time, the new rules received extensive breaks from bankers, \nlarge and small, as being workable. Richard Mount stated, on behalf of \nthe Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents only \nsmall community banks:\n\n       The new rules should alleviate the paperwork nightmare of \n     CRA for community banks and allow them to concentrate on what \n     they do best--reinvest in their communities.\n\n  Given the changes made in 1996, there is little reason to believe \nthat a CRA exemption for small banks would result in reduced costs \nsufficient enough to make a difference in their competition with credit \nunions.\n  What is perhaps more important, Madam President, is the question of \nwhether CRA actually is a means for the Government to engage in credit \nallocation and whether CRA forces banks to make unprofitable loans. \nAgain, I do not think the facts bear out these statements.\n  Some have suggested that the Community Reinvestment Act was enacted \nin 1977 solely because banks enjoyed a protected advantage in \ncommunities, that CRA was the tradeoff for continuing those protective \nstatutes. These people argued that with the advent of increased \nfinancial competition, and particularly with the passage by Congress of \nthe Interstate Banking and Branching Act that ended the exclusive \nrights of banks to service particular communities, the basis for CRA no \nlonger exists.\n  While those were important factors in the passage of CRA, the \noverriding concern, Madam President, was that the banking industry, \nwhich enjoyed then and enjoys today the benefit of taxpayer-backed \ndeposit insurance, was using that benefit to make loans available only \nto affluent communities, and were allowing less affluent communities, \nfrom Appalachia to Bridgeport, CT, to wither on the vine.\n  The hearing record in 1977 clearly shows that by most surveys banks \nwere returning only pennies in loans for every dollar of deposit that \ncame from low- and moderate-income areas. The\n\n[[Page S9021]]\n\nsolution to that real and uncontested problem was that regulators take \nsteps to ensure that banks serve their entire communities, not just \nselect parts.\n  However, there is nothing in CRA that allows the regulators to have \nthe banks waive basic fundamental underwriting practices. The \nregulators cannot permit the banks to jeopardize safety and soundness \nin order to demonstrate compliance with the act.\n  In other words, Madam President, CRA loans have to make money. They \nmust make money. As bank regulators stated in their joint agency rule \non CRA:\n\n       The agencies firmly believe that institutions can and \n     should expect lending and investments encouraged by CRA to be \n     profitable. . . . As in other areas of bank and thrift \n     operations, unsafe and unsound practices are viewed \n     unfavorably.\n\n  Or as Mario Antoci, chairman of the American Savings said:\n\n       Lending in the inner city has turned out to be the most \n     profitable part of our business over the past few years.\n\n  Madam President, the Community Reinvestment Act has proven, I think, \nto be one of the most useful financial initiatives enacted by the \nFederal Government in a generation.\n  Community groups estimate that CRA has brought more than $1 trillion \ninto underserved communities across our Nation from our small rural \ntowns to our largest cities. It is done so in a manner that not only \nbenefits the community in which the investment is made, but also allows \nthe lending institution to expect the same profit that they would \nreceive on other loans.\n  This is a law, Madam President, that works. And it is a law where \nbenefits can be seen in every new home that gets built or new business \nthat gets started in a neighborhood or town that used to be neglected \nby the banking industry prior to 1977.\n  If there are specific problems with the implementation of CRA, if \nthere are certain activities that should be considered that are not \nconsidered, then the appropriate way to address those specific concerns \nis to work with the regulators to improve the way that the law is being \nadministered.\n  But to exempt 86 percent of America's banks from a requirement to \nserve their entire community, while still extending them the benefit of \ndeposit insurance which is backed by the dollars of everyone in that \ncommunity, is simply wrongheaded in the approach to helping the banking \nindustry.\n  At the end of the day, Madam President, the best thing that Congress \ncan do to help community banks is to provide the means for all American \ncommunities to grow, thus expanding the demand for bank loans and \nproducts. CRA helps all of us achieve that goal and, therefore, I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Lastly, Madam President, I will come back to the point I made at the \noutset. I urge my colleagues to think about this: Even if the idea of \nCRA should be reworked and redone, even if you think it deserves a \nlegislative approach, if it ends up being adopted on this credit union \nbill, it will bring down this piece of legislation. That would be a \ngreat disservice to the millions of people who are looking to this \nChamber to follow what was done in the other Chamber, and that is to \npass these reforms that are necessary for credit unions to succeed. For \nthose reasons, Madam President, I urge that this body reject the Shelby \namendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to share some of my concerns regarding H.R. 1151, the Credit \nUnion Membership Access Act.\n  First, let me state that I support the concept of H.R. 1151; that is, \nto prevent a current credit union member from being forced to \ndisaffiliate, and also to allow a credit union an opportunity to \nreasonably expand its membership to help ensure the safety and \nsoundness of the institution.\n  I will support passage of H.R. 1151. However, in light of the \nrealization of the tax-exempt status that Congress affords credit \nunions, I think it would be irresponsible for this body to not fully \ndebate a serious problem that exists with this legislation; and it is \nthe Community Reinvestment Act requirements.\n  Madam President, we can talk about interpretation. We can talk about \nadministering the act. But the realization is that the act calls for \nspecific action by community banks. And the consequences of that are \nnot only costly, but in some instances rather--well, they are rather \namusing. Let us put it that way.\n  I know of one bank in Los Angeles with numerous branches throughout \nthe city. And those banks are primarily located in areas of high \nconcentration of Chinese residents, both from the mainland previously, \nor their families, and Taiwan. So a good portion of the banks' \ncustomers clearly are Chinese.\n  The Community Reinvestment Act mandates that these particular \nbranches advertise in Hispanic areas of Los Angeles, advertise in areas \nwhere there are large concentrations of black residents, and move \nbeyond, if you will, the traditional area that they serve with their \nbranch system.\n  This particular institution has been cited as being in violation of \nthe Community Reinvestment Act because it did not have a certain \npercentage of Hispanic depositors and borrowers. So they were forced to \ngo out and advertise in those particular areas, which they did. They \nstill did not generate any business.\n  If you go into this Chinese bank, so to speak, the tellers can speak \nEnglish and Chinese. They are meeting, if you will, a minority service, \nbut they are in violation, technically, of the Community Reinvestment \nAct.\n  I could go on and on with numerous examples, but here, clearly, is an \nexample where the Community Reinvestment Act is out of sync with \nreality.\n  Community banks, for the most part, are small. Many of them are \nlocally owned. Over half of the banks have only one or two branches. \nAnd they have excellent records of serving their communities because \nthey are different than the money center banks. They are there to serve \nthe community. They have to be there, and they have to do that or they \nwould not survive. They have to serve the community.\n  It is interesting to note that of the 8,970 small community banks, \nthere are only 9--only 9--that have a substantial noncompliance CRA \nrating. Let me repeat that. Of the 8,970 small community banks in \nAmerica, only 9 have received a substantial noncompliance rating. In \nother words, almost 9,000 small banks must spend hundreds of millions \nof dollars to comply with a Federal mandate simply because a bare 9 \ncommunity banks had records that the regulators in Washington, DC, \ndeemed bad. Well, that makes no sense, Madam President. It is just \ntotally unrealistic.\n  Because community banks by their very nature serve the needs of their \ncommunity, community banks do not need a burdensome Government mandate \nto order them to do what they have already been doing a good job of for \ndecades.\n  The difference is the large banks don't have a difficulty in meeting \nthe CRA requirements. The large banks have personnel. They have \nresources and they can easily absorb the costs of these additional CRA \nmandates. The small banks don't have these resources. It is very \ndifficult for them to absorb the high cost of the Community \nReinvestment Act, and even the credit unions express concern over \nadditional costs, additional Federal mandates.\n  How costly are the CRA requirements? Let's just take a look at this \nchart, because I think it shows adequately that this is a very \nmeaningful cost. If we look at the chart, we see the financial burden \nof the CRAs to small community banks is costly, costly in both dollars \nas well as man-hours. If we look at compliance with the Community \nReinvestment Act, what it costs the community banks--14.4 million \nemployee hours; 6,900 full-time employees; $1,256 per $1 million in \nassets--the total cost of the CRA to community banks is over $1 billion \na year.\n  One of the curious things about the manner in which this debate is \ngoing on, it is my understanding that Senator Gramm has put in an \namendment to exempt the credit unions from the CRA requirements. The \nCRA requirements are in the Banking Committee bill to exempt the credit \nunions from CRA requirements.\n  Senator Shelby's amendment is simply to exempt small banks from the\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\nsame CRA requirements. Now, is that not an equitable situation? I am \nsurprised that the President has come down and suggested that if this \npasses, the Shelby amendment, it is grounds for vetoing the bill. What \nis the logic in that? What is the equity? What is the fairness? What we \nare trying to do here is to serve America's consumers. The way to do \nthat is lower costs.\n  If it costs the small community banks $1 billion a year, that cost \nhas to be passed on. What many in this body don't recognize is the \ndifficulty that the small community bank has in meeting these \nrequirements as compared to its competitor, whether a Bank of America \nor Citicorp or any of the major institutions. This is just another cost \nof doing business that they can assimilate. But the small country \nbanker on the corner has a real problem with this in spite of what some \nof the debate has suggested here today.\n  The regulatory costs of the CRA impairs the ability of small banks to \nserve the needs to their local community. As this chart shows, it costs \nreal money--$1 billion--to comply with the CRA. Banks must comply with \nthe Truth in Lending Act. That requirement, which everyone supports, \ntakes less than half the man-hours of the CRA and costs nearly half of \nwhat CRA costs. The banks must also meet the important Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act which prevents discrimination in lending, a worthy \ngoal. Yet the cost of complying with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act \nis barely one-fifth of the onerous costs of the CRA.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Shelby amendment which exempts small banks, \nexempts small banks with $250 million in assets from CRA. Personally, I \ndon't feel that goes far enough. I believe a $500 million threshold is \na more appropriate figure.\n  Why is an exemption for small banks with $500 million in assets more \nappropriate? Well, there is a good reason. That is the threshold we \nestablished 12 years ago to distinguish small banks from large banks in \nthe 1986 reform of the Tax Code. We recognized back then that the small \nbanks, banks with less than $500 million, should be allowed a deduction \nfor reserve for bad debts but denied a similar reserve deduction for \nlarge banks. It only makes sense to use a definition already so well \nestablished. Obviously, by the attitude prevailing here with regard to \nthe equity, I am not going to pursue that, but I think that is an \nappropriate threshold as you look at where you cut off a small bank \nfrom a large bank.\n  I believe the Shelby amendment is a modest amendment that all of our \ncolleagues should support. It is equitable. To have the threat of the \nWhite House come down, that they will veto this if it prevails, is \nabsolutely unrealistic, and it is certainly unfair.\n  I think it is time we sent a message to the White House with regard \nto the merits of the debate on issues of equity and fairness. To \nsuggest that the White House simply comes down with a threat--this \nSenator from Alaska is not buying. If there are any financial \ninstitutions in America that do not need to have a Federal community \nreinvestment mandate imposed upon them, it is America's small community \nbankers. They are not making loans in Indonesia. They are not making \nloans in South Korea. Their loans are in their communities. That is how \nthey survive. Why exempt the credit unions and penalize small banks, \nsmall banks who pay taxes?\n  Make it fair. Make it equitable. Exempt both. That is the correct \naction that should be taken by this body. I hope there are enough \nMembers who will stand up for what is right and equitable.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment sponsored \nby the senior Senator from Alabama.\n  The amendment, which authorizes an exemption for banks with less than \n$250 million in assets, would allow small banks to escape the \nburdensome, federal government mandate of the Community Reinvestment \nAct of 1977, commonly known as CRA. In 1977, Congress felt that the \nregulated and insured financial institutions should be required to \ndemonstrate that their deposit facilities help meet the credit needs of \nthe local communities in which they are chartered.\n  However, I have seen the CRA become a burdensome federal government \nmandate on private financial institutions resulting in nothing more \nthan excessive paperwork requirements. Small community banks naturally \nserve the needs of their communities, otherwise they would not survive. \nIn Wyoming, where many towns have only one or two banks and maybe a \ncredit union, the financial institutions must reach out to everyone in \nthe community in order to be successful.\n  We must also realize that several things have changed since the \npassage of the community Reinvestment Act became law in 1977. Until \n1994, when Congress passed the Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking and \nBranching Efficiency Act, banks were not allowed to acquire another \nbank in another state. The Reigle-Neal Act forced small community banks \nto be more aggressive to meet the needs of their community in order to \ncompete with outside banks, thus supplanting the need for the CRA.\n  Second, we now have less government intervention on the rate of \ninterest payable on savings deposits and demand deposits. Before the \nDepository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, \nthere was a ceiling on the interest rates on savings deposits and a \nprohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits to consumers. \nWe do not have these restrictions now. These laws, passed after the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act of 1977, have promoted a healthy competition \nfor deposits and credit, thus causing financial institutions to \nincreasingly reach out to the communities they serve.\n  I believe it is prudent and right to exempt small banks from CRA \nrequirements. They are the very institutions that comply every day with \nthe Community Reinvestment Act just by the very nature of their \nbusiness. And they are the institutions that are most burdened by the \nrequired paperwork because of their limited resources.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I have spoken to this issue before, so \nI am going to try to make my remarks very succinct. That is difficult \nfor me, I realize that, but there are others waiting. The Senator from \nKansas has been on the floor for 2 hours and the Senator from \nMassachusetts is waiting to speak also.\n  I share the concerns that my colleagues have raised regarding the \nfairness of what would appear to be overreaching in certain cases \ninvolving our community banks. I believe we need to have a full and \nthorough hearing to look at this question and examine it. Not just one \nhearing, but a comprehensive study and a series of hearings to see if \nwe cannot advance the goals. Because I don't think there is anyone, \nanyone, who is opposed to the goals of ensuring that there is capital \navailable in our rural areas and our small communities. Capital that \nmight not otherwise be there were it not for CRA.\n  The question is, Is that capital being made available? How effective \nis CRA? Or has there been an unexpected consequence from the impact of \nthe legislation and the compliance requirements? And has that \nconsequence been so overwhelming as to keep the small banker from doing \nhis job? Those are legitimate questions. We should review this \nimportant issue in its entirety and we should examine it.\n  But we should not offer an amendment now that would in any way make \nit impossible for this bill to go forward. That is exactly what would \ntake place. There is no way, no way, that we could get sufficient votes \nnor would the administration enact legislation if the CRA provision was \nstripped out. I say ``stripped out'' because that is, indeed, what the \namendment would do. The Shelby amendment would literally strip it out.\n  There is no way for evaluating if a bank had proven itself year after \nyear and earned a relaxation in its examination schedule so it would be \nreviewed less frequently or even periodically. That is the kind of \nthoughtful consideration that we need to do.\n  This doesn't say, well, let's look at giving better tax treatment to \nthe smaller community banks so that they can do their job. And, for \nexample, Senator Allard has worked long and hard on developing a \nproposal that would do that. That is the kind of thing we have to do. \nBut to come in here now and suggest that we simply strip out CRA for \nall community banks would be wrong.\n  And you can say that you favor credit unions, but if you vote for \nthis\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\namendment, what you are doing is taking a chance that credit unions \nwill have irreparable damage done to them. So I am going to urge my \ncolleagues to support the motion to table Senator Shelby's legislative \neffort. As well intended as it may be, it should not be here.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1151, \nthe Credit Union Membership Access Act. I have always supported federal \ncredit unions because of their vital role in providing access to \ncredit, particularly for consumers of moderate means. This bill would \nallow credit unions to continue to offer this outstanding level of \nservice.\n  The Supreme Court's recent decision in the AT case cast a shadow of \nuncertainty over credit union membership. The decision threatens to \ndisrupt the financial affairs of millions of hard-working families by \nforcing credit unions to limit future memberships and placing current \nmemberships in jeopardy. This legislation responds to the Court's \ndecision by clarifying the credit union field of membership. It \nprotects existing credit union members and membership groups, while \nallowing approporiate expansion. In addition, it further protects \nconsumers by ensuring the safety and soundness of credit unions through \nimproved regulatory safeguards.\n  H.R. 1151, as reported by the Senate Banking Committee, is critical \nto consumers across the nation. Credit unions serve many families who \nhave trouble obtaining credit elsewhere. In particular, credit unions \nare absolutely essential in the area of small consumer loans. For those \nin need of a loan to purchase a new car, put down a rent deposit, or \nbuy a new washer and dryer, the local credit union is a valuable \nresource. In today's world of mega-mergers, credit unions continue to \nbe there to provide affordable and personal financial services.\n  Both the House of Representatives and the Senate Banking Committee \napproved H.R. 1151 by overwhelming margins. These votes are evidence of \nthe strong support behind this legislation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 1151 in a similar fashion.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3336\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 4:30 \np.m. having arrived, the question recurs on amendment No. 3336 offered \nby the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm. There will now be 1 hour of \ndebate, divided in the usual form, prior to the motion to table the \namendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that 10 minutes \nof additional time be granted, and if the Senator from Texas would \nyield, we could take it out of our time. The Republicans would get 10 \nminutes equally divided. I see the Senator from Kansas who has been \nhere 2 hours. Senator Thurmond has come to the floor and 2 other \nMembers are here. If we can divide 10 minutes, 5 minutes on each side, \nI make that request.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, would it \nbe possible, I ask my colleague from New York, to work out an agreement \nwhere we might have a little more time on each side? Or I assume we are \nable to speak to either amendment during the time of the other \namendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, as I understand it, we are now in a \ntime-constrained period of 1 hour on the Gramm amendment, equally \ndivided; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Thirty minutes to Senator Gramm and Senator D'Amato, \nwho supports Senator Gramm, and 30 minutes on this side; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from New York has \na unanimous consent request that would seek to delay that period.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I withdraw my request, Madam President. Let's start it \nfrom there.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of the Senator \nfrom Texas and the Senator from Maryland, under the previous order.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:45 on \nTuesday, the Senate resume consideration of the Shelby amendment, and \nthere be 15 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a motion to \ntable. I further ask consent that no amendments be in order prior to \nthe vote. This has been cleared by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, thank you. I thank the Senator from \nMaryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3338\n\n  Madam President, I want to speak just for a moment, if I may, with \nrespect to the Shelby amendment. This amendment concerns me greatly and \nI think should concern all Senators who have invested the amount of \ntime and energy in the past years to guarantee that we will provide \nadequate access to credit to those parts of America that have \nhistorically been very difficult to reach, difficult to provide jobs, \nand difficult for people to gain access to credit.\n  There is a fundamental reason that in 1977 Congress, in its wisdom, \ndecided to pass the Community Reinvestment Act. All the Community \nReinvestment Act asks is that banking institutions, demonstrate that \nthey are making adequate efforts to try to provide credit to all of the \npeople within their communities--that they are reinvesting in their \ncommunities. There is a reason that happened. It is very simple. They \nweren't doing it. Large financial institutions were growing, and were \naccepting deposits from people within a community, but the banks were \nnot giving back to the people within that community. They were finding \nother places to invest for more lucrative, faster returns, safer \nreturns, and the community suffered as a consequence of that. So you \ncould have communities where you had rows of houses but they weren't \nhomes. There is a distinction between a house and a home.\n  What we have learned is that, over the years, the almost $400 billion \nworth of investments that have been made back into communities have \nmade homes out of what were just houses, have provided people the \ncapacity to be able to improve their own lives, to create their own \njobs, within the community. And that helps the community. In point of \nfact, it reduces taxes. It reduces the social burden on the rest of the \npeople within those communities who have to pick up the slack if the \nlarger financial institutions are not doing so.\n  What is astonishing about the Shelby amendment is that what it seeks \nto pass off as simply taking away those institutions with $250 million \nor less in assets is, in fact, an exemption for perhaps 85 percent of \nall the lending institutions in this country. The vast majority of the \nlending institutions in this country would be exempted from a \nrequirement to show that they are involved in their community.\n  The fact is, I know this well, because as the ranking member of the \nSmall Business Committee, we have spent a considerable amount of time \ntrying to analyze access to credit for small businesses, which we know \nare over 95 percent of the businesses in the country and which provide \na majority of the jobs in the country. These are some of the people who \nalso benefit by virtue of the CRA.\n  The fact is that there is nothing that requires a lending institution \nto make a bad loan. In fact, those loans are specifically outlawed. \nThey are specifically covered under the regulations. And the regulatory \nprocess requires the same standards of due diligence and the same \nstandards of assuming credit. It simply requires them to make certain \nthey are making some of those loans in the place where they do \nbusiness.\n  The fact is that the CRA has been a remarkable catalyst, and those \n$400 billion have had a remarkable impact in the United States. Study \nafter study shows that CRA portfolios perform well and that banks are \nprofiting as a result.\n  It would be one thing if the banks came in here and said they were \nlosing money, but they are not losing money, they are profiting as a \nresult of the investments made under the CRA. That\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n\nis precisely why banks are now starting to sell CRA loans on Wall \nStreet--in order to raise more capital to make more CRA loans.\n  I might add that we have heard some complaints about the \nadministrative burden of CRA on small banks. A number of years ago, \nMadam President, those complaints were made to our committee. They were \nmade to the Small Business Committee and others. There have been a \nseries of efforts within the banking community, and in fact a \nconsiderable amount of progress has been made to reduce the overlap of \nregulations and reduce the administrative burden of CRA.\n  I am told that there is a 30-percent reduction in the level of \nadministrative effort to comply with CRA regulations. But all we are \nasking people to do is, in effect, report publicly on what they say \nthey are going to do anyway. There are people who tell you: ``We don't \nwant to do this because it is a regulatory burden. But trust us; we are \ngoing to be out there in the community making these loans anyway.''\n  If that is true, they are going to have all the records of the loans \nthey are making. They are going to have all of the analyses of how this \neffects the community. They are going to have all of the analyses of \nthose to whom they are lending.\n  The only additional requirement when you finish with all the folderol \nand hype is the requirement that they make it public and that they do \nit in a regular and orderly fashion.\n  But it's more than just the application of an economic model. CRA \nmakes a difference in the lives of real people. In Massachusetts, there \nhave been more than $1.6 billion in commitments made by financial \ninstitutions to assist low income neighborhoods. These funds have been \ninvested in home ownership, affordable housing development, minority \nsmall business development, and new banking facilities and services. \nIt's making a difference in Boston's inner city neighborhoods, from \nRoxbury and Jamaica Plain to the South End.\n  Stacy Andrus, from Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, was a restauranteur \nstruggling to make ends meet and retain her clientele in a competitive \nenvironment. She knew she had to be creative just to keep pace. Stacy \nbegan toasting chips out of pita bread to serve as finger food before \nthe meals. Well, as you might expect, the pita chips soon became the \nmost popular item on the menu. Like so many small business owners who \nknow they've latched onto a great idea, Stacy wanted to expand her \noperation, to bring her concept to scale. But capital and credit are \nscarce in Jamaica Plain. Stacy couldn't find the help she needed until \nshe started working with the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development \nCorporation. This corporation works within a network of small business \nassistance providers that use CRA programs at local banks to secure \nfinancing for small businesses. With their help, Stacy obtained a \n$60,000 loan from BankBoston. As a result, her small business has \nexpanded rapidly: She has leased a production plant in Jamaica Plain; \nput former welfare recipients on the payroll; and 900 bags of chips are \nrolling off the assembly line every day. Thanks to CRA, Stacy Andrus \nhas made her Pita chips the top-selling gourmet snack food in Boston \nand she has major airlines interested in serving her chips to first \nclass customers. But without CRA, the community of Jamaica Plain would \nnot receive the benefits from the economic development that these \ninvestment have generated.\n  CRA is also giving low-income communities a shot at home ownership, \nmaking the American Dream a reality for those who believed it was out \nof reach. Julie Orlando, a single mother of three, wanted to buy a home \nfor her family in Leominster, Massachusetts. Julie's income, though, \nwas less than 80 percent of the medial family income for the area. In \nthe days before CRA, Julie wouldn't be considered a likely candidate to \nown a home. But because the Fidelity Cooperative Bank was involved in \nthe CRA coalition, Julie was able to obtain a $72,000 mortgage with no \npoints. The city of Leominster provided additional assistance to Julie \nand her family. Because the Fidelity Cooperative Bank participated in a \nCRA coalition, Julie and her two children can live the American Dream \nof owning their first home. That is exactly the type of assistance that \nthe CRA was designed to provide. Let me tell you, Julie's success story \nis typical. It's indicative of the kind of progress we can make when we \nleverage market forces to work in disadvantaged communities.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Shelby amendment will roll back the \nadvances being made in cities and rural areas around the country. To \neliminate these regulations for more than 85 percent of banks in the \nUnited States and 75 percent of banks in Massachusetts will close the \ndoor of home ownership and small business growth for thousands of low-\nincome neighborhoods across the country.\n  I believe that is the wrong direction for this country. The United \nStates is experiencing economic growth that surpasses our wildest \nexpectations. The stock market is pushing 9,000. Unemployment is low \nand we are, for the first time in fourteen years, starting to see \ngrowth in real wages. We have reason to be proud. We don't, however, \nhave reason to rest on our laurels. In this time of prosperity, our job \nmust be to expand the winner's circle, to empower every community to \nparticipate in this economic expansion. That means we must not allow \nany community to be denied access to credit and capital. Destroying the \ndevelopment of CRA will mean access denied for our inner cities and \nrural areas. It would dismantle one of the most effective methods for \ninvestment in our neighborhoods and set back hard-fought development in \ndisadvantaged areas of this country. That is why I oppose the Shelby \namendment and urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  I hope colleagues will oppose the Shelby amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 26 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3336\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, we will vote at 5:30 on an amendment I \nhave offered, an amendment that is supported by every Republican on the \nBanking Committee. This amendment would strike an unwise and, I \nbelieve, unfair provision that was put into this credit union bill in \nthe House.\n  What I would like to try to do in a few moments is to explain what \ncredit unions are and how they work. I would like to explain why this \nprovision is unwise and unfair. I would like then to read for my \ncolleagues the language of this provision to show, by the very words of \nthe provision, how it is unworkable and how it is subject to tremendous \nvariance in interpretation. Then, contrary to what others might say \nabout a provision called ``community reinvestment,'' I would like to \ngive some real examples of abuses that are not of benefit to the \ncommunity but rather to special interests.\n  Those are basically the points that I want to cover.\n  Credit unions are voluntary organizations. They are not for-profit \norganizations. They are organizations that were established under \nFederal law or State law, many during the Great Depression, whereby \npeople of modest means pooled their savings and then, from that pool of \nsavings, they made loans to others who had joined the pool, often \nmaking it possible for people to borrow money in small amounts that \nwould not have been available through other, commercial sources. And in \nthe process, credit unions brought credit literally to millions of \nAmerican families of modest means.\n  Recognizing this in their charter, they, as other cooperatives that \nwere born during the Great Depression, were granted tax exemption. They \nare totally voluntary organizations tied together by a common bond.\n  We have written a bill in the Senate and House because of a court \nruling which jeopardizes the current status of credit unions.\n  In the House of Representatives, a provision was added to this bill \nto require for the first time ever in the history of this country that \nFederal credit unions, and not only Federal credit unions but State \ncredit unions as well, be forced to make loans and grant services at \nsubsidized rates to people who are not members of the credit union. \nThis is following a principle that has been established with the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act for banks, and I\n\n[[Page S9025]]\n\nwant to argue that it does not fit the model of credit unions, and that \nit has certainly been abused in its use for banks.\n  I personally will vote for the Shelby amendment to exempt small banks \nfrom CRA, but my amendment deals with a different subject. We should \nnot be imposing with Federal power a mandate that voluntary, nonprofit \norganizations, chartered for the sole purpose of promoting the private \ninterests of their members and the cooperative interests of their \nmembers, provide services, loans and other services, to people who are \nnot members of the credit union, people who had an opportunity to join \nbut chose not to join. And might I point out, it generally costs \nnothing more than a deposit of five dollars to join a credit union, yet \nthese people to be served under these mandates in the bill chose not to \njoin.\n  Let me read the language. In three different instances this bill \nimposes these new Federal mandates. First of all, it imposes on credit \nunions ``a continuing and affirmative obligation to meet the financial \nservices needs of persons of modest means.'' It then requires that the \nFederal Government conduct a periodic review of the records of each \ninsured credit union to see that each and every credit union is \n``providing affordable,''--and ``affordable'' is undefined and \nundefinable--``credit union services to all individuals of modest means \nwithin the field of membership of the credit union.''\n  Let me remind my colleagues that not only does the bill mandate that \nthe credit union be ``providing,'' not offering to provide but actually \nproviding, its services, meaning that they must be offered and accepted \nin order to meet the standard, but the bill mandates that the services \nand credit be ``affordable,'' an undefined and undefinable term.\n  The bill then uses equally expansive terms to identify to whom these \naffordable services and loans are to be provided: ``All individuals . . \n. within the field of membership of the credit union.'' That is far \ndifferent from the number of people who chose to join a credit union. \nIf a credit union represents a common bond of people who work for a \ncompany or people who live in a community, a credit union is very \nsuccessful if 20 percent of the people who had the opportunity to join \nthe credit union actually chose to do it.\n  If this House provision remains in the bill, we will be mandating \nthat the hard-earned savings of credit union members be used to provide \nsubsidized services to people who had an opportunity to join the credit \nunion but who chose not to afford themselves that opportunity.\n  This provision also requires that the evaluation of the credit union \nmade by the Federal examiners be made public.\n  With regard to community credit unions, the provision requires that \nthe credit union meet the credit needs and credit union service needs \nof the entire field of membership, and that procedures for remedying a \nfailure be established--again, for the first time ever in the history \nof this country requiring voluntary nonprofit organizations to grant \nsubsidized services to people who are not members of those \norganizations.\n  And, finally, a third time the legislation mandates, and again in \nwords that are undefinable, that the credit union, as a condition tied \nto its federal deposit insurance, insurance that it pays for out of its \ncapital provided by its members in a self-financing system, must be \nsatisfactorily providing affordable credit union services to all \nindividuals of modest means within its field of membership--again, not \npeople who joined the credit union. And, as before, the terms \n``satisfactorily'' and ``affordable'' are undefined and totally \nundefinable.\n  What is this really about? I want to use, I am afraid, somewhat harsh \nlanguage to describe what this is about, there are not any other terms \nwhich really describe it. We must begin by recognizing that we had to \npass a bill to deal with a court decision with regard to credit unions. \nThen we are seeing a rider added to this bill, in essence an effort to \nhold this bill hostage, these CRA provisions that for the first time \nwill force credit unions to use their resources for something other \nthan promoting the well-being of their members. These so-called \ncommunity reinvestment provisions are often abused and often can turn \ninto something very different than the term ``community reinvestment'' \nwould suggest.\n  I want to give you three examples of the kind of problems that are \nhappening on a regular basis with regard to the application of CRA to \nbanks. We do not want these things to happen to credit unions, and \nsomeday we are going to stop them from happening to banks. I would like \nto begin that soon.\n  The first has to do with California First Bank. California First Bank \nsought to merge in 1989 with Union Bank. When the merger was announced, \nprotesters showed up and filed a protest under the Community \nReinvestment Act opposing the merger of California First Bank and Union \nBank. They met with the leadership of the California First Bank, and \nafter delaying that merger, an agreement was entered into in return for \nremoving the protest to the merger. California First Bank agreed to \nincrease purchases from women and minority-owned vendors to 20 percent \nof total purchases. They agreed to make charitable contributions in the \namount of 1.4 percent of net income in 1989 and 1.5 percent of net \nincome in 1990. They made a commitment that 60 percent of employees \nplaced in middle and senior management positions within 5 years would \nbe minorities and women. And finally, they agreed, as a condition for \nthe removal of this protest, that they would appoint three minority and \nwomen directors to the bank.\n  Sumitomo Bank in California is a bank that I do not know, but I \nassume it is an affiliate bank of the Japanese bank operating in \nCalifornia. I suspect that it has specialized in providing services, \ncorresponding bank services to companies that do business in Japan and \nJapanese companies that do business in the United States. Sumitomo Bank \nhad an action filed against them under the Community Reinvestment Act, \nand as a result of this filing, they were ultimately forced into the \nfollowing agreement. And I would like to ask you, if this were a bank \nfrom one of our States that was operating in the Dominican Republic and \na group of professional protesters came into the bank and protested its \noperations and demanded and received the following things, what would \nwe call it?\n  This Japanese affiliate bank was required under this agreement to \nmake $500 million of CRA-related loans over 10 years; to spend 2 \npercent of income on charitable or not-for-profit organizations, two-\nthirds of the money going to inner-city organizations; appoint minority \nboard members to the bank; appoint a paid five-member minority advisory \nboard to consult with management; and give 20 to 25 percent of outside \ncontracts to minority-owned vendors.\n  I submit that, while it is a harsh word to say, if an American bank \nin the Dominican Republic had been forced to do these things, we would \nhave called it extortion. Yet this is happening every year in America.\n  Let me give another example. When NationsBank and the Bank of America \nrecently sought to merge, both banks had excellent CRA reports. They \nhad been graded annually, and they had historically invested \nsubstantially in the inner-city areas that they served. Yet, despite \nthe fact that both banks had excellent CRA reports, a group of \nprofessional protesters opposed the merger. Currently, they are \nendeavoring to hold up the merger, and one of the protesters was \nrecently quoted as saying, ``We will close down their branches and \nensure they fail in California. This is going to be a street fight and \nwe are prepared to engage in it.''\n  Madam President, what has really happened to CRA provisions for banks \nis that we have literally set up a procedure whereby professional \nprotesters lodge a complaint in the name of community reinvestment \nevery time banks seek official approval of any action, and based on \nthose complaints, in holding up that action, they are able to force \ncompanies to sign agreements to set quotas in purchasing, quotas in \nhiring, quotas in promotion, and they literally force the bank to \ndonate money to organizations of which they themselves, on occasion, \nare part or beneficiaries.\n  I submit that community reinvestment, while the name is a wonderful \nname, and we all support it, has really turned into a system that is \nterribly abused. It has become virtually a system of legalized \nextortion whereby a\n\n[[Page S9026]]\n\nsmall number of professional protesters are able to go into a bank and \nliterally threaten that bank with the inability to do its business \nunless they are, in some form, in some fashion, paid off.\n  I think this is fundamentally wrong. It is very difficult to get \nbanks to talk about it, obviously, because when people have been \nextorted, it is hard to get them to go public. But the plain truth is, \nI think if people look at what is happening to NationsBank and Bank of \nAmerica, even though both of them have excellent records, and in the \nreports that are filed annually have consistently received high \nratings, yet they are being shaken down by protesters who are trying to \nhold up their merger, asking for additional concessions.\n  When we look at what California First Bank and this Japanese \naffiliate were forced to do, in terms of payments of cash, in terms of \nhiring people to serve on ``advisory boards,'' it reminds me of an \nimmigrant merchant working with his family. This immigrant merchant is \ntrying to eke out a living in a little store, when these big heavies \nwalk into his store and say: You know, you need protection. You need \nsomebody to make sure that somebody doesn't come in here and tear up \nyour business or hurt you. And you give us 5 percent of what you earn \nand we will protect you.\n  I think it is fundamentally wrong, when we have established terms \nthat are so undefined as ``affordable,'' terms such as ``satisfactorily \nproviding affordable,'' so that we are literally allowing American \nbusiness to be shaken down. I don't want this to happen to credit \nunions. I don't like the fact that it is happening to banks. I believe \nthat we will ultimately fix this problem. I think we should.\n  Some people are going to say that the credit unions are not actively \nopposing the CRA mandates in the bill. The credit unions were told that \nif they opposed this provision in the bill that they might not get the \nbill, that it might be held up. So needless to say, I am not surprised \nunder those circumstances that they have not come forward to say that \nthey oppose these mandates.\n  But I believe these mandates should be stricken. I think that they \nhave no role in the credit union bill. I think it is fundamentally \nwrong, to require that voluntary nonprofit organizations, established \nto provide cooperative financial services to people who voluntarily \ncome together in a credit union--it is wrong to force them to take \ntheir money and their services and, in essence, give them to people who \nare not members of their credit union.\n  I think it is fundamentally wrong. Striking those mandates is what my \namendment is about. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, how much time is left to the proponents \nof the measure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 6 minutes 44 seconds; the \nopponents have 19 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I would like to take up to 5 minutes.\n  I support the Senator's efforts, the efforts of the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Gramm. As strenuously as I have argued against the \ninclusion of legislation that would affect community banks and CRA, I \ndo not believe this is the time for us to go forward and place the same \nCRA provisions, which are so controversial as they relate to community \nbanks, on the backs of credit unions.\n  We want to see that credit unions are soundly run. We want to protect \nthe taxpayers. We want to see that credit unions can do their business, \nand that business is to make the small loans that others traditionally \nare not willing to make. I am going to ask that a letter from the \nNational Credit Union Association, written by Robert E. Loftus, \nDirector, Public and Congressional Affairs be printed in the Record in \na minute, but I want to read this part out, relating to inquiries we \nmade as to what obligations the CRA portions of our bill would require. \nHe says, ``Our investigations have not produced any evidence that \ncredit unions are guilty of redlining or other discriminatory \npractices.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the letter from Mr. Loftus \ndated June 1, 1998, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   National Credit\n\n\n                                         Union Administration,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, June 1, 1998.\n     Mr. Phil Bechtel, Chief Counsel,\n     Ms. Madelyn Simmons, Professional Staff Member,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Phil and Madelyn: Thank you for your efforts in \n     obtaining Banking Committee approval of H.R. 1151. NCUA \n     greatly appreciates the work you and the Banking Committee \n     staff put into crafting a compromise bill.\n       I am writing in response to your request that NCUA analyze \n     the effects on credit unions of the community service \n     requirement in section 204 of H.R. 1151. Of course, NCUA's \n     ultimate disposition of this issue lies in the hands of the \n     NCUA Board; these comments reflect only staff views and not \n     the Board's position.\n       Consistent with the language of the bill, NCUA will strive \n     to focus on performance and ``not impose burdensome paperwork \n     or recordkeeping requirements.'' Our goal will be, to the \n     maximum extent possible, to rely on records credit unions \n     already maintain in order to minimize the costs of evaluating \n     service to low- and moderate-income members. We believe that \n     this approach is appropriate, as our investigations have not \n     produced any evidence that credit unions are guilty of \n     redlining or other discriminatory practices.\n       If the final version of H.R. 1151 requires NCUA to \n     implement a community service requirement, one possible \n     approach might be that taken in a recent proposed regulation. \n     A proposal before the NCUA Board in March (attached) would \n     have required credit unions applying for a new or expanded \n     community charter to document their plans to serve all \n     segments of the community. We believe that the proposed \n     regulation might provide a framework for implementation of \n     section 204.\n       Implementation of section 204 will be a time-consuming and \n     difficult process, as the Board will have to agree on the \n     meaning of terms such as ``periodically'' and ``criteria'' \n     after a public comment period which will run for several \n     months. Staff expects that developing the community service \n     regulation will be the most challenging part of implementing \n     H.R. 1151. Although there will be some additional cost, until \n     a regulation is in place, it will be impossible for staff to \n     estimate the amount of the costs to the agency and credit \n     unions.\n       Thank you again for your efforts on behalf of credit unions \n     and their members. I assure you that the NCUA Board will \n     implement the final version of the legislation with all due \n     speed. If you have further questions, please feel free to \n     contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Robert E. Loftus,\n\n                                              Directir. Public and\n                                            Congressional Affairs.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, there is no evidence that people are \nnot getting credit that they should be getting. This legislation is ill \nconceived, to place these burdens on these small credit unions and \ncredit unions that are by their nature nonprofit and voluntary. I don't \nunderstand this. To paraphrase the statement that has been used often, \n``This is a solution in search of a problem.'' We don't even have a \nproblem and we are coming up with a solution.\n  Let's look and see what the National Credit Union Administration \nsays. These are the people who are going to draw the rules enforcing \nthis vague open-ended legislation. Listen to what they say about \nimplementing the legislation that imposes the CRA requirements:\n\n       This will be a time-consuming and difficult process, as the \n     Board will have to agree on the meanings of terms such as \n     ``periodically'' and ``criteria.''\n\n  This legislation, as it is written, is ambiguous. This is not the \ntime for my colleagues to be putting this kind of legislation into law. \nThis proposed legislation is wrong. The letter from the National Credit \nUnion Administration goes on and says:\n\n       . . . after a public comment period which will run for \n     several months. Staff expects that developing the community \n     service regulation will be the most challenging part of \n     implementing H.R. 1151.\n\n  My gosh, there you have the people who are going to administer these \nCRA provisions, as well-intentioned as they might be, saying that \ndeveloping the community service regulation will be the most \nchallenging part of implementing H.R. 1151. The National Credit Union \nAdministration is saying that this is going to be the most difficult \npart of the law. Furthermore, there is no community service problem \nthat is outstanding. I don't think we want to engage in this type of \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S9027]]\n\n  Last but not least, let me say what we should be doing and what the \nadministrator of the credit unions, the National Credit Union \nAdministration, should be doing is concentrating on seeing to it that \nthose few credit unions that may have trouble with their capital \nstandards, et cetera, are subject to the prompt corrective action \nprovisions in the bill so that the taxpayers are protected.\n  Let's protect the taxpayers, and let's see to it that credit unions \ndo what they have done best, and that is to be available to the \ncommunity that often has had difficulty getting credit. That is what \nthis is about. That is what this legislation should be about.\n  As strongly as I am opposed to an attempt to strip out CRA from \ncommunity banks, it is ill conceived to place these kinds of \nlegislative prerogatives and requirements on credit unions that are not \neven adequately defined and that the National Credit Union \nAdministration itself says will be the most difficult to undertake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland controls 19 minutes, \n20 seconds, and the Senator from Texas controls 2 minutes, 29 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland yield me just 15 seconds so that I might make a request?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly, I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of \nthe two rollcall votes this afternoon, I be recognized to introduce a \nbill and to speak thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, a lot has been said here this \nafternoon. I regret some of the rhetoric. I don't think it advances a \nrational discussion of the issue, to talk about extortion and piracy, I \nmust say, because I think there are very important issues here with \nrespect to CRA, and I want to cover both of them since a lot of the \narguments that are used on the amendment pending before us which would \nremove from the bill a sort of modified version of CRA which would be \nplaced on credit unions, which was in the bill as it came over to us \nfrom the House of Representatives--a lot of those arguments really \nrelate to CRA as it applies to banks, and that application is being \nused to make an argument with respect to credit unions.\n  First of all, it had been asserted earlier that the rationale for CRA \nwhich Senator Proxmire advanced back at the time of its passage in 1977 \nhas all eroded, but the fact of the matter is, when that argument was \nmade, one of the major points that Senator Proxmire advanced for the \napplication of CRA was omitted from the list of considerations; namely, \nthat deposit insurance is available to these institutions and the \nimportance of deposit insurance.\n  This was underscored, of course, because in the 1980s Federal \ninsurance for the savings and loans cost us $132 billion, without \ncounting the indirect costs that were incurred in interest payments in \norder to finance the direct payments which were necessary.\n  Many of those who are arguing against are against any CRA requirement \nfor any federally insured financial institutions, and I think it is \nimportant to understand that. Of course, I come from a very different \npoint of view.\n  The fact of the matter is that CRA does not require a bank to make \nsubsidized loans. It doesn't require it to make uncreditworthy loans. \nIt doesn't require it to lend to a particular individual. It is not an \nallocation of credit.\n  What it requires it to do is pay attention to its community so it \ncan't simply take money out of the community and, in effect, not be in \nthe posture of putting money back into the community, which is, of \ncourse, what the act says community reinvestment is.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has pointed out:\n\n       The essential purpose of the CRA is to try to encourage \n     institutions who are not involved in areas where their own \n     self-interest is involved in doing so. If you are indicating \n     to an institution that there is a forgone business \n     opportunity in area X or loan product Y, that is not credit \n     allocation. That, indeed, is enhancing the market.\n\n  What this has enabled us to do is to draw into the mainstream of \neconomic life communities that had previously been neglected. It has \nworked well, and there is every reason that it also should apply to the \ncredit unions who, of course, also get the benefit of a Federal \nguarantee standing behind their insurance fund.\n  With respect to these sharp statements about how CRA has been used by \ncommunity groups, let me quote on the record some of the statements \nthat banks and bankers have said about it.\n  The Bank of America says:\n\n       Over the past several years, Bank of America, in \n     partnership with community organizations, has developed CRA \n     lending into a profitable mainstream business * * *. We have \n     taken what began as a compliance function and turned it into \n     a business line that makes economic as well as social sense.\n       We believe we have demonstrated over the past several years \n     that when institutions develop CRA programs as a business \n     tool, and provide lending products with flexible but prudent \n     underwriting criteria, low-income lending can be safe, sound \n     and profitable.\n\n  ``* * * low-income lending can be safe, sound and profitable.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this public statement by Bank of America \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n              Bank of America Voices Support of CRA Reform\n\n\n     Says Low-Income lending can be ``Safe, Sound, and Profitable''\n\n       San Francisco, March 9, 1995.--Bank of America said today \n     that it supports ongoing efforts to reform the Community \n     Reinvestment Act by increasing its focus on lending \n     performance.\n       ``Over the past several years, Bank of America, in \n     partnership with community organizations, has developed CRA \n     lending into a profitable mainstream business,'' said BofA \n     Executive Vice President Donald A. Mullane. ``We have taken \n     what began as a compliance function and turned it into a \n     business line that makes economic as well as social sense.\n       ``We believe we have demonstrated over the past several \n     years that when institutions develop CRA programs as a \n     business tool, and provide lending products with flexible but \n     prudent underwriting criteria, low-income lending can be \n     safe, sound and profitable.''\n       The bank reported earlier this week that it provided $5.9 \n     billion in CRA loans in the western U.S. during 1994.\n       ``As we have said repeatedly during the public debate on \n     the future of CRA, we believe it continues to play a valuable \n     public policy role by promoting more innovative and \n     widespread reinvestment activities by the financial services \n     industry.''\n       BofA made its comments in a letter to Rep. Marge Roukema, \n     who chairs the House Banking Subcommittee on Financial \n     Institutions and Consumer Credit. The subcommittee is holding \n     hearings this week on the effectiveness of the CRA and on \n     ongoing efforts by regulators to revise the 17-year-old law.\n       Mullane, as co-chair of the national Consumer Bankers \n     Association's Community Reinvestment Committee, provided a \n     written statement to Roukema's committee representing the \n     national trade association's position on CRA reform. He said \n     BofA's letter was written to clarify the bank's position as \n     an individual institution.\n       ``Our industry is not a monolith and there is a wide \n     divergence of opinion regarding the effectiveness of the \n     CRA,'' Mullane said. ``We respect those differences and \n     believe in a full and open dialogue on the future of this key \n     banking regulation.\n       ``But we want to be clear that Bank of America has been and \n     continues to be a strong advocate of the CRA process, and we \n     support current efforts by federal banking regulatory \n     agencies to revise CRA regulations so that they focus more on \n     actual lending performance than paperwork.''\n       Regarding specific elements of CRA reform, Mullane said \n     Bank of America:\n       Supports the collection of race and gender data on small \n     business and consumer loan applications, as advocated by \n     community organizations, but only if it is required of all \n     small business lending providers, not just those institutions \n     currently regulated by CRA. Banks provide only approximately \n     30 percent of small business loans in the country, Mullane \n     said, and without full reporting by all providers, such data \n     would give a distorted view of the small business lending \n     market.\n       Supports a ``safe harbor'' provision protecting \n     institutions with a CRA rating of ``outstanding'' from \n     protests during mergers and acquisitions.\n       Believes that CRA should apply equally to all banks, \n     regardless of size. CRA should also provide new market-based \n     incentives to encourage nonbank financial service providers \n     to engage in community development lending and investments.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter\n\n[[Page S9028]]\n\nfrom LaSalle Talman Bank in Chicago be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          LaSalle Talman Bank,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, March 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Marge Roukema,\n     House of Representatives, Chairwoman, House Subcommittee on \n         Financial Institutions & Consumer Credit, Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Roukema: Through our subsidiary, the \n     LaSalle Talman Home Mortgage Corporation, we are the largest \n     residential mortgage lender in both the Chicago metropolitan \n     area and the state of Illinois.\n       Our orientation and focus of lending has been consistent \n     with the mandates of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). In \n     fact, it predates the actual introduction of the CRA in 1977. \n     For the record, our institution was also providing voluntary \n     mortgage disclosure data before the passage of the Home \n     Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).\n       CRA has proved to be a positive force here in Chicago. It \n     has been the instrument that has provided millions of dollars \n     in investment that has financed home purchase, rehabilitation \n     and home improvement, and new construction in once \n     underserved communities.\n       CRA is not bad business or ``have to'' business. CRA allows \n     discretion and choice to the lender. It allows for reasoned \n     negotiation and workable solutions. It has provided a forum \n     where financial institutions, corporations, and community \n     organizations can work in a spirit of cooperation to meet \n     community credit needs.\n       Today we are disturbed by news coming from Washington, \n     viz., that efforts are underway to repeal or undermine the \n     Community Reinvestment Act.\n       There is a need to revise some aspects of the CRA, and \n     recent hearings and rule changes were to do that. That has \n     not happened. Changes are needed. Repeal is not!\n       Chicago, and indeed all of our nation's cities, need the \n     positive force of CRA. Without CRA the prospects of a return \n     to the terrible social turmoil and destructive results of \n     pre-CRA days becomes a very real possibility.\n       I express my support for the continuance of the Community \n     Reinvestment Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Thomas J. Gobby,\n                                            Senior Vice President.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, this letter states:\n\n       Through our subsidiary, LaSalle Talman Home Mortgage \n     Corporation, we are the largest residential mortgage lender \n     in both the Chicago metropolitan area and the state of \n     Illinois.\n       . . . CRA has proved to be a positive force here in \n     Chicago. It has been the instrument that has provided \n     millions of dollars in investment that has financed home \n     purchase, rehabilitation and home improvement, and new \n     construction in once underserved communities.\n       CRA is not bad business or ``have to'' business.

It has provided a forum \n     where financial institutions, corporations, and community \n     organizations can work in a spirit of cooperation to meet \n     community credit needs.\n\n  The objective is to meet these community credit needs. We have \ndiscovered now a path down which we can go and which, in the course of \nmeeting the community needs, the financial institutions benefit and \nprofit from it.\n  Reference was made to the Sumitomo Bank of California. I ask \nunanimous consent that a statement of Sumitomo released in March 1997 \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n          Sumitomo Bank Announces 1997 Community Outreach Plan\n\n       San Francisco, March 6.--At a press conference today, \n     Sumitomo Bank of California (Nasdaq: SUMI) announced its 1997 \n     Community Outreach Plan. A full text of the Bank's statement, \n     as provided by Tsuneo Onda, President and CEO, is provided \n     below.\n       ``In January of 1993, Sumitomo Bank of California announced \n     its Ten-Year Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Goals. At the \n     time, it was widely praised by advocacy groups as the most \n     comprehensive and largest commitment of its type.\n       ``I am proud to announce that just four years into the \n     plan, our Bank has made great progress. In terms of lending, \n     the most significant of the goals, we have already made $349 \n     million of CRA loans since 1993, just under seventy percent \n     of our $500 million ten-year goal. This includes loans to \n     low- to moderate-income home buyers, Small Business \n     Administration loans, and loans in redevelopment and \n     enterprise zones, among others. I believe that this is an \n     outstanding accomplishment, especially in light of the fact \n     that our Bank has actually declined in size over that period.\n       ``Encouraged by our success to date, we have decided to \n     reaffirm our commitment by expanding our original Goals. \n     Based on our progress, we will strive to achieve our original \n     $500 million CRA loan goal within six years, four years \n     earlier than originally targeted. Not stopping there, we will \n     double our 1993 goal, targeting a total of $1.0 billion in \n     CRA loans over the original ten-year time-frame. In addition \n     to the loan goal, we will expand our Community Advisory Board \n     from five to ten members, and will aim for greater diversity \n     in our use of vendors and in our philanthropic support of \n     community organizations. Our goals are extremely challenging, \n     but we feel they are consistent with our business plans and \n     we will do our best to achieve them.\n       ``Community outreach will be the key to achieving our \n     goals, and that is why we have named our new plan the ``1997 \n     Community Outreach Plan.'' As a start, we are in the process \n     of creating a new CRA unit, specifically dedicated to \n     ensuring the achievement of our goals. This new unit will \n     concentrate on identifying ways to expand and improve our \n     involvement with a more diverse customer base, including \n     those with whom we have not previously established business \n     relationships.\n       ``Perhaps our most important effort will be in the \n     communities themselves. Our goals can best be achieved \n     through a cooperative effort between our Bank and the people \n     in the communities we serve. We believe that the \n     establishment of working relationships with minority-owned \n     financial institutions that are already doing business in \n     these communities will be one important aspect of our \n     outreach efforts. In that regard, we are presently developing \n     a relationship with a African American-owned bank located in \n     South Central Los Angeles. In addition, we have sought and \n     received the support of a broad range of community groups. As \n     we develop concrete projects with these groups, we will be \n     making additional announcements.\n       ``In closing, I believe that our 1997 Community Outreach \n     Plan is a mutually beneficial plan that will greatly assist \n     all the communities we serve, while helping our Bank achieve \n     our own business goals.''\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, in this statement they reaffirm their \nCRA commitment and announce an expansion of their CRA goals. Sumitomo \nitself came in and said they were proud to announce that, just 4 years \ninto the plan, the bank had made great progress. They then quote some \nfigures of how they come close to meeting their various goals:\n\n       Encouraged by our success to date, we have decided to \n     reaffirm our commitment by expanding our original Goals. \n     Based on our progress, we will strive to achieve our original \n     . . . goal within six years, four years earlier than \n     originally targeted. . . .\n\n  They doubled their goal. So they recognize that it was working, that \nit was mutually beneficial. They closed by saying this ``will greatly \nassist all the communities we serve, while helping our Bank achieve our \nown business goals.''\n  Recently The Enterprise Foundation, which of course was founded by \nJim Rouse, one of the great visionaries, in my judgment, in our Nation \nwith respect to community development, urban planning, affordable \nhousing, they described in a publication ``Community Reinvestment, Good \nWorks, Good Business''--``Good Works, Good Business''--they cited \nprograms in Florida, Missouri, Iowa, California, Nebraska, New York, \nMinnesota, and New Jersey as examples, cited the banks, the programs \nthey were carrying out under CRA. And they went on to say:\n\n       Many banks have discovered that community lending is good \n     business. These banks would continue to meet their \n     obligations regardless of federal requirements. But others \n     need encouragement, and CRA has proven effective at providing \n     this. CRA has helped banks discover new markets and profit \n     opportunities that they otherwise might have overlooked.\n\n  We had all these complaints about paperwork, overregulation. The \nregulators undertook a major effort to slim that down, with great \nsuccess. The various banking associations, after that was completed, \nappraised the process through which we had gone in order to simplify \nand streamline this process. So it is working. It is bringing in these \ncommunities. It is drawing people into the financial mainstream. And it \nseems to me a reasonable requirement.\n  Let me make just one final point, because the point is being asserted \nthat, well, these banks that would be exempted under the amendment \noffered by Senator Shelby hold a small portion of the assets of all \nbanks nationally. But what you have to understand is that 85 percent of \nall banks in the country would be eliminated from the CRA by the Shelby \namendment. In six States, over 95 percent of the banks fall into this \ncategory. In nine other States, over 90 percent of the banks fall into \nthis category. There are 30 States in which 80 percent of the banks \nfall into this category.\n  Many are rural States. CRA is often perceived as benefiting the urban \nareas\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\nof our country. However, rural areas, no less than urban areas, benefit \nfrom CRA.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from a \ncoalition of rural and farm groups in opposition to the Shelby \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 23, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations \n     representing rural Americans, we are writing to express our \n     strong opposition to legislative efforts to weaken the \n     coverage of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Our \n     understanding is that Senator Shelby plans to offer an \n     amendment to H.R. 1151, the credit union legislation, that is \n     scheduled for floor action. In addition, Senator Gramm plans \n     to offer an amendment that strikes provisions in H.R. 1151 \n     that would ensure that credit unions provide services to all \n     individuals of modest means within their field of membership.\n       The Shelby amendment would exempt banks under $250 million \n     in assets from CRA coverage. This affects over 85% of banks \n     nationally. For citizens in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, \n     Nebraska, and Oklahoma, 95% of the banks would be exempt.\n       Rural Americans need the tools of the Community \n     Reinvestment Act to ensure accountability of their local \n     lending institutions. It is needed to prevent rural banks \n     from abandoning their commitment to serve the millions of \n     Americans living in smaller low and moderate-income \n     communities. Unfortunately, small commercial banks do not \n     automatically reinvest in their local communities. This is \n     documented to national data on reinvestment trends and loan \n     to asset ratios for banks across the country. 50% of small \n     banks have a loan-to-deposit ratio below 70%, with 25% of \n     these having levels less than 58%. The data for 1997 reveals \n     that banks under $100 million in assets received 82% of the \n     substantial non-compliance ratings.\n       We strongly urge you to oppose these amendments to H.R. \n     1151. The Shelby amendment ignores the important regulatory \n     changes since 1995 that have significantly reduced the \n     paperwork and reporting issues for small banks. The Gramm \n     amendment will strike an important provision from the bill \n     that for the first time would require credit unions to meet \n     the financial services needs of their entire field of \n     membership.\n       A vote against these amendments will help meet the credit \n     demand of millions of family farmers, rural residents, and \n     local businesses.

That letter says, in part:\n\n       Rural Americans need tools of the Community Reinvestment \n     Act to ensure accountability of their local lending \n     institutions. It is needed to prevent rural banks from \n     abandoning their commitment to serve the millions of \n     Americans living in smaller low and moderate-income \n     communities. Unfortunately, small commercial banks do not \n     automatically reinvest in their local communities.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from more than \n40 community groups with respect to CRA and with respect to both the \nShelby and the Gramm amendment be printed in the Record as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Vote Against the Anti-Community Reinvestment Amendments \n           to H.R. 1151\n                                                    July 13, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: The credit union bill (H.R. 1151) is \n     currently scheduled for consideration by the full Senate this \n     Friday (July 18). We understand that Sen. Shelby will offer \n     an amendment that would have the effect of substantially \n     curtailing coverage for banks under the Community \n     Reinvestment Act (CRA). Additionally, Sen. Gramm is planning \n     to offer another amendment to strike provisions in H.R. 1151 \n     intended to ensure that credit unions serve persons of modest \n     means within their fields of membership and consistent with \n     safe and sound operation. We urge you to vote against both of \n     these amendments.\n       CRA is a 1977 law that was enacted to combat the practice \n     of redlining by taxpayer-backed federally insured banks and \n     savings institutions. The Shelby amendment offered \n     unsuccessfully in the Senate Banking Committee exempts banks \n     with under $250 million in assets from all CRA requirements \n     (more than 85% of all banks). Should this amendment be \n     adopted, it would mean that the vast majority of insured \n     depository lenders would be free to redline or otherwise \n     discriminate with impunity against the residents of certain \n     urban and rural geographies.\n       CRA is a law that works! Almost $400 billion is estimated \n     to have been committed by banks for affordable housing, small \n     business lending, and community development in under-served \n     urban and rural communities since 1977. These commitments \n     have opened up opportunities for modest income families, \n     small firms and small family farmers to purchase a home, and \n     start up and expand their businesses. CRA has helped to \n     ``jump start'' the market in these under-served areas.\n       CRA has produced substantial benefits at no cost to the \n     taxpayer. Former Federal Reserve Board Governor Lawrence \n     Lindsey said that CRA accounts for billions of dollars being \n     invested annually in low-income areas without employing a \n     large bureaucracy. For these reasons, US News and World \n     Report refers to CRA as an ``ideal government initiative.'' \n     Community reinvestment lending has helped to take the place \n     of dwindling federal resources for community development.\n       The Shelby amendment is a solution in search of a problem. \n     The recently adopted CRA regulations were specifically \n     designed to streamline the examination process for small \n     banks and thrifts. Under the revised rules, banks and thrifts \n     with an asset size of less than $250 million are exempt from \n     all reporting requirements and are no longer subject to \n     process-based documentation requirements. Instead, examiners \n     now look at a small bank's loan-to-deposit ratio, percentage \n     of portfolio in local loans, distribution of loans across \n     geographies and income levels, and responses to any \n     complaints about its CRA performance. As a result, federal \n     regulators report that they no longer receive complaints from \n     small banks about the examination process for CRA.\n       Small banks have praised the new CRA regulations, adopted \n     in 1995. The Independent Bankers Association of America \n     (IBAA) ``hailed the final interagency CRA rules . . . as a \n     big step in regulatory burden reduction for community \n     banks.'' The IBAA ``[commended the regulators for instituting \n     a meaningful, streamlined tiered examination system that \n     recognizes the differences between community banks and their \n     large regional and multinational brethren.'' (IBAA, press \n     release, April 19, 1995).\n       ``Small Banks Give Thumbs-Up To Streamlined CRA Exams.'' \n     This headline from the February 1, 1996 American Banker \n     reflects the positive experience that small banks have had \n     since the new regulations have gone into effect. For example, \n     the same article cites the experience of one small bank after \n     its first CRA exam under the new rules. The bank's CRA \n     officer said, ``We are done with it, and it was definitely \n     less burdensome. We only had one examiner . . . She got here \n     on Wednesday at 1 p.m. and left the following day at noon . . \n     . It was a lot less time consuming. They are not requiring \n     a lot of documentation.''\n       Please do not allow this important law to be weakened.

Madam President, let me just very quickly focus on the \ncredit unions only. This debate has tended to overlap both areas. It is \ndone\n\n[[Page S9030]]\n\nby the proponents of the amendment and, of course, we have responded \ntoo, because, in part, your attitude is going to be affected by how you \nsee CRA functioning and whether you perceive it as bringing beneficial \nimpacts or whether you perceive it as being harmful or not. I submit \nthere is strong evidence that it has brought significant beneficial \nimpacts, and many of the studies have supported that.\n  What is being applied to the credit unions in this legislation is not \nthe full CRA provision. But this does require the credit union \nregulator, the National Credit Union Administration, to review the \nrecord of each insured credit union in providing credit union services \nto all individuals of modest means within the field of membership of \nthe credit union.\n  It would not require them to go outside of the field of membership. \nThey could not be required to give a loan to someone who was not a \nmember of the credit union because that is a requirement of credit \nunions in terms of their loan policy. But they would have to try to \ndraw in, make an effort to draw in people who were within the field of \nmembership. They would have to concern themselves with trying to bring \nboth low- and moderate-income as well as the sort of very top of the \nline within their field of membership.\n  The NCUA has directed a focus on the actual performance of the credit \nunion not to impose burdensome paperwork or record-keeping \nrequirements. This provision included in the House bill that was sent \nto us has been crafted to respond to the situation of credit unions. It \nis an effort to encourage them to meet the financial service needs of \nall their members and to reach out to those in the field of membership \nwho have not yet joined and gotten the benefit of the credit union's \nservices.\n  It is really a modest proposal. It has been suggested that the credit \nunions are not fiercely opposing it because they have somehow or other \nbeen coerced into that position--that is certainly not my \nunderstanding--just as it has been suggested that we need to get people \nto talk to some of these bankers who favor the CRA.\n  We are told, ``Well, now we have these people who are against it. We \ncannot identify them because if we identify them then they are going to \nget into a lot of trouble.'' Well, I have people I can identify who \nwould tell you that CRA has worked, that it has made an important \nimpact, that the financial institution has found it not to be a burden \nbut has found it actually to be profitable, that it has developed a \nbetter relationship in terms of their service area in terms of \nproviding needed financial services. In effect, we are gaining public \nbenefits from it, from an industry which received very significant \npublic benefits in the sense of the insurance, the backup to the \ninsurance, the Federal Government guarantee, access to low-cost credit \nthrough the Federal Reserve window and the Federal Reserve payment \nsystem.\n  This is enabling us to make very significant progress. The estimates \nin terms of the money that has gone into previously neglected \ncommunities is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. This is an \neffort to make capitalism work in a broader expanse, both \ngeographically and in terms of the individuals who then are drawn in to \nplay a part in the system.\n  I know some harsh language has been quoted earlier by community \ngroups. I do not begin to try to justify or excuse that harsh language, \nalthough I must say some pretty harsh language has been used here on \nthe floor of the Senate which I also regret. But we ought to look at \nthis as an opportunity. This is turning into a win-win situation. It \nenables us then to sort of say, look, this economic system can work for \neverybody.\n  Those of you who are sort of complaining that you are shut out of \nthis economic system, we have found ways to make this system--to open \nit up so it works for everybody. The institutions make a profit. They \ndo good. They do well by doing good. People who otherwise would be \nfighting the system are drawn into the system. They become a part of \nthe workings of this, of our financial structure and, therefore, become \nable to make a contribution to our society.\n  It has brought enormous benefits in so many areas of the country. As \nI said, the Chicago Bank says, ``It's a positive force here in Chicago. \nIt has been the instrument that has provided millions of dollars in \ninvestment that has financed home purchases, rehabilitation, and home \nimprovement and new construction in once underserved communities.''\n  That is what we are trying to accomplish.\n  The Shelby amendment, of course, would eliminate all of that, take us \nback a significant step. The Gramm amendment would prevent the \nextension of this concept of serving the community to the credit \nunions. I oppose it and I very much hope my colleagues would oppose it \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I only have a limited amount of time. Let \nme be quick.\n  No one is against community investment. Everyone is for community \ninvestment, and virtually every financial institution in America \nengages in it, and engages in it as much as they can in terms of \nprudent investments.\n  Our colleague talks about financial institutions taking money out of \nthe community and then the government, through CRA, making them put it \nback into the community. I want to remind my colleagues that credit \nunions do not take money out of the community. Credit unions are \nvoluntary organizations which people can choose to join or not to join. \nThey cannot take money away, because they can only loan their money to \ntheir own members.\n  Our colleague objects to talk about being forced to grant credit, at \na subsidized rate, to people that are not members of the credit union. \nBut in three different places in the bill it requires that credit \nunions are ``satisfactorily,'' whatever that means, ``providing \naffordable,'' whatever that means, credit to the entire field of \nmembership. Not trying to do it, not offering to, but doing it, \nsomething that clearly is open to any kind of subjective evaluation by \na regulator. In fact, Senator D'Amato has read from the Federal agency \nthat regulates credit unions, how burdensome this is going to be.\n  Two final points: Our colleague quotes someone from this Sumitomo \nBank, about how happy they are. Well, I think you would be saying that, \ntoo, if in 1993 you had been forced, under the CRA, to give 2 percent \nof your income away, to appoint people to your board that you didn't \nchoose to appoint, to set up an advisory board and pay them, the very \npeople who are protesting your bank under CRA, make then now a part of \nyour organization, and, finally, if had been forced to engage in \nquotas. So I am not surprised that this bank is saying how great \neverything is now. They don't want the same people back in their place \nof business.\n  Finally, I appreciate the fact that the Senator gave us the wonderful \nrecord of the Bank of America in California under CRA, but it doesn't \nseem to have done Bank of America any good. I quote a CRA protester who \nat this moment has lodged a complaint with this financial institution \nagainst its merger with NationsBank. Despite all their good work, he \nsays, ``We will close down their branches and assure they fail in \nCalifornia. This is going to be a street fight and we are prepared to \nengage in it.''\n  What tyrant in history has not claimed that he was serving the public \ninterest when he took private property --not one ever in the history of \nthe world.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I can't control the comments of the \nstreet protester, just like I can't control the comments of some of my \ncolleagues on the Senate floor, since this is a free country with free \nspeech.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I can protect private property, and that is why I am in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I move to table the Gramm amendment \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Gramm amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) are absent on \nofficial business.\n\n[[Page S9031]]\n\n  I also announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman) \nand the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin) is absent due \nto a death in the family.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we had considered doing the memorial \nresolution between these votes, but we decided, after discussion with \nSenator Daschle, the most appropriate thing would be to go to this next \nvote and then have the memorial resolution read.\n  I would like to ask Senators to remain in the Chamber and take their \nseats so that we can hear this memorial resolution. It is not that \nlong, but it is very appropriate. I think the Senators will like to \nhear it. Perhaps at that point Senator Daschle, who was not able to \nspeak this morning, will want to make a statement, and others, and then \nwe will go on to other issues.\n  I also want to remind Senators that at 11:50 tomorrow morning, \nSenators are asked to assemble in the Chamber. We will recess at that \ntime to go en bloc to the Rotunda to pass through and around the \ncoffins of the officers that will be there in the Rotunda. We will be \nback then at about 12:15, and we will go forward with legislative \nbusiness. Then again tomorrow afternoon, at approximately 2:30, we will \ngo for the memorial services beginning at 3 o'clock with the President \nand the Vice President in the Rotunda.\n  I just wanted Senators to be aware of that. So we will have the \nresolution read. We would like to ask you to stay, if you can, \nimmediately following this vote. This next vote will be the last \nrecorded vote tonight, although we may try to move to an appropriations \nbill. This will be the last vote tonight. The next vote will be in the \nmorning at 10 o'clock on the Shelby amendment, followed by final \npassage on the credit union issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, there is an order that has been entered \nwhich would allow me to speak immediately upon the disposition of the \ntwo rollcall votes. I would ask unanimous consent that that order be \nmoved to the conclusion of the reading of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3337\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Hagel amendment \nis now before the Senate. There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I am a supporter of credit unions. I have been a \nmember of a credit union. I have been on the board of a credit union. I \nsupport the original charter for their original purpose. But if we are \ngoing to change the rules and allow tax-exempt credit unions to get \nmore and more into commercial lending and have essentially unlimited \naccess to new members, with the common bond being realistically \neliminated, then additional safety and soundness measures are going to \nhave to be required. My amendment strengthens the safety and soundness \nof credit unions with open and honest accounting. It brings some market \nfairness to the relationship between tax-exempt credit unions and tax-\npaying small community banks, and it refocuses on the original intent \nof credit unions--on consumer loans and services.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote against tabling the Hagel-Bennett \namendment. Vote no.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am moving to table this amendment because we have had \nfor years no limitations on credit unions and their loans commercially. \nAnd, by the way, with all that with no limitations, only 1.3 percent \nwere made for commercial purposes. Now we impose 12.25 percent. We \nlimit them. And to say that we are not doing something when we place \nrestrictions on them and you want to go further, I think this is wrong, \nit is ill conceived, and that is why I will move to table.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Secretary of the Treasury has written to the \nleadership after Treasury did a thorough study of credit unions. The \nSecretary says, ``The bill's safety and soundness provisions would \nrepresent the most significant legislative reform of credit unions' \nsafety and soundness since the creation of the share insurance fund.'' \nAnd then he specifically addresses business lending and says, ``The \nprovisions in this legislation represent an adequate response to safety \nand soundness concerns about credit unions' business lending.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the opponents has expired. The \nSenator from Nebraska has 7 seconds.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield my time back to my distinguished colleagues. They \nneed some help with their argument.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I move to table.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Hagel amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself, the Democratic leader, \nand the entire Senate membership, I send a Senate concurrent resolution \nto the desk regarding the fallen U.S. Capitol policemen. And I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration, and ask that the clerk read the resolution in its \nentirety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report and \nread the concurrent resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 110) honoring the \n     memory of Detective John Michael Gibson and Private First \n     Class Jacob Joseph Chestnut of the United States Capitol \n     Police for their selfless acts of heroism at the United \n     States Capitol on July 24, 1998.\n       Whereas the Capitol is the people's house, and, as such, it \n     has always been and will remain open to the public;\n       Whereas millions of people visit the Capitol each year to \n     observe and study the workings of the democratic process;\n       Whereas the Capitol is the most recognizable symbol of \n     liberty and democracy throughout the world and those who \n     guard the Capitol guard our freedom;\n       Whereas Private First Class Jacob ``J.J.'' Chestnut and \n     Detective John Michael Gibson sacrificed their lives to \n     protect the lives of hundreds of tourists, staff, and Members \n     of Congress;\n       Whereas if not for the quick and courageous action of those \n     officers, many innocent people would likely have been injured \n     or killed;\n       Whereas through their selfless acts, Detective Gibson and \n     Private First Class Chestnut underscored the courage, honor, \n     and dedication shown daily by every member of the United \n     States Capitol Police and every law enforcement officer;\n       Whereas Private First Class Chestnut, a Vietnam veteran who \n     spent 20 years in the Air Force, was an 18-year veteran of \n     the Capitol Police, and was married to Wen Ling and had five \n     children, Joseph, Janece, Janet, Karen and William;\n       Whereas Detective Gibson, assigned as Rep.

Mr. President, I want to extend my deepest sympathy to \nthe families of Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, and to \nthe many friends that they leave, particularly their brothers and \nsisters in arms, the members of the United States Capitol Police. Our \nhearts ache for them as they struggle with their staggering loss.\n\n  Like many Members of Congress, I was headed home Friday afternoon \nwhen Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson were slain. I was in the \nairport in Minneapolis, changing planes, when I first learned of what \nhad happened. I was shocked and sickened and saddened.\n  Throughout the airport, wherever there was a TV, people crowded \naround it to watch the news, and try to understand.\n  At home in South Dakota this past weekend, I spoke with countless \npeople who told me how terribly sad they are about the deaths of these \ntwo brave men.\n  In that airport, in South Dakota and across our nation, Americans \nunderstand that Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson sacrificed their \nlives to guard and protect something that is sacred to all of us.\n  This Capitol truly is ``the people's house'', a symbol of freedom and \ndemocracy, recognized the world over.\n  That is one of the reasons Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson \nloved it so, and were so proud to work here.\n  It is difficult, unless you have worked here, to understand what a \nclose-knit family the Capitol community is. We come to work every day, \npass each other in the halls. We ask about each others' families, joke \nwith each other.\n  And today, we try to comfort each other.\n  Whenever you suffer a death in the family, as we have in the Capitol \nHill family, there is at first a sort of unreality about it.\n  That is especially true when the person is taken suddenly, or too \nyoung, as Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson were.\n  But then, you come to where they should be and there is a hole in the \nworld and you begin to understand that it's true.\n  Coming back to work today, we have all experienced that void.\n  Inside the Capitol, another officer stands where Officer Chestnut \nshould be.\n  And the door over the House Majority Whip's office, where Detective \nGibson was stationed, is draped in black bunting.\n  Everywhere, the voices are quieter than usual. Tears rim the eyes of \nmany people. Outside, the flag over the Capitol flies mournfully at \nhalf-staff.\n  Below it, on the white marble steps, lay flowers and cards left by a \ngrateful public to honor two fallen heroes.\n  Then, there is perhaps the saddest sight of all: the black bands \nstretched like a gash over the badges of the Capitol Police officers.\n  These are the inadequate tributes we pay to these two extraordinary \nmen whose professionalism, courage and selfless dedication last Friday \nafternoon surely saved many innocent lives.\n  But the real tribute is not what is different about the Capitol \ntoday. The real tribute is what is the same.\n  The halls of ``the people's house'' are filled today--as they are \nevery day--with vacationing families, school children, Scout troops and \nthousands of others who have come to see their government in action. \nThey walk these majestic halls and marvel--as they do every day--at the \nbeauty of this building, at its history and its openness.\n  That is the real tribute to Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson.\n  Because they made us feel so safe, we may not have understood fully \nthe risks they took each day when they put on their badges and came to \nwork. But they understood.\n  They knowingly risked their lives because they loved this building \nand\n\n[[Page S9033]]\n\nwhat it represents, and they wanted others to be able to see their \ngovernment at work.\n  Among the bouquets on the steps outside is a handmade tribute: a \ncollage of a silvery cross on black paper. Glued across the top of the \ncollage is the headline from S aturday's newspaper. It reads ``2 Slain \nOfficers Remembered, Called Heroes.''\n  Today, as we struggle to accept that loss, we offer our condolences \nand thanks to the men and women of the Capitol Police Department \nespecially those who were at work last Friday afternoon and who reacted \nwith such selfless professionalism as well as those who worked through \nthe weekend so that ``the people's house'' could remain open to the \npeople.\n  We can only imagine how awful these days are for you, and how \ndifficult it must be for you to be here.\n  We are proud to work with you, and deeply grateful to you for your \ncourage and dedication.\n  Above all, our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends \nof Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson. May God comfort them and ease \ntheir terrible anguish.\n  Tomorrow, we will put aside our normal schedule in order to pay our \nfinal respects to Jacob Joseph Chestnut and John Gibson.\n  Their bodies will lie in honor in the Rotunda, surrounded by statues \nof other American heroes. That is as it should be, for they truly are \nheroes. They gave their life for their country and, in doing so, saved \nthe lives of countless others. We are in awe of their sacrifice, and we \nare grateful to them beyond words.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I also want to voice my sorrow and the sorrow of the \npeople of Maryland following the tragic events on Friday, July 24.\n  And I rise in tribute to the heroic acts of Officer Jacob ``J.J.'' \nChestnut, from Ft. Washington in my home state of Maryland, and special \nagent John Gibson, of nearby Woodbridge, Virginia, who gave their lives \nto protect the U.S. Capitol and its residents, to protect this building \nthat is the symbol of freedom and democracy the world over.\n  No words can adequately express my pain and outrage at the senseless \nkillings that took place at 3:40 on Friday. No words can adequately \ncomfort those who were emotionally and physically injured, nor relieve \nthe pain of the families who lost loved ones. No words can erase the \nhorror of the Weston family upon learning that their son may have \ncommitted this horrific act. And no words can adequately express the \nsorrow that millions of Americans feel today about this assault on our \nnation's heritage and democratic institutions.\n  However, words can be used to remember and applaud the lives and \nheroism of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson. And I want to add my \nvoice to the call today to remember those brave men and commend all the \nCapitol Hill police officers who put their lives on the line to protect \ndemocracy. And I want to add my voice to the call to ensure that the \nPeople's House remains open to the people, while preserving the safety \nof those who work and visit this great institution.\n  Many of my colleagues know how indispensable and brave the Capitol \nHill Police Officers are, but many other Americans learned of these \nbrave troops just on Friday. Let me tell you what I think many people \ndidn't really know until Friday: what a Capitol Hill Police Officer \ndoes and what makes them so special.\n  These men and women are some of the most unique officers in the \ncountry. First, they are excellent federal law-enforcement officials \nwho protect members of Congress from crooks, terrorists, or anyone else \nwho would want to harm us and they also protect all the people in the \nbuilding, whether it's a foreign dignitary, like Mr. Mandela, or a \ngirl-scout troop from Iowa. Second, they are also ``Officer \nFriendly''--welcoming people and answering questions and many have \ntaken special language training to help visitors from around the world. \nThird, many are also trained for other possible emergencies: to provide \nbasic paramedic help in the case of an ill tourist, or to provide basic \nfire-fighting and help evacuate buildings in the case of fires.\n  These police are like our own ``Cops on the Beat.'' Many of the \nofficers are assigned a primary beat, which means they get to know \nparticular members and our hours and our staffs; the regular delivery \npeople; and others. They know who are the usual folks coming in and can \nthen detect anyone who is strange, or who is acting strange. So, just \nlike thousands of towns across the country, Capitol Hill has its own \ncommunity policemen. They have a beat, they get to know us, and we get \nto know them.\n  And if you're on the beat, you get to know the officers on your beat. \nWe talk about the Orioles. We talk about their families. There is \nalways the proud dad. The one who's getting off early because his \ndaughter is going to a prom and he's chaperoning. Or one who is the \nfirst in her family to get her college degree.\n  They also get to know us. We talk to them about our own families. I \nknow when my own mother was ill and we thought she needed surgery, they \nvolunteered to organize a blood drive if I needed it. They told me that \nI never had to worry, that if I needed extra people to come to \nBaltimore, they would. They just said, ``Don't worry, Senator Barb, \nwe'll be there for you.''\n  Finally, so many of the Capitol Hill Police Officers are my Maryland \nconstituents, just like J.J. Chestnut. So, I'd hear if the fishing was \ngood down in Southern Maryland, or if the traffic was congested. \nOfficer Chestnut was from Ft. Washington in Prince Georges County. It's \nclose to the Potomac River, and it is where a lot of our officers live. \nWhere they can have a wonderful family life, fish in the Potomac, or, \nas I've learned about Officer Chestnut, tend a wonderful vegetable \ngarden. Officer Chestnut was always one of the stars--trained as an MP \nin the military, he'd been with the Capitol Police for eighteen years \nand was known for having a unique touch with tourists and constituents. \nWe were very proud of him and that he was even nominated at one time \nfor Capitol Police Officer of the Year.\n  And I know how proud we were of Detective Gibson as well. He was from \njust across the River in Virginia, and was also a star and a hero. From \nhelping tourists to protecting dignitaries, Detective Gibson always \nmade the safety of others his top priority. I know he was a true hero \non Friday, when he stopped the gunman from entering further into the \nbuilding.\n  The Capitol Hill Police Officers are our hi-touch, hi-tech community \npolice officers and we are very, very proud of them. And we are \nprofoundly grieved at the passing of two of that force's brightest \nlights, Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson.\n  My heart and prayers go out to their families, as they cope with \ntheir overwhelming loss. And my heart goes out to the family of the \nsuspect, Mr. Weston. From everything I've seen and heard, Mr. Weston \nwas mentally ill. From interviews I've seen, the Weston family is a \ngood family and his mom and dad are absolutely grief-stricken at the \nthought that their son could have done such a terrible, terrible act \nand our thoughts and prayers should be with them, as well today.\n  Mr. President, I know the entire Senate joins me in saying that this \nact was a horror and that no family, no nation should have to endure \nthe pain we feel today. I know that we will honor them tomorrow in a \nservice befitting heroes because, Madam President, they were heroes. \nGiving their lives so that others might be safe is the ultimate act of \nheroism. We know that Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson are heroes \nfor today and all eternity.\n  Madam President, I hope that as we respond, we are very careful to \nensure that the public access continues to be granted here. We need to \nensure that what they died for, which was defending not only the \nbuilding, but what the building stands for, so that the public can \nalways come see us doing our work while they so valiantly did their \nwork. I thank the Chair and my colleague, the senior Senator, for \nyielding me this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on Friday, two veteran Capitol Police \nOfficers were killed in the line of duty during a tragic attack in the \nUnited States Capitol. Their sacrifice in performance of duty will \nforever be remembered in the halls of the United States Congress.\n  Tomorrow in the Rotunda of the Capitol, we will memorialize the \nbravery\n\n[[Page S9034]]\n\nand sacrifice of these two officers--the first Capitol Police Officers \nto be killed in the line of duty.\n  Officer ``J.J.'' Chestnut was 58 and the father of five children. He \nwas a grandfather and a 20-year veteran of the United States Air Force \nwith service in Vietnam. Officer Chestnut was a member of the Capitol \nPolice Force for 18 years.\n  Special Agent John Gibson was 42 and the father of three children. He \nwas an 18-year veteran of the Capitol Police Force who served as a \nSpecial Agent assigned to House Majority Whip, Tom DeLay for the last \nthree years.\n  To the families of these men, we extend our deep and heartfelt \nsympathy during this very difficult time. The Capitol Hill community \nhas lost two respected and brave defenders of democracy.\n  To the fellow officers of these fallen heroes, you have our \nunqualified support as daily you carry your duties to protect the halls \nof freedom. Your dedication and service to the Nation is deeply \nappreciated.\n  Indeed, all Americans are indebted to Officer Chestnut and Special \nAgent Gibson for their devotion to duty and their sacrifice in the \ndefense of freedom.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Rules Committee, I also had the \nopportunity over the weekend to maintain close contact with those here \nunder the direction of our distinguished majority leader and minority \nleader, notably the Sergeant at Arms and the chief of police. I wish to \ncommend them in the manner in which they very quickly took charge of \nthis tragic situation and, once again, reopened the people's house--\nthat is what this magnificent structure is--so that the people from the \nUnited States, people from all over the world, can continue to come and \nshare the magnificence of this edifice.\n  A great debt of gratitude is owed, of course, especially to these two \nofficers and to their families. As I look into their eyes of the men \nand women who guard the Capitol, each day, I silently express my \ngratitude, for we couldn't have 32,000 visitors as we did the day \nbefore and probably in the day to come, who could walk through these \nmagnificent halls with a sense of safety and confidence--we couldn't \nhave that without the dedicated service of our Capitol Police. Nor \ncould the business of the Congress itself take place without their \ntaking a risk every minute of the day and night that this edifice is \nopen for the people's business.\n  I also thank the medical department. They responded and were on the \nscene within less than 2 minutes. I went down to personally express my \nappreciation and their reply to me was, we are there, we did our duty \nlike everyone else, and we are delighted to be a part of this team that \nfunctions to make this magnificent organization and this building serve \nthe people of this country and, indeed, stands as a symbol to the whole \nfree world.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to join briefly in the comments \nthat have been made. The heroism of the two slain officers will be a \npermanent memorial to the hundreds of others, the thousands, the tens \nof thousands of others here and across our land who daily put their \nlives at risk so we can live as free and secure people.\n  The greatest testimony that we could give to these two brave men \nwould be to continue the practice of openness in this Capitol. Our \ndemocracy depends upon a very special relationship between the people \nand those who are fortunate enough to be their representatives. We must \nnot break that bond. We must be prudent in our actions, but not closed \nin our demeanor toward the thousands of citizens who come here on a \ndaily basis to observe their democracy.\n  So I join in the comments that have been made by our leaders and \nextend our heartfelt sympathy to those families who have been so \ntragically ruptured by this senseless act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the nation was stunned as we learned of \nthe tragic deaths of John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut, two veteran \nofficers of the Capitol Police who lost their lives in the line of duty \nin the tragic and senseless shootings last Friday. The extraordinary \ndedication and heroism of these two courageous officers clearly \nprevented greater loss of life in the Capitol, and I join all Americans \nin mourning their deaths.\n  These brave men represented the very finest traditions of American \nlaw enforcement. They protected a building--the nation's Capitol--and \nin doing so they were also defending our democracy. Unless citizens can \ncome freely into the Capitol building and meet with their elected \nSenators and Representatives, our democracy and our freedoms are \ngreatly diminished. Special Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut \nunderstood this, and with professionalism and dedication, they served \nCongress well and served the country well too.\n  It is fitting that these two brave men will lie in state tomorrow in \nthe Capitol building where they gave their lives. They made the \nultimate sacrifice to protect us, and we will forever owe them and \ntheir families a debt of deep gratitude.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out especially to the Gibson and Chestnut \nfamilies. My family too has suffered the sudden loss of loved ones, and \nI know that there is no greater tragedy, no greater sadness for a \nfamily.\n  Special Agent Gibson is a son of Massachusetts, and we were all \nespecially proud of him. He loved his family, his country, his church, \nand his Capitol. Our hearts go out to his wife Lynn and his three \nchildren during this very difficult time of loss.\n  Officer Chestnut, too, was well known by anyone who entered the \nDocument Room door. He was always friendly to everyone, and was a \nconsummate professional in the conduct of his duties. I join Wendy and \nthe rest of Officer Chestnut's family in mourning his loss.\n  We cannot help but be angry at the senseless act that led to the \ndeath of these two extraordinary officers. One minute, the Capitol \nbuilding is full of the people's business--with debates and meetings \nand visitors from across the country in this great and open symbol of \nour free government. The next minute, the nation was shocked to learn \nthe news that a man who had no business possessing a handgun had taken \nthe lives of these officers in two brutal acts that shocked the \nconscience of Congress and the country.\n  In the days ahead, we will consider what steps may be taken to ensure \na secure--and yet open--Capitol. I hope Congress will also consider \nfurther actions to keep guns out of the hands of those who so easily \nmisuse them. As we saw on Friday, our failure to do so leads to tragedy \nfar too often.\n  The Gibson and Chestnut families know that all of us in Congress \nembrace them at this sad time. The nation loves them. We are grateful \nfor their extraordinary service, and saddened by their tragic \nsacrifice.\n  Mr. President, on Saturday, at Andrews Air Force Base, President \nClinton spoke eloquently and movingly about the loss of these two brave \nofficers. I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Remarks of President Clinton, July 25, 1998\n\n       Good morning. The shooting at the United States Capitol \n     yesterday was a moment of savagery at the front door of \n     American civilization. Federal law enforcement agencies and \n     the United States Attorneys' office are working closely with \n     the D.C. Police and the Capitol Police to ensure that justice \n     is pursued.\n       Meanwhile, I would ask all Americans to reflect for a \n     moment on the human elements of yesterday's tragedy. The \n     scripture says ``greater love hath no man than this, that he \n     lay down his life for his friends.''\n       Officer Jacob ``J.J.'' Chestnut and Detective John Gibson \n     laid down their lives for their friends, their co-workers and \n     their fellow citizens--those whom they were sworn to protect. \n     In so doing, they saved many others from exposure to lethal \n     violence.\n       Every day, a special breed of men and women pin on their \n     badges, put on their uniforms, kiss their families good-bye, \n     knowing full well they may be called on to lay down their \n     lives. This year alone 79 other law enforcement officers have \n     made the ultimate sacrifice. Every American should be \n     grateful to them, for the freedom and the security they guard \n     with their lives. And every American should stand up for them \n     and stand against violence.\n\n[[Page S9035]]\n\n       Officer Chestnut was a Vietnam veteran, a member of the \n     Capitol Police for 18 years, just months away from \n     retirement.\n       Detective Gibson was a deeply religious man, beloved by his \n     co-workers and, being from Massachusetts, devoted to the Red \n     Sox and the Bruins.\n       Both leave behind loving wives and children, the affection \n     of neighbors, friends and co-workers, and the deep gratitude \n     of those who are alive today because of their bravery.\n       In this one heartless act, there were many acts of heroism, \n     by strangers who shielded children with their bodies, by \n     officers who fanned across the Capitol, by Dr. Bill Frist, a \n     renowned heart surgeon before his election to the Senate from \n     Tennessee, who had just put down his gavel, when he rushed to \n     tend the injured.\n       To all these and others, who stood for our common humanity, \n     we extend the thanks of our nation.\n       To the families of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, \n     nothing we say can bring them back. But all Americans pray \n     that the power of a loving God, and the comfort of family and \n     friends, will with time ease your sorrow and swell your pride \n     for loved ones and the sacrifice they made for their fellow \n     citizens.\n       To Angela Dickerson, the young woman who was injured in the \n     shooting, we extend our prayers and hope for your speedy \n     recovery.\n       To every American who has been shaken by this violent act, \n     to the millions of parents who have taken your children \n     through those very same doors, I ask you to think about what \n     our Capitol means. All around the world, that majestic marble \n     building is the symbol of our democracy and the embodiment of \n     our nation. We must keep it a place where people can freely \n     and proudly walk the halls of their government. And we must \n     never, ever take for granted the values for which it stands, \n     or the price of preserving them.\n\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been honored to serve here in the \nSenate for 22 years. I have to say that, to a person, our Capitol Hill \nPolice are terrific human beings; to a person, they are dedicated to \ntheir jobs and they want to do the best they can. Frankly, without \nthem, I think this place would not run anywhere near as well as it \ndoes. To a person, those of us who knew John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut \nhave to say these are two of the finest who have ever served on Capitol \nHill. These are people for whom everybody should have a sense of deep \ngratitude. They gave their lives as a last full measure of devotion so \nthat many others might live.\n  It is a shame that we have people who violate the law and who may be \nemotionally disturbed and do things like this. And it is an absolute \ncatastrophe and tragedy for the families of these two fine men. Our \nhearts go out to them. Elaine and I have them in our prayers, as I know \nother Members of Congress and Members of the Senate do as well. These \nwere two fine men--always courteous, always looking out for not only \nthe Members as they came in and out of those doors and in and out of \nthe Capitol, but for every citizen who came to the People's House time \nafter time--and millions of them do. Both of them had long tenures here \nand both served every day of those tenures with distinction.\n  Mr. President, I want to personally express my gratitude to these men \nfor the sacrifice they have made, and to their families for the \nsacrifice that they have made. I am sure the families will be taken \ncare of. I hope we will do some good for them and that they will \nrealize how deeply we all feel about the sacrifice that these two brave \nmen gave for us.\n  Mr. President, this is one of the great spots on this Earth. It is \nvisited by millions of people. It means so much to those of us who \nserve in this building. We are vulnerable to people who are emotionally \ndisturbed or who may be terrorists. We are vulnerable to people who are \ninsensitive to the needs of those who serve here. On the other hand, \nevery one of us feels it to be such a privilege to serve in these two \ngreat bodies, in this separate branch of government that means so much \nto the people. We could not serve very well, nor could we accomplish \nvery much if it weren't for the sacrifices of all of our people here on \nCapitol Hill who work so hard--like John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut.\n  Again, Mr. President, I pray to our Father in Heaven that the \nfamilies of these two heroes will be comforted and cared for. As a \nNation, we are deeply grateful for their service. God bless those who \nremain that we all might keep in remembrance the sacrifice of these two \nfine men.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a special moment in the history of \nthis body. I wanted to be heard for a very brief moment on what \nhappened in the last few days here in this building. I guess it is \ncustomary, when you work in a building for many years, to get used to \nit and not to be stirred by it, but not this building. For 16 years, it \nhas been my honor to serve in the House and the Senate, and I can tell \nyou that as I walk up to this building still in daylight, or in the \nmiddle of the night, it still has a special impact on me, as it does on \nso many Americans. There have been those who have come before us, and \nmy colleague from West Virginia, who is a historian of this body, \nremembers, I'm sure, better than most that when President Lincoln was \nengaged in the Civil War, we were in the process of building the great \nwhite dome that we now see on the top of this Capitol Building.\n  People came to him, and said, ``Mr. President, we can't continue this \nconstruction. We have a war to fight.'' He said, ``No. We will continue \nthis construction. We will build this dome during the war as a symbol \nof what this Nation will be after the war; that it will be united \nagain; and that this building will be the symbol of that unity.''\n  President Lincoln had it right. As you reflect on this building and \nwhat it means to so many of us, you have to also reflect on its \nhistory.\n  This is not the first act of violence in this building. It is not the \nfirst time that lives were lost, or that blood was shed.\n  The British invaded this building and came up the spiral staircase. \nDuring the Civil War, the Union troops who had been felled in battle \nwere brought here and laid in the Rotunda in a hospital where they were \ntreated. In the 1950s, a group of terrorists took control of the \nChamber of the House for a few brief minutes, firing pistols on the \nfloor and injuring people. In 1983, just outside this Chamber, there \nwas a bomb that was detonated late at night. We have never discovered \nthe cause of that bombing. And then, of course, the tragic incident \nwhich occurred last Friday involving one very troubled, disturbed \nindividual who took two lives and injured another person.\n  I guess each of us who walk in the door of the Capitol each day take \nfor granted the warm greeting and the smile from the Capitol Police, \nand forget that it is more than just a responsibility to greet. It is a \nresponsibility to protect that brings them to this building. Like so \nmany Senators, I came to take that for granted. You think it is always \ngoing to be safe and that they will never need to take the pistols from \ntheir holsters, or use them. And yet last Friday that all changed.\n  When I came to this building today and walked in the entrance and saw \nthe Capitol policeman at his post, I looked at him in a different way, \nunderstanding that he was doing more than just his duty. He was \nprotecting me and thousands of others who come to this building.\n  In behalf of John Gibson and Mr. Chestnut, J.J. Chestnut, my \nsympathies go out, on behalf of the people of Illinois and all of my \nfriends and my staff, to their families. To think that they have left \nbehind eight children who now should be cared for, and I hope all of us \nwill join in that effort to make certain that that occurs--and that \ntheir family goes through this period of mourning understanding that \nthey do not stand alone, that we stand with them shoulder to shoulder \nin gratitude for what they have given us. Because what they have given \nus is something we all hope to bring to this building--to bring more \nhonor to this building, to the people who work here, and to the great \ntradition in history of the U.S. Capitol. We do it in our daily \nactivities, in our speeches, in our conduct. What these men have done \nis to give their lives in the service to that great tradition and that \ngreat history.\n  There will be another time and another place when we will talk about \nhow this tragedy might have been averted with better security measures, \nor better efforts in terms of the control of guns, or keeping guns out \nof the\n\n[[Page S9036]]\n\nhands of those who should not have them. But let's save that debate for \nanother day. Let us close this debate with fond memory of the \ncontributions made by these two men, and with gratitude not only to \nthem but to all of the men and women who protect our lives in law \nenforcement, and particularly those on the Capitol Hill Police Force.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing their shock, dismay, and most significantly, sorrow at the \ntragic events that unfolded not far from this chamber last Friday.\n  The killing of a police officer is always a disturbing event as a \nmortal attack on a law enforcement officer is also an attack on society \nat large. After all, it is those men and women who are sworn law \nenforcement officers who stand between the law abiding citizens of the \nUnited States and those elements within our society that seek to do \nharm. Being any sort of law enforcement officer is a thankless job \nfraught with danger, two facts that it is sometimes easy to forget.\n  The deaths of Capitol Police Officers Jacob Chestnut, known as J.J., \nand John Gibson not only remind us of just how dangerous a profession \nlaw enforcement is, but also of the admiration we have for those who \nprotect us. What makes their deaths all the more disturbing is that \nthey were attacked in the United States Capitol, a place that is more \nthan an office building; it is a symbol of our Nation. What makes their \ndeaths all the more saddening is that being of close interaction each \nof us has with Capitol Police Officers, we have come to think of these \nmen and women as much more than simply protectors, we have come to view \nthem as friends.\n  Since its founding in 1828, the United States Capitol Police and its \nofficers have worked, largely in anonymity, to protect Members of \nCongress, their staffs, the Capitol, and all those who visit this \nmagnificent building. They are a force that carries out its \nresponsibilities professionally and effectively, and they manage to \nbring credible security and protection to one of the most publicly \naccessible places in the world. Last Friday, fate forced Officers \nGibson and Chestnut to shed their anonymity in the most tragic and \nbrutal of manners, but the manner in which they put duty and aiding \nothers above personal safety is a credit to not only each of them, but \nto all the members of the United States Capitol Police. The members of \nthe South Carolina Congressional Delegation feel a special sense of \ngrief as ``J.J.'' Chestnut was both a native of Myrtle Beach, South \nCarolina and a 20-year veteran of the United States Air Force who \nretired as a Master Sergeant\n  Many have likened Capitol Hill to a small town, as this is a place \nwhere people know each other, stop to talk, and where there is true \nsense of congeniality and hospitality. That spirit is certainly evident \nin the outpouring of grief, support, and sympathy we are seeing for \nthese two slain officers. Sadly, no amount of expressed condolences or \nhigh praise will bring these two brave men back to their families and \nloved ones. I thin, however, that each of us hopes that these \nexpressions will convey the high regard we hold for these two men, and \nour inexpressible gratitude that Officers Chestnut and Gibson were on \nduty. Their actions truly saved the day and they will no doubt forever \nbe remembered as ``heroes.''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as with everyone in Congress and the \nnation, my thoughts today are with the victims of Friday's shooting and \ntheir families. And like many of my colleagues, I wish to pay tribute \nto the heroism of Capitol Police officers Jacob Chestnut and John \nGibson and to mourn their passing.\n  This is a terrible time for the Congress and the nation. It reminds \nme, Mr. President, of having to write the families of dead comrades in \nWorld War II. How does one summarize the achievements and meaning of \ntwo lifetimes in a short letter or brief remarks? How does one do \njustice to men who gave the last full measure of devotion that others \nmight live? Consoling the families of the dead and doing justice to the \nultimate sacrifices and nobility of heroes is never easy. It is \nparticularly hard in time of peace, when we take our safety and \nsecurity for granted.\n  But even in peace time, Mr. President, unfathomable evil exists and \nthreatens to shatter our security at any moment. Officers Chestnut and \nGibson knew that the price of our safety here in the Capitol was their \nunceasing vigilance; and they showed us that even in peace time, the \nheroism of brave and selfless individuals like them often is all that \nenables us to live in freedom and work in safety. It is easy to forget \nthis; but we must not forget, and Friday's events ensure that we will \nnot forget. Officer Chestnut, a South Carolina native who served with \ndistinction in the Air Force for many years, would not want us to \nforget. He knew the price of freedom, and he was willing to give his \nlife for his fellow citizens.\n  Who knows how many lives officer Gibson saved by confronting the \ngunman, Russell Weston, outside the office of Representative Tom DeLay? \nWho knows how many tourists and staffers would have died were it not \nfor the bravery and heroism not only of officers Gibson and Chestnut \nbut of all the Capitol Police?\n  Friday's shootings were a reminder that all of us who live and work \non Capitol Hill owe an unpayable debt to the Capitol Police. The brave \nmen and women of that force put their lives on the line for us every \ntime they put on a uniform. It is their job to stand between us and \nharm's way, and they perform it with unceasing devotion and consummate \nprofessionalism. We should all give thanks to God that we are protected \nby these officers. And we should realize that it is thanks to their \nzealous devotion to duty that we live in freedom from constant fear and \ndanger.\n  For those of us who see the Capitol Police every day, it is easy to \nforget they are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. Officers \nChestnut and Gibson were not only exemplary guardians of the public \nsafety--they also were dedicated and loving family men. Each leaves \nbehind a wife and three children. These shattered homes are the legacy \nof one lunatic's senseless violence.\n  Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson's heroic deaths are all the more \npainful for the loss their families will forever feel. We whom they \ndied to protect can only hope that the nobility of their sacrifice and \nthe priceless ideal for which they gave their lives--not us, but \nfreedom and democratic government--will be of some small comfort to \ntheir families.\n  I join with all Americans today in offering my deepest thanks to \nthese men, my condolences to their families, and my promise that their \nsacrifice will not be forgotten.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to two Capitol \nPolice officers, two heroes, who last Friday gave their lives in the \nline of duty while serving their country, Detective John Gibson and \nOfficer Jacob Chestnut.\n  Last Friday's shocking and senseless violence in the halls of the \nU.S. Capitol both saddened our nation and took the lives of two of our \nfinest. I would like to take a moment to share a few memories and \nthoughts about the two slain officers.\n  About a month ago, in late June, I had the chance to start a new \nfriendship with a good man. I had the pleasure to get to know John \nGibson, not just as a able and dedicated detective, but also as a \ngentleman and dedicated family man.\n  During our time together, I learned that we shared common values and \na similar hobby. As a former deputy sheriff myself, it quickly became \nevident that Detective Gibson and I shared an understanding of the \ndaily perils facing law enforcement officers.\n  Detective Gibson and I also discovered that we both shared the rather \nunique hobby of collecting police patches. In fact, just last month I \nsent him several police arm patches from Colorado to add to his \ncollection as a small token of my appreciation for his dedicated \nservice.\n  I understand that it was Detective John Gibson's final shot, his \nfinal act as a defender of the peace, that brought the gunman down and \nended the violent rampage. The Detective's steadfast valor, while \nalready having been shot several times, was the difference that saved \nmany lives. We all owe him a deep debt of gratitude.\n  Officer Jacob Chestnut was posted at the Document Door entrance on \nthe Capitol's East Front. Officers posted to\n\n[[Page S9037]]\n\nthis entrance are the first faces that many tourists see when they come \nto visit the Capitol. Officer Chestnut's post, which involves achieving \na delicate balance between the ensuring safety of those who visit the \nCapitol while keeping the People's House as free and open as possible, \nrequires a very special combination of hospitality, humor, patience and \nprofessionalism. To his credit, Officer Chestnut excelled in this \nendeavor.\n  If it had not been for the heroic actions of these two brave \nofficers, this dangerous gunman would almost certainly have killed many \nmore innocent people. The officer's ultimate sacrifice saved lives. I \nextend my deepest sympathies to the families of these two fallen \nheroes.\n  This building, the U.S. Capitol, is far more than just a building, it \nis a living monument to freedom and democracy. It is perhaps the only \nbuilding on earth that simultaneously houses a healthy democracy at \nwork, while standing as a tribute to freedom that attract millions of \nvisitors from all over the U.S. and the entire world each year. The \nchambers, galleries and halls of our Capitol are full of statues, \nbusts, paintings and displays that commemorate heroes and key events in \nour nation's history. The men and women honored under this magnificent \ndome have served their country in a wide variety of ways. Some have \nbeen great visionaries and statesmen. Some have been leaders in science \nor adventurers, like Colorado's son, astronaut Jack Swaggered whose \nstatute stands in these halls. Each of these heroes has contributed and \nsacrificed in his or her own very real and personal way.\n  Some of these heroes have made the greatest sacrifice for their \nnation, giving their lives. Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob \nChestnut have joined this honored rank. They gave their lives for their \nnation while protecting our nation's Capitol, and it is fitting that \nthey will lie in honor in the Capitol's Rotunda while a grateful nation \npays its respects.\n  Not only is the Capitol the American people's house, it stands as a \nbright beacon of hope to all of the world's freedom loving people. \nWhile traveling this building's halls, I have been regularly awed by \nthe comments of visitors from other countries as they comment in \nastonishment how open and free this building is. They state how they \nwould never be allowed to walk so freely through the halls of their own \ncapital buildings back home in their respective countries. This is an \nimportant part of what makes America great.\n  Whenever I have heard such sentiments, I am reminded of just how \nfortunate I am, and we all are, to be Americans. Our Capitol is the \nPeople's House, and it must remain open and accessible to all.\n  Thanks to the sacrifices of Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob \nChestnut, and the dedication and professionalism of the entire U.S. \nCapitol Police force, our nation's Capitol building is freely \naccessible and continues to serve as a beacon of freedom.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, today, we mourn the loss in our Capitol \nfamily of two brave men who gave their lives in service to our nation.\n  Last Friday, in a running gun battle, United States Capitol Police \nOfficer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson were killed in \nthe line of duty.\n  Mr. President, each of us who works in the Capitol feels a kinship to \nand a deep appreciation of the officers of the U.S. Capitol Police. We \nknow that our lives are protected each and every day by the work that \nthey do. In the twenty-four years that I have served Ohio as Senator, I \nhave come to know many of the fine officers on the force. A former \nmember of my staff is currently a member of the force and other staff \nmembers have officers among their immediate family members.\n  This highly trained and professional force polices our nation's \nCapitol and performs numerous law enforcement duties as they monitor \nthe entrances of our buildings, ensure the safety of the millions of \ntourists who visit the Capitol each year, and provide a kind word and a \nwatchful eye as we come and go. These officers go about their duties \nwith dedication and great skill.\n  In a senseless, momentary act of violence, these fine officers gave \ntheir all. They gave their lives in the defense of all who visit and \nwork here. Mr. President, we may never understand why such a tragedy \noccurred in our halls last Friday afternoon. Despite this lack of \ncomprehension, we will always be certain that J. J. Chestnut and John \nGibson fulfilled their responsibilities to our nation and will be \nremembered as heroes.\n  I think that it is a fitting tribute that these officers will lay in \nstate in the Capitol tomorrow, an appropriate commendation for the \nselfless sacrifice that they gave in the performance of their duties. \nMy wife, Annie, joins me in extending my deepest sympathy to the \nfamilies of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in \nexpressing my sincere condolences to the families of the two Capitol \nPolice officers who gave their lives last Friday defending the Capitol \nand all of us who work here, as well as the many Americans who come \nhere from around the country to see their government in action.\n  Officers J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson are American heroes in the \ntruest sense of the word. Their actions last week unquestionably \nprevented a terrible tragedy from becoming even more deadly. I know I \nspeak for every member of Congress in expressing my respect and \ngratitude to them, their families, and their colleagues on the Capitol \nPolice force.\n  At the first sign of trouble, Officers Chestnut and Gibson acted on \ninstinct, doing what they were trained to do and saving lives in the \nprocess. When an event like this happens, I think many of us react \naccording to instinct, and our instincts differ depending on the \nvarying experiences we've had.\n  As most people know by now, my colleague from Tennessee, Senator \nFrist, also acted on instinct when he heard the news of Friday's \nshootings. Upon returning to his office from speaking on the Senate \nfloor and learning what had happened, Senator Frist immediately called \nthe Capitol physician's office to see if they needed assistance, and \nthen rushed over to the scene of the shootings to lend a hand however \nhe could. He assisted in treating one of the two fallen police \nofficers, administered CPR, made sure that he made it safely to a \nwaiting ambulance--and then went back inside to treat another of the \nvictims. After restarting this second victim's heart, he rode with him \nto D.C. General Hospital to ensure that, if paramedics had to open up \nhis chest on the way to the hospital, he would be there to provide \nassistance or do the procedure himself.\n  Mr. President, Senator Frist's actions are both a reminder of the \nvery different routes each of us took in coming to the United States \nSenate, and of the importance of preserving the diversity of \nbackgrounds that we have in this body. His instinct as a heart surgeon \nand trauma specialist took over last Friday, and he rushed to the scene \nto provide whatever help he could--just as he's done hundreds of times \nbefore when patients were relying on him.\n  I want to take this opportunity to salute my colleague from Tennessee \nfor his heroic actions last Friday, and for all of the other times he's \nprovided medical assistance since coming to the Senate three and a half \nyears ago. Many people will remember that a couple of years ago, one of \nour constituents, a man from Cleveland, Tennessee, had a heart attack \nin the Dirksen Building, just outside of Senator Frist's office. \nSenator Frist immediately came to the rescue, and saved this \nTennessean's life. Now that's what I call constituent service.\n  Mr. President, the events of last Friday have affected all of us very \ndeeply. We will not soon get over the memory of the tragedy that \noccurred inside ``the people's house'' or of the heroic sacrifice made \nby Officers Chestnut and Gibson. Again, I want to offer to their \nfamilies and Capitol Police colleagues our sincere condolences and our \ndeepest thanks.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the U.S. Capitol Police--so ubiquitous, \nso steady, so utterly competent. We take them for granted. Yet every \nday they defend us, our families, our staff, millions of tourists, \nready to lay down their lives. Last Friday, two of them did: Officer \nJacob J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, each an 18-year veteran, \neach married, each with children. One in the prime of life; the other, \na few short months from retirement. What a tragedy.\n\n[[Page S9038]]\n\n  The fact of the matter is that what happened on Friday could happen \nat any instant. One never knows when. In the crucible of a gun battle, \nChestnut, Gibson, and other Capitol Police officers performed their \nduty in the most exemplary fashion. Chestnut and Gibson made the \nultimate sacrifice, laying down their lives to defend others. We can \nonly speculate how many bystanders would have been killed, if not for \ntheir--and the other officers'--quick and appropriate actions.\n  To the wives and children, other family members, and friends and \ncolleagues of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, our words cannot \nassuage your grief. But perhaps there is some solace in knowing that \nthese fine two men, killed in the line of duty, have died the most \nhonorable deaths, defending the United States Congress and its most \nsacred building. They are heroes. Remember, as Pindar wrote, that ``the \nbright gleam of noble deeds moves on with undying voice, ever \nunquenchable.'' And as you struggle to be brave in the days and weeks \nahead, know that courage is marked not by the absence of fear, but \nrather by the presence of faith. May God be with you, and may God be \nwith J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I join my colleagues and our fellow \ncitizens all across this country in honoring the memories of Detective \nJohn Gibson and Private First Class Jacob Chestnut. These two fine law \nenforcement officers gave their lives in the line of duty during a \ntragedy on Friday, July 24, 1998, while guarding the United States \nCapitol. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of these two \nfine gentlemen.\n  The United States Capitol is recognized the world over as the symbol \nof American freedom and of the still revolutionary idea that citizens \nconfer power upon those who serve us in government. That it could \nbecome the scene of so heinous an act as this cannot but shake us from \nthe complacency by which we sometimes take this all for granted.\n  But on a beautiful summer day and with thousands of ordinary people \nin sight, Officers Chestnut and Gibson gave their lives as proof that \neveryday, in places as near as our Capitol and as far away as seven \nseas, men and women serve selflessly to protect the freedom that is the \nAmerican birthright and the dream of millions around the globe.\n  I commend the United States Capitol Police, the D.C. Metropolitan \nPolice, and the other law enforcement agencies that have performed so \nprofessionally throughout this difficult period. They are a continuing \ntribute to their fallen comrades, and I trust that they will be \ninspired to serve on in their memory.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jacob J. \nChestnut and John M. Gibson, Capitol Police officers who were \ntragically killed in the line of duty on Friday.\n  Officers Chestnut and Gibson were decent and highly capable law \nenforcement professionals. On Friday, their selfless devotion to duty \nsaved countless lives. Their deaths were not in vain.\n  The service of these Capitol Police officers will not be forgotten by \nthe Congress. In particular, I will always remember the spirit and good \nhumor brought to this job by J.J. Chestnut, whom I knew personally from \nyears of working together here at the Capitol. This institution has \nknown few, if any, who were more friendly and able protectors.\n  On this day of reflection, I think it is important to note that \nincidents such as occurred on Friday do not happen every day precisely \nbecause Gibson, Chestnut, and other Capitol Police officers have done \ntheir jobs so well. Even as they stood their ground and gave their \nlives, Gibson and Chestnut demonstrated that attacks on this building \nand the Members and staff who work here will simply not succeed.\n  Mr. President, every day of their careers here on the Hill, Chestnut \nand Gibson provided a unique and important service to every American. \nBy protecting the United States Congress, they made it possible for our \nNation's legislature and our county's greatest public building to be \nopen and accessible to the American people. American democracy could \nnot function as it does in the sunlight of public scrutiny, engagement, \nand participation if not for the safety provided by Gibson and \nChestnut. If for this reason alone, every American owes these \nofficers--and everyone serving in the United States Capitol Police--a \ndeep debt of gratitude.\n  It is difficult for those of us who knew these officers to let them \ngo easily, but certainly nowhere as trying as this loss has been for \ntheir families. With our friends and colleagues here in the Senate and \nmillions of Americans throughout our country, my wife Lucy and I will \nbe sure to keep the families of Chestnut and Gibson in our thoughts and \nprayers. It is my understanding that a scholarship fund is being \nestablished in their honor, and I would urge every Member and staff \nmember to contribute.\n  Mr. President, I think the most important message we can deliver here \ntoday is one of thanks. Officers John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut made \nthe ultimate sacrifice: they laid down their lives so that others could \nlive. For that, they deserve our unending gratitude and respect. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to take time out of our busy \nschedule to recognize the bravery and valor of U.S. Capitol Police \nOfficers John M. Gibson and Jacob J. Chestnut. These two fine officers \nwere killed in the line of duty while protecting our Nation's Capitol \nbuilding and protecting those who pass through this great building. \nThey died fulfilling their sworn duty to protect the public, and they \ndid so in an exemplary way. They are heroes who saved many lives by \ntheir actions.\n  I remember a period of time after the World Trade Center bombing in \nNew York in 1993 when law enforcement officials informed me of threats \nagainst my life. The Capitol Police quickly formed a detail for my \nprotection. Officer Gibson was a member of this detail. I feel a \npersonal loss. This man was willing to lay down his life for mine and, \nin fact, he did for others.\n  Tomorrow we will pay homage to their memory as they lay in honor \nbeneath the majestic Rotunda in the very building in which they gave \ntheir lives to protect.\n  The thoughts and prayers of this great body, as well as that of the \nNation, goes out to the families and friends of Officers Gibson and \nChestnut.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words \nabout the tragedy that occurred last Friday here in the Capitol. As all \nthe world now knows, the heart of our democracy was invaded that day by \na gunman who opened fire in an area crowded with tourists. Before the \nmelee was over, two Capitol Police officers were dead and an innocent \nbystander was wounded.\n  Even before Friday's events, every Member of this Congress was well \naware of how critical the Capitol Police are to the functioning of our \ndemocracy. We are here to do the people's business, but the sad fact is \nthat there are those--both at home and abroad--who do not wish us well \nin our efforts. Instead of the free exchange of ideas central to the \nconcept of democracy, some of those individuals would, if given the \nchance, express their views through bullets and explosives. The only \nthing that stands between those individuals and the daily practice of \nour democratic ideals is the Capitol Police. They are nothing less than \nthe guardians of those ideals--for what meaning would such principles \nhave if they could not be safely exercised?\n  On Friday, Officer John Gibson and Officer Jacob J. Chestnut \nsacrificed their lives defending those principles. An 18-year veteran \nof the force, Officer Chestnut was serving that day as the Capitol's \nfirst line of defense, manning the metal detector designed to keep \ninstruments of violence out of these halls. When the gunman set off the \nalarm, Officer Chestnut immediately responded, but, tragically, was \nmortally wounded before he could stop the intruder. Officer Gibson, \nalso an 18-year member of the force, performed several acts of bravery \nbefore his death, pushing a French tourist out of harm's way, hiding a \ncongressional staff member under a desk, ensuring that Representative \nTom DeLay and members of his staff were hidden from danger, and then \nhelping to bring down the gunman in the battle that ultimately cost his \nlife. Before he died, Officer Gibson singlehandedly kept the\n\n[[Page S9039]]\n\ngunman out of Representative DeLay's office and, in so doing, saved the \nlives of both the Congressman and his staff.\n\n  Those of us who work here--the Senators, the Representatives, the \nstaff members, the Capitol Police--have lost two members of our \ncongressional family. But it is not only those who work and visit the \nCapitol who owe an unrepayable debt to those officers--every citizen of \nthe United States is indebted to them. For Officers Chestnut and Gibson \ndied defending an institution that is the very embodiment of all the \ndemocratic freedoms that we Americans hold dear.\n  Mr. President, our democracy does not exist in a vacuum; it functions \nin a very dangerous world. For that reason, a system of security has \nbeen established in the Capitol to try to insulate the Congress from \nthose who would do it harm while guaranteeing that we remain accessible \nto the people we serve. On Friday, that system worked. This is ``the \npeople's house,'' and each year we welcome roughly four million people \nto it. That is precisely the way it should be. This Capitol--the \ngreatest symbol of democracy of the greatest democratic republic the \nworld has ever known, a building aptly described by President Clinton \nas ``the front door of American civilization''--belongs to the people \nof the United States, and it must always be open to them. I do not \noppose calls for tighter security, but I would take issue with any \nmeasure that would make it more difficult for the American people to \nvisit ``their house.''\n  Mr. President, I am the daughter and sister of police officers. I \nknow the terrible fear that every law enforcement officer's family \nendures--the fear that when their loved one departs for work, he or she \nmay never return home. It is my good fortune that, throughout my life, \nI have never seen that fear materialize. Therefore, I cannot claim to \nhave any concept of what the families of Officers Gibson and Chestnut \nare going through right now. Nevertheless, I want to express my \nheartfelt sorrow to them. Our prayers are with you and the entire \nnation will forever be grateful for the heroism and sacrifice that your \nloved ones made on our behalf.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the two \nCapitol Police Officers who gave their lives to protect members of \nCongress, their staffs and visitors from throughout the world during \nlast Friday's tragic shooting at the United States Capitol.\n  For those of us who work in the Capitol, Special Agent John Gibson \nand Officer Jacob Chestnut were among the people who are part of our \ndaily lives. And over the twenty years I have served in Congress, I've \nbeen constantly impressed with their courteous manner and their \nfriendliness and the way they know all of us by name, all the while \nmaintaining the highest degree of professionalism in carrying out their \nsolemn duties. They become extensions of our staffs, and they become \nour friends.\n  Sometimes, in the commotion of everyday life around here, it is easy \nto forget that each new day brings the potential for unknown dangers \nfor these brave men and women. The fact is, those assigned to protect \nthe sanctity and safety of the U.S. Capitol put themselves in harms way \non a daily basis, and three days ago, two of them came to work in the \nmorning never to return to the lives and families they loved.\n  It is difficult for us to understand how a day which began like so \nmany other summer days here on Capitol Hill could so suddenly end in \nviolence and terror. Here beneath this dome of marble and stone; here \nbehind these historic walls; and here at the epicenter of the world's \ngreatest democracy; we feel somehow that such heinous acts are simply \ntoo incongruous with our noble surroundings to be possible. And yet, \nhistory and reality tell us they are, in fact, all too possible.\n  It vividly brings back to me one such incident fifteen years ago, \nwhen I was in the House of Representatives. My future husband, \nCongressman Jock McKernan, and I were standing with others on the House \nfloor when, right above us, two officers tackled a man brandishing a \nbomb in the House gallery. These two men unhesitatingly put the safety \nof the entire House chamber before their own, without questioning the \ndanger they faced.\n  Such was the case last Friday--as certainly more would have been \ninjured or killed had it not been for the willingness of Special Agent \nGibson and Officer Chestnut to put their lives on the line. Their \nactions not only prevented what could have been an even greater \ncatastrophe, but sent a message to those who would violate the people's \nhouse that they will never prevail.\n  During what I know is the most difficult of times for the families of \nAgent Gibson and Officer Chestnut, I hope it will be at least some \nmeasure of comfort for them to know that so many here and across \nAmerica are keeping them in their thoughts and prayers. The entire \nnation shares in their sense of loss, and our hearts go out to the \nloved ones that these brave individuals have left behind.\n  I also want to extend my sympathies to all the men and women of the \nCapitol Police force. They have lost two of their finest--men whose \nactions under the most dire circumstances have brought tremendous \ncredit to the Capitol Police. As members of the force go about their \nvital duties, I want them to know that they have our fullest support, \ntrust, and appreciation for all they do to keep us safe.\n  Last Friday's shootings stunned the nation and affected us all in \nvery personal ways. For those of us here on Capitol Hill, we lost two \nmembers of our family. And in Maine and throughout the country, people \nfelt a sense of outrage that this symbol of freedom of democracy--the \ngreatest public building in the country--would be stained with the mark \nof violence.\n  Today, let us as a country be grateful that people like Special Agent \nJohn Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut are willing to make the ultimate \nsacrifice so that this building will always remain the people's house. \nLet us mourn their loss, celebrate their lives, and never forget their \ncourageous deeds on behalf of all the citizens of our great Nation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, all of America mourns the loss of two brave \nCapitol Police Officers--John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut. We will never \nunderstand the senseless violence that took their lives, never be able \nto explain why two fine men who loved their families have been stolen \naway from their wives and children. But we know for certain that \nSpecial Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut made the ultimate sacrifice \nin the line of duty.\n  It has become almost cliched to say that Congress is the ``people's \nhouse.'' What many forgot, though, until last Friday, is that John \nGibson and Jacob Chestnut were two very real people who kept the \npeople's house safe for over a million visitors and thousands of staff \nmembers in the Capitol each year. Members of Congress know the Capitol \npolice as men and women who come to work each day to protect us. We see \nthem every morning and late into the night. We spend free moments in \nthe hallways and off the Senate floor talking with them--talking about \nfamily, the score of last night's ball-game, the weather, and, of \ncourse, the prospects of getting home for the weekend. There is a \nspecial bond between us, those who are elected to serve here for a \nperiod of time and those who put on a uniform to serve in a different \nway. It is a bond of public service, a common purpose too often \noverlooked in the hustle and bustle of everyday life in Washington.\n  This remains a country where we allow the media spotlight and our \ncollective imagination to transform our public figures into heroes. \nJohn Gibson and Jacob Chestnut require no exaggeration or rhetorical \nenlargement to be seen as something above and beyond the ordinary. They \nare--quite simply--and will be, forever--heroes.\n  John Gibson was a native of Massachusetts who, although he made his \ncareer here in Washington and his home in the suburbs of Northern \nVirginia, never left his allegiance to Massachusetts--or to the Boston \nRed Sox--behind. John Gibson cherished his Waltham accent and his deep \nroots in our state. He carried with him, everywhere, the values \ninstilled in him in Waltham. He is remembered by those who knew him as \nthe kind of husband and father who never went anywhere--not even on a \nroutine errand to the corner store--without one of his children happily \nin tow. John Gibson served with total dedication to protect \nRepresentative Tom DeLay, and died because his commitment, when tested \nunder fire, remained resolute. I want to extend my\n\n[[Page S9040]]\n\ndeepest condolences to John Gibson's family, to his wife and their \nthree children, Kristen, John, and Daniel, and to the Moakley clan \nwhich is mourning John's loss. John Gibson became a part of \nMassachusett's biggest extended political family when he married Joe \nMoakley's niece, Evelyn. Whether debating Boston College football or \nsharing Irish stories in the afternoon, John Gibson was a special \nfriend to the dean of our congressional delegation. Even in his \nsadness, Congressman Moakley knows that the young man from Waltham who \njoined the Capitol police force 18 years ago, served as a professional \nwho took his sense of duty to heart.\n  Jacob Chestnut, too, died as he lived--giving selflessly of himself \nto help others. The tragedy on Friday made Jacob Chestnut a hero \nthroughout the country, but, long before that, he was a hero to the \ncommunity in Maryland where he made his home. Jacob Chestnut was the \nneighbor who always lent a helping hand to those who needed it, the \ngood Samaritan who expected nothing in return and served his community \nbecause it was the right thing to do do. Long before he was a hero to \nhis country, Jacob Chestnut was a role-model to his children and \ngrandchildren.\n\n  One never knows how one will react under fire, how, when the shots \nring out and the adrenaline flows--at the moment when duty calls--one \nwill call upon the inner strength to react with bravery. It requires a \ndegree of courage found in the deepest reserves of the human character. \nEvery police officer in this country chooses to serve with the \nknowledge that the day may come when that commitment will be tested. \nJohn Gibson told a friend--just a week before he was struck down at the \nCapitol--that he hoped that if that moment came, if he was called upon \nto draw his gun and defend tourists or Members of Congress or a fellow \nofficer, that he would rise to the occasion. It is a thought that \naccompanies every police officer through every step of what is at once \na dangerous and vital career. History will record that when that moment \ncame for John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut, they rose to the occasion, \nremembered their duty, and gave their lives selflessly to protect not \njust the people's house, but the people themselves who make that \nCapitol a home. For the families they left behind, for those among us \nprivileged to work with them, and for all Americans, these two officers \nwill forever be heroes.\n  Even as we pay tribute to these brave, fallen officers, we must \nremember that we are obligated to honor their memory with more than \nwords alone. There is a temptation in this country to focus only on the \nextraordinary circumstances of these tragic deaths, to remember merely \nthat John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut were fatally wounded in the \n``people's house.'' Too many commentators in the last few days have \nsaid--again and again--``can we believe that this type of violence \ncould occur in our nation's capital?'' The truth is--and police \nofficers on the front lines know this better than we can imagine--\nviolence does occur in the nation's capitol, and in our classrooms, and \nour tree-lined neighborhoods, and in homes across this country. To pay \ntribute to John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut--to truly honor them for \ntheir sacrifice--we must make clear our conviction as a nation that we \nwill not tolerate any form of violence in this country. To remember \nJohn Gibson and Jacob Chestnut in a way that lifts us all up--in a way \nthat creates a safer world for the eight children these fine men left \nbehind--we must commit ourselves to safer neighborhoods, violence-free \nschools, and communities where the sound of our children's laughter--\nnot the sound of gun shots--fills the air.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to give my condolences to the \nslain officers and their families. Both of these brave men gave their \nlives to defend innocent visitors to our Nations Capital. Both gave \ntheir lives so that the Capitol can remain a free and open institution, \nvisited by millions each year from this nation and nations of the \nworld. But for their acts of bravery, we don't know how many others may \nhave lost their lives. The entire Capitol Police Force deserves \ncongratulations, because I know there where other officers that \nassisted in bringing the situation to a close. Further, I share the \nsentiments expressed by the Majority Leader that we do everything we \ncan to insure that their families are well taken care of, I am sure \nthat is what these two brave officers would have wanted most. On behalf \nof the citizens of North Carolina, we collectively express our deep \nsorrow about this tragedy and extend our heartfelt condolences to their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

And I have sensed today that \nevery Senator and every person I have talked to has a sense of deep \nsympathy and sorrow for this event.\n  We will take every precaution to make sure that the Capitol is \nsecure, but that it remains the people's body and the people have \naccess to it.

Mr. President, today I want to advise my colleagues on the \nimplementation of the one-call notification (``call-before-you-dig'') \nlaw. This legislation, which was enacted into law as part of the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA 21), has taken \nalmost three Congresses to complete. However, this Congress was able to \naccomplish the goal, thanks to bipartisan support and lots of \ncooperation among the affected entities: pipeline, telecommunications, \ncable and electric utility companies, state one-call systems and \nnumerous others of good will.\n  Last week the Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline \nSafety announced a public meeting will be held on August 25-26. The \npurpose of this meeting is to begin organizing a process to collect \ninformation on the suggested ``best practices'' in one-call \nnotification. All affected parties--underground facility operators, \nexcavation contractors, railroads, one-call centers, states and \nmunicipalities--should participate in this meeting which will be a \njoint government-industry effort to bring together the best information \non one-call notification practices, techniques, technologies and \nenforcement processes. Information on these best practices would then \nbe shared among the various state one-call programs, in order to \nimprove performance. The ink is barely dry on the law, and already \nimplementation rulemaking has begun. This is great because this is all \nabout the public's safety.\n  This is enlightened federalism: the federal government working \ntogether with the states and the private sector to mutually decide how \nto protect our nation's vital underground infrastructure. The federal \ngovernment does not dictate to state and local governments, nor does it \ntry to fit private companies into some prescriptive regulatory scheme. \nThat never works. Results come by working together.\n  I congratulate the Senate Appropriations Committee for including a \nmodest but sufficient amount of support for implementing the one-call \nbill in the FY 1999 Transportation Appropriations bill. I hope the \nHouse appropriators will follow this lead and an agreement can be \nreached in conference for funding to be available in the coming fiscal \nyear.\n  The one-call bill, which was enacted into law, provides that general \nrevenues are to be used to improve our one-call systems. Realizing \nthere is such a long list of beneficiaries from better one-call \nnotification, this is only fair. I expect the appropriations process to \nreflect this principle of fairness and to fund this program from \ngeneral revenues.\n  We have all seen the tragedies and near tragedies that can occur when \naccidents happen at underground facilities. These accidents are \npreventable, and this law provides the surest way to present these \naccidents. I urge all affected parties to join in participating in the \nAugust 25-26 meeting to begin the cooperative, responsible process \nenvisioned in the one-call law.\n  Mr. President, I promised my good friend, former Senator Bill \nBradley, when he left the Senate that his colleagues would continue the \nlegislative effort to enact a one-call notification bill. This was \naccomplished this year. The terrible 1994 accident in Edison, New \nJersey, showed Congress the kind of accident which must be prevented. \nNow a law has been enacted that can do the job. Let's continue to work \ntogether to carry it out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9041-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9041-S9042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PUERTO RICO STATUS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, 100 years ago this past Saturday--July 25, \n1898--U.S. Major General Nelson Miles and his troops arrived on Puerto \nRico's shores to liberate the island from tyranny. On that historic \noccasion, he declared that the United States came ``bearing the banner \nof freedom . . . the fostering arm of a nation of free people, whose \ngreatest power is in justice and humanity to all those living within \nits fold.''\n  One hundred years after those valiant actions and eloquent words, the \nnearly four million people of Puerto Rico--excuse me, the United States \ncitizens of Puerto Rico--continue to wait for the fulfillment of that \npromise of justice and humanity. For the last century, they have been \ndenied the most fundamental right of a free people: the right to choose \ntheir own political destiny.\n  Mr. President, enough is enough. In the last 100 years, Puerto Ricans \nhave fought for freedom as part of the U.S. armed forces. Through their \nvibrant culture and tireless spirit, they have made invaluable and \nlasting contributions to American democracy. But they have never had a \nreal opportunity to exercise that freedom fully or enjoy the complete \nbenefits of living in that democracy. Congress must right that wrong in \n1998.\n  Make no mistake: Puerto Ricans are ready for this opportunity. In its \nquest to gain the right of political self-determination, Puerto Rico \nhas on three occasions held local plebiscites to express preferences \nfor the political options of statehood, independence, or commonwealth. \nBut since these votes were not\n\n[[Page S9042]]\n\nsanctioned by Congress, they had little more than symbolic value.\n  In 1997 and 1998, the Puerto Rican Legislature passed resolutions \nasking Congress to provide Puerto Ricans with a real opportunity to \ndetermine their political future. But our loudest action on this \nrequest has been inaction.\n  It is high time that we move forward. The 105th Congress--and others \nbefore it--has held numerous hearings. The House of Representatives \npassed its version of Puerto Rico status legislation more than four \nmonths ago. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has \nthoroughly examined the many issues surrounding Puerto Rico's self-\ndetermination. We are fully educated. The only work that remains to be \ndone are a committee mark-up and vote, Senate floor action, and a \nHouse-Senate Conference Committee.\n  Congressman Carlos Romero-Barcelo, Puerto Rico's non-voting member of \nCongress, told the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that\n\n       The unresolved dilemma of Puerto Rico's status is the \n     single most important long term issue of concern to all \n     Puerto Ricans. It permeates every aspect of our political and \n     economic life and holds our future hostage.\n\n  Mr. President, the United States does not hold innocent hostages. It \nfrees them, just as it did 100 years ago when General Miles and his \ntroops waded ashore in Puerto Rico to rescue the residents of that \nbeautiful island from tyranny.\n  In 1998, as the United States and Puerto Rico celebrate 100 years \ntogether, the U.S. Senate can decide to act as our colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives have already done.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nprovide for uniform food safety warning notification requirements, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                national uniformity for food act of 1998\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Roberts and \nseveral other Members in introducing this legislation designed to \nestablish national rules regarding standards, labeling and notification \nrequirements for foods.\n  The legislation recognizes the reality that we have a truly national \nsystem of food production, processing and distribution. Perhaps the \nmost apparent reason for a national system of rules relating to \nregulation of foods involves the economic costs associated with \ncomplying with varying state requirements. The burden of satisfying a \nnumber of different, and perhaps conflicting, requirements throughout \nthe country can be significant.\n  Another aspect of the matter, though, involves the benefits to \nconsumers. Certainly, when it comes to labeling and notification, I \nbelieve that consumers are entitled to have plenty of information that \nwill help them make sound purchasing decisions for their families. I \nbelieve there can come a point, however, when a multitude of varying \nlabeling and notification requirements can confuse consumers and be \ncounterproductive with respect to helping them make sound choices.\n  Accordingly, this bill would establish a framework for uniform \nnational rules relating to food labeling, standards and notification \nrequirements while recognizing the interest of the states in regulatory \nactivities involving food. Under the bill, states would continue to \nhave full authority in the area of food sanitation requirements. States \ncould also petition for new national standards or exemption from \nestablished national standards and could take emergency action \ninconsistent with the national standards in the case of imminent \nhazards. States would continue to have full authority to establish and \nenforce standards relating to matters on which a national standard had \nnot been set. In addition, the bill specifically identifies a number of \ntypes of labeling requirements as to which the states would continue to \nhave full authority.\n  The bill being introduced today is a sound starting point for further \ndiscussion and study, and for hearings that I hope can be scheduled \nsoon. I am sure that during this process issues and considerations will \narise that will need to be addressed in the legislation. I look forward \nto working with the Senator from Kansas and other colleagues toward \nproducing a final bill that will achieve broad support and be enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Specter, Mr. \n        Daschle, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Conrad, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Dodd, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Ford, Mr. \n        Thurmond, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2358.

Mr. President, not too long ago, the Senate returned to \nwork from celebrating the Fourth of July, Independence Day. By now, the \nflags that flew so gaily in front of our houses have long since been \nfurled or folded, tucked away in dark closets until next year. The \nbanners and bunting that adorned main streets throughout the country \nhave been taken down, and the high school band's uniforms are again \nhanging in orderly rows to await September's football games. Our \nmilitary veterans, cheered at Fourth of July parades as the legacy of \nthose proud men who wrested our freedom from the hands of Redcoats, \nhave again been put out of most people's minds until somber Veterans \nDay rolls around in November. But it is with the memory of Independence \nDay still fresh in my mind that I consider how well we as a nation \ntreat the veterans who have protected our freedoms so well.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs does a pretty good job of taking \ncare of individual veterans, despite the fact that funding for veterans \nprograms has been declining in real dollars for many years. But, like \nmost bureaucracies, the VA does not always move nimbly and with great \nprecision to identify big trends as quickly as one might like. In large \npart, that may be because the VA must depend on the even larger and \nmore cumbersome Department of Defense to provide it with the background \ninformation on what happened to our veterans while they were on active \nduty that may require the ministrations of the VA after a conflict. In \nthe case of the Persian Gulf War, the Department of Defense did not, by \nits own admission, do a very aggressive job early on in trying to get \nto the bottom of what happened in the Gulf. As a result, we have been \nengaged in a long and circular debate regarding the large numbers of \nsick Persian Gulf War veterans, and the trail that will lead us to the \nanswers to what really happened in that theater of operations is \ngrowing colder by the day.\n  Mr. President, I have been working with the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs on this issue, and I am pleased that Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Specter, and I have been able to draft a bill that will bring \nto a close a part of the debate that has been eroding the confidence of \nour soldiers in their government's support for them, and eroding the \nconfidence of our veterans that their nation cares for them. I thank my \ncolleague from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, for his courtesy in \nworking with me, and I thank Senator Specter also for his cooperation. \nThe encouragement and support offered by the Chronic Illness Research \nFoundation and the veterans service organizations, particularly the \nAmerican Legion, the National Gulf War Resources Center, Vietnam \nVeterans of America, and the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans \nCoalition, have also been critical to this joint effort. That debate is \nthe now 7-year-old argument over what really happened to our soldiers, \nsailors, and airmen during the Operation Desert Storm to make so many \nof them sick. As of March 31, 1998, there were 112,123 active and \nformer military personnel on the Department of Defense and Department \nof Veterans Affairs' Persian Gulf Registries. That is a lot of sick \npeople, and I understand that new registrants continue to sign on at a \nrate of 80 to 90 each week.\n  In the 7 years since the ``hot'' phase of that conflict ended, a fog \nof words has further obscured the fog of war that enveloped these \nmilitary men and women in its fetid, inky grasp. Panel after panel has \nbeen convened, congressional committee after congressional committee \nhas conducted hearings, report after report has been issued. Mountains \nof paper have been created. Yet, substantial, concrete action to end \nthis debate has not been taken, though many recommendations have been \nissued.\n\n  The President's own Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' \nIllnesses warned in their October 1997 final report that the \ngovernment's credibility was at stake and urged that a ``permanent, \nstatutory'' program of benefits and health care for the sick Persian \nGulf veterans be established. This bill that we have introduced today \nbegins that important work. It ends the long argument about what \nhappened in the Gulf and who might have been exposed to what, and \nfocuses on the ``now what?'' phase. This bill establishes a mechanism \nfor the National Academy of Sciences or some other comparable body to \nperiodically review the scientific and medical literature to identify \nwhat specific illnesses or diseases might arise from exposure to all of \nthose hazardous materials that were present in the Gulf or that can \notherwise be associated with service in that theater of war. The \nexperts provide the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with that list, and \nthe Secretary reviews and establishes regulations to establish those \nillnesses and diseases as service connected for the purposes of \nproviding medical care and other benefits to Gulf War veterans. The \nSecretary will also receive recommendations from the National Academy \nregarding further medical research needed to answer questions about \nillness and service in the Gulf. The Secretary, in conjunction with the \nSecretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, is \nrequested to outline a program of medical research based on those \nrecommendations and other information that may warrant further \nresearch.\n  In an effort to jump-start this review process, the bill contains a \nlengthy list of materials to which numerous government and expert \nscientific panels have suggested the Gulf veterans may have been \nexposed. This list was drawn from legislation, H.R. 4036, introduced in \nthe House of Representatives by Representative Christopher Shays and \nRepresentative Bernard Sanders of the Subcommittee on Human Resources \nof the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight after 2 years \nof hearings and review. Their tireless efforts have been invaluable. \nThis bill asks the National Academy to begin its review with that list, \nand to report within 6 months on its findings. Our concern is to \nexpedite this process with as much speed as is prudent, given the long \nwait that these veterans have already faced.\n  Remember the chiaroscuro images of that conflict--the bright sand \ninked over with grimy, oily debris, the road dust sprayed down with \noil, chemical alarms blaring, pesticides and insecticides liberally \nsprayed to keep disease-carrying insects at bay, and of men and women \npumped full of last minute vaccines and ordered to take nerve agent \npretreatment pills whenever the chemical alarms sounded. Top it all off \nwith the image of man-made thunderclouds forming over the vast \nammunition pit at Khamisiyah when U.S. troops destroyed tons of \ncaptured Iraqi shells, some unknown quantity of which was loaded with \nchemical mustard and nerve agents. It was a dirty, dirty war, \nconcentrated over a fairly compact area filled with almost 700,000 U.S. \ntroops. We can be fairly confident on the basis of many previous \nstudies that all of these listed hazards and potential hazards were \npresent in that theater of war, even though we will never be able to \nsay which hazards each individual soldier, sailor, and airman was \nexposed to and at what dosage. But wounds created by chemicals maim \njust as readily, if not as visibly, as bullets.\n\n  This situation, and this legislation addressing it, are similar to \nthe way that the terrible legacy of Agent Orange from the Vietnam War \nwas finally, agonizingly, resolved. In that case, finally, Congress \nsimply declared that we know that these herbicides were present in \ncountry in enormous quantities, but we do not know, and likely never \nwill know, precisely who may have been exposed to them and in what \ndosage. Therefore, we will simply acknowledge that if you were there \nduring the time that Agent Orange and the other similar herbicides were \nbeing used, you may well have been exposed, and if you come down with a \ndisease or illness which can be plausibly linked to that exposure, we \nwill assume that you may have gotten it as a result of that exposure \nand act accordingly.\n  It took a long time to get to that point, but it was the right thing \nto do, and it helped to restore the crisis in confidence that had \nshaken our servicemen and our veterans. The situation in the Gulf is \nhauntingly similar, a refrain from the same song. Almost\n\n[[Page S9046]]\n\n700,000 men and women were in the Gulf when the shooting started and \noperated in a fluid battlefield that included many potential hazards. \nCollection of data was not done or could not be done in a way that \nallows us to reconstruct every nuance of that situation 7 years later. \nEven veterans medical records are not as complete as we would now like \nthem to be. So we find ourselves in a chicken soup of possibilities, \ndebating endlessly about whether this pea or this carrot or this piece \nof meat was here or there in the soup at any point in time, when really \nall we know is that all the ingredients for a soup were in the pot. So, \nlet us stop analyzing that broth at the expense of taking any further \naction and get on with turning it into a restorative and nourishing \nbalm for our ailing veterans. This legislation does not presume \nexposure of every veteran to every possible hazard. Rather, it looks at \nthese hazards and to the illnesses already being seen in the veteran \npopulation and determines what diseases and illnesses can be associated \nwith that service or those hazards. If the veteran has that disease or \nillness, then it is presumed to have been as a result of his exposure \nto that hazard or hazards or to that service.\n  Vietnam veterans had to wait almost 20 years before their medical \ncrisis was resolved, and is still being resolved. We must show that we \nas a Government can learn from that experience and push forward so that \nthe veterans from the Persian Gulf War do not have to wait so long. I \nthink it is possible to learn from history, and recent history provides \nthe freshest lessons. If we do not act decisively now, these newest \nveterans will be one more year closer to reaching that sorry halfway \nhurdle. That is why I am proud to cosponsor this bill with Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Specter, the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of \n1998, to be considered by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs as it \nmeets to address pending legislation. I hope that the Committee will \nreceive it favorably, and that the Senate can move to address the needs \nof our nations newest conflict veterans and stem the crisis of \nconfidence that the slow and often stumbling Government response to \nthis health care dilemma has created in our servicemen and women, and \nin our veterans.\n  Mr. President, the men and women who go into combat for the rest of \nus deserve our lasting gratitude. They also deserve to have their \nwounded compatriots properly and aggressively taken care of and that is \nwhat President Lincoln meant when he said, ``To take care of him who \nhas borne the battle, and his widow and children'' which the Department \nof Veterans Affairs has adopted as its motto. When we fail to do this, \nwe undermine that covenant, and we put cold and daunting doubt in the \nhearts of those who might otherwise consider volunteering for that hard \nduty.\n  To those who are concerned, as I am, about readiness in our military, \nI say that this is the final element of all the recruiting, \nadvertising, and patriotic appeals to join the military and serve the \nnation in uniform. This is the element that seals the deal--the \ncommitment to care for our soldiers who are wounded in service. It must \nbe there, and our men and women in uniform must be confident in its \ncompassion and in its endurance, or no signing bonus will keep \nvolunteers in the military. We took too long to follow through with our \nveterans from Vietnam, and we are in danger of making the same mistake \nwith our veterans from the Persian Gulf:\n\n       A man who is good enough to shed his blood for his country \n     is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards. More \n     than that no man is entitled to, and less than that no man \n     shall have.\n\n  So said President Theodore Roosevelt on another Independence Day 95 \nyears ago, on July 4, 1903, following the Spanish-American War. I \nbelieve that this Congress wants to, and will, live up to that \nsentiment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, along with Senator Byrd and Senator \nSpecter, I am proud to introduce today the ``Persian Gulf War Veterans \nAct of 1998.'' This bipartisan legislation establishes a clear \nframework for the compensation and health care needs of Gulf War \nveterans. This bill would create a permanent statutory authority for \nthe compensation of ill Gulf War veterans. It builds upon the system of \nscientific review and determinations for presumptive compensation that \ncurrently exists for veterans exposed to Agent Orange during the \nVietnam War and builds upon S. 1320, which I introduced last October.\n  The bill we introduce today is an even more comprehensive effort to \naddress the needs of our Nation's Gulf War veterans. Senator Byrd's and \nSenator Specter's many contributions have served to make this an even \nstronger bill that will help to expedite the process of scientific \nreview of possible wartime hazards and exposures that may have \ncontributed to illnesses in our Gulf War veterans, which in turn \nexpedites compensation to ill veterans. It will also help ensure health \ncare for these men and women in the years to come, and improves the \ncurrent program for evaluating the health of families of Gulf War \nveterans.\n  As Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have \nwitnessed firsthand the struggles of many of our Nation's Gulf War \nveterans. The Persian Gulf War will undoubtedly go down in history as \none of our country's most decisive military victories. Despite our \nfears of potentially huge troop injuries and losses, the careful \nplanning and strategy of our military leaders paid off. The ground war \nlasted only four days, and the casualties we experienced, while deeply \nregrettable, were fortunately few. But as with any war, the human costs \nof the Gulf War have been high, and the casualties have continued long \nafter the battle was over.\n  Many of the men and women who served in the Gulf have suffered \nchronic, debilitating health problems. Unnecessarily compounding their \npain has been their difficulty in getting the government they served to \nacknowledge their problems and provide the appropriate care and \nbenefits they deserve. This legislation will go a long way to address \nsome of these concerns. We can't wait the 20 years we waited after the \nVietnam war to assess the effects of Agent Orange, or the 40 years we \nwaited after World War II to concede the problems of radiation-exposed \nveterans. We must learn from the lessons of the past and act now. We \nhave already waited too long.\n  For the past seven years, we have looked to the leaders of the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs for a \nresolution of these difficult issues. While they have made some \nprogress, I think we can all agree there is much more to be done. This \nlegislation will require VA to enlist the National Academy of \nSciences--an independent, nonprofit, scientific organization--to review \nand evaluate the research regarding links between illnesses and \nexposure to toxic agents and wartime hazards. Based on the findings of \nthe NAS, VA will then determine whether a diagnosed or undiagnosed \nillness found to be associated with Gulf War service warrants a \npresumption of service connection for compensation purposes. This will \nprovide an ongoing scientific basis and nonpolitical framework for the \nVA to use in compensating Persian Gulf War veterans.\n  Mr. President, I will now highlight some of the provisions contained \nin this legislation.\n  First, this legislation calls for the Secretary of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to contract with the National Academy of Sciences \n(NAS) to provide a scientific basis for determining the association \nbetween illnesses and exposures to environmental or wartime hazards as \na result of service in the Persian Gulf. The NAS will review the \nscientific literature to assess health exposures during the Gulf War \nand health problems among veterans, and report to Congress and the VA.\n  This bill tasks the NAS with first reviewing a list of likely \nexposures. Such a step will jump start their review and provide NAS \nwith an initial blueprint to build upon. This is important because it \nwill speed up the process of providing compensation to veterans, and \nour veterans should not have to wait any longer.\n  Second, this legislation authorizes VA to presume that diagnosed or \nundiagnosed illnesses that have a positive association with exposures \nto environmental or wartime hazards were incurred in or aggravated by \nservice even if there was no evidence of the illness during service. \nHaving that authority, VA will determine whether there is a sound \nmedical and scientific basis to warrant a presumption of service \nconnection for compensation for diagnosed\n\n[[Page S9047]]\n\nor undiagnosed illnesses, based on NAS' report. Within 60 days of that \ndetermination, VA will publish proposed regulations to presumptively \nservice connect these illnesses.\n  Third, this bill extends VA's authority to provide health care to \nGulf War veterans through December 31, 2001. After the war, DoD and VA \nacknowledged that they couldn't define what health problems were \naffecting Persian Gulf War veterans. Nonetheless, we did not want to \nmake these veterans wait for the science to catch up before we could \nprovide health care and compensation for their service-related \nconditions. That is why, back in 1993, we provided Persian Gulf War \nveterans with priority health care at VA facilities for conditions \nrelated to their exposure to environmental hazards. Gulf War veterans' \naccess to health care through VA must be continue to be ensured.\n  Fourth, this bill requires NAS to provide recommendations for \nadditional research that should be conducted to better understand the \npossible adverse health effects of exposures to toxic agents or \nenvironmental or wartime hazards associated with Gulf War service. The \nVA, in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DoD) and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS), will review and act upon \nthe recommendations for additional research and future studies.\n  Fifth, this legislation tasks NAS with assessing potential treatment \nmodels for the chronic undiagnosed illnesses that have affected so many \nof our Gulf War veterans. They will make recommendations for additional \nstudies to determine the most appropriate and scientifically sound \ntreatments. VA and DoD will review this information and submit a report \nto Congress describing whether they will implement these treatment \nmodels and their rationale for their decisions.\n  In addition, this legislation calls for the establishment of a system \nto monitor the health status of Persian Gulf War veterans over time. \nVA, in collaboration with DoD, will develop a plan to establish and \noperate a computerized information data set to collect information on \nthe illnesses and health problems of Gulf War veterans. This data base \nwill also track health care utilization of veterans with chronic \nundiagnosed illnesses to better evaluate these veterans' health care \nneeds. VA and DoD will submit this plan for review and comment by NAS. \nAfter this review, VA and DoD will implement the agreed-upon plan and \nprovide annual reports to Congress on the health status of Persian Gulf \nWar veterans.\n  Also, this legislation requires that VA, in consultation with DoD and \nHHS, carry out an ongoing outreach program to provide information to \nGulf War veterans. This information will include health risks, if any, \nfrom exposures during service in the Gulf War theater of operations, \nand any additional services or benefits that are available.\n  This bill also extends and improves upon VA's Persian Gulf War Spouse \nand Children Evaluation Program to allow VA greater flexibility in the \nimplementation of this important program and to allow for greater \naccess for the families who seek medical evaluations.\n  Finally, this bill requires the Secretary of VA to enter into an \nagreement with the National Academy of Sciences to study the \nfeasibility of establishing, as an independent entity, a National \nCenter for the Study of Military Health. The proposed center would \nevaluate and monitor interagency coordination on issues relating to \npost-deployment health concerns of members of the Armed Forces. In \naddition, this center would evaluate the health care provided to \nmembers of the Armed Services both before and after their deployment on \nmilitary operations. It could also monitor and direct government \nefforts to evaluate the health of servicemembers upon their return from \nmilitary deployments, for purposes of ensuring the rapid identification \nof any trends in diseases or injuries that result from such operations. \nFinally, such an independent health center could also serve an \nimportant role in providing training of health care professionals in \nDoD and VA in the evaluation and treatment of post-conflict diseases \nand health conditions, including nonspecific and unexplained illnesses.\n  We will continue to retrace the steps and decisions that were made in \ndeploying almost 697,000 men and women to the Persian Gulf in 1990. \nHopefully, we will learn from the lessons of this war to prevent some \nof these same health problems in future deployments, where our troops \nwill again face the threat of an ever changing and increasingly toxic \ncombat environment. But we also must address what our ill Gulf War \nveterans need now. We need to provide a permanent statutory authority \nto compensate them. We need to be able to answer the questions of ``How \nmany veterans are ill?'' and ``Are our ill veterans getting sicker over \ntime?\"\n  Mr. President, this legislation targets these important issues. I ask \nmy colleagues in the Senate to join Senator Byrd, Senator Specter, and \nme in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2358\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues \nSenator Byrd and Senator Rockefeller who have worked so carefully in \ncrafting this legislation, the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998. \nThus, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor on this bill.\n  This is a major piece of legislation on behalf of a very important \ngroup of veterans. For too long, many Gulf War veterans unsuccessfully \nhave sought promised assistance from our government for the troubling \nand unexplained health problems they have suffered since they returned \nhome from the Gulf War conflict seven years ago. This bill will fill \nimportant gaps in the current health care services and compensation \nbenefits actually being provided to these veterans. It will advance \nefforts to determine what happened to these veterans during their \ndeployment that may have affected their current health. It also \nprovides a mechanism for an independent scientific entity--the National \nAcademy of Sciences--to identify on a scientific basis linkages between \ntoxic substances to which Gulf War veterans were exposed during their \ndeployment and the illnesses that many now suffer, and for the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to issue regulations based on the NAS's \nfindings creating presumptions of service connection for health care \nand benefits purposes for Gulf War veterans.\n  This bill is the latest in a series of laws we have passed in \nrecognition of the deep debt we owe those brave men and women who \nanswered their country's call and put their lives on the line on behalf \nof us all during the Gulf War. Although that war ended quickly with \nrelatively few immediate casualties, the long term impact of that \ndeployment--which had as a daily reality the very real threat that Iraq \nwould use chemical or biological weapons--was immense and \nunanticipated. The casualties now are those Gulf War veterans who, \nseveral years after the war, have a variety of symptoms and illnesses \nthat fall into no set pattern but for which they still cannot get \neffective help from our government. This is, unfortunately, \nparticularly true at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has as \nits mission the care for and compensation of veterans who fall ill as a \nresult of their military service, and is why this bill focuses on \ndirecting the VA to take steps to remedy the situation that many Gulf \nWar veterans find themselves in. It is clear that many Gulf War \nveterans are suffering from very real physical problems, many of which \nare still-evolving and the cause of which remains unclear. Effective \ntreatments in many cases have yet to be identified, and even where \ntreatment could be helpful it is not yet uniformly provided to all Gulf \nWar veterans who seek it. And, individuals who develop health problems \nafter their service in the Gulf continue to encounter significant \nproblems in obtaining adequate and timely compensation benefits.\n  It is true that the Department of Veterans Affairs has instituted \nprograms and made efforts to treat Gulf War veterans. But clearly, the \ncurrent realization of those efforts is not worthy of what these \nveterans--who have been identified as a high priority group by VA \nitself--deserve. As I travel through my home state of Pennsylvania, I \nhear over and over again the heartbreaking stories of ill Gulf War \nveterans and their families, who are understandably frightened about \ntheir future health prospects and are frustrated by their attempts to \nget timely and effective health care assistance and compensation \nbenefits. This bill should help remove some of the barriers to \nobtaining these services from the VA. It should also help shift to the \ngovernment the burden that in the past has too often fallen on the \nveteran to demonstrate that he or she is ill and why. It does this by \nestablishing a structured means for seeking potential positive \nassociations between troop exposures to one or more environmental \nhazards in the Gulf region and the unexplained illnesses that many now \nface every day. It compels VA to not just treat these ill veterans in \nisolation and on an ad hoc basis but to monitor their health status \nover time, and requires more research and outreach programs to make \nsure every potentially useful area of research into treatment as well \nas causation is pursued, and that Gulf War veterans know how to obtain \nthe VA's services that are provided on their behalf. It also enhances \nVA's authority to implement the program for examinations of the spouses \nand children of these veterans under a program that we established some \nyears ago but that VA has utterly failed to implement in a truly \neffective way.\n  This is another opportunity for us to learn from the past and not \nrepeat the delays or mistakes that were made in helping the veterans of \nprevious conflicts who have suffered long term, adverse health \nconsequences as a result of their military service. America's Gulf War \nveterans deserve no less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Baucus, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Jeffords, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2359. A bill to amend the National Environmental Education Act to \nextend the programs under the Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n             national environmental amendments act of 1998\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the National Environment Education Act. I am joined by my \ncolleagues Senators Faircloth, Lugar, Kerry, Baucus, Lautenberg, Wyden, \nGraham, Jeffords, and Domenici.\n  Over the last few years environmental education has been criticized \nfor being one-sided and heavy-handed. People have accused environmental \nadvocates of trying to brainwash children and of pushing an \nenvironmental agenda that is not supported by the facts or by science. \nThey also accuse the Federal government of setting one curriculum \nstandard and forcing all schools to subscribe to their views. This is \nnot how these two environmental education programs have worked, and I \nhave taken specific steps to ensure that they never work this way.\n  This legislation accomplishes two important functions. First, it \ncleans up the current law to make the programs run more efficiently. \nAnd second, it places two very important safeguards in the program to \nensure its integrity in the future.\n  I have placed in this bill language to ensure that the EPA programs \nare ``balanced and scientifically sound.'' It is important that \nenvironmental education is presented in an unbiased and balanced \nmanner. The personal values and prejudices of the educators should not \nbe instilled in our children. Instead we must teach them to think for \nthemselves after they have been presented with all of the facts and \ninformation. Environmental ideas must be grounded in sound science and \nnot emotional bias. While these programs have not been guilty of this \nin the past, this is an important safeguard to protect the future of \nenvironmental education.\n  Second, I have included language which prohibits any of the funds to \nbe used for lobbying efforts. While these programs have not used the \ngrant process to lobby the government, there are other programs which \nhave been accused of this and this language will ensure that this \nprogram never becomes a vehicle for the executive branch to lobby \nCongress.\n  This is an important piece of legislation, and I hope both the Senate \nand the House can act quickly to reauthorize these programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9052]]\n\n                                S. 2359\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration for Fiscal Years 1999, 2000, and 2001, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n national oceanic and atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of \n                                  1998\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1998. This \nlegislation authorizes appropriations for NOAA research, operations, \nand other activities, reforms the operation of NOAA's hydrographic \nactivities, authorizes continuation of the NOAA Corps, requires the \ndevelopment of a revised\n\n[[Page S9053]]\n\nNOAA fleet modernization plan, and makes administrative changes related \nto NOAA.\n  Mr. President, I consider NOAA to be one of the most important \nagencies of the Federal government. It manages and conserves living \nmarine resources; explores, maps, and charts the ocean and its \nresources; describes, monitors, and predicts conditions in the \natmosphere, ocean, and space environments; and issue whether forecasts \nand warnings, among other missions.\n  Certain specific NOAA activities are authorized through individual \nstatutes such as the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery Conservation and Management Act, the National Sea Grant College \nProgram Act, and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. \nBut many NOAA activities are conducted pursuant to longstanding general \nauthorizations, and the specific details of these programs are \ndetermined administratively\n  Congress last enacted a general NOAA authorization in 1992 (Public \nLaw 102-567). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nAuthorization Act of 1992 authorized funding for NOAA programs through \nFY 1993. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries of the \nCommerce Committee, I think it is time for the Congress to pass an \nupdated authorization for these NOAA programs.\n  My bill authorizes funding in various accounts in fiscal years 1999 \nthrough 2001 for the National Ocean Service, the National Weather \nService, the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information \nService, the Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research, the National \nMarine Fisheries Service, Program Support, Facilities, and Fleet \nMaintenance and Planning.\n  Mr. President, the Congress should make a concerted effort to \nreauthorize NOAA's programs. This legislation will accomplish that \nobjective and I would urge my colleagues to support it. \n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2361. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to authorize programs for predisaster \nmitigation, to streamline the administration of disaster relief, to \ncontrol the Federal costs of disaster assistance, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  the disaster mitigation act of 1998\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \namend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \nAct. I am introducing this legislation as the chairman of the \nsubcommittee with jurisdiction over FEMA, the Clean Air, Wetlands, \nPrivate Property, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee. I am joined today by \nmy ranking member, Senator Graham, who has worked closely with me in \ndrafting this legislation. It is our intention to move swiftly through \nthe committee process with the prospect of floor action this fall.\n  This bill has two main titles. The first authorizes the Predisaster \nHazard Mitigation Program. This program helps communities plan for \ndisasters before they strike which will reduce the post hazard costs \nassociated with disasters. The second title provides a number of \nstreamlining and cost reduction measures which will help bring into \nline the funds Congress ends up appropriating through supplemental \nbudgets every time we have a major disaster.\n  I would like to spend a few minutes discussing two key provisions in \nthe Predisaster Mitigation Program that I believe are very important. \nThey relate to the Project Impact Program which was thoroughly \ndiscussed in our recent Subcommittee hearing.\n  Project Impact is an innovative program where FEMA is working with \nlocal communities to help them prepare for disasters. It began last \nyear with seven pilots and was expanded this year to include one \nProject Impact community in every State.\n  Our Bill authorizes funding for the program for five years, with a \nsunset at the end of the five years. Based on the costs of the first 50 \npilots, the funds authorized will pay for an additional 300 \ncommunities. I expect FEMA to work on how best to devolve this program \nto the local communities over the next five years. If this program is \ngoing to be successful then it must evolve into a State and locally run \nprogram.\n  Some may question why a sunset for a program like this is necessary, \nso let me explain. In the legislation we require the GAO to conduct a \nstudy of the program and report back to the Congress in three years. We \nalso ask FEMA to report back on the success of the program. It is my \nintent that these reports make specific recommendations for the next \nphase of Project Impact. The House legislation only authorizes Project \nImpact for three years, I felt it was necessary to authorize the \nprogram for five years which will give Congress plenty of time to \nauthorize the next phase of Project Impact.\n  This program cannot be another Federal bureaucratic program that \ncontinues to mushroom without clear direction and with escalating \ncosts. At this point no one has enough experience to predict how this \nprogram should look in five years. As FEMA says, this is not just \nanother big government program, and Congress should not treat it as \none. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2361\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) greater emphasis needs to be placed on identifying and \n     assessing the risks to States and local communities and \n     implementing adequate measures to reduce losses from natural \n     disasters and to ensure that critical facilities and public \n     infrastructure will continue to function after a disaster;\n       (2) expenditures for post-disaster assistance are \n     increasing without commensurate reduction in the likelihood \n     of future losses from natural disasters;\n       (3) a high priority in the expenditure of Federal funds \n     under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) should be to \n     implement predisaster activities at the local level; and\n       (4) with a unified effort of economic incentives, awareness \n     and education, technical assistance, and demonstrated Federal \n     support, States and local communities will be able to \n     increase their capabilities to--\n       (A) form effective community-based partnerships for \n     mitigation purposes;\n       (B) implement effective natural disaster mitigation \n     measures that reduce the risk of future damage, hardship, and \n     suffering;\n       (C) ensure continued functioning of critical facilities and \n     public infrastructure;\n       (D) leverage additional non-Federal resources into meeting \n     disaster resistance goals; and\n       (E) make commitments to long-term disaster mitigation \n     efforts for new and existing structures.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to establish a \n     predisaster hazard mitigation program that--\n       (1) reduces the loss of life and property, human suffering, \n     economic disruption, and disaster assistance costs resulting \n     from natural hazards; and\n       (2) provides a source of predisaster hazard mitigation \n     funding that will assist States and local governments in \n     implementing effective mitigation measures that are designed \n     to ensure the continued functioning\n\n[[Page S9054]]\n\n     of critical facilities and public infrastructure after a \n     natural disaster.\n\n     SEC. 102. STATE MITIGATION PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 201(c) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief \n     and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5131(c)) is amended \n     in the third sentence--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) set forth, with the ongoing cooperation of local \n     governments and consistent with section 409, a comprehensive \n     and detailed State program for mitigating emergencies and \n     major disasters, including provisions for prioritizing \n     mitigation measures.''.\n\n     SEC. 103.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       ``This Act may be cited as the `Robert T. Stafford Disaster \n     Relief and Emergency Assistance Act'.''.\n\n     SEC. 302. DEFINITION OF STATE.\n\n       Section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122) is amended in each \n     of paragraphs (3) and (4) by striking ``the Northern'' and \n     all that follows through ``Pacific Islands'' and inserting \n     ``and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands''.\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today along with my distinguished \ncolleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, I introduce the Disaster \nMitigation Act of 1998, legislation that will refocus the energies of \nfederal, state and local governments on disaster mitigation, and will \nshift our efforts to preventative--rather than responsive--actions as \nwe ready the nation for future disasters.\n  Since the outset of this year, I have been working closely with \nSenator Inhofe to develop this bi-partisan legislation that will more \ncomprehensively and efficiently address the threats we face from \ndisasters of all types. The bill is composed of two titles: Title I \nseeks to reduce the impact of disasters by authorizing a ``pre-disaster \nmitigation'' program; Title II seeks to streamline the current disaster \nassistance programs to save administrative costs in addition to greatly \nsimplifying these programs for the benefit of states, local \ncommunities, and individual disaster victims.\n  In addressing the challenges we face from the threat of disaster, I \nhave found it very helpful to use a ``doctor/patient'' analogy to guide \nour efforts. First, we diagnosed the problem: over the last ten years, \ndisasters have affected the nation with more frequency--and at a \ngreater cost--than we have experienced in the past. In fact, over the \nlast several years, the supplemental appropriations bills required to \nrespond to disasters have been unusually large compared to the previous \ndecade due to a series of unprecedented disasters including: Hurricanes \nAndrew and Iniki in 1992; the Midwest floods of 1993; the Northridge \nearthquake of 1994; and the Upper Midwest floods of 1997.\n  Second, we offered a prescription to address the problem: \ncomprehensive pre-disaster mitigation. This bill will authorize a five-\nyear pre-disaster mitigation program, funded at $35 million per year, \nto be administered by Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. The \npre-disaster mitigation program will change the focus of our efforts, \nat all levels of government, to preventative--rather than responsive--\nactions in planning for disasters. Such a change in ideology is \ncritical to reducing the short- and long-term costs of natural \ndisasters. It will encourage both the public and the private sector, as \nwell as individual citizens, to take responsibility for the threats \nthey face by adopting the concept of disaster mitigation into their \neveryday lives. Just like energy conservation, recycling, and the \nwidespread use of seat belts, disaster mitigation should become a \nconcept that all citizens incorporate into their day-to-day lives.\n  Since 1993, under the leadership of Director James Lee Witt, FEMA has \ntruly changed their way of doing business. In the past five years, FEMA \nhas become more responsive to disaster victims and state and local \ngovernments, and has ``reinvented'' itself by choosing to focus its \nenergy on mitigating, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from \nthe effects of natural hazards. FEMA has already taken an important \nfirst step in advocating pre-disaster mitigation by establishing \n``Project Impact,'' their new mitigation initiative, in local \ncommunities throughout the nation. I am proud to say that Deerfield \nBeach, Florida, was the first community to be chosen as a participant \nin Project Impact. By authorizing the conduct of Project Impact for \nfive years in the legislation, we are making a definitive endorsement \nof both the program and Director Witt's leadership, and we expect that \nthe initiative will produce measurable results in reducing the costs of \ndisaster in the future.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is the result of coordination and \ncooperation with FEMA, the National Association of Emergency \nManagement, the National League of Cities, representatives of the \nprivate and voluntary sectors, and numerous other state and local \ngovernmental organizations. I wish to take this opportunity to thank \nall who provided important input into the development of this bill, and \nI am confident that our joint efforts have resulted in a truly \ncomprehensive ``diagnosis'' of the problem, as well as a \n``prescription'' to address it.\n  In his testimony before the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nFlorida Director of Emergency Management Joe Myers called this \nlegislation a ``defining moment'' in emergency management. I too \nbelieve that this legislation represents a historic change in the \nnation's efforts to prevent the effects of natural disasters. By taking \nproactive steps to implement mitigation now, we will reduce the damage, \npain, and suffering from disaster that have become all too familiar. \nMr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Inhofe and \nmyself by joining with us in our efforts to protect\n\n[[Page S9058]]\n\nthe citizens of the U.S. from disasters now and in the future.\n\n

Tom DeLay's \n     bodyguard for the last three years, was an 18-year veteran of \n     the Capitol Police, and was married to Evelyn and had three \n     children, Kristen, John and Daniel;\n       Whereas Private First Class Chestnut and Detective Gibson \n     were the first United States Capitol Police officers ever \n     killed in the line of duty;\n       Whereas Private First Class Chestnut and Detective Gibson, \n     and all those who helped apprehend the gunman, assist the \n     injured, and evacuate the building, are true heroes of \n     democracy, and every American owes them a deep debt of \n     gratitude: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) Congress hereby honors the memory of Detective John \n     Michael Gibson and Private First Class Jacob Joseph Chestnut \n     of the United States Capitol Police for the selfless acts of \n     heroism they displayed on July 24, 1998, in sacrificing their \n     lives in the line of duty so that others might live; and\n       (2) when the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     adjourn on this date they shall do so out of respect to the \n     memory of Detective John Michael Gibson and Private First \n     Class Jacob Joseph Chestnut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9058-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 111--AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF \n THE CAPITOL FOR A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR DETECTIVE JOHN MICHAEL GIBSON \n  AND PRIVATE FIRST CLASS JACOB JOSEPH CHESTNUT OF THE UNITED STATES \n                             CAPITOL POLICE\n\n       Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Akaka, \n     Mr. Allard, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, \n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Burns, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \n     Campbell, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Coats, Mr. Cochran, \n     Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n     D'Amato, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Ford, Mr. Frist, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Gorton, Mr. \n     Graham, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Grams, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hollings, Mr. \n     Hutchinson, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Kerrey, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, \n     Mr. Mack, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \n     Moseley-Braun, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Nickles, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Robb, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mr. Roth, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n     Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Smith \n     of Oregon, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Thomas, \n     Mr. Thompson, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n     Wellstone and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following concurrent \n     resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

VOLLRATH\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor \nLieutenant General Frederick E. Vollrath upon his retirement from the \nUnited States Army. General Vollrath has served our great nation with \nhonor and distinction for 35 years and his performance throughout his \ncareer has been characterized by the highest standards of professional \nethics and commitment to soldiers.\n  General Vollrath's outstanding career began when he was commissioned \na second lieutenant upon completion of the Reserve Officers' Training \nCorps and graduation from the University of Miami in 1963. During his \nmilitary career, he completed the Adjutant General Officer Basic and \nAdvanced Courses, the United States Army Command and General Staff \nCollege, the United States Army War College, the National Security \nManagement.\n  His initial assignments include Adjutant General and Deputy Chief of \nStaff, 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Fort Carson, Colorado; \nDirector of Personnel Service Support, Director of Enlisted Personnel \nManagement, and Chief, Enlisted Assignment Division, 1st Personnel \nCommand, U.S. Army Europe. He has also held a variety of important \ncommand and staff positions to include Deputy Chief of Staff, \nPersonnel, U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army; Director of Military \nPersonnel Management, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for \nPersonnel, Department of the Army; Director of Enlisted Personnel U.S. \nTotal Army Personnel Command, Alexandria, Virginia; Commander, \nPersonnel Information Systems Command; Chief of Staff and later Deputy \nCommander, 1st Personnel Command, U.S. Army Europe; Assistant Deputy \nChief of Staff for Personnel, Headquarters, Department of the Army and \nculminating his career with his most recent duty as Deputy Chief of \nStaff for Personnel, Headquarters, Department of the Army.\n  General Vollrath's military awards and decorations include the \nDistinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star \nMedal, the Meritorious Service Medal and the Army Commendation Medal.\n  General Vollrath has truly made a difference to our Army and our \nNation. He has always fought for what was right for the Army, it's \nsoldiers, civilians and family members. He has established a solid \nreputation among his peers and superiors as the single driving force in \nensuring the personnel community has stayed on the leading edge of \nsustaining the personnel readiness for the Total Army.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join me in wishing General Vollrath and \nhis wife, Joy, all the best and thank them for 35 years of dedicated \nand unselfish service to our Nation. We wish them both a very \nfulfilling retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9060-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9060-S9061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PATIENT PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Friday, July 24, I introduced \nlegislation along with Senators Ashcroft, Burns, and Abraham to repeal \nthe legal mandate for personal identification codes for each patient \nthat would be part of a national medical records system.\n  Our legislation, S. 2352, the Patient Privacy Rights Act, would \nrepeal the unique medical identifiers requirement of the Health \nInsurance Portability Law of 1996 (HIPAA). This law directs the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to develop a system to use \npersonal identifying codes as part of a system for electronically \ntransmitting health information to aid implementation of the health \ninsurance portability law. The unique health identifiers would be \ncodes, numbers or other methods of uniquely identifying each patient \nthat his or her doctors would be required to use throughout that \nperson's lifetime. Hearings on the emerging system were launched in \nChicago this week by the National Committee on Vital and Health \nStatistics.\n  I believe it is irresponsible to expose patients to this massive new \nerosion of\n\n[[Page S9061]]\n\ntheir privacy. The impetus to computerize medical records for the sake \nof efficiency cannot be allowed to overrun our basic privacy. People \ndeserve the assurance that their medical histories will not be the \nsubject of public curiosity, commercial advantage or harmful \ndisclosure. This computerization of medical information has raised the \nstakes in privacy protection. Congress created this threat. Now \nCongress needs to just say no to the idea of a cradle-to-grave medical \ndossier.\n  Health care computerization not only is inevitable, it can be a \nuseful tool to improve health care. But trusting our medical records to \nthis rapidly developing technology will only be supported by the \nAmerican people if they are assured that their medical privacy is \nprotected. Privacy is not the only victim here. Without privacy \nprotections, many will be discouraged from seeking help or taking \nadvantage of the access we are working so hard to protect in this very \nsame law.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The text of the bill follows:\n\n                                S. 2352\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Patient Privacy Rights Act \n     of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) individuals have a right to confidentiality with \n     respect to their personal health information and records;\n       (2) with respect to information about medical care and \n     health status, the traditional right of confidentiality is at \n     risk;\n       (3) an erosion of the right of confidentiality will reduce \n     the willingness of patients to confide in physicians and \n     other practitioners, thus jeopardizing quality health care;\n       (4) fear that confidentiality is being compromised will \n     deter individuals from seeking medical treatment and stifle \n     technological or medical research and development; and\n       (5) advancing technology should not lead to a loss of \n     personal privacy.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act--\n       (1) to repeal the implementation of a ``standard unique \n     health identifier for each individual'' as required under \n     section 1173(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d-\n     2(b)) as added by the amendment made by section 262(a) of the \n     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \n     (Public Law 104-191); and\n       (2) to guarantee that medical privacy protections are not \n     undermined by federal law.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPEAL OF FEDERAL UNIQUE HEALTH IDENTIFIER.\n\n       Sections 1173(b) and 1177(a)(1) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1320d-2(b); 42 U.S.C. 1320d-6(a)(1)) are \n     repealed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9060-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DR.

Over the past years, Dr. Leftwich has worked with students in \nhis area by talking to them about life and their futures. In his \ndiscussions, he has urged students to be the very best they can be and \nto make firm commitments to excellence.\n  Dr. Leftwich is a prime example of a hero in my book. He is a \ncommitted advocate for young people and the freedoms they can achieve \nthrough hard work and perseverance.\n  It is people like Bob, with the motivation he brings to our students, \nwho will be remembered when these students are the leaders of our great \nnation. They will no doubt look back and remember the impact that this \nindividual had on their lives. And hopefully they will follow his lead \nby getting involved with young people themselves.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I would like to thank Dr. Leftwich for his \ndedication to excellence. His work should serve as an encouragement to \nothers to become more involved with the education of our nation's \nyouth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9061-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               HEAD START\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Head Start program has \nsuccessfully served hundreds of thousands of children over the past 33 \nyears. These are children who otherwise would have been left behind. \nInstead, they received an enriching opportunity to get prepared for \nelementary school.\n  It is critical that we allow local Head Start providers to continue \nto focus on their mission of serving families and children first. They \nserve our most vulnerable populations. We need to make sure that we do \nnot saddle Head Start with the additional responsibilities that some \nmembers have proposed. Responsibilities such as determining paternity, \nor enforcing welfare laws by verifying TANF requirements, are duties \nwhich are within the realm and expertise of social workers and other \nprofessionals. Requiring Head Start to handle these burdensome \nresponsibilities would take their time, energy and focus away from \nserving families and children first.\n  We are finding that the quality of instruction and programs at Head \nStart continues to improve. We must continue to improve quality. One \nmajor concern is the authority given to private companies in this bill. \nWhile for-profits are partners with many Head Start grantees, their \nprofit-making goals are not wholly consistent with the mission of \nserving the public good.\n  Mr. President, in June, 1995, several respected researchers from Yale \nUniversity and other universities issued a report comparing the quality \nand cost outcomes between for-profit and non-profit centers. The \nresearch shows that non-profit centers on average have more teachers \nwith Associates of Arts in Early Childhood Education degrees than for-\nprofit centers.\n  Futhermore, for-profit centers on average had lower quality scores \nbut higher costs per child than non-profit centers. Also, for-profit \ncenters make very little use of volunteers from the community. I fear \nthat for-profits are not about quality and community.\n  Mr. President, presently under 50 percent of the eligible population \nis served by the Head Start program. It is important that Head Start \ncontinues to expand and serve a greater number of children. However, \nduring these times of welfare reform, it is also necessary that Head \nStart provide full-day, full-year programs for working families. In \norder to achieve both goals, it is important that expansion occurs \ncautiously.\n  Overall, the bill allows flexibility and focuses on school readiness \nand should be supported. Head Start is one of the most important \ninvestments we can make in our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9061-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Earl V. \nJones, Sr., from Pittsburgh, PA, on his efforts to promote world peace.\n  Mr. Jones started his grassroots movement, Peace on Earth, to teach \nchildren about peace and understanding. The project has since expanded \nto include a sister city in Russia, the Siberian industrial town of \nNovokuznetak. Children in each of these cities write essays answering \nthe question ``What Can Each of Us Do for Peace on Earth?''\n  Essay winners receive medals fashioned from metal produced in \nPittsburgh and from Novokuznetak. Among the honorary medal recipients \nare President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Mr. Jones \nbelieves children will have an added incentive to compete in the \ncontest when they know that two Presidents have the same medals that \nthey can win. Furthermore, Mr. Jones included a third set of medals in \nhis gift to the presidents which he hopes will be carried into outer \nspace. He explains, ``If you're going to have peace on Earth, you \nbetter start up above and come down.''\n  Mr. President, I commend Earl Jones for his tireless work on the \nPeace on Earth campaign. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending \nthe Senate's best wishes for continued success to Mr. Jones and his \nworthwhile project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9061-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9061-S9064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST WOMEN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last week marked the 150th \nanniversary of one of the most important events in our history.\n  In July, 1848 a revolution was taking place in a small brick chapel \nin a village in upstate New York. The first Women's Rights Convention \nwas held at the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20 of \nthat year. There, a small group ratified the ``Declaration of \nSentiments,'' a document which may be considered the Magna Carta of the \nwomen's movement. The Declaration proclaimed that:\n\n       All men and women are created equal: That they are endowed \n     by their Creator with\n\n[[Page S9062]]\n\n     certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  That was the first American political idea--that women are equal in \ncivic rights with men. It did not come from Europe, or ancient Athens, \nor Rome. It came right from central New York.\n  In 1980, we established a Women's Rights Historic Park at Seneca \nFalls and Waterloo, commemorating this monumental convention. Former \nSenator Javits and I proposed a bill to create an historic park within \nSeneca Falls to commemorate the early beginnings of the women's \nmovement and to recognize the important role Seneca Falls has played in \nthe movement. The park consists of five sites: the 1840's Greek Revival \nhome of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, organizer and leader of the women's \nrights movement; the Wesleyan Chapel, where the First Women's Rights \nConvention was held; Declaration Park with a 100 foot waterwall \nengraved with the Declaration of Sentiments and the names of the \nsigners of Declaration; and the M'Clintock house, home of MaryAnn and \nThomas M'Clintock, where the Declaration was drafted.\n  Mrs. Clinton visited a number of these sites as part of her ``Save \nAmerica's Treasures'' tour. There she spoke to the meaning of the \nWomen's Rights Convention and called for the work of these pioneers to \ncontinue into the next century.\n  I ask that the text of Mrs. Clinton's speech be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The speech follows:\n\n              Remarks of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton\n\n       Thank you for gathering here in such numbers for this \n     important celebration. I want to thank Governor Pataki and \n     Congresswoman Slaughter and all the elected officials who are \n     here with us today. I want to thank Mary Anne and here \n     committee for helping to organize such a great celebration. I \n     want to thank Bob Stanton and the entire Park Service staff \n     for doing such an excellent job with the historic site. I \n     want to thank our choirs. I thought the choirs really added; \n     I want to thank our singers whom we've already heard from and \n     will hear from because this is a celebration and we need to \n     think about it in such terms.\n       But for a moment, I would like you to take your minds backs \n     a hundred and fifty years. Imagine if you will that you are \n     Charlotte Woodward, a nineteen-year-old glove maker working \n     and living in Waterloo. Everyday you sit for hours sewing \n     gloves together, working for small wages you cannot even \n     keep, with no hope of going on in school or owning property, \n     knowing that if you marry, your children and even the clothes \n     on your body will belong to your husband.\n       But then one day in July, 1848, you hear about a women's \n     right convention to be held in nearby Seneca Falls. It's a \n     convention to discuss the social, civil, and religious \n     conditions and rights of women. You run from house to house \n     and you find other women who have heard the same news. Some \n     are excited, others are amused or even shocked, and a few \n     agree to come with you, for at least the first day.\n       When that day comes, July 19, 1848, you leave early in the \n     morning in your horse-drawn wagon. You fear that no one else \n     will come; and at first, the road is empty, except for you \n     and your neighbors. But suddenly, as you reach a crossroads, \n     you see a few more wagons and carriages, then more and more \n     all going towards Wesleyan Chapel. Eventually you join the \n     others to form one long procession on the road to equality.\n       Who were the others traveling that road to equality, \n     traveling to that convention? Frederick Douglass, the former \n     slave and great abolitionist, was on his way there and he \n     described the participants as ``few in numbers, moderate in \n     resources, and very little known in the world. The most we \n     had to connect us was a firm commitment that we were in the \n     right and a firm faith that the right must ultimately \n     prevail.'' In the wagons and carriages, on foot or horseback, \n     were women like Rhoda Palmer. Seventy years later in 1918, at \n     the age of one-hundred and two, she would cast her first \n     ballot in a New York state election.\n       Also traveling down that road to equality was Susan Quinn, \n     who at fifteen will become the youngest signer of the \n     Declaration of Sentiments. Catharine F. Stebbins, a veteran \n     of activism starting when she was only twelve going door to \n     door collecting anti-salvery petitions. She also, by the way, \n     kept an anti-tobacco pledge on the parlor table and asked all \n     her young male friends to sign up. She was a woman truly \n     ahead of her time, as all the participants were.\n       I often wonder, when reflecting back on the Seneca Falls \n     Convention, who of us--men and women--would have left our \n     homes, our families, our work to make that journey one \n     hundred and fifty years ago. Think about the incredible \n     courage it must have taken to join that procession. Ordinary \n     men and women, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, \n     husbands and wives, friends and neighbors. And just like \n     those who have embarked on other journeys throughout American \n     history, seeking freedom or escapings religious or political \n     persecution, speaking out against slavery, working for labor \n     rights. These men and women were motivated by dreams of \n     better lives and more just societies.\n       At the end of the two-day convention, one hundred people, \n     sixty-eight women and thirty-two men, signed the Declaration \n     of Sentiments that you can now read on the wall at Wesleyan \n     Chapel. Among the signers were some of the names we remember \n     today: Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, Martha \n     Wright and Frederick Douglass and young Charlotte Woodward. \n     The ``Seneca Falls 100,'' as I like to call them, shared the \n     radical idea that America fell far short of her ideals stated \n     in our founding documents, denying citizenship to women and \n     slaves.\n       Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who is frequently credited with \n     originating the idea for the Convention, knew that women were \n     not only denied legal citizenship, but that society's \n     cultural values and social structures conspired to assign \n     women only one occupation and role, that of wife and mother. \n     Of course, the reality was always far different. Women have \n     always worked, and worked both in the home and outside the \n     home for as long as history can record. And even though \n     Stanton herself had a comfortable life and valued deeply her \n     husband and seven children, she knew that she and all other \n     women were not truly free if they could not keep wages they \n     earned, divorce an abusive husband, own property, or vote for \n     the political leaders who governed them. Stanton was \n     inspired, along with the others who met, to rewrite our \n     Declaration of Independence, and they boldly asserted, ``We \n     hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women \n     are created equal.''\n       ``All men and all women.'' It was the shout heard around \n     the world, and if we listen, we can still hear its echoes \n     today. We can hear it in the voices of women demanding their \n     full civil and political rights anywhere in the world. I've \n     heard such voices and their echoes from women, around the \n     world, from Belfast to Bosnia to Beijing, as they work to \n     change the conditions for women and girls and improve their \n     lives and the lives of their families. We can even hear those \n     echoes today in Seneca Falls. We come together this time not \n     by carriage, but by car or plane, by train or foot, and yes, \n     in my case, by bus. We come together not to hold a \n     convention, but to celebrate those who met here one hundres \n     and fifty years ago, to commemorate how far we have traveled \n     since then, and to challenge ourselves to persevere on the \n     journey that was begun all those many years ago.\n       We are, as one can see looking around this great crowd, men \n     and women, old and young, different races, different \n     backgrounds. We come to honor the past and imagine the \n     future. That is the theme the President and I have chosen for \n     the White House Millennium Council's efforts to remind and \n     inspire Americans as we approach the year 2000. This is my \n     last stop on the Millennium Council's tour to Save \n     America's Treasures--those buildings, monuments, papers \n     and sites--that define who we are as a nation. They \n     include not only famous symbols like the Star Spangled \n     Banner and not only great political leaders like George \n     Washington's revolutionary headquarters, or creative \n     inventors like Thomas Edison's invention factory, but they \n     include also the women of America who wrote our nation's \n     past and must write its future.\n       Women like the ones we honor here and, in fact, at the end \n     of my tour yesterday, I learned that I was following \n     literally in the footsteps of one of them, Lucretia Mott, \n     who, on her way to Seneca Falls, stopped in Auburn to visit \n     former slaves and went on to the Seneca Nations to meet with \n     clan mothers, as I did.\n       Last evening, I visited the home of Mary Ann and Thomas \n     M'Clintock in Waterloo, where the Declaration of Sentiments \n     was drafted, and which the Park Service is planning to \n     restore for visitors if the money needed can be raised. I \n     certainly hope I can return here sometime in the next few \n     years to visit that restoration.\n       Because we must tell and retell, learn and relearn, these \n     women's stories, and we must make it our personal mission, in \n     our everyday lives, to pass these stories on to our daughters \n     and sons. Because we cannot--we must not--ever forget that \n     the rights and opportunities that we enjoy as women today \n     were not just bestowed upon us by some benevolent ruler. They \n     were fought for, agonized over, marched for, jailed for and \n     even died for by brave and persistent women and men who came \n     before us.\n       Every time we buy or sell or inherit property in our own \n     name--let us thank the pioneers who agitated to change the \n     laws that made that possible.\n       Every time, every time we vote, let us thank the women and \n     men of Seneca Falls, Susan B. Anthony and all the others, who \n     tirelessly crossed our nation and withstood ridicule and the \n     rest to bring about the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.\n       Every time we enter an occupation--a profession of our own \n     choosing and receive a paycheck that reflect earnings equal \n     to a male colleague, let us thank the signers and women like \n     Kate Mullaney, who's house I visited yesterday, in Troy, New \n     York.\n       Every time we elect a woman to office--let us thank ground \n     breaking leaders like Jeannette Rankin and Margaret Chase \n     Smith, Hattie Caraway, Louise Slaughter, Bella Abzug, Shirley \n     Chisholm--all of whom proved that a woman's place is truly in \n     the House, and in the Senate, and one day, in the White \n     House, as well.\n\n[[Page S9063]]\n\n       And every time we take another step forward for justice in \n     this nation--let us thank extraordinary women like Harriet \n     Tubman, whose home in Auburn I visited yesterday, and who \n     escaped herself from slavery, and, then risked her life, time \n     and again, to bring at least two hundred other slaves to \n     freedom as well.\n       Harriet Tubman's rule for all of her underground railroad \n     missions was to keep going. Once you started--no matter how \n     scared you got, how dangerous it became--you were not allowed \n     to turn back. That's a pretty good rule for life. It not only \n     describes the women who gathered in Wesleyan Chapel in 1848, \n     but it could serve as our own motto for today. We, too, \n     cannot turn back. We, too, must keep going in our commitment \n     to the dignity of every individual--to women's rights as \n     human rights. We are on that road of the pioneers to Seneca \n     Falls, they started down it 150 years ago. But now, we too, \n     must keep going.\n       We may not face the criticism and derision they did. They \n     understood that the Declaration of Sentiments would create no \n     small amount of misconception, or misrepresentation and \n     ridicule; they were called mannish women, old maids, \n     fanatics, attacked personally by those who disagreed with \n     them. One paper said, ``These rights for women would bring a \n     monstrous injury to all mankind.'' If it sounds familiar, \n     it's the same thing that's always said when women keep going \n     for true equality and justice.\n       Those who came here also understood that the convention and \n     the Declaration were only first steps down the road. What \n     matters most is what happens when everyone packs up and goes \n     back to their families and communities. What matters is \n     whether sentiment and resolutions, once made, are fulfilled \n     or forgotten. The Seneca Falls one hundred pledged themselves \n     to petition, and lit the pulpit and used every \n     instrumentality within their power to affect their subjects. \n     And they did. But they also knew they were not acting \n     primarily for themselves. They knew they probably would not \n     even see the changes they advocated in their own lifetime. In \n     fact, only Charlotte Woodward lived long enough to see \n     American women finally win the right to vote.\n       Those who signed that Declaration were doing it for the \n     girls and women--for us--those of us in the twentieth \n     century.\n       Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote a letter to her daughters \n     later in life enclosing a special gift and explaining why. \n     ``Dear Maggie and Hattie, this is my first speech,'' she \n     wrote, ``it contains all I knew at that time; I give this \n     manuscript to my precious daughters in the hopes that they \n     will finish the work that I have begun.'' And they have. Her \n     daughter, Harriot Blatch, was the chief strategist of the \n     suffrage movement in New York. Harriot's daughter, Nora \n     Barney, was one of the first women to be a civil engineer. \n     Nora's daughter, Rhoda Jenkins, became an architect. Rhoda's \n     daughter, Colleen Jenkins-Sahlin is an elected official in \n     Greenwich, Connecticut. And her daughter, Elizabeth is a \n     thirteen-year-old, who wrote about the six generations of \n     Stantons in a book called, 33 Things Every Girl Should Know.\n       So, far into the twentieth century, the work is still being \n     done; the journey goes on. Now, some might say that the only \n     purpose of this celebration is to honor the past, that the \n     work begun here is finished in America, that young women no \n     longer face legal obstacles to whatever education or \n     employment choices they choose to pursue. And I certainly \n     believe and hope all of you agree that we should, everyday, \n     count our blessings as American women.\n       I know how much change I have seen in my own life. When I \n     was growing up back in the fifties and sixties, there were \n     still barriers that Mrs. Stanton would have recognized-- \n     scholarships I couldn't apply for, schools I couldn't go \n     to, jobs I couldn't have--just because of my sex. Thanks \n     to federal laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \n     Title 9, and the Equal Pay Act, legal barriers to equality \n     have fallen.\n       But if all we do is honor the past, then I believe we will \n     miss the central point of the Declaration of Sentiments, \n     which was, above all, a document about the future. The \n     drafters of the Declaration imagined a different future for \n     women and men, in a society based on equality and mutual \n     respect. It falls to every generation to imagine the future, \n     and it is our task to do so now.\n       We know that, just as the women 150 years ago knew, that \n     what we imagine will be principally for our daughters and \n     sons in the 21st century. Because the work of the Seneca \n     Falls Convention is, just like the work of the nation itself, \n     it's never finished, so long as there remain gaps between our \n     ideals and reality. That is one of the great joys and \n     beauties of the American experiment. We are always striving \n     to build and move toward a more perfect union, that we on \n     every occasion keep faith with our founding ideals, and \n     translate them into reality. So what kind of future can we \n     imagine together.\n       If we are to finish the work begun here--then no American \n     should ever again face discrimination on the basis of gender, \n     race or sexual orientation anywhere in our country.\n       If we are to finish the work begun here--then $0.76 in a \n     woman's paycheck for every dollar in a man's is still not \n     enough. Equal pay for equal work can once and for all be \n     achieved.\n       If we are to finish the work begun here--then families need \n     more help to balance their responsibilities at work and at \n     home. In a letter to Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton \n     writes, ``Come here and I will do what I can to help you with \n     your address, if you will hold the baby and make the \n     pudding.'' Even then, women knew we had to have help with \n     child care. All families should have access to safe, \n     affordable, quality child care.\n       If we are to finish the work begun here--then women and \n     children must be protected against what the Declaration \n     called the ``chastisement of women,'' namely domestic abuse \n     and violence. We must take all steps necessary to end the \n     scourge of violence against women and punish the perpetrator. \n     And our country must join the rest of the world, as so \n     eloquently Secretary Albright called for on Saturday night \n     here in Seneca Falls, ``Join the rest of the world and ratify \n     the convention on the elimination of discrimination against \n     women.''\n       If we are to finish the work begun here--we must do more \n     than talk about family values, we must adopt policies that \n     truly value families--policies like a universal system of \n     health care insurance that guarantees every American's access \n     to affordable, quality health care. Policies like taking all \n     steps necessary to keep guns out of the hands of children and \n     criminals. Policies like doing all that is necessary at all \n     levels of our society to ensure high quality public education \n     for every boy or girl no matter where that child lives.\n       If we are to finish the work begun here--we must ensure \n     that women and men who work full-time earn a wage that lifts \n     them out of poverty and all workers who retire have financial \n     security in their later years through guaranteed Social \n     Security and pensions.\n       If we are to finish the work begun here--we must be \n     vigilant against the messages of a media-driven consumer \n     culture that convinces our sons and daughters that what brand \n     of sneakers they wear or cosmetics they use is more important \n     that what they think, feel, know, or do.\n       And if we are to finish the work begun here--we must, above \n     all else, take seriously the power of the vote and use it to \n     make our voices heard. What the champions of suffrage \n     understood was that the vote is not just a symbol of our \n     equality, but that it can be, if used, a guarantee of \n     results. It is the way we express our political views. It is \n     the way we hold our leaders and governments accountable. It \n     is the way we bridge the gap between what we want our nation \n     to be and what it is.\n       But when will the majority of women voters of our country \n     exercise their most fundamental political right? Can you \n     imagine what any of the Declaration signers would say if they \n     learned how many women fail to vote in elections? They would \n     be amazed and outraged. They would agree with a poster I saw \n     in 1996. On it, there is a picture of a woman with a piece of \n     tape covering her mouth and under it, it says, ``Most \n     politicians think women should be seen and not heard. In the \n     last election, 54 million women agreed with them.''\n       One hundred and fifty years ago, the women at Seneca Falls \n     were silenced by someone else. Today, women, we silence \n     ourselves. We have a choice. We have a voice. And if we are \n     going to finish the work begun here we must exercise our \n     right to vote in every election we are eligible to vote in.\n       Much of who women are and what women do today can be traced \n     to the courage, vision, and dedication of the pioneers who \n     came together at Seneca Falls. Now it is our responsibility \n     to finish the work they began. Let's ask ourselves, at the \n     200th anniversary of Seneca Falls, will they say that today's \n     gathering also was a catalyst for action? Will they say that \n     businesses, labor, religious organizations, the media, \n     foundations, educators, every citizen in our society came to \n     see the unfinished struggle of today as their struggle?\n       Will they say that we joined across lines of race and \n     class, that we raised up those too often pushed down, and \n     ultimately found strength in each other's differences and \n     resolved in our common cause? Will we, like the champions at \n     Seneca Falls, recognize that men must play a central role in \n     this fight? How can we ever forget the impassioned plea of \n     Frederick Douglas, issued in our defense of the right to \n     vote?\n       How can we ever forget that young legislator from Tennessee \n     by the name of Harry Burns, who was the deciding vote in \n     ratifying the 19th Amendment. He was planning on voting \n     ``no,'' but then he got a letter from his mother with a \n     simple message. The letter said, ``Be a good boy Harry and do \n     the right thing.'' And he did! Tennessee became the last \n     state to ratify, proving that you can never ever overestimate \n     the power of one person to alter the course of history, or \n     the power of a little motherly advice.\n       Will we look back and see that we have finally joined the \n     rest of the advanced economies by creating systems of \n     education, employment, child care and health care that \n     support and strengthen families and give all women real \n     choices in their lives.\n       At the 200th anniversary celebration, will they say that \n     women today supported each other in the choices we make? Will \n     we admit once and for all there is no single cookie cutter \n     model for being a successful and fulfilled woman today, that \n     we have so many choices? We can choose full-time motherhood \n     or no family at all or like most of us, seek to strike a \n     balance between our family and our work, always trying to do \n     what is right in our lives. Will we leave our children a \n     world where it is self-evident that all men and women, boys \n     and girls are created equal?\n\n[[Page S9064]]\n\n     These are some of the questions we can ask ourselves.\n       Help us imagine a future that keeps faith with the \n     sentiments expressed here in 1848. The future, like the past \n     and the present, will not and cannot be perfect. Our \n     daughters and granddaughters will face new challenges which \n     we today cannot even imagine. But each of us can help prepare \n     for that future by doing what we can to speak out for justice \n     and equality for women's rights and human rights, to be on \n     the right side of history, no matter the risk or cost, \n     knowing that eventually the sentiments we express and the \n     causes we advocate will succeed because they are rooted in \n     the conviction that all people are entitled by their creator \n     and by the promise of America to the freedom, rights, \n     responsibilities, and opportunity of full citizenship. That \n     is what I imagine for the future. I invite you to imagine \n     with me and then to work together to make that future a \n     reality.\n       Thank you all very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9061-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL STEVEN DOUGLAS JACQUES, USAF\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the dedication, \npublic service, and patriotism of Lieutenant Colonel Steven Douglas \nJacques, United States Air Force, on the occasion of his retirement \nafter over twenty years' of faithful service to our nation. Colonel \nJacques' strong commitment to excellence will leave a lasting impact on \nthe vitality of our nation's Space and Intelligence capabilities, \ncommanding the admiration and respect of his military and civilian \ncolleagues.\n  The son of a retired Air Force Senior Master Sergeant, Steve received \nhis commission through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps \nprogram while attending Texas Tech. He was first assigned at the Space \nand Missiles Systems Organization (SAMSO), Los Angeles AFS, CA in 1977, \nwhere he served as financial manager for the Expendable Space Launch \nVehicles Program.\n  In 1981, Steve was assigned to HQ Systems Command, Andrews AFB, MD, \nas Budget Officer for Space Programs. In 1983, he was transferred to \nHeadquarters, United States Air Force, Pentagon, as the Program Element \nMonitor for the Expendable Launch Vehicles programs. During this time, \nthe Department reversed its policy and determined that placing sole \nreliance on the Space Shuttle for access to space for military \nsatellites presented an unacceptable national security risk. \nConsequently, new ELV programs were created, and Steve became the Air \nForce's first Titan IV ``PEM.''\n  Following his Pentagon tour, Steve was transferred back to Los \nAngeles AFB in 1985, where he was assigned as Deputy Program Control \nDirector for Expendable Launch Vehicles. Months after Steve's arrival, \nthe tragic loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger stimulated the nation's \n``Space Launch Recovery,'' in which the Defense Department determined \nits satellites would eventually be removed from the shuttle and placed \nback on ELVs for launch. Steve led the efforts in costing and packaging \nthe $10 billion Space Launch Recovery, which was fully approved by the \nDepartment and the Congress.\n  In 1988, Steve returned to the Pentagon, serving in the Special \nPrograms Division of the Directorate for Space Programs, Assistant \nSecretary of the Air Force for Acquisition. Following duty as Executive \nOfficer to the Director of Space Programs, Steve was assigned to the \nAssistant Secretary of the Air Force for Legislative Liaison in 1991, \nwhere he served as the Air Force's liaison officer to the Congress for \nall Space Programs.\n  During the winter and spring of 1994, Steve attended the Defense \nSystems Management College at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, receiving his \nLevel III certification in Program Management. Following school, Steve \nwas assigned to the National Reconnaissance Office, where he first \nserved as Director of Program Control for a classified program, and \nlater as the SIGINT and Launch Comptroller. While serving as \nComptroller, Steve played a formidable leadership role during the NRO's \n``forward funding'' recovery.\n  In 1996, Steve began his final assignment in the Office of the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, where he served \nas Special Assistant for Space, Intelligence, and Special Programs. In \nthis capacity, he represented the Secretary of Defense on a myriad of \nimportant and sensitive matters with the U.S. Congress, most notably \nthe tragic Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, legislation forming \nthe National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and a number of highly \nclassified issues.\n  Colonel Steve Jacques' military awards include the Defense Superior \nService Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force \nMeritorious Service Medal, and the Air Force Commendation Medal.\n  Mr. President, our nation, the Department of Defense, the United \nStates Air Force, and Lieutenant Colonel Steve Jacques' family--his \nwife Debbie and daughters Tracy and Amy--can truly be proud of this \noutstanding officer's many accomplishments. While his honorable service \nwill be genuinely missed in the Department of Defense, it gives me \ngreat pleasure to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Steve Jacques before my \ncolleagues and wish him the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9064-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9064-S9065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE: HCFA CAUTIOUS IN ENFORCING FEDERAL HIPAA \n              STANDARDS IN STATES LACKING COMPARABLE LAWS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am releasing a new U.S. \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) report entitled, ``Private Health \nInsurance: HCFA Cautious in Enforcing Federal HIPAA Standards in States \nLacking Comparable Laws'' (GAO/HEHS-98-217R). The GAO report warns that \nFederal involvement in the role traditionally reserved for the States \nmay complicate oversight of private health insurance.\n  In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, thereby endorsing \nthe arrangement where States are responsible for the regulation of \ninsurance. Federal regulation of health insurance in States establishes \na new precedent. In light of current proposals that would establish \nadditional Federal standards of health insurance, I believe we must \ncarefully consider the appropriate role for Federal and State \nregulatory agencies in monitoring and enforcing compliance with \ninsurance standards.\n  As the Chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I have \nclosely monitored the implementation of the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) since its enactment \nin the last Congress. HIPAA set new Federal standards for access, \nportability, and renewability for group health plans under the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and for health insurance \nissuers which have traditionally been regulated by the States. Under \nthe HIPAA framework, in the event that a State does not enact the new \nFederal standards for health insurance issuers, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration (HCFA) is required to enforce the provisions.\n  As of June 30, 1998, officials in California, Rhode Island, and \nMissouri have voluntarily notified HCFA that they have failed to enact \nHIPAA standards in legislation. Two other States, Massachusetts and \nMichigan, are widely known to have not enacted conforming legislation, \nbut the States have not notified HCFA, nor has HCFA initiated the \nformal process to determine if Federal regulation is necessary.\n  In the case of the five States where HIPAA standards have not been \nadopted, HCFA must assume several functions normally reserved for State \ninsurance regulators. These duties include (1) responding to consumer \ninquiries and complaints; (2) providing guidance to carriers about \nHIPAA requirements; (3) obtaining and reviewing carriers' product \nliterature and policies for compliance with HIPAA standards; (4) \nmonitoring carrier marketing practices for compliance; and (5) imposing \ncivil monetary penalties on carriers who fail to comply with HIPAA \nrequirements.\n  HCFA officials have acknowledged that their agency has thus far taken \na minimalist approach to regulating HIPAA, and they attribute the \nagency's limited involvement to a lack of experienced staff, as well as \nuncertainty about its actual regulatory authority. Originally assuming \nthat States would adopt HIPAA legislation, HCFA reassigned only a small \nnumber of staff members to address enforcement issues. The reassigned \nstaff generally came from other divisions and\n\n[[Page S9065]]\n\nhad no previous experience in private health insurance.\n  As of July, 1998, HCFA has authorized 40 full-time staff members to \nwork on all HIPAA-related issues. HCFA officials acknowledge that these \nnew staffers will likely focus on responding to consumer inquiries and \ncomplaints. Officials also have said that they will need additional \nstaff to conduct any further enforcement activities. They are unable to \nstate their precise staff needs, because they are inexperienced in the \nregulation of private health insurance and are uncertain of their long-\nterm responsibility. At a Labor Committee oversight hearing in March, \nHCFA Commissioner Nancy-Ann Min DeParle testified that HCFA may require \nan additional range of enforcement tools, beyond the already-\nestablished civil monetary penalties.\n  Without formal notification of noncompliance from Massachusetts and \nMichigan, HCFA must undertake a determination process to establish the \nStates' nonconformance, officially providing the authority for HCFA to \nbecome involved. HCFA officials have not yet undertaken this effort, \nwhich they characterize as cumbersome.\n  The GAO has found that HCFA's review of carriers' product literature \nand policy compliance would be restricted by the Paperwork Reduction \nAct. The Act establishes a process for approval of any collection \ninformation, defined as collecting information from 10 or more persons. \nHCFA would need to obtain approval from the Office of Management and \nBudget for anything other than obtaining information in response to \nspecific consumer complaints. To fulfill its regulatory duties, HCFA \nwould need OMB approval to collect information from all carriers on a \nregular basis, which most State insurance commissioners already do.\n  In California, Missouri, and Rhode Island, oversight of health \nbenefits is divided between State insurance regulators and the \nDepartment of Labor. The addition of HCFA to the array of regulatory \nbodies may further fragment and complicate the regulation of private \nhealth insurance. This framework may lead to duplication, yet none of \nthese agencies will have complete authority for regulating health \ninsurance products. Ms. DeParle herself has stated that this would be a \nchallenging ``patchwork quilt of Federal and State enforcement.''\n  One example is in Missouri, where the State's present small-group, \nguaranteed-issue requirement is applicable to groups of 3 to 25 \nindividuals. HIPAA's small-group guaranteed-issue standard applies to \npolicies sold to groups of 2 to 50 individuals. Therefore, in Missouri, \nHCFA has the responsibility for ensuring that carriers guarantee \nproducts to groups the size of 2 individuals, and groups the size of 26 \nto 50 individuals.\n  The legislative history of HIPAA makes clear that the Congress \nintended that the effect of this legislation would be that all States \nwould come quickly into compliance with the stated Federal standards, \neliminating the need for active regulation by HCFA. We are now \nconfronted by the fact that in at least five States HCFA must initiate \nenforcement with respect to group to individual market coverage.\n  At a March 19, 1998, Labor Committee HIPAA oversight hearing, Don \nMoran of the Lewin Group testified: ``The lesson I take from HIPAA is \nthat, in the complex world of health benefits regulation, the Federal \ngovernment cannot tidily insert itself as a policy-setter in a \npredominantly State-administered regulatory regime.'' In establishing \nminimum Federal standards for health insurance, we may have to develop \nalternative approaches to the HIPAA framework so as to encourage States \nto meet Federal standards and retain enforcement responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, the GAO report concludes that HCFA's regulatory role \nis likely to expand as it assumes enforcement responsibilities to \nensure States' compliance with HIPAA. It is clear that HCFA's new \nregulatory responsibilities will increase the burden faced by health \ncarriers and regulators, and will add to the confusion faced by \nconsumers, who try to navigate through the intricate system of \noverlapping and duplicative regulatory jurisdiction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9064-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9065-S9066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FEDERAL ACTIVITIES INVENTORY REFORM (FAIR) ACT\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nappreciation to the members of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and the Committee's staff, for the time and effort they have \ndedicated to developing a consensus on my legislation to codify the 40+ \nyear Federal policy on reliance on the private sector.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, I introduced S. 314, the ``Freedom \nfrom Government Competition Act.'' This legislation was an attempt to \nestablish in statute a workable process by which Federal agencies \nutilize the private sector for commercially available products and \nservices. As we have learned from our research and from House and \nSenate hearings, as early as 1932 Congress first became aware of the \nfact that the Federal government was starting and carrying out \nactivities that are commercial in nature, and that government \nperformance of these activities resulted in unfair competition with the \nprivate sector. In 1954, a bill to address this issue passed the House \nand was reported by the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the \nSenate. At that time, the Eisenhower Administration indicated that it \ncould resolve the issue administratively. Bureau of the Budget Bulletin \n55-4 was issued and the Senate suspended action on the legislation. The \nbudget document established a federal policy of reliance on the private \nsector. It noted that the free enterprise system was the strength of \nour economy and that the government should not compete with private \nbusiness. Rather, the Bulletin said, the government should rely on the \nprivate sector for those good and services that could be obtained \nthrough ordinary business channels.\n  That policy is now found in OMB Circular A-76 and has been endorsed \nby every Administration, of both parties, since 1955. However, the \ndegree of enthusiasm for implementation of the Circular has varied from \none Administration to another. In fact, the issue of government \ncompetition has become so pervasive that all three sessions of the \nWhite House Conference on Small Business, held in 1980, 1986, and 1995, \nranked this as one of the top problems facing America's small \nbusinesses. According to testimony we received, it is estimated that \nmore than half a million Federal employees are engaged in activities \nthat are commercial in nature.\n  However, the purpose of my legislation is not to bash Federal \nemployees. I believe most are motivated by public service and are \ndedicated individuals. However, from a policy standpoint, I believe we \nhave gone too far in defining the role of government and the private \nsector in our economy. Because A-76 is non-binding and discretionary on \nthe part of agencies, too many commercial activities have been started \nand carried out in Federal agencies. Because A-76 is not statutory, \nCongress has failed to exercise its oversight responsibilities. \nFurther, by leaving ``make or buy'' decisions to agency managers, there \nhas been no means to assure that agencies ``govern'' or restrict \nthemselves to inherently governmental activities, rather than produce \ngoods and services that can otherwise be performed in and obtained from \nthe private sector.\n  Among the problems we have seen with Circular A-76 is (1) agencies do \nnot develop accurate inventories of activities (2) they do not conduct \nthe reviews outlined in the Circular, (3) when reviews are conducted \nthey drag out over extended periods of time and (4) the criteria for \nthe reviews are not fair and equitable. These are complaints we heard \nfrom the private sector, government employees, and in some cases from \nboth.\n  In the 1980's our former colleague Senator Warren Rudman first \nintroduced the ``Freedom from Government Competition Act'' in the \nSenate. Later, Representative John J. Duncan, Jr. (R-TN) introduced \nsimilar legislation the House. I was a cosponsor of that bill when I \nserved in the other body. Upon my election to the Senate in the 104th \nCongress, I introduced the companion to Rep. Duncan's bill in the \nSenate.\n  On Wednesday, July 15, 1998 the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \nunanimously reported a version of S. 314 that is a result of many \nmonths of discussion among both the majority and minority on the \ncommittee, OMB, Federal employee unions and private sector \norganizations. The amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by\n\n[[Page S9066]]\n\nChairman Fred Thompson and approved by the Committee is a consensus and \na compromise.\n  It is important to point out that the bill that I introduced in the \n104th Congress was an attempt to codify the original 1955 policy that \nthe government should rely on the private sector. After a hearing on \nthat bill was convened by Senator Stevens, during his tenure as \nChairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, it became clear to \nme that it was necessary to add to the bill the concept of competition \nto determine whether government performance or private sector \nperformance resulted in the best value to the American taxpayer. While \nS. 314 as introduced, and H.R. 716 introduced in the House, was still \nentitled the ``Freedom from Government Competition Act'', it in fact \nnot only did not prevent government competition, but it mandated it. \nThis was not a change that private sector organizations came to \ncomfortably support. However, inasmuch as OMB Circular A-76 changed \nthrough the years from its original 1955 philosophical statement to its \nmore recent iterations that required public-private competition, I \nrevised my bill when introducing it last year to include such \ncompetitions, provided they in fact are conducted and that when \nconducted, they are fair and equitable comparisons carried out on a \nlevel playing field.\n  I would also hasten to add that the measure reported by the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which I hope will be promptly approved \nby the full Senate, is significantly different than S. 314 as \nintroduced. While S. 314 as introduced was opposed by the \nAdministration and by the Federal employee unions, the compromise \nmeasure reported from the committee is not opposed by these groups.\n  Mr. President, this is important legislation that I believe will \ntruly result in a government that works better and costs less. \nCertainly government agency officials should have the ability to \ncontract with the private sector for goods and services needed for the \nconduct of government activities. This bill will not inhibit ability. \nHowever, it should not be the practice of the government to carry on \ncommercial activities for months, years, even decades without reviewing \nwhether such activities can be carried out in a more cost effective or \nefficient manner by the private sector. I believe that the drive to \nreduce the size and scope of the federal government will be successful \nonly when we force the government to do less and allow the private \nsector to do more.\n\n  During the course of our hearings, it became abundantly clear that \nthere are certain activities that the Federal government has performed \nin-house which can and should be converted to the private sector. Areas \nsuch as architecture an engineering, surveying and mapping, laboratory \ntesting, information technology, and laundry services have no place in \ngovernment. These activities should be promptly transitioned to the \nprivate sector.\n  Thre are other activities in which a public-private competition \nshould be conducted to determined which provider can deliver the best \nvalue to the taxpayer. This includes base and facility operation, \ncampgrounds an auctioning.\n  There are several key provisions in the bill upon which I would like \nto comment. In particular, section 2(d) requires the head of an agency \nto review the activities on his or her list of commercial activities \n``within a reasonable time''. OMB strongly opposed a legislative \ntimetable for conducting these reviews. As a result of the compromise \nlanguage on this matter, it will be incumbent on OMB to make certain \nthese reviews are indeed conducted in a reasonable time frame. These \nreviews should be scheduled and completed within moths, not years. I \nwill personally monitor progress on this matter, as will the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I urge OMB to exercise strong oversight \nto assure timely implementation of this requirement by the agencies.\n  This provision also requires that agencies use a ``competitive \nprocess'' to select the source of goods or services. In my view, this \nterm has the same meaning as ``competitive procedures'' as defined in \nFederal law (10 U.S.C. 2302(2) and 41 U.S.C. 259 (b)). To the extent \nthat a government agency competes for work under this section of the \nbill, the government agency will be treated as any other contractor or \nofferor in order to assure that the competition is conducted on a level \nplaying field.\n  Another issue that I have been concerned about is the proliferation \nof Interservice Support Agreement's (ISSA's). Under the ``FAIR'' Act, \nconsistent with the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535), items on the \ncommercial inventory that have not been reviewed may not be performed \nfor another federal agency. In addition, any item on the inventory \ncannot be provided to state or local governments unless there is a \ncertification, pursuant to the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 \nU.S.C. 6505(a)).\n  Enactment of the ``FAIR'' Act is a major achievement because it \ncodifies a process to assure government reliance on the private sector \nto the maximum extent feasible. Further, it will put some teeth into \nExecutive Order 12615 by President Reagan, which is still on the books \ntoday.\n  Again, I thank the members of the Senate Government Affairs Committee \nand the Committee's staff, for all of the hard work necessary to forge \nthis compromise. I look forward to working with them on thorough \nCongressional oversight on the implementation of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9065-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO THOMAS ESTES\n\n Mr. SMITH, of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \npay tribute to the life and accomplishments of Thomas Clifford Estes of \nNew Ipswich, New Hampshire, who recently passed away at the age of 66.\n  The family of Tom Estes can take comfort and pride in the way that he \nlived his life. Born on November 28, 1931 to the late Bedford and Emily \nEstes of New York, Tom graduated from Erasmus Hall High School and \nlater studied at RCA Institute.\n  Following his father's distinguished example in serving this country \nin the armed forces, Tom joined the United States Navy in 1951, shortly \nafter the outbreak of the Korean War. For three of his four years of \nactive duty, Tom served on the U.S.S. Tarawa, a Navy aircraft carrier \nthat entered the Asian war zone. He earned a number of Navy awards, \nincluding the Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, \nthe China Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Good \nConduct Medal and the Navy Occupation Service Medal.\n  Tom's service to the nation was commendable, not just during the \nKorean War, but throughout his thirty-two years of Federal civil \nservice. He began his career as a quality assurance engineer for the \nUnited States military in Florida and later moved to Dallas, Texas, \nbefore settling in New Hampshire in 1967. Upon his retirement, Tom was \nrecognized by the Defense Logistics Agency for his contributions.\n  Tom was admired for his integrity, dedication to his community and \npositive demeanor. He remained a devoted husband to his wife, Mary, \nthroughout almost thirty-five years of marriage and helped care for his \ndisabled sister for many years. An accomplished chess player, Tom also \nenjoyed baseball and studied the law. He and his wife ran a small, \ntwenty-acre farm in New Ipswich for many years. He was a man who cared \nabout the needs of others and his community, whose sense of humor, \ncheery smile and knack for storytelling will be missed by all who knew \nhim.\n  Tom will be buried with military honors at Arlington National \nCemetery on Monday, August 3, 1998. I extend my deepest sympathies to \nhis wife, Mary, his daughter, Evelyn, his sons Thomas and Peter, and \nhis sister, Nancy. It is my great pleasure to pay tribute to this \nspecial American in the official Record of the annals of \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9066-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9066-S9067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE EFFORTS OF THE WOMEN'S MOTORCYCLIST FOUNDATION, INC., TOWARDS THE \n                         CURE FOR BREAST CANCER\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate The \nWomen's Motorcyclist Foundation, Inc. for their continued efforts in \nthe battle against breast cancer. The fight against breast cancer is \none that everyone must join\n\n[[Page S9067]]\n\nin together. Unfortunately, Mr. President, New York has one of the \nhighest incidence rates of breast cancer in the country.\n  Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women with over \n2.6 million living with it presently in the United States. The Women's \nMotorcyclist Foundation has taken an active role in trying to solve \nthis problem by sponsoring a nation wide tour across 44 states and \nfifty major metropolitan areas in an event known as the Pony Express \nTour.\n  The women cyclists began as a group to inspire other women to take up \nthe avocation of and interest in the motorcycling industry. As the \norganization grew, the foundation decided to enlarge its perspective by \nvoting in 1992 to use its collective passion for motorcycling as a \nvehicle to raise money for breast cancer research. It was further \ndecided that the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation would be the \nmain recipient of the Foundation's efforts. The Komen Foundation is the \nlargest private organization in the world whose sole aim is eradicating \nbreast cancer.\n  The Women's Motorcyclist Foundation is comprised of a large number of \nnational, international and independent clubs and associations. Each \norganization provides the particular activities, values, character and \npersonality that works for its particular membership. Having always \nbeen a non-profit organization, it has recently evolved into a tax-\nexempt charitable organization. The Women's Motorcyclist Foundation is \npresently articulating its Mission Statement through activities to \nraise money for the Komen Foundation.\n  During the summer of 1993, the Foundation participated in the Women's \nArctic Tour and raised $25,000 for the Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. \nThen, in 1996, these women raised 12 times that amount when they rode \nacross the nation in the Pony Express Tour. The Pony Express Tour '98 \nhas set a goal of $500,000 for the 500,000 lives that will be lost to \nthis deadly disease in just this decade. The Women's Motorcyclist \nFoundation has also been recognized with two national awards. The \nAmerican Motorcyclist Association and the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer \nFoundation both honored them for their positive contributions and \ndedication to a cure.\n  The Women's Motorcyclist Foundation is to be commended for their \ndedication and desire to find a cure for this deadly disease. It is \nthrough their concentrated efforts that they provide both the money and \nawareness to American women in the fight against breast cancer. I am \nextremely proud of The Women's Motorcyclist Foundation's commitment and \nI encourage other organizations and associations throughout the country \nto search for innovative ways of not only providing funds for breast \ncancer research, but information and awareness to women of all ages so \nthat we may be able to detect this cancer in its earliest stages. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/27/senate-section/article/S9066-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Assets for Independence \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Economic well-being does not come solely from income, \n     spending, and consumption, but also requires savings, \n     investment, and accumulation of assets because assets can \n     improve economic independence and stability, connect \n     individuals with a viable and hopeful future, stimulate \n     development of human and other capital, and enhance the \n     welfare of offspring.\n       (2) Fully \\1/2\\ of all Americans have either no, \n     negligible, or negative assets available for investment, just \n     as the price of entry to the economic mainstream, the cost of \n     a house, an adequate education, and starting a business, is \n     increasing. Further, the household savings rate of the United \n     States lags far behind other industrial nations, presenting a \n     barrier to economic growth.\n       (3) In the current tight fiscal environment, the United \n     States should invest existing resources in high-yield \n     initiatives. There is reason to believe that the financial \n     returns, including increased income, tax revenue, and \n     decreased welfare cash assistance, resulting from individual \n     development accounts will far exceed the cost of investment \n     in those accounts.\n       (4) Traditional public assistance programs concentrating on \n     income and consumption have rarely been successful in \n     promoting and supporting the transition to increased economic \n     self-sufficiency. Income-based domestic policy should be \n     complemented with asset-based policy because, while income-\n     based policies ensure that consumption needs (including food, \n     child care, rent, clothing, and health care) are met, asset-\n     based policies provide the means to achieve greater \n     independence and economic well-being.\n\n     SEC. 403.

Each report shall include both program \n     and participant information and shall specify for the period \n     covered by the report the following information:\n       (1) The number of individuals making a deposit into an \n     individual development account.\n       (2) The amounts in the Reserve Fund established with \n     respect to the project.\n       (3) The amounts deposited in the individual development \n     accounts.\n       (4) The amounts withdrawn from the individual development \n     accounts and the purposes for which such amounts were \n     withdrawn.\n       (5) The balances remaining in the individual development \n     accounts.\n       (6) The savings account characteristics (such as threshold \n     amounts and match rates) required to stimulate participation \n     in the demonstration project, and how such characteristics \n     vary among different populations or communities.\n       (7) What service configurations of the qualified entity \n     (such as peer support, structured planning exercises, \n     mentoring, and case management) increased the rate and \n     consistency of participation in the demonstration project and \n     how such configurations varied among different populations or \n     communities.\n       (8) Such other information as the Secretary may require to \n     evaluate the demonstration project.\n       (b) Submission of Reports.--The qualified entity shall \n     submit each report required to be prepared under subsection \n     (a) to--\n       (1) the Secretary; and\n       (2) the Treasurer (or equivalent official) of the State in \n     which the project is conducted, if the State or a local \n     government or a tribal government committed funds to the \n     demonstration project.\n       (c) Timing.--The first report required by subsection (a) \n     shall be submitted not later than 60 days after the end of \n     the calendar year in which the Secretary authorized the \n     qualified entity to conduct the demonstration project, and \n     subsequent reports shall be submitted every 12 months \n     thereafter, until the conclusion of the project.\n\n     SEC. 413. SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Authority To Terminate Demonstration Project.--If the \n     Secretary determines that a qualified entity under this title \n     is not operating the demonstration project in accordance with \n     the entity's application or the requirements of this title \n     (and has not implemented any corrective recommendations \n     directed by the Secretary), the Secretary shall terminate \n     such entity's authority to conduct the demonstration project.\n       (b) Actions Required Upon Termination.--If the Secretary \n     terminates the authority to conduct a demonstration project, \n     the Secretary--\n       (1) shall suspend the demonstration project;\n       (2) shall take control of the Reserve Fund established \n     pursuant to section 407;\n       (3) shall make every effort to identify another qualified \n     entity (or entities) willing and able to conduct the project \n     in accordance with the approved application (or, as modified, \n     if necessary to incorporate the recommendations) and the \n     requirements of this title;\n       (4) shall, if the Secretary identifies an entity (or \n     entities) described in paragraph (3)--\n       (A) authorize the entity (or entities) to conduct the \n     project in accordance with the approved application (or, as \n     modified, if necessary, to incorporate the recommendations) \n     and the requirements of this title;\n       (B) transfer to the entity (or entities) control over the \n     Reserve Fund established pursuant to section 407; and\n       (C) consider, for purposes of this title--\n       (i) such other entity (or entities) to be the qualified \n     entity (or entities) originally authorized to conduct the \n     demonstration project; and\n       (ii) the date of such authorization to be the date of the \n     original authorization; and\n       (5) if, by the end of the 1-year period beginning on the \n     date of the termination, the Secretary has not found a \n     qualified entity (or entities) described in paragraph (3), \n     shall--\n       (A) terminate the project; and\n       (B) from the amount remaining in the Reserve Fund \n     established as part of the project, remit to each source that \n     provided funds under section 405(c)(4) to the entity \n     originally authorized to conduct the project, an amount that \n     bears the same ratio to the amount so remaining as the amount \n     provided by the source under section 405(c)(4) bears to the \n     amount provided by all such sources under that section.\n\n     SEC. 414. EVALUATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 10 months after the date of \n     enactment of this title, the Secretary shall enter into a \n     contract with an independent research organization to \n     evaluate, individually and as a group, all qualified entities \n     and sources participating in the demonstration projects \n     conducted under this title.\n       (b) Factors To Evaluate.--In evaluating any demonstration \n     project conducted under this title, the research organization \n     shall address the following factors:\n       (1) The effects of incentives and organizational or \n     institutional support on savings behavior in the \n     demonstration project.\n       (2) The savings rates of individuals in the demonstration \n     project based on demographic characteristics including \n     gender, age, family size, race or ethnic background, and \n     income.\n       (3) The economic, civic, psychological, and social effects \n     of asset accumulation, and how such effects vary among \n     different populations or communities.\n       (4) The effects of individual development accounts on \n     savings rates, homeownership, level of postsecondary \n     education attained, and self-employment, and how such effects \n     vary among different populations or communities.\n       (5) The potential financial returns to the Federal \n     Government and to other public sector and private sector \n     investors in individual development accounts over a 5-year \n     and 10-year period of time.\n       (6) The lessons to be learned from the demonstration \n     projects conducted under this title and if a permanent \n     program of individual development accounts should be \n     established.\n       (7) Such other factors as may be prescribed by the \n     Secretary.\n       (c) Methodological Requirements.--In evaluating any \n     demonstration project conducted under this title, the \n     research organization shall--\n       (1) for at least one site, use control groups to compare \n     participants with nonparticipants;\n       (2) before, during, and after the project, obtain such \n     quantitative data as are necessary to evaluate the project \n     thoroughly; and\n       (3) develop a qualitative assessment, derived from sources \n     such as in-depth interviews, of how asset accumulation \n     affects individuals and families.\n       (d) Reports by the Secretary.--\n       (1) Interim reports.--Not later than 90 days after the end \n     of the calendar year in which the Secretary first authorizes \n     a qualified entity to conduct a demonstration project under \n     this title, and every 12 months thereafter until all \n     demonstration projects conducted under this title are \n     completed, the Secretary shall submit to Congress an interim \n     report setting forth the results of the reports submitted \n     pursuant to section 412(b).\n       (2) Final reports.--Not later than 12 months after the \n     conclusion of all demonstration projects conducted under this \n     title, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a final report \n     setting forth the results and findings of all reports and \n     evaluations conducted pursuant to this title.\n       (e) Evaluation Expenses.--The Secretary shall expend such \n     sums as may be necessary,\n\n[[Page S9082]]\n\n     but not more than 2 percent of the amounts appropriated under \n     section 416 for a fiscal year, to carry out the purposes of \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. 415. TREATMENT OF FUNDS.\n\n       Of the funds deposited in individual development accounts \n     for eligible individuals only the funds deposited by the \n     individuals (including interest accruing on those funds) may \n     be considered to be the income, assets, or resources of the \n     individuals, for purposes of determining eligibility for, or \n     the amount of assistance furnished under, any Federal or \n     federally assisted program based on need.\n\n     SEC. 416. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     title, $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, \n     2002, and 2003 to remain available until expended.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate, on \nbehalf of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, S. 2206, the \nCoats Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998.\n  This legislation is truly the result of a significant bi-partisan \neffort. We have worked closely with members of the committee to make \nimportant changes in program focus and in our expectations for \nmeasurable outcomes.\n  Few federal programs engender the kind of positive feelings as do the \nprograms we are discussing today: Head Start, the Community Services \nBlock Grant, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, and a new \nprogram--close to my heart, the Assets for Independence Act.\n  These programs all have one important thing in common--they represent \nthe federal government at its best, forging public and private \npartnerships to combat the effects of poverty, and unleashing the vast \nresources of one of our most important assets--the local community.\n  Whether in a Head Start classroom, a food bank, or a community action \nagency, the programs we are about to reauthorize provide a valuable \nlink between families and the services and opportunities they need.\n  I have had the privilege of visiting a number of Head Start programs \nin my own state, and have found at each one a common thread--the \ncommitment of staff and of parents to be there for their children. In \nHead Start centers across America, parents serve as volunteers, as \nteachers, as aides, in whatever capacity they are needed. Many have \ntold me that thanks to Head Start, they have gone on to higher \neducation. Thanks to Head Start, their children have hope for a future. \nI say that it is thanks to their commitment as parents that their \nchildren's hopes have been realized.\n  S. 2206 continues this legacy--and does so in a way that supports the \nfamily as a unit. Head Start is a program serving children in families. \nCSBG is a program serving families in communities. And Assets for \nIndependence makes it possible for families to become fully self \nsufficient.\n  Before I briefly discuss the specifics issues addressed in the \nlegislation I want to thank members of the Committee (Senator Dodd, \nKennedy, Jeffords, DeWine and McConnell in particular) and of course \ntheir staffs for their commitment to this process being open and bi-\npartisan. I think the fruit of all of our efforts is in the bill we \nwill vote on today. I also would also like Karen Spar from the \nCongressional Research Service who has been tireless in her efforts to \nprovide support to my staff and Liz Aldridge-King from the Office of \nLegislative Counsel who worked virtually around the clock to get this \nbill out on time. Thank you to all who contributed to this effort.\n  Head Start is a program that has been identified as one with enormous \npotential in giving children an opportunity to realize their full \npotential; however, it has been a program which has experienced varying \ndegrees of quality. With the 1994 reauthization, Congress and the \nAdministration formed an important partnership to devise ways to make \nprogram quality a primary focus. Since the last reauthorization, the \nHead Start Bureau has offered technical assistance, resources, and \nsupport to Head Start programs that are committed to pursuing \nexcellence--and terminated the grants of those programs that were \nexperiencing significant program deficiencies. Close to 100 Head Start \ngrantees have been terminated or have relinquished their grants since \n1994.\n  S. 2206 takes further steps to ensure quality and to make sure that \nHead Start students attain the goal of school readiness by expanding \nthe use of quality improvement funds to provide staff training related \nto the promotion of language skills and literacy growth of children and \nthe acquisition of English for children from non-English-speaking \nbackgrounds and by requiring the establishment of education performance \nstandards to ensure school readiness and that children develop a \nminimum level of literacy awareness and understanding. Further, the \nSecretary is directed to develop outcome-based performance measures and \nto apply those measures to local grantees when evaluating program \neffectiveness. Under this scenario, consistent poor performers would be \nidentified, offered technical assistance, and if they failed to correct \nthe deficiency--terminated and their grant re-competed.\n  We have responded to concerns that Head Start programs be able to \nmore fully respond to emerging needs of working families for full-day, \nfull-year services by significantly enhancing the collaboration grant \nprogram in current law by requiring active collaboration between Head \nStart, the State liaison appointed by the Governor, and other early \ncare and education programs within the State. We have attempted to \neliminate barriers to effective collaboration and have instructed the \nSecretary to design an administrative structure whereby additional \nbarriers that are identified can be addressed. Taken together, these \nprovisions should make it much easier for States to include Head Start \nin unified planning regarding early care and education services at the \nstate and local level.\n  To respond to the recent research on the importance of early brain \ndevelopment, we have included the President's request for an expansion \nof the Early Head Start program from 7.5 percent in FY 1999 to 10 \npercent in FY 2003. We have required the Secretary to set aside a \nportion of these funds to provide technical assistance to ensure the \nmaintenance of program quality and given the Secretary the authority to \nreduce the set aside amounts, if necessary to avoid a reduction in \nregular Head Start services or quality.\n  To respond to the issue of improved teacher competence, we have added \na new section to the section in the law pertaining to staff \nqualifications to ensure that each head start classroom has a teacher \nwith demonstrated competency to perform certain functions. This was \ndone in lieu of mandating additional degrees such as 2 or 4 year \ncollege degree which is not the norm for preschools in America, and \nwhich in fact, are not a good measure for teacher competence. Rather, \nwe focus on specific demonstrated competencies which must first be \nachieved in order to qualify as a teacher.\n  During the last reauthorization in 1994 we required every Head Start \nclassroom to have a teacher with at least Child Development Associate \ncredential. With near accomplishment of that goal we wanted to make \nsure that waivers to this requirement would only be given in the most \nlimited circumstance. Therefore we allow a 180-day waiver which will \nonly be available where a Head Start agency could document that it had \nunsuccessfully attempted to recruit an individual with the required \ncredential, certificate or degree. Such a waiver would be for an \nindividual who is enrolled in a program that grants the appropriate \ncredential, and who will receive the appropriate credential within 180 \ndays of beginning employment as a Head Start teacher.\n  In response to concerns raised by the General Accounting Office and \nothers about the lack of reliable research on Head Start which can be \nused to determine its effectiveness, we have authorized a national \nimpact study of Head Start and also included, at the request of Senator \nDeWine, several smaller comparative studies of children participating \nin head start with eligible children who did not participate in Head \nStart or other preschool programs. These studies should yield very \nvaluable information about how this program is working, and whether \nHead Start is, as we all hope and believe it is, making a difference.\n  Title II of S. 2206 authorizes the Community Services Block Grant. \nThis program had not been updated since 1981 when CSBG came into \nexistence as a block grant. Therefore, we have done a complete redraft \nof this program to bring it current and to make some very\n\n[[Page S9083]]\n\nimportant changes to program structure and goals.\n  First, we have established some very specific program goals which \ninclude strengthening community capabilities for planning, coordinating \nand supporting innovative responses to community needs and conditions. \nCSBG is an excellent example of what can happen when Washington gets \nout of the way and allows local communities to design effective \nresponses to local problems. Ninety percent of the funds provided under \nthis act must be passed through by the State to local eligible entities \nwhich include a variety of public and non-profit organizations, \ncommunity action agencies, and faith-based neighborhood organizations.\n\n  Second, we have established a mechanism for state monitoring of \neligible entities to determine whether such entities meet performance \ngoals, administrative standards, financial management requirements, and \nother requirements of the state. Each State will be required to \nparticipate in a performance measurement system, although they will be \nable to choose from a menu of priorities to reflect the current program \nthey are instituting at the local level.\n  Third, we have grand fathered in all existing public CAPS but are \nrequiring that any new public CAPS may come into existence only if \nthere is no private, nonprofit organization identified or qualified to \nserve as the CSBG recipient. Like private nonprofit agencies, public \nCAPS would have to agree to administer their program through a local \ntripartite board and ensure adequate low income representation on it.\n  Fourth, with respect to the discretionary programs under CSBG, we \nhave reauthorized the Community Economic Development program, the Rural \nCommunity Development program, National Youth Sports, and Community \nFood and Nutrition. We have created a new program called Neighborhood \nInnovation Projects for grants to neighborhood based, private non-\nprofits to test or assist in the development of new approaches or \nmethods of dealing with community problems. These grants may be used \nfor a variety of purposes including gang interventions, addressing \nschool violence, or any other purposes that are identified by the \ncommunity as a problem resulting from poverty and consistent with the \npurposes of this CSBG.\n  Title III are reauthorizes the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram at the current level of $2 billion for each of the fiscal years \n1999 through 2004. The amount available for leveraging is reduced from \n$50,000,000 to $30,000,000 except in any year in which appropriations \nfall below $1.4 billion at which time the leveraging pot goes back to \n$50,000,000.\n  The most significant change in this program is the addition of a new \nsection which clarifies the criteria by which LIHEAP funds can be \nreleased in an emergency or natural disaster. Currently, there is an \narbitrary standard for determining an emergency or natural disaster, \nthis language will rectify this problem by listing standards under \nwhich funds may be released which may include: significant home energy \nsupply shortage or disruption; a significant increase in the cost of \nhome energy, as determined by the secretary; a significant increase in \nhome energy disconnections reported by a utility, a state regulatory \nagency, or another agency with necessary data; significant increase in \nparticipation in a public benefit program such as the food stamp \nprogram; a significant increase in unemployment or layoffs; or any \nother event meeting criteria as the secretary may determine to be \nappropriate.\n  This is an important addition, and I would like to thank Senators \nJeffords and Kennedy for their leadership in this matter.\n  Finally, Title IV establishes a five year demonstration program to \ndetermine the social, civic, psychological and economic effects that \nIndividual Development Account (IDA) savings accounts can have on low \nincome individuals and their families.\n  In some respects, IDAs are like IRAs for the working poor. They are \ndedicated savings accounts that can be used for purchasing a first \nhome, post-secondary education, or capitalizing a business. These \ninvestments are associated with extremely high rates of return that \nhave the potential to bring a new level of economic and personal \nsecurity to families and communities.\n  The individual or family deposits whatever they can save (typically \n$5-$20 a month) in the account. The sponsoring organization ``matches'' \nthat deposit with funds provided by local churches and service \norganizations, corporations, foundations, and state or local \ngovernments.\n  The intent of this demonstration program is to encourage participants \nto develop and reaffirm strong habits for saving money. To assist this, \nsponsor organizations will provide participating individuals and \nfamilies intensive financial counseling and counseling to develop \ninvestment plans for education, home ownership, and entrepreneurship.\n  In addition, participating welfare and low-income families build \nassets whose high return on investment propels them into independence \nand stability. The community will also benefit from the significant \nreturn on an investment in IDAs: we can expect welfare rolls to be \nreduced; tax receipts to increase; employment to increase; and local \nenterprises and builders can expect increased business activity. \nNeighborhoods will be rejuvenated as new microenterprises and increased \nhome renovation and building drive increased employment and community \ndevelopment.\n  In fact, it is estimated that an investment of $100 million in asset \nbuilding through these individual accounts would generate :7,050 new \nbusinesses; 68,799 new jobs; $730 million in additional earnings; \n12,000 new or rehabilitated homes; $287 million in savings and matching \ncontributions and earnings on those accounts; 188 million in increased \nassets for low-income families 6,600 families removed from welfare \nrolls 12,000 youth graduates from vocational education and college \nprograms; 20,000 adults obtaining high school, vocational, and college \ndegrees.\n  IDAs are planned or now available on a small scale across the \ncountry, including Indiana, Illinois, Virginia, Oregon, and Iowa. The \nAssets for Independence Act has been developed after a review of \nnumerous, similar, successful programs, and most notably one run by the \nEastside Community Investments community development corporation in \nIndianapolis, Indiana. This provision incorporates a number of \nprotections developed with their assistance and based on their \nexperience.\n  Mr. President, taken together, I think we have an excellent package \nof programs designed to reauthorize programs which have been vital to \nmany low-income individuals and communities. These programs are for the \nmost part locally designed and controlled and offer unique \nopportunities for self-sufficiency and enhanced community involvement.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has turned to \nconsideration of the Community Opportunities, Accountability, Education \nand Training Services Act of 1998--the COATS Act--which reauthorizes \nthe Human Services Act. This legislation, sponsored by Senator Coats, \nSenator Dodd, myself, and Senator Kennedy, was voted unanimously out of \nthe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on June 24, 1998, and \ncontinues to have broad bipartisan support.\n  This bill includes the reauthorization of three of our most important \nprograms providing services and assistance to the neediest of \nAmericans: the Head Start program, the Community Services Block Grant, \nand the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. It also includes a \nnew program, the Assets for Independence Act, to empower these citizens \ninto achieving economic independence.\n  This legislation draws upon over thirty years of experience with \nthese programs. While each of these programs is working--and working \nwell--there are clearly some things that we can be doing better. So \nwhile this bill leaves present law largely intact, it does include some \nimportant changes to make these programs more accountable and more \neffective in carrying out the specific tasks that we have asked of \nthem.\n  The Head Start Program has been instrumental in helping many children \nenter school ready to learn. It goes beyond child care, by providing \nmedical, dental, and other services to children enrolled in the \nprogram. However, I believe that its major contribution has been to \nsupport parents in their role as\n\n[[Page S9084]]\n\nthe primary teacher for their children. Head Start is a comprehensive \nservice program that has made a difference in the lives of so many \nchildren and their parents.\n  While most of us know the difference that Head Start has made in the \nlives of millions of children and their parents, it is important that \nwe continue to ensure that the program is the very best it can be. This \nreauthorization includes a major evaluation and research initiative. I \nbelieve this research will help demonstrate the positive impact of high \nquality, comprehensive services for children and families. More \nimportantly, this initiative can provide the American people with more \ninformation about how best to help prepare all of our children for the \nchallenges that lie ahead in the next century.\n  We also have increased funding for the Infant and Toddler Head Start \nprogram. Although this program is relatively new, the emerging research \non early brain development clearly indicates that tremendous benefits \ncan be gained by supporting parents in their efforts to be good parents \nfor their children. Few young parents have the family and community \nsupport networks that were once such an integral part of raising \nchildren. The Infant and Toddler program strives to re-create those \nnetworks in order to help mothers and fathers better meet the \nchallenges of parenthood.\n  One of the more controversial changes in this year's reauthorization \nis the inclusion of for-profit providers as eligible grantees for Head \nStart. Yet, working with Senators Kennedy and Dodd, we were able to \nreach an acceptable compromise that makes clear exactly what is and is \nnot allowed. Briefly, the legislation opens up the competitive process \nto another segment of child care and human service provider . However, \nit does not require the Secretary to award a grant to a non-profit \nentity. It does not lessen the requirements and standards that any Head \nStart program must meet. I do not believe that, by virtue of an \norganization's tax status, it is either more or less capable of \nproviding the high quality of services which we require of all Head \nStart grantees. I am pleased that an agreement on this issue has been \nreached.\n  The second major program authorized under this legislation is the \nCommunity Services Block Grant. This program provides funding which \nenables States to work with their communities to reduce poverty. That's \nan easily defined goal, but getting there takes lots of work. Because \nit is locally-driven and community-based, the CSBG is used differently \nin every community--drawing upon available strengths and resources to \nmeet the unique needs of each.\n  In Vermont, the CSBG serves communities all across our state, from \nBrattleboro to the Northeast Kingdom. Under the current formula, \nVermont receives a little more than $2.6 million in CSBG funds. Whether \nit's using CSBG dollars to help the underprivileged learn new job \nskills or go back to school, or helping families become self-sufficient \nby teaching them how to search for affordable housing or simply work \nwithin a budget, I think countless families and communities in our \nState would agree that the initial investment has earned priceless \nreturns. Communities are using those dollars to make a difference.\n  For this reason, I am pleased that we have made only minor \nadjustments in these programs, and that most of these changes make some \nnecessary improvements that will allow us to better determine the \neffectiveness of CSBG programs. For example, this bill requires states \nto monitor their grantees to determine whether they are meeting \nperformance goals, administrative standards, and financial management \nrequirements. The bill also establishes state and federal \naccountability and reporting provisions, and requires grantees to \nparticipate in a performance measurement system. Presently, grantees \nmay participate in this system, but are not required to do so. The \nchanges in this bill mean that we will be able to better monitor the \nprogress of programs and measure the effectiveness of the delivery of \nprograms.\n  I want to point out, however, that I am aware that through a \ntechnical change that we were unable to remove at the last minute, this \nlegislation contains language repealing the Community Economic \nDevelopment program. This was brought to my attention, and to the \nattention of the Ranking Member, last Friday, and we have taken steps \nto remedy the situation. Our House colleagues have indicated their bill \nwill not repeal this provision, and Senator Coats and I have pledged \nthat we will remove the language repealing this program in conference. \nThis is a matter that was due to a technical oversight only; it is \ncertainly not the intention of the committee to end this program, and I \nam grateful for the assistance of Congressman Bill Goodling and his \nstaff in helping us resolve this matter satisfactorily.\n  I also want to mention that I know there was some concern about \nallowing faith-based organizations to participate as direct grantees in \nCSBG programs. I want to be clear that this bill does not allow faith-\nbased organizations any priority in becoming grantees. It simply says \nthat they may participate. If a faith-based organization receives a \ngrant, it will still be expected to run quality programs and operate in \nthe same way any other grantee would, including establishing a tri-\npartite board to administer the programs. Further, there is language in \nthis bill essentially grandfathering in existing community action \nagencies as eligible grantees, so there should not be a concern that \ncurrent grantees will suddenly find themselves jockeying for funding. \nIf they are delivering good services, they may continue to do so.\n  There was also some concern over including a new program, the \nNeighborhood Innovation Project, as an allowable activity under the \ndiscretionary account because it would mean less funds for the other \nprograms authorized in the account. Let me explain why this is not the \ncase--and, in fact, if Congressional appropriators follow the \nauthorization carefully, there should be more funding for programs \nwithin this account.\n  Under current law, the discretionary account receives a set-aside of \nnine percent of the CSBG funds. Presently, the discretionary account \nonly contains the community economic development programs and the rural \ncommunity development programs as allowable expenditures. However, at \nappropriations time, the appropriators have been folding the National \nYouth Sports program (NYSP) and the Community Food and Nutrition Act \n(CFNP) into the nine percent set-aside. What the law actually says--and \nwhat this bill reinforces--is that the NYSP and the CFNP program are \nboth worthwhile programs that should receive separately appropriated \nline-items; they should not be competing with the community economic \ndevelopment and rural community development initiatives to receive a \npart of that nine-percent set-aside. I hope the appropriators will \nfollow the authorization and limit the programs funded through the \nnine-percent set-aside.\n  Under the new bill, we maintain the NYSP and CFNP as separate \naccounts that do not compete with programs in the discretionary \naccount. I know this all sounds like maudlin bookkeeping, but what it \nmeans is that, even with the new Neighborhood Innovation Project \nincluded in the discretionary account, there are now only three \nprograms among which the discretionary account can be divided, not \nfour. That should mean funding can go a little bit further for these \nprograms. Meanwhile, the NYSP and CNFP can receive their own separate \nstreams of funding. That is clearly our intent.\n  While on the subject of the NYSP, let me just mention one change we \nmade in the current program to ensure a more comprehensive delivery of \nservices. What this legislation would do is link youth who participate \nin this five week summer program to community-based youth services that \ncan serve their needs all year long.\n  The third major program reauthorized in this legislation is the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which, due to the \nforward-funded nature of the program, is authorized through 2004. The \nprogram provides assistance to 4.3 million low-income households to \nhelp families pay their heating and cooling bills. LIHEAP is a state \nblock grant program that has faced more than its fair share of budget \ncuts. In fact, I am very dismayed that appropriators on the House side \nhave voted to slash funding for the program.\n\n[[Page S9085]]\n\n  Our bill reauthorizes the program at the $2 billion level and \ncontinues to authorize funds to be released on an emergency basis by \nthe President. On that subject, we have included language that \nclarifies the criteria under which LIHEAP funds can be released during \nan emergency or natural disaster. Last winter, when much of Northern \nNew England was devastated by a 100-year ice storm, 53 Senators \nunsuccessfully wrote to the President asking him to release LIHEAP \nemergency funds. Our bill includes language that will help states \nobtain funds when they face similar natural or economic disasters.\n  Finally, this bill authorizes a new, $25 million program known as the \nAssets for Independence Act. This new program builds upon the \nIndividual Development Accounts that we allowed under welfare reform. \nThe Assets for Independence Act would help qualified, poor individuals \nestablish individual savings accounts that they can later use for post-\nsecondary education, purchase of a first home, or business \ncapitalization.\n  In Vermont, we are already operating a program very much like this \nunder our welfare waiver. However, Vermont's program does not look \nexactly like what is in this bill, and I want to make it clear that \nVermont, and any other state, may continue to operate existing IDA \nprograms as they deem fit, using their existing resources. States do \nnot have to make their program look like those established in this bill \nunless they specifically apply for the funding made available under \nthis section. What is in this bill does not override any existing IDA \nprogram. Knowing this, I am pleased we were able to include this new \nsection in the bill, as I know it has been a priority for Senator \nCoats, and I commend him for working with me to ensure that Vermont can \ncontinue to run its existing programs.\n  This legislation is the result of months of hard work, negotiation, \nand compromise. This is a very good bill that deserves the support of \nthe Senate. It reinforces what works in these programs, and discards \nwhat does not. It continues the mission that we began many years ago of \nempowering communities to help their most vulnerable populations, and \nit does this in a responsible manner.\n  I am pleased with the bipartisan atmosphere that has surrounded this \nbill so far, and I look forward to finishing the reauthorization in the \nsame manner. I want to thank Senator Coats for his excellent work on \nthis important legislation. As always, it is a pleasure working with \nhim, and I want to commend him for his hard work in crafting this \ncompromise. Senator Kennedy and Senator Dodd were instrumental in \ndrafting this bill and moving it through the committee, and each has \nleft a definite mark on this legislation. I also appreciate the \nvaluable input from Senators DeWine and Ashcroft in drafting some key \nprovisions of the bill.\n  There are a number of staff who have worked very hard on this \nlegislation who deserve recognition for their efforts. In particular, I \nwant to thank Stephanie Monroe with Senator Coats--her effort was \nextraordinary; Suzanne Day, Jeanne Ireland and Jim Fenton with Senator \nDodd; Stephanie Robinson with Senator Kennedy; and Geoff Brown, \nKimberly Barnes-O'Connor and Brian Jones of my staff. In addition, I \nwant to note the contributions of Vince Ventimiglia with Senator Coats \non the IDA section; Aaron Grau with Senator DeWine for his help with \nmigrant and seasonal Head Start; Robin Bowen with Senator McConnell for \nher assistance on the CED correction; and Denzel McGuire with Chairman \nGoodling for her help in assuring a smooth debate with the House.\n  Again, Mr. President, I am proud of this legislation and of all the \nwork that has gone into it. I look forward to working with our House \ncolleagues to approve final legislation, with broad bipartisan support, \nbefore the 105th Congress adjourns for the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Coats and \nSenator Jeffords for their exemplary work on the Coats Act's \nreauthorization of Head Start, Community Services Block Grants. Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance, and the new authorization for an \nIndividual Development Account demonstration.\n  In particular, I appreciate their commitment to address a matter of \nserious concern to me regarding provisions that would unintentionally \nimpact the Rural Development Loan Fund currently administered by the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  The Coats Act includes the repeal of section 407 of the Human \nServices Reauthorization Act of 1986 and the Community Economic \nDevelopment Act. These statutory repeals were included to achieve a \nreasonable clarification of the statutory authority held by the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Upon further examination of \nthese provisions after the committee mark-up, we discovered that this \nhouse-keeping action for HHS would eliminate provisions essential to \nthe USDA's administration of the Rural Development Loan Fund, a lending \nprogram that has provided vital economic support to several communities \nin Kentucky.\n  I understand that during conference, Senators Coats and Jeffords have \nagreed to recede to the House position and drop the Coats Act \nprovisions that repeal section 407 and CEDA.\n  Mr. COATS. That is correct. We were attempting to do a significant \ncleanup of a statute that has not been modified in any real way since \n1981. We were informed that these programs were obsolete and had not \nreceived funding from the Department of Health and Human Services for \nsome time. We therefore, as part of a package of technical corrects \nidentified to bring the statute into conformity, repealed these two \nprograms. Senator McConnell was very helpful in bringing this error to \nour attention and we have given him our assurance that it will be \ncorrected in Conference with the House.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Indiana for his commitment to \nresolve this issue, and greatly appreciate his understanding of the \nRural Development Loan Fund's importance to Kentucky's efforts to spur \neconomic growth in rural areas.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am very pleased that today we take up the \nreauthorization of the the Community Opportunities, Accountability, \nTraining and Educational Services (COATS) Act, which includes Head \nStart, LIHEAP and the Community Service Block Grant. This bill is \nsponsored by Chairman Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator Coats, and \nmyself, and was reported unanimously by the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee a month ago. This strong record of bipartisan support is a \nclear statement of how we all view these crucial programs. But it is \nalso a testament to the leadership of Senator Coats on this \nlegislation. As a tribute, we on the Committee insisted on naming this \nimportant bill after him.\n  This bill is fundamentally about improving the reach of opportunity \nin America to all of our citizens.\n  Head Start will serve over 830,000 children and their families this \nyear; nearly 6,000 in my home state of Connecticut. These families and \ntheir children will receive access to the nation's leading child \ndevelopment program. Head Start focuses on the needs of the whole \nchild. Inherently, we know that a child cannot be successful if he or \nshe has unidentified health needs, if his or her parents are not \ninvolved in their education, and if he or she is not well-nourished or \nwell-rested. Head Start is the embodiment of those concerns and works \neach day to meet children's critical needs.\n  The bill before us today further strengthens the Head Start program: \nWe continue the expansion of the Early Head Start program, increasing \nthe set aside for this program to 10 percent in FY 2002. Anyone who has \npicked up a magazine or newspaper within the last year knows how vital \nthe first three years of a child's life are to their development. This \nprogram, which we established in 1994, extends comprehensive, high-\nquality services to these young children and their parents, to make \nsure the most is made of this window of opportunity.\n  We have added new provisions to encourage collaboration within states \nand local communities as well as within individual Head Start programs \nto expand the services they offer to families to full-day and full-year \nservices, where appropriate, and to leverage other child care dollars \nto improve quality and better meet family needs.\n\n[[Page S9086]]\n\n  We emphasize the importance of school readiness and literacy \npreparation in Head Start. While I think this has always been a \ncritical part of Head Start, this bill ensures that gains will continue \nto be made in this area.\n  Mr. President, this bill puts Head Start on strong footing as we \napproach the 21st Century. It is a framework within which Head Start \ncan continue to grow to meet the needs of more children and their \nfamilies. What is unfortunate is that we cannot guarantee more funding \nfor Head Start--I think it is shameful that there are waiting lists for \nHead Start and that only 40 percent of eligible children are served by \nthis program. And Early Head Start, which is admittedly a new program, \nserves just a tiny fraction of the infants and toddlers in need of \nthese services.\n  The President has set a laudable goal to reach 1 million children by \n2002. But I say we need to do more. We need a plan to serve 2 million \nchildren--all those eligible and in need of services--as soon as \npossible.\n  Some argue that meeting the goal of fully funding Head Start will be \ntoo costly. Yes, it will cost a great deal to get there. But my \nquestion is how much more will it cost not to get there?\n  Studies show us that children in quality early childhood development \nprograms, such as Head Start, start school more ready to learn than \ntheir non-Head Start counterparts. They are more likely to keep up with \ntheir classmates, avoid placement in special education, and graduate \nfrom high school. They are also less likely to become teenage mothers \nand fathers, go on welfare, or become involved in violence or the \ncriminal justice system.\n  How much does it cost when we don't see these benefits?\n  I know this is an issue for another place and another venue. But I am \nhopeful as we strengthen the program we can also strengthen our resolve \nto expand this successful program to more children and their families.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us also makes important changes to the \nCommunity Services Block Grant program. CSBG makes funds available to \nstates and local communities to assist low-income individuals and help \nalleviate the causes of poverty. One thousand local service providers--\nmainly Community Action Agencies--use these federal funds to address \nthe root causes of poverty within their communities. CSBG dollars are \nparticularly powerful because local communities have substantial \nflexibility in determining where these dollars are best spent to meet \ntheir local circumstances.\n  I have had the pleasure of visiting Community Action Agencies in \nConnecticut many times. They are exciting, vibrant places at the very \ncenter of their communities--filled with adults taking literacy and job \ntraining courses, children at Head Start centers, seniors with housing \nor other concerns, and youths participating in programs or volunteering \ntheir time.\n  To see clearly how critical the CSBG program is to the nation's low \nincome families, one only needs to look at the statistics. The CSBG \nprogram in 1995 served more than 11.5 million people, or one in three \nAmericans living in poverty. Three-quarters of CSBG clients have \nincomes that fall below the federal poverty guideline.\n  This bill recognizes the fundamental strength of this program and \nmakes modest changes to encourage broader participation by neighborhood \ngroups. In addition, it improves the accountability of local programs.\n  This bill also reauthorizes the vitally important Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. Nearly 4.2 million low-income \nhouseholds received LIHEAP assistance during FY1996, more than 70,000 \nhouseholds in Connecticut. One quarter of those assisted by LIHEAP \nfunds are elderly. Another 25 percent are individuals with \ndisabilities. I cannot overvalue the importance of this assistance--it \nis nearly as necessary as food and water to a low-income senior citizen \nor family with children seeking help to stay warm in the winter--or as \nwe have seen recently in the Southwest--to stay cool during the summer.\n  This bill makes no fundamental changes to the LIHEAP program. I am \nvery pleased we increase the authorization of the program to $2 \nbillion, which recognizes the great need for this help. I wish House \nappropriators, who eliminated the program earlier this month, shared \nthis commitment to meeting these most basic needs. We also put into \nplace a system to more accurately and quickly designate natural \ndisasters. Early disaster designation will allow for the more efficient \ndistribution of the critically important emergency LIHEAP funds, aiding \nStates devastated by a natural disaster.\n  This bill contains one new, important program--the Individual \nDevelopment Accounts, based on a bill offered by Senator Coats and \nSenator Harkin. Individual Development Accounts, or IDA's, are \ndedicated savings accounts for very low income families, similar in \nstructure to IRA's, that can be used to pay for post-secondary \neducation, buy a first home, or capitalize a business. This program is \na welcome addition to the Human Services Act family. The Assets for \nIndependence title will provide low-income individuals and families \nwith new opportunities to move their families out of poverty through \nsavings.\n  This is strong bill and it is a good bill. And I want to thank \nSenator Coats again for his committed leadership on this important \nbill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Human Services Reauthorization Act \nbefore us today is landmark legislation and is backed by a broad bi-\npartisan coalition. It represents legislation at its best, with Members \non both sides of the aisle working closely together and with the \nAdministration to achieve better results for America's children.\n  I commend Senator Jeffords, Senator Coats, and Senator Dodd for their \nleadership in making this bill a reality. Together we have produced \nlegislation that preserves and enhances these needed family programs \nwhile addressing the concerns that have been raised. Our bipartisan \ngoal is to take these worthwhile programs and make them even better.\n  The pending bill is an important step toward a more effective family \npolicy. This legislation consolidates, reorganizes, and reauthorizes \nservices for poor families and their children by investing in programs \nto strengthen families, promote child development, and build \ncommunities. In keeping with efforts to reinvent government, the Act \npromotes one-stop shopping by consolidating several existing \ncategorical programs into more comprehensive and coordinated programs. \nIt improves performance by developing outcome measures and monitoring \nprogress, and it puts families first by promoting self-sufficiency. We \nhave worked carefully to draft a bill that addresses the concerns of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important bill, and I urge my colleagues in the House, both \nDemocrat and Republican, to join together as we have to provide \nservices to America's families.\n\n\n                    Title I: Head Start Act of 1998\n\n  Title I of the bill reauthorizes Head Start while making improvements \nin this strong and effective program. The 1994 Act significantly \nimproved the quality and scope of Head Start services. The bill before \nus today recognizes these successes and builds on them.\n  Before we acted in 1994, the Carnegie Foundation had released a \nreport which called for a greater national effort to support low-income \nchildren, particularly those under age 3 who are at the greatest risk. \nThe period between birth and age three is critical to be a child's \ndevelopment. Synapses not formed in a child's brain period can never be \nformed later.\n  We responded to these findings by introducing the Early Head Start \nprogram to provide comprehensive services to families who qualify for \nHead Start and who have children under age 3. We introduced this \nprogram by phasing it in gradually over 4 years, and it is now \nproviding crucial services to 40,000 of the nation's neediest infants \nand toddlers.\n  The present bill continues to gradually expand this vital program, in \nkeeping with advice from experts on child development. Early Head Start \nwill be expanded to twice its size by 2002, so that 80,000 children can \nreceive these services. This expansion will still serve only 1 out of \nevery 25 eligible babies and toddlers, but it will give us more \nknowledge and experience on how to help most at this crucial period in \nchildren's lives.\n\n[[Page S9087]]\n\n  We have also added to Early Head Start a training and technical \nassistance fund which will enable the program to grow in quality. To \nmaximize its effectiveness, it is important to ensure the highest \npossible quality. The set-aside in Head Start has helped to maintain \nand improve the quality of these services, and Early Head Start needs \nsimilar safeguards.\n  In 1994, we also made significant improvements to Head Start by \nimplementing stringent quality standards. As a result, dozens of \nprograms not meeting these standards were closed down, and many more \nwere brought back to health and now serve as strong programs. Today, we \nbuild on these improvements by adding requirements that ensure that \nchildren with disabilities will receive services appropriate to their \nneeds and that Head Start centers will be physically accessible to \nchildren and their families. We have also sought more research, so that \nwe can continue to build on this program in the most effective ways \npossible in future years.\n  This legislation also includes three other priorities. It \nreauthorizes and amends the Community Services Block Grant and the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, and it creates demonstration \nprojects to study the benefits of Individual Development Accounts.\n\n\n          title ii: community services block grant act of 1998\n\n  This bill recognizes the strength of the Community Services Block \nGrant program and leaves it largely unchanged. I am proud to have been \na supporter of the Community Action Agencies funded under the CSBG \nblock grants as long as I have been in the Senate. Robert Kennedy, as a \nSenator, sponsored the original Community Development Corporation \nlegislation that is now funded under these block grants. Community \nAction Programs were created to respond to the complex social problems \nthat face low-income individuals, families, and communities. These \ncommunity-based public-private partnerships are a central part of the \nlow-income service delivery network. In reauthorizing the Community \nService Block Grant, we are promoting self sufficiency, family \nstability, and community revitalization.\n\n\n                           title iii: liheap\n\n  This legislation also reauthorizes the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program through the year 2004. For over four million LIHEAP \nbeneficiaries across the nation, including 112,000 in Massachusetts, \nthis program has made a major difference in the lives of thousands of \nworking families and elderly households. Last week in Texas, for \nexample, LIHEAP funds were made available to help families suffering \nfrom the triple-digit temperatures.\n  LIHEAP does more than just keep households warm in the winter and \ncool in the summer. It is also a lynchpin for self-sufficiency.\n  Many working parents are concerned about the health of their \nfamilies. Researchers at Boston City Hospital have found that higher \nutility bills during the coldest months force low-income families to \nspend less money on food--the so-called ``heat or eat'' effect.\n  Unfortunately, the House Appropriations Committee voted to eliminate \nfunding for this important program. Unless this funding is restored--\nand I am confident that it will be in the Senate--it will be a very \ncold Winter for millions of LIHEAP recipients across the nation.\n  By reauthorizing LIHEAP, the Senate will be placing this program on a \nsolid footing for the future. I am especially pleased that this \nlegislation includes provisions that I sponsored with Senators Jeffords \nand Senator Harkin to clarify the criteria for the President to release \nemergency LIHEAP funds, so that needed funds can help low-income \nfamilies adversely affected by hot or cold weather, ice storms, floods, \nearthquakes, and other natural disasters get through the emergency. In \naddition, it will enable the release of emergency LIHEAP funds if there \nis a significant increase in unemployment or home energy \ndisconnections.\n\n\n               title iv: individual development accounts\n\n  Finally, this bill establishes Independent Development Account \ndemonstration projects. This program will determine whether providing \nmatching funds to poor individuals using savings accounts is an \neffective way to encourage them to save for their futures and develop \nself sufficiency. States and towns with such programs have seen \nimpressive results. The demonstration projects in today's bill will \nenable us to see whether these programs can be effective nationwide.\n  This bipartisan bill puts families first. It is an excellent example \nof what happens when we work together in the interest of American \nfamilies. This legislation will benefit millions of families living in \npoverty, and will bring immeasurable benefits to our society as a \nwhole. I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the committee \nsubstitute be agreed to, the bill be read a third time, and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to S. 2206 appear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The veto message is as follows:\n\nTo the House of Representatives:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 1122, which would \nprohibit doctors from performing a certain kind of abortion. I am \nreturning H.R. 1122 for exactly the same reasons I returned an earlier \nsubstantially identical version of this bill, H.R. 1833, last year. My \nveto message of April 10, 1996, fully explains my reasons for returning \nthat bill and applies to H.R. 1122 as well. H.R. 1122 is a bill that is \nconsistent neither with the Constitution nor sound public policy.\n  As I have stated on many occasions, I support the decision in Roe v. \nWade protecting a woman's right to choose. Consistent with that \ndecision, I have long opposed late-term abortions, and I continue to do \nso except in those instances necessary to save the life of a woman or \nprevent serious harm to her health. Unfortunately, H.R. 1122 does not \ncontain an exception to the measure's ban that will adequately protect \nthe lives and health of the small group of women in tragic \ncircumstances who need an abortion performed at a late stage of \npregnancy to avert death or serious injury.\n  I have asked the Congress repeatedly, for almost 2 years, to send me \nlegislation that includes a limited exception for the small number of \ncompelling cases where use of this procedure is necessary to avoid \nserious health consequences. When Governor of Arkansas, I signed a bill \ninto law that barred third-trimester abortions, with an appropriate \nexception for life or health. I would do so again, but only if the bill \ncontains an exception for the rare cases where a woman faces death or \nserious injury. I believe the Congress should work in a bipartisan \nmanner to fashion such legislation.\n                                                  William J.
