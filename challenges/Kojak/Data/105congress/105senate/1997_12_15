The bill is known as the Asian Elephant \nConservation Act of 1997.

The bill would direct the \n     Secretary of the Interior to use amounts in the new fund to \n     finance eligible conservation efforts, which may include \n     specific projects such as research and education as well as \n     ongoing activities such as law enforcement. For this purpose, \n     S. 1287 would authorize appropriations to the fund of $5 \n     million for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2002. Also, the \n     Secretary would be authorized to accept and use donated funds \n     without further appropriation.\n       Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 1287 would result in \n     additional discretionary spending of about $10 million over \n     the 1998-2002 period (with the remainder of the authorized \n     $25 million estimated to be spent after 2002). The \n     legislation would affect direct spending and receipts by \n     allowing the Secretary to accept and spend donations; \n     therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. Any such \n     transactions, however, would involve minor, offsetting \n     amounts. S. 1287 contains no intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act of 1995 (UMRA) and would have no impact on the budgets of \n     state, local, or tribal governments.\n       Estimated Cost to the Federal Government: For purposes of \n     this estimate, CBO assumes that the entire amounts authorized \n     by S. 1287 will be appropriated for each of fiscal years 1998 \n     through 2002. Outlay estimates are based on obligation \n     patterns for similar programs, which indicate that the rate \n     of spending over the first few years of the new program would \n     be slow. The estimated budgetary impact of S. 1287 is shown \n     in the following table.\n\n                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION                   \n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAuthorization level..................      5      5      5      5      5\nEstimated outlays....................

Spending for the \n     conservation of Asian elephants would constitute a new \n     program in the federal budget; that is, there is no spending \n     for this activity under current law.\n       Enacting S. 1287 also would affect both receipts and direct \n     spending by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to \n     accept and use donations. CBO estimates that this provision \n     would increase federal receipts by less than $500,000 \n     annually once the conservation program has been established. \n     Because these receipts would be offset by additional direct \n     spending, the net impact of this provision on the federal \n     budget would be negligible in each year.\n       Pay-as-You-Go Considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 specifies pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. Although enacting S. 1287 would affect both \n     receipts and direct spending, CBO estimates that the amounts \n     involved would be less than $500,000 annually.\n       Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact: S. 1287 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA and would have no impact on the budgets of \n     state, local, or tribal governments.\n       Previous CBO Estimate: On September 17, 1997, CBO prepared \n     an estimate for H.R. 1787, a similar bill ordered reported by \n     the House Committee on Resources on September 10, 1997. The \n     two estimates are identical.\n       Estimate Prepared by: Deborah Reis.\n       Estimate Approved by: James R. Horney for Paul N.

Mr. President, on November 11, Mary McAleese was \ninaugurated as President of Ireland.\n  President McAleese was elected by the largest majority ever in an \nIrish Presidential election, and she is also the first President of \nIreland who is from Northern Ireland.\n  Having suffered personally from the troubles in Northern Ireland, \nPresident McAleese said in her inaugural address that the theme of her \nPresidency would be building bridges--between nationalists and \nunionists in Northern Ireland, and between the North and the South of \nIreland.\n  President McAleese will find many friends in the United States who \nshare her vision of cooperation. We look forward to working with her in \nthe years to come. I believe that all Members of the Congress concerned \nabout these issues will be interested in reading her eloquent inaugural \naddress, and I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The address follows:\n\nInauguration Speech By President Mary McAleese Dublin Castle, November \n                      11th, 1997, Dublin, Ireland\n\n       This is a historic day in my life, in the life of my family \n     and in the life of the country. It is a wonderful privilege \n     for me to be chosen as Uachtaran na hEireann, to be a voice \n     for Ireland at home and abroad.\n       I am honoured and humbled to be successor to seven \n     exemplary Presidents. Their differing religious, political, \n     geographical and social origins speak loudly of a Presidency \n     which has always been wide open and all embracing. Among them \n     were Presidents from Connaught, Leinster and Munster to say \n     nothing of America and London. It is my special privilege and \n     delight to be the first President from Ulster.\n\n[[Page S12718]]\n\n       The span of almost sixty years since the first Presidential \n     inauguration has seen a nation transformed. This Ireland \n     which stands so confidently on the brink of the 21st century \n     and the third millennium is one our forbears dreamed of and \n     yeamed for, a prospering Ireland, accomplished, educated, \n     dynamic, innovative, compassionate, proud of its people, its \n     language, and of its vast heritage; an Ireland, at the heart \n     of the European Union, respected by nations and cultures \n     across the world.\n       The scale of what we have already accomplished in such a \n     short time allows us to embrace the future with well-based \n     confidence and hope.\n       It is the people of Ireland who, in a million big and small \n     ways, in quiet acts of hard work, heroism and generosity have \n     built up the fabric of home, community and country on which \n     the remarkable success story of today's Ireland is built.\n       Over many generations there have been very special sources \n     of inspiration who have nurtured our talent and instilled \n     determination into this country. Mnay outstanding \n     politicians, public servants, voluntary workers, clergy of \n     all denominations and religious, teachers and particularly \n     parents have through hard and difficult times worked and \n     sacrificed so that our children could blossom to their \n     fullest potential.\n       They are entitled to look with satisfaction at what they \n     have achieved. May we never become so cynical that we forget \n     to be grateful. I certainly owe them a deep personal debt and \n     as President I hope to find many opportunities both to repay \n     that debt and to assist in the great work of encouraging our \n     children to believe in themselves and in their country.\n       Among those who are also owed an enormous debt of thanks \n     are the countless emigrants whose letters home with dollars \n     and pound notes, earned in grinding loneliness thousands of \n     miles from home, bridged the gap between the Ireland they \n     left and the Ireland which greets them today when they return \n     as tourists or return to stay. They are a crucial part of our \n     global Irish family. In every continent they have put their \n     ingenuity and hard work at the service of new homelands. They \n     have kept their love of Ireland, its traditions and its \n     culture deep in their hearts so that wherever we travel in \n     the world there is always a part of Ireland of which we \n     can be proud and which in turn takes pride in us. I hope \n     over the next seven years there will be many opportunities \n     for me to celebrate with them.\n       At our core we are a sharing people. Selfishness has never \n     been our creed. Commitment to the welfare of each other has \n     fired generations of voluntary organisations and a network of \n     everyday neighbourliness which weaves together the caring \n     fabric of our country. It has sent our missionaries, \n     development workers and peacekeepers to the aid of distressed \n     peoples in other parts of the world. It has made us a country \n     of refuge for the hurt and dispossessed of other troubled \n     places. It is the fuel which drives us to tackle the many \n     social problems we face, problems which cynicism and self \n     doubt can never redress but painstaking commitment can. We \n     know our duty is to spread the benefits of our prosperity to \n     those whose lives are still mired in poverty, unemployment, \n     worry and despair. There can be no rest until the harsh gap \n     between the comfortable and the struggling has been bridged.\n       The late Cearbhall O Dalaigh, Ireland's fifth president \n     and, dare I say it, one of three lawyers to grace the office, \n     said at his inauguration in 1974:\n       ``Presidents, under the Irish Constitution don't have \n     policies. But * * * a President can have a theme.''\n       The theme of my Presidency, the Eighth Presidency, is \n     Building Bridges. These bridges require no engineering skills \n     but they will demand patience, imagination and courage for \n     Ireland's pace of change is now bewilderingly fast. We grow \n     more complex by the day. Our dancers, singers, writers, \n     poets, musicians, sportsmen and women, indeed our last \n     President herself, are giants on the world stage. Our \n     technologically skilled young people are in demand \n     everywhere. There is an invigorating sense of purpose about \n     us.\n       There are those who absorb the rush of newness with \n     delight. There are those who are more cautious, even fearful. \n     Such tensions are part of our creative genius, they form the \n     energy which gives us our unique identity, our particularity.\n       I want to point the way to a reconciliation of these many \n     tensions and to see Ireland grow ever more comfortable and at \n     ease with the flowering diversity that is now all around us. \n     To quote a Belfast poet Louis MacNeice ``a single purpose can \n     be founded on a jumble of opposites.''\n       Yet I know to speak of reconciliation is to raise a nervous \n     query in the hearts of some North of the border, in the place \n     of my birth. There is no more appropriate place to address \n     that query than here in Dublin Castle, a place where the \n     complex history of these two neighbouring and now very \n     neighbourly islands has seen many chapters written. It is \n     fortuitous too that the timing of today's Inauguration \n     coincides with the commemoration of those who died so \n     tragically and heroically in two world wars. I think of \n     nationalist and unionist, who fought and died together in \n     those wars, the differences which separated them at home, \n     fading into insignificance as the bond of their common \n     humanity forged friendships as intense as love can make them.\n       In Ireland, we know only too well the cruelty and \n     capriciousness of violent conflict. Our own history has been \n     hard on lives young and old. Too hard. Hard on those who died \n     and those left behind with only shattered dreams and poignant \n     memories. We hope and pray, indeed we insist, that we have \n     seen the last of violence. We demand the right to solve our \n     problems by dialogue and the noble pursuit of consensus. We \n     hope to see that consensus pursued without the language of \n     hatred and contempt and we wish all those engaged in that \n     endeavour, well.\n       That it can be done--we know. We need look no further than \n     our own European continent where once bitter enemies now work \n     conscientiously with each other and for each other as friends \n     and partners. The greatest salute to the memory of all our \n     dead and the living whom they loved, would be the achievement \n     of agreement and peace.\n       I think of the late Gordon Wilson who faced his unbearable \n     sorrow ten years ago at the horror that was Enniskillen. His \n     words of love and forgiveness shocked us as if we were \n     hearing them for the very first time, as if they had not been \n     uttered first two thousand years ago. His work, and the work \n     of so many peacemakers who have risen above the awesome pain \n     of loss to find a bridge to the other side, is work I want to \n     help in every way I can. No side has a monopoly on pain. Each \n     has suffered intensely.\n       I know the distrusts go deep and the challenge is awesome. \n     Across this island, North, South, East and West, there are \n     people of such greatness of heart that I know with their help \n     it can be done. I invite them, to work in partnership with me \n     to dedicate ourselves to the task of creating a wonderful \n     millennium gift to the Child of Bethlehem whose 2000th \n     birthday we will soon celebrate--the gift of an island where \n     difference is celebrated with joyful curiosity and generous \n     respect and where in the words of John Hewitt ``each may \n     grasp his neighbor's hand as friend.''\n       There will be those who are wary of such invitations, \n     afraid that they are being invited to the edge of a \n     precipice. To them I have dedicated a poem, written by the \n     English poet, Christopher Logue, himself a veteran of the \n     Second World War.\n\n     ``Come to the edge.\n     We might fall.\n     Come to the edge.\n     It's too high!\n     Come to the edge\n     And they came,\n     and he pushed\n     and they flew.''\n\n       No one will be pushing, just gently inviting, but I hope \n     that if ever and whenever you decide to walk over that edge, \n     there will be no need to fly, you will find there a firm and \n     steady bridge across which we will walk together both ways.\n       Ireland sits tantalizingly ready to embrace a golden age of \n     affluence, self-assurance tolerance and peace. It will be my \n     most profound privilege to be President of this beautiful, \n     intriguing country.\n       May I ask those of faith, whatever that faith may be, to \n     pray for me and for our country that we will use these seven \n     years well, to create a future where in the words of William \n     Butler Yeats.\n       ``Everything we look upon is blest''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/12/15/senate-section/article/S12717-2", "month": "12", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12718-S12719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNITION OF WILFRED WOODS\n\n Mr. GORTON. I would like to call attention to Wilfred Woods, \nwho has recently announced he will step down as the publisher of the \nWenatchee World newspaper after 47 years. Wilfred is the son of Rufus \nWoods, who purchased the Wenatchee Daily World in 1907, and was one of \nthe earliest promoters of the Grand Coulee Dam project. Beginning in \n1918, Rufus used the pages of the newspaper to promote the concept of \nusing the Columbia River for hydroelectric power as well as for \nirrigation of the fertile but arid Columbia Basin. Half a million acres \nare irrigated by the Columbia Basin project. This valuable irrigation \nproject allowed the central Washington desert to bloom and is \nresponsible for producing the valley known as the Apple Capital of the \nWorld.\n  Wilfred Woods and his late father, Rufus, have played significant \nroles in the development of central Washington during their 90 years of \nservice. Wilfred succeeded his father as editor and publisher in 1950 \nand has been an active advocate for resource and economic development \nin central Washington. He served as a State parks commissioner, a \ntrustee for Central Washington University, and in various capacities in \ncountless civic organizations.\n  Wilfred's son, Rufus, will now become the editor and publisher of the \nWenatchee World and carry on the great traditions of his father and \ngrandfather.\n  Wilfred has been a great personal friend of mine for more than 30 \nyears, dating back to the time I first ran for Washington State \nattorney general. I have always valued his wisdom, foresight, and the \nmanner in which he and\n\n[[Page S12719]]\n\nhis father guided the Wenatchee World to become one of the State's \nfinest daily newspapers. Wilfred and his father were truly part of a \nlegendary experience that has forever changed the political and \neconomic landscape of north-central Washington. While the Woods family \nwill be remembered most for their influence over the management of the \nColumbia River system, I will remember Wilfred as a true friend. During \nmy years of touring Washington State for various political engagements \nand meetings, I always looked forward to my stop in Wilfred's newsroom \nand valued our countless conversations, whether we were in agreement or \nnot. I will miss our exchange of ideas and his insights into the \ncentral Washington community. I wish him continued success in future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/12/15/senate-section/article/S12718-1", "month": "12", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NEW MEXICO HISPANIC CULTURAL CENTER PERFORMING ARTS FACILITY\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, S. 1417, a bill to authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to provide for the design, construction, \nfurnishing, and equipping of a center for performing arts within the \ncomplex known as the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center, was \nintroduced and passed the Senate on November 7, 1997.\n  Because the measure was considered and passed on the same day as its \nintroduction, the Committee on Environment and Public Works was not \nreferred S. 1417, and a report was not filed.

Therefore, I ask \nthat the letter from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \ndated November 17, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 1997.\n     Hon.

Based on the amounts S. 1417 would count toward the \n     state share, the federal share of these costs is estimated at \n     about $18 million. However some funds have been appropriated \n     for this purpose for the 1998 fiscal year: $2.5 million in \n     the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act and \n     $3 million in the Interior Appropriations Act. Because S. \n     1417 would not restrict this grant to the availability of \n     appropriations, New Mexico would be entitled to receive the \n     remaining costs even if no additional appropriations are \n     made.

Mr. President, during the course of the last \nseveral months, the number of broadcast radio station transactions has \nincreased due to the liberalized station ownership provisions contained \nin the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, with this increase in \ntransactions has come an increased concern that, in authorizing these \nassignments, the FCC may try to impose terms and conditions on the \nassignors or assignees neither contained in, nor intended by, the 1996 \nact.\n  Radio mergers must be permitted to go forward when they satisfy the \nrequirements under the plain meaning of the statute. While the Senate \nis in adjournment, I expect the FCC to follow the law, not rewrite it, \nwhen they review radio station mergers.\n  Given the number of broadcast media outlets available today, \ntraditional concerns about how mergers affect viewpoint diversity are \ngreatly mitigated. This is especially true because, in addition to \ntraditional broadcast media outlets, various multichannel video \nprogramming services and online services over the Internet, as well as \nnonbroadcast media outlets like magazines and newspapers, are available \nin today's market.\n  In light of these facts, Mr. President, the FCC should not block \nsensible radio mergers or approve them only with additional, \nunwarranted terms and conditions attached.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/12/15/senate-section/article/S12719-2", "month": "12", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12719-S12720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS IN THE 105TH CONGRESS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, now that we have concluded the \n1st session of the 105th Congress, I want to again focus the attention \nof the Senate and the American people on the glacial pace of Federal \njudicial confirmations during this session.\n  Mr. President, the reluctance of the Senate to confirm the \nPresident's nominees to the Federal bench is a carryover from the 2d \nsession of the 104th Congress, during which the Republican-controlled \nSenate, in an unprecedented display of election-year inaction, \nconfirmed only 17 district court nominees and no circuit court \nnominees.\n  This pattern of inaction has continued into the 105th Congress, \nduring which the Senate has confirmed only 36 of the President's \njudicial nominees--7 circuit judges and 29 district court judges. \nAdmittedly, there was some effort made in the waning days of the \nsession to confirm judges, but the overall numbers remain highly \ndisturbing and worthy of attention.\n  In the last 2 years, the Senate has confirmed 53 judicial nominees, \nwhile a total of 81 seats on the bench continue to lie vacant, and 41 \nnominees await committee or floor consideration.\n  In other words, there are still more nominees pending in the Senate \nthan were confirmed this year, and more than twice the number of \nnominees confirmed last year.\n  Compare the number of nominees confirmed thus far this year and in \nthe 104th Congress to the number confirmed in the last two \nDemocratically controlled Congresses, one of which featured a \nRepublican President. In the 102d Congress, the Senate confirmed 124 \nFederal judges, while in the 103d Congress it confirmed 129 Federal \njudges. In the 104th Congress, the Republicans confirmed but 75 judges, \nwhile this year it confirmed 36. In other words, in the last 3 years, \nthe Republican majority in the Senate has confirmed fewer Federal \njudges than the Democratically controlled Senate did in either the 102d \nor the 103d Congress.\n  I ask my colleagues to further compare the figures of the last 2 \nyears with the number of judicial nominees confirmed by Democratically \ncontrolled Senates during years when a Republican White House faced a \nDemocratic challenge--when, as in 1996, the party in control of the \nSenate had an incentive to delay confirmations, in the hopes that the \nPresidential election would effect a transfer of the White House to its \nparty.\n\n[[Page S12720]]\n\n  In 1992, when President Bush stood for reelection and the Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate, the Senate confirmed 11 circuit court judges and \n55 district court judges. In other words, the Democratically controlled \nSenate in 1992 confirmed almost four times the number of Republican \nnominees confirmed by the Republican controlled Senate in 1996, and \nalmost 25 percent more judges than the Republican Senate has confirmed \nin the last 2 years combined.\n  Similarly, in 1988, when Vice President Bush stood for election, the \nDemocratically controlled Senate confirmed 7 circuit court judges and \n33 district court judges--over twice the number of judges confirmed \nlast year, and more judges than were confirmed in this past nonelection \nyear.\n  Clearly, in the last couple of years, the politicization of the \nconfirmation process has increased. Today, the Republican majority in \nthe Senate is effectively bottling up nominees in committee and on the \nfloor, in stark contrast to the behavior of Democratically controlled \nSenates over the last decade.\n  This politicization, Mr. President, has been extended to include the \npractice of denying nominees an up or down vote on the Senate floor, or \neven in the Judiciary Committee. If the majority of the Senate opposes \na judicial nominee enough to derail a nomination by an up or down vote, \nthen at least the process has been served. Instead, however, the \nPresident's nominees are not even receiving that courtesy from this \nSenate: Some of the individuals whose nominations are pending before \nthe Judiciary Committee or the full Senate have not been allowed a vote \non the floor, much less in committee, for close to 2 years. It is \nespecially troubling that of the 14 nominees who have been held up the \nlongest by the Republican majority in the Senate, 12 are women or \nminorities.\n  Let me give one example of this phenomenon--that of James Beaty, the \nPresident's nominee to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which \nincludes my State of Maryland.\n  Judge Beaty, currently a district court judge in North Carolina, was \nnominated by the President to the court of appeals in the 104th \nCongress, during which he did not even receive a vote in committee. He \nwas renominated on January 7 of this year, and has yet to receive even \na hearing in the committee, much less an up-or-down vote there, or on \nthe floor.\n  Some have argued against Judge Beaty's nomination that, in their \nview, the fourth circuit does not need an additional judge, and that \nfailure to confirm him would amount to a conservation of taxpayer \nresources. Assuming for the sake of argument that that is the case--and \nI would disagree that it is the case--Congress should act affirmatively \nto eliminate the vacant seat on that court before a nominee comes \nbefore it, not stall an individual's nomination into oblivion with \narguments created after the fact. When you have a nominee sent to the \nSenate and then claims are made that the seat is unnecessary, it is \nsimply impossible to divorce the claim that the seat is unnecessary \nfrom an ad hominem attack on the candidate himself.\n  Judge Beaty, if confirmed to the fourth circuit, would be the first \nAfrican-American to sit on that court. Prior to becoming a district \ncourt judge, Judge Beaty maintained a general civil and criminal \nlitigation practice in Winston-Salem, NC, and then served as a State \ncourt judge for 13 years. These accomplishments entitle him, at the \nvery least, to an up-or-down vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. \nInstead, he has not even received a committee hearing--much less a \ncommittee vote, at the hands of the majority.\n  By any measure, Mr. President, the Congress has become increasingly \npoliticized in the last few years. I submit to my colleagues, however, \nthat if there is one subject that should remain immune from political \ngames and pressure it is our Federal judicial system, which is the envy \nof the world for its independence and integrity, and which is \nabsolutely fundamental to our system of government.\n  It is essential for the maintenance of public confidence in this \nsystem that the confirmation process be as far removed from politics as \npossible. Yet we seem to be moving in the exact opposite direction, as \nwe hear Members of the other party calling for impeachment of judges on \nthe basis of decisions with which the Members disagree, and for defeat \nof judicial nominees deemed to possess liberal or activist tendencies.\n  This behavior--while perhaps politically advantageous in the short \nrun--betrays a basic and dangerous misunderstanding of the role of the \ncourts in our system of government.\n  Moreover, on a purely practical level, the Senate's failure to \nconfirm the 42 nominees before it adjourns hamstrings the courts' \nability to deal with its ever-increasing caseload--an increase that, I \nmight add, Mr. President, is in large part due to the majority's \nproclivity for federalizing areas of law that have been historically \nleft to the States.\n  So we have district judges throughout the country putting aside all \ncivil cases in order to deal with their criminal dockets, because their \ncourts have been left shorthanded by the Senate's inaction. We have \ncourts of appeals canceling oral arguments because of shortages on \ntheir courts. We have Chief Justice Rehnquist--hardly the kind of \nliberal judicial activist that so concerns the majority--calling the \nproblem of judicial vacancies the most pressing problem facing the \nFederal courts today. And yet we see little in the way of movement by \nthe Senate to alleviate these burdens.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues--especially my Republican \ncolleagues--will give serious attention to the problems, both practical \nand philosophical, that will result if the Senate does not revisit its \napproach to the judicial confirmation process, and that in this area, \nthe second session of the 105th Congress will proceed in a markedly \ndifferent manner than the last 2 years.\n  In closing, I would like to commend the efforts of my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \nin this area. He has tried to jog the Senate into acting to resolve \nthis problem: I regret that his calls for action have not been heeded \nthus far, though I hold out hope that common sense and respect for our \nconstitutional system will prevail in the long run.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/12/15/senate-section/article/S12719-3", "month": "12", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12720-S12721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO DAVID EDELSTEIN AND THE JEWISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL OF PELHAM \n                                PARKWAY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the members of the Jewish \nCommunity Council of Pelham Parkway in the Bronx recently celebrated \nthe 20th anniversary of David Edelstein's tenure as their executive \ndirector.\n  Twenty years ago the Bronx was a virtual, albeit not entirely \nappropriate, synonym for urban decay and middle-class flight. The \nJewish Community Council of Pelham Parkway is one of the dynamic \ngrassroots neighborhood groups that have helped bring about a dramatic \nchange in this proud borough.\n  Much of the credit for the council's success belongs to its \nindefatigable executive director. David Edelstein came to the Jewish \nCommunity Council of Pelham Parkway on September 7, 1977. He helped \nestablish the council's programs of social service, community \ndevelopment, Jewish cultural enrichment, and civic improvement. He \npioneered the creation of programs that led to the reinvestment of over \n$17 million in the neighborhood's multifamily housing stock and played \na key role in the creation of programs that helped settle over 3,000 \nSoviet Jewish immigrants in the Pelham Parkway neighborhood. David's \nleadership has enabled the council to sponsor programs that assure the \navailability of Jewish education for all neighborhood youngsters.\n  David established relationships with New York City's major Jewish \norganizations, helping to assure that needy families in Pelham Parkway \ncould be helped with the resources available from those agencies. The \ncouncil distributes over $25,000 in emergency and/or supplemental food \nto over 500 needy families every year. Hundreds of people have been \nhelped with emergency home care, transportation for the homebound, \neviction prevention, and other forms of emergency assistance.\n  David has helped the Jewish Community Council become the unified \nvoice of the Jewish community in the Pelham Parkway neighborhood. \nWorking with the council's active board of directors and maintaining \nrelationships with the police, medical centers,\n\n[[Page S12721]]\n\nelected officials, and others whose decisions impact on the community's \nquality of life, David has worked to assure cooperation and consensus \non issues of community concern.\n  My childhood friend, the late distinguished New York State Senator \nJoseph Galiber worked closely with David Edelstein and was fond of \nnoting the Jewish Community Council's many strengths and successes. I \nknow I speak for all of my colleagues in the Senate when I congratulate \nDavid Edelstein and the Jewish Community Council of Pelham Parkway on \ntwo decades of inspired leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/12/15/senate-section/article/S12720-1", "month": "12", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12721-S12722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  STATEMENT ON CURRENT STATUS OF FISCAL YEAR 1998 APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. With the completion of congressional action on \nthe 13 annual fiscal year 1998 appropriations bills, I submit a table \nto the Senate showing the current status of the bills compared to the \nmost recently filed Section 302(b) allocations by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee on November 13, 1997.\n  I note that the Interior and related agencies Appropriations bill \nunder the current 302(b) allocation is over the subcommittee's \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays. A provision in the \nfinal Interior appropriations bill amends the budget resolution to \ntrigger the allocation of an additional $700 million in budget \nauthority and $257 million in outlays to the Appropriations Committee \nfor land acquisition. I have filed that allocation today.\n  Once the Senate Appropriations Committee revises its 302(b) \nallocations to reflect the land acquisition funding, the Interior and \nrelated agencies appropriations bill will be within the subcommittee's \nfunding allocation.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the pertinent tables.\n  The material follows:\n\n

Mr. President, the final appropriations measure \nthat the Congress passed before adjournment was H.R. 2267, the \nCommerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1998. I today submit a table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the final bill.\n  The conference agreement accompanying the bill provides $31.7 billion \nin budget authority and $21.2 billion in new outlays to operate the \nprograms of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the \nDepartment of State, the Judiciary, and related Federal agencies for \nfiscal year 1998.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $31.8 billion in budget \nauthority and $29.5 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998.\n  The final bill is within the revised Senate subcommittee's section \n302(b) allocation for both budget authority and outlays.\n  The bill is $7 million in budget authority and $77 million in outlays \nbelow the Senate subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. President, it was my pleasure to serve on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee with the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. I \ncommend Chairman Gregg, for completing the fiscal year 1998 bill. It is \nnot easy to balance the competing program requirements that are funded \nin this bill.\n  I thank the chairman for the consideration he gave to issues I \nbrought before the subcommittee, and for his extra effort to address \nthe items in the bipartisan balanced budget agreement.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record a pertinent table.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                H.R. 2267, COMMERCE-JUSTICE APPROPRIATIONS, 1998                                \n               [Spending comparisons--Conference Report, fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]              \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                             Non-                               \n                                                                  Defense   defense   Crime   Mandatory   Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority...........................................       298    25,750    5,225       522    31,795\n    Outlays....................................................       340    25,211    3,400       532    29,483\nSenate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n    Budget authority...........................................       298    25,757    5,225       522    31,802\n    Outlays....................................................       342    25,285    3,401       532    29,560\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n    Budget authority...........................................       257    26,114    5,238       522    32,131\n    Outlays....................................................       286    25,907    3,423       532    30,148\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority...........................................       273    25,687    5,259       522    31,741\n    Outlays....................................................       296    25,249    3,434       532    29,511\nSenate-passed bill:                                                                                             \n    Budget authority...........................................       275    25,581    5,225       522    31,603\n    Outlays....................................................       322    25,156    3,381       532    29,391\n                                                                                                                \n                 Conference Report Compared to:                                                                 \n                                                                                                                \nSenate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n    Budget authority...........................................  ........        -7  .......  .........       -7\n    Outlays....................................................        -2       -74       -1  .........      -77\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n    Budget authority...........................................        41      -364      -13  .........     -336\n    Outlays....................................................        54      -696      -23  .........     -665\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority...........................................        25        63      -34  .........       54\n    Outlays....................................................        44       -38      -34  .........      -28\nSenate-passed bill:                                                                                             \n    Budget authority...........................................        23       169  .......  .........      192\n    Outlays....................................................        18        55       19  .........       92\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I submit the Budget Committee \nscoring of H.R. 2607, the fiscal year 1998 District of Columbia \nappropriations bill.\n  The final bill totals $855 million, including $835 million for \nFederal payments to the District of Columbia.\n\n[[Page S12723]]\n\n  The bill provides $190 million for the Federal contribution to the \nDistrict of Columbia, $169 million to operate the District's \ncorrectional facilities for felons, $302 million to build new \ncorrectional facilities to replace the Lorton facility, $151 million to \noperate the district court System, $12 million to the National Park \nService to support U.S. Park Police operations in the District, $8 \nmillion to implement management reform initiatives, and $3 million for \na Medicare coordinated-care demonstration project.\n  The appropriation is in addition to the resources allocated to the \nDistrict by the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997. Combined, the two laws provide tax breaks and mandatory spending \nworth $4.5 billion over 10 years. Because the cost of taking over the \nDistrict's $5.8 billion pension liability is largely delayed until \nafter this period, the total bailout is worth substantially more to the \nDistrict.\n  The final bill is below the subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation \nby $7 million in both budget authority and outlays.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record a pertinent table.\n  The material follows:\n\n                              H.R. 2607, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS, 1998                              \n              [Spending comparisions--Conference Report, fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]              \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                             Non-                               \n                                                                  Defense   defense   Crime   Mandatory   Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority...........................................  ........       855  .......  .........      855\n    Outlays....................................................  ........       554  .......  .........      554\nSenate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n    Budget authority...........................................  ........       862  .......  .........      862\n    Outlays....................................................  ........       561  .......  .........      561\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n    Budget authority...........................................  ........       777  .......  .........      777\n    Outlays....................................................  ........       479  .......  .........      479\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority...........................................  ........       828  .......  .........      828\n    Outlays....................................................  ........       527  .......  .........      527\nSenate-passed bill:                                                                                             \n    Budget authority...........................................  ........       855  .......  .........      855\n    Outlays....................................................  ........       555  .......  .........      555\n                                                                                                                \n                 Conference Report compared to:                                                                 \n                                                                                                                \nSenate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n    Budget authority...........................................  ........        -7  .......  .........       -7\n    Outlays....................................................  ........        -7  .......  .........       -7\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n    Budget authority...........................................  ........        78  .......  .........       78\n    Outlays....................................................  ........        75  .......  .........       75\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority...........................................  ........        27  .......  .........       27\n    Outlays....................................................  ........        27  .......  .........       27\nSenate-passed bill:                                                                                             \n    Budget authority...........................................  ........  ........  .......  .........  .......\n    Outlays....................................................  ........        -1  .......  .........       -1\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I submit the following table \ndisplaying the Budget Committee scoring of the conference report \naccompanying the foreign operations and export financing appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 1998.\n  The conference report provides $13.1 billion in budget authority and \n$5 billion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of \nState, export and military assistance, bilateral and multilateral \neconomic assistance, and related agencies for fiscal year 1998.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $13.1 billion in budget \nauthority and $13.1 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998.\n  The final bill is at the subcommittee's revised section 302(b) \nallocation for budget authority, and it is $4 million below the revised \nallocation in outlays.\n  Mr. President, I note that the final bill is significantly below the \nSenate-passed version of the bill due to the deletion of $3.5 billion \nfor the New Arrangements to Borrow for the International Monetary Fund. \nThese funds were requested by the President in his fiscal year 1998 \nbudget.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record a pertinent table.\n  The material follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2159, FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS, 1998                               \n

Mr. President, with the completion of the 13 \nannual fiscal year 1998 appropriations bills by the Congress, I believe \nwe can say that Congress lived up to its end of the Balanced Budget \nAgreement.\n  The Balanced Budget Agreement had two major assumptions for the \nappropriated programs. The first was the protection of 13 priority \ndomestic discretionary programs that were assumed to be funded at the \nlevel of the President's request. For these programs, Congress was on, \nor close to, the President's requested funding level with few \ndepartures.\n  The second assumption was the protection of funding for five specific \nbudget functions--International Affairs, Natural Resources, \nTransportation, Education, and the Administration of Justice. Congress \ncame within $0.3 billion of the overall total of $126.5 billion for \nthese five budget functions, a shortfall of only 0.2 percent.\n  The funding departures for the 13 priority domestic discretionary \nprograms were largely for items that Congress had not specifically \nagreed to--Pell grants--for a new program that was advance appropriated \nand made subject to authorization--Opportunities for Out of School \nYouth--and where anticipated reform was not enacted--Superfund.\n\n[[Page S12724]]\n\n  Adjusting for these three items, Congress exceeded by $54 million, \nthe overall $34 billion assumed in the budget agreement for these 13 \nprotected programs. I will submit a table displaying congressional \naction on these programs at the end of my statement.\n  Mr. President, the Congress matched the BBA assumptions for bilingual \nand immigrant education, for BIA tribal priority allocations, and for \nthe Job Corps.\n  The Congress exceeded the BBA assumptions for the technology literacy \nchallenge fund, for Head Start, for National Park System operations and \nland acquisition, and for the violent crime reduction trust fund.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the pertinent tables.\n  The material follows:\n  Partially offsetting these increases, Congress provided slightly less \nthan the BBA assumed for the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology and the Community Development Institutions Fund.\n  For Pell grants, the commitment made in the BBA was more complicated \nthan simply a funding level. The BBA assumed the President's funding \nrequest for Pell grants, which was more than needed to fund the only \npolicy change promised in the BBA--a $300 increase in the maximum Pell \ngrant award. The BBA was silent on other policy changes, such as \nindependent students, that were contemplated in the President's \nrequest.\n  While Congress provided $290 million less than assumed in the BBA for \nPell grants, as part of the overall funding increase, the \nappropriations committees provided an additional $286 million above the \nbase program level, which can be used to increase the income protection \nallowance [IPA] for independent and dependent students in the needs \nanalysis formula applied in all need-based financial assistance \nprograms. The final conference report makes clear, however, that the \nmaximum Pell grant of $3,000 is to be funded first, before IPA's can be \nincreased.\n  For the protected training and employment services programs at the \nDepartment of Labor, the final appropriations bill fell $307 million \nshort of the BBA. The difference results mainly from Congress delaying \n$250 million from 1998 to advance 1999 funding for a new program called \nopportunities for out of school youth, provided that such program is \nauthorized as part of job training consolidation legislation enacted by \nJuly 1, 1998. The appropriations bill provides $25 million for pilots \nand demonstrations for this activity in 1998. The President sought all \nfunds for 1998.\n  For Superfund, while enacted funding may not be at the President's \nrequested level, Congress abided by the BBA. The BBA incorporated the \nPresident's request ``if policies can be worked out'' to reform the \nprogram. The President requested $2.094 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority for Superfund, and proposed $200 million in new direct \nspending, for a total of $2.294 billion in 1998.\n  The Congress provided $2.15 billion for Superfund in the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill--$56 million more than the President requested in \ndiscretionary funding. Congress approved $1.5 billion in regular \nprogram funds, delays the obligation of $100 million of this budget \nauthority until October 1, 1998, and provides that $650 million of the \noverall appropriation will only be made available if legislation \nreauthorizing Superfund is enacted by May 15, 1998.\n\n  Section 204 of the budget resolution includes a $200 million \nallowance for direct spending for the Superfund Program, which will be \nallocated once reform legislation is reported.\n  Finally, while Congress reduced EPA operating programs by $0.1 \nbillion relative to the BBA, Congress also restored funding reductions \nproposed by the President to the State and tribal assistance grants--\nwhich was not a protected program--providing $3.2 billion compared to \nthe requested $2.8 billion.\n  For all the suspense at the end of the session, funding levels for \nthese 13 programs were not the issue. The administration and the \nCongress came to mutual agreement on these funding levels, and other \nlegislative matters held up the completion of the fiscal year 1998 \nappropriations bills.\n  Mr. President, I will also submit at the end of my statement a table \ndisplaying final action on funding for the five priority budget \nfunctions. It is somewhat remarkable that final appropriations action \nfor these functions fell only $0.3 billion short of the $126.5 billion \nassumed in the BBA, considering that the responsibility for living up \nto the agreement was dispersed over 11 of the 13 appropriations \nsubcommittees, which do not appropriate funds by function. Again, the \nPresident and the Congress came to agreement to depart somewhat from \nthe request on funding for these functions, but the BBA was largely \nimplemented as envisioned.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the pertinent tables.\n  The material follows:\n\n             BBA: PROTECTED DOMESTIC DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS             \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Final                 \n           Protected item               BBA       action    Final +/-BBA\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDept of Commerce:                                                       \n    Nat Inst of Standards & Tech...     0.693        0.678        -0.015\nDept of Education:                                                      \n    Technology Literacy Fund.......     0.510        0.541         0.031\n    Pell Grants....................     7.635        7.345        -0.290\n    Bilingual & Immigrant Ed.......     0.354        0.354         0    \n    Child Literacy Initiatives.....     0.260        0.210        -0.05 \nDept of HHS:                                                            \n    Head Start.....................     4.305        4.355         0.05 \nDept of Interior:                                                       \n    National Park System...........     1.220        1.234         0.014\n    Land Acquisition...............     0.867        0.969         0.102\n    Everglades Restoration.........     0.140        0.135        -0.005\n    Tribal Priority Allocations....     0.757        0.757         0    \nDept of Labor:                                                          \n    Training & Employment Service..     4.049        3.742        -0.307\n    Job Corps......................     1.246        1.246         0    \nDept of the Treasury:                                                   \n    Community Development..........     0.125        0.080        -0.045\nEPA:                                                                    \n    EPA Operating Program..........     2.739        2.632        -0.107\n    Superfund......................     2.042        1.453        -0.589\nViolent Crime:                                                          \n    VCRTF..........................     5.416        5.500         0.084\n    COPS...........................     1.405        1.400         0.005\n                                    ------------------------------------\n      Total........................    33.763       32.631        -1.122\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    COMPARISON OF NON-DEFENSE DISCRETIONARY LEVELS IN BALANCED BUDGET   \n                   AGREEMENT TO ENACTED APPROPRIATIONS                  \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            BBA     Enacted   Difference\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInternational Affairs:                                                  \n    Budget authority...................    19.038    19.021       -0.017\n    Outlays............................    19.179    18.954       -0.225\nNatural Resources:                                                      \n    Budget authority...................    22.807    23.409        0.602\n    Outlays............................    21.393    21.691        0.298\nTransportation:                                                         \n    Budget authority...................    13.556    13.520       -0.036\n    Outlays............................    38.267    38.453        0.186\nEducation:                                                              \n    Budget authority...................    46.721    45.978       -0.743\n    Outlays............................    43.185    42.899       -0.286\nJustice:                                                                \n    Budget authority...................    24.405    24.290       -0.115\n    Outlays............................    22.170    21.711       -0.459\nTOTAL:                                                                  \n    Budget authority...................   126.527   126.218       -0.309\n    Outlays............................   144.194   143.708       -0.486\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/12/15/senate-section/article/S12723-3", "month": "12", "year": "1997"}]
