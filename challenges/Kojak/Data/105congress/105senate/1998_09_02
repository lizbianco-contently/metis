Mr. President, yesterday, as is the habit in the Senate, \nthe Republicans met in policy luncheon during the lunch hour, and \nduring that meeting I made some comments which, under the terms of the \nmeeting, normally remain confidential. Apparently they were \nsufficiently provocative that, within an hour or so of the meeting, my \noffice was besieged with calls from reporters who wanted to know if I \nwas going to proceed in the manner that had been reported to them. \nOthers of my colleagues were similarly accosted by reporters who wanted \nto know what is Senator Bennett going to do on the issue he raised in \nthe policy lunch. Rather than try to respond to each of those reporters \nindividually, I decided that I would take the floor this morning and \nmake a presentation of what it was I said at the policy lunch \nyesterday, and thereby end any suspense anyone may have. I assure you, \nthis issue is probably not worth the amount of concern that was stirred \nup yesterday, but I will make it clear what I said and what I have in \nmind.\n\n  The issue that was under discussion had to do with the behavior of \nthe President of the United States, as indicated by his statement to \nthe people of America several weeks ago. I made this comment. I said \nthat if any Member of this body had engaged in that kind of behavior, \nhe or she would be subject to censure for that behavior, and I singled \nout three areas in particular which I feel would be worthy of censure.\n  The first: It is now clear that the President of the United States \nhad a relationship with an intern who was under his control and in his \npurview\n\n[[Page S9808]]\n\nwithin the White House, which was improper, or, in the words of the \nPresident himself, ``wrong.'' This was not a chance encounter. It was \nnot a matter of her bringing him a piece of pizza, catching his eye, he \ncatching her eye, she smiled at him, he smiled at her, and something \nimproper happened and that was the end of it. It was an affair with \nsexual activity that began in December of 1995 and continued for 18 \nmonths, including the period of time after she had left the White House \nand was no longer in the President's direct line of report. And it \nended, apparently, only because it was discovered and reported in the \npublic. If any Member of this body had that kind of a relationship with \nan intern in his office he would, I think, very appropriately be \nsubject to censure from the Ethics Committee and by the Senate as a \nwhole. That is the first item.\n  The second item: When this matter became public, the President went \nbefore the public and insisted in the most emphatic possible language \nthat it had not happened. Furthermore, he then gathered his Cabinet and \nhis closest aides around him and, in direct personal contact with many \nof them, assured them that the public reports of this activity were \nfalse, and urged them to go forward and speak in his behalf repeating \nthat denial. We had members of the President's Cabinet come before the \nCongress and repeat that denial, in effect lying to the Congress from \ntheir position as Cabinet officers on behalf of the President of the \nUnited States. This, in my opinion, is the second thing that would \njustify censure, lying and urging others, particularly members of his \nofficial family, to lie in various fora, including an official forum of \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  Then there is the third: While this was going on, for a period of 7 \nto 7\\1/2\\ months, the President allowed many of his subordinates, aides \nand supporters to not only lie about this issue--admittedly, they \nthought they were telling the truth because they had believed the \nPresident--but also to attack and smear those who were telling the \ntruth; to go after the reputation of those who had come forward with an \naccurate description of what was going on and attempt to destroy those \nreputations in the public arena. This, in my opinion, would be a third \nreason for censure. And I repeat, I am convinced that if any Member of \nthis body had, No. 1, engaged in that kind of extended improper sexual \nrelationship with an intern; No. 2, lied to his own associates and \nurged those associates to go forward and lie in his behalf; and, No. 3, \nthen sat by while others of his official family smeared the reputations \nof those who were telling the truth, a motion for censure would be \nbrought upon this floor and passed, I believe, overwhelmingly.\n  So I raised in the policy luncheon yesterday the possibility of \nhaving a motion of censure raised as a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nwith respect to the President of the United States. I pointed out that \nthis should in no way prejudge any impeachment activity that might \noccur in the House of Representatives for several reasons. In the first \nplace, we do not know what is in Judge Starr's report that will come to \nthe House of Representatives, and what I have described has public \ncirculation, indeed confirmation by the President himself, and \ntherefore need not depend upon Judge Starr's report in order for us to \nact upon it.\n  Second, Judge Starr's report and the action of the House of \nRepresentatives will not take place, if such action does occur, until \nthe 106th Congress. I believe that something as serious as this should \nbe commented on by the 105th Congress. I do not know that I will be in \nthe 106th Congress. I hope I will be. The political signs in my home \nState indicate that I will be. But I can take nothing for granted, and \nI raised with my colleagues yesterday the possibility of having this \nCongress go on record as stating that it found totally unacceptable and \nsubject to condemnation--because the word ``censure'' is a synonym for \ncondemn--the actions of the President in the three areas I have \ndescribed.\n  I pointedly said I do not want to go beyond those three areas with \nany resolution of censure because I do not know what is in Ken Starr's \nreport. I do not want to prejudge the issue of whether or not those \nthree items constitute impeachable offenses or high crimes and \nmisdemeanors as such offenses are described in the Constitution. I \nthink that is the responsibility for the House to undertake under the \nConstitution, and the House, in the 106th Congress, will make that \ndecision.\n  I raised that possibility within the Republican policy luncheon, for \nconversation and counsel from my colleagues. I received a good deal of \nconversation and counsel from my colleagues, both in that luncheon and \nsubsequent to it, and I have reflected on the matter myself in \nconversations with my staff. But, as I said, it was within an hour or \nso after I had made essentially the same statement that I have made \nhere within the policy luncheon that members of the press were after me \nand some of my colleagues, to say, ``Is Senator Bennett going to offer \na motion of censure with respect to the President of the United \nStates?'' I told those reporters, as I indicated earlier, that I would \ngive them their answer today.\n  The answer is no, Senator Bennett will not be offering a motion of \ncensure, for two reasons. First, there are some who would interpret \nthat motion of censure as an attempt to bring this issue to closure. \nClosure, interestingly enough, is a psychological term, not a legal \nterm. In legal terms, you come to guilty or innocent; you come to \n``case closed,'' with a final finding of fact. Closure seems to be a \npsychological term where you say the individual is now able to deal \nwith this issue.\n  But, aside from the semantic question involved, I do not want to be a \nparty to any suggestion that the investigation of the President's \nbehavior and the consideration of whether or not that behavior \nconstitutes an impeachable offense should come to an end by virtue of \nthe resolution that I might offer. So, for that first reason, I have \nconcluded that I will not, in fact, offer this resolution.\n  The second reason I have decided not to offer the resolution is \nbecause some have suggested that, since the Senate would ultimately be \nthe jury that would try any accusations with respect to impeachment, I \nshould not, as a Member of the Senate, prejudge the case. I can draw a \nfine line with which I would be comfortable that would say that my \nresolution of censure, saying that I found this behavior in the three \nareas I have described to be reprehensible, would not prejudge a \ndetermination as to whether that behavior constituted a high crime or \nmisdemeanor under the Constitution, and I would be comfortable with \nthat distinction. But since there are some who would not be comfortable \nand who would suggest that by offering the resolution I was prejudging \nthe case, I have also, for that second reason, decided that I will not \noffer that resolution.\n\n  That, I hope, Mr. President, clears up, if anybody had any concerns \nabout what I said yesterday in the policy luncheon, what I intend to \ndo.\n  I conclude, however, with this one final thought with respect to this \nissue. One of the reasons I considered offering the resolution, so that \nthe Senate at least would go on record as making it clear that this \nbehavior was unacceptable, is because I imagined this scenario in the \nfuture:\n  Let us suppose that at some point in the future--pick a date, 5 \nyears--the superintendent of West Point, a married man in his early \nfifties, became involved sexually with a 21-year-old female cadet who \nhad come to his office to bring him coffee. The superintendent \nmaintained a sexual relationship with that female cadet for the next 18 \nmonths while she was still within his purview and under some form or \nother of his control. Other cadets found out about the relationship and \nbegan talking about it in the scenario I am describing.\n  The superintendent, let us suppose, adamantly denies that the \nrelationship is going on, recognizing that it is totally inappropriate \nand wrong. An investigation is opened whereby legally constituted \nauthorities from the Department of Defense check into the rumors. The \nsuperintendent attacks the investigator, smears his ability and his \nintegrity, denies absolutely to his own circle of aides that the affair \nhad ever taken place, and allows the impression to go forward \nthroughout the entire community that he is the subject of a witch hunt \nbeing undertaken by the Department of Defense.\n\n[[Page S9809]]\n\n  After 7 months of stonewalling, denying and refusing to cooperate, \nthe superintendent is then forced to admit that, No. 1, the \nrelationship did take place; No. 2, he has been lying through the 7 \nmonths; and, No. 3, there has been a smearing of the reputation of \npeople of high integrity.\n  I would not want, under that circumstance, to have the superintendent \nthen approach the Department of Defense with a poll showing that 58 \npercent of the cadets were happy under his superintendency at West \nPoint and say, ``Since the Commander in Chief did something like this 5 \nyears ago and no reprimand of any kind came out of the Congress, why \ncannot I do exactly the same thing under these circumstances and not \nhave it affect my career?''\n  I wish the precedent to be laid down that says that this kind of \nactivity, whether it constitutes impeachable offenses or not, cannot go \nuncommented on in an official way. And just because I have decided that \nI will not offer this resolution in this Congress at this time for the \ntwo reasons I have outlined, I do make it clear, Mr. President, that \nshould the voters of Utah send me back here to serve in the 106th \nCongress, I will do what I can to give Members of Congress a clear \nopportunity, regardless of impeachment proceedings, to express their \nopinion on the behavior of the President of the United States in this \ncircumstance.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9807-8", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9809-S9819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TEXAS LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL COMPACT CONSENT ACT--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

The time on this conference report is limited \nto 40 minutes to be equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am now pleased to yield to my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to join the senior Senator from Maine, Senator \nSnowe, in urging my colleagues to approve the conference report on H.R. \n629, legislation that would ratify the Low-Level Radioactive Waste \nDisposal Compact, known as the Texas Compact.\n  In entering into an agreement for the disposal of low-level \nradioactive waste, the States of Maine, Texas, and Vermont followed the \ndirection established by the Congress in the Low-Level Radioactive \nWaste Policy Act and its 1985 amendments. That legislation contemplated \nthat States would form agreements of this nature for the disposal of \nlow-level waste, and thus, by ratifying the compact, Congress will be \ncompleting a process that it set in motion.\n  Since 1985, Congress has ratified 9 compacts involving 41 States. Put \ndifferently, 82 of the 100 Members of this body live in States with \ncompacts that have already been ratified by the Senate, and with the \napproval of the Texas Compact, that number will rise to 88. In short, \nwhat Maine, Texas, and Vermont are seeking today has already been \nroutinely granted in the vast majority of States.\n  While the disposal of radioactive waste is bound to generate \ncontroversy, this agreement has been overwhelmingly approved by the \nlegislatures of the three compacting States, signed by their Governors, \nand, in the case of the State of Maine, endorsed by voters in a \nreferendum. This is consistent with the congressional determination \nthat the States bear responsibility for the disposal of low-level \nradioactive waste and that, in the interest of limiting the number of \ndisposal sites, they work together to carry out this responsibility. \nIndeed, ratification by Congress is necessitated only because State-\nimposed limitations on the importation of waste would otherwise violate \nthe commerce clause.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota, whom I enjoy serving with \non the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, has criticized the \ndisposal site that is under consideration by the State of Texas. Apart \nfrom the fact that the location of the site is a matter for Texas to \ndetermine and is not a component of this bill, that criticism is \nunsupported by the facts.\n  In making the decision to consider the proposed site in Hudspeth \nCounty, TX, there has been extensive public involvement as well as a \nthorough environmental and technical review. The county was found to \nhave two critical characteristics for a disposal site; namely, very \nlittle rainfall and very low population density. Indeed, the county is \nthe size of the State of Connecticut and has a population of only 2,800 \npeople, and it must be remembered, Mr. President, that this is only a \nproposed site. Final approval will not be forthcoming unless all of the \nstandards established by Texas law are satisfied.\n  The decision to consider the site in Texas has nothing to do with who \nlives there. It has everything to do with the fact that very few people \nlive there.\n  This body has been presented with nine low-level radioactive waste \ncompacts. It has not imposed changes on any one of those agreements. In \nkeeping with congressionally established policy for the disposal of \nlow-level waste, Maine, Texas, and Vermont are simply seeking the same \ntreatment.\n  I commend my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, for her leadership \non this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support the conference \nreport. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise again this morning to speak \nagainst the conference report to H.R. 629. This is the Texas-Maine-\nVermont Compact which will result in the dumping of low-level \nradioactive waste from Texas, Maine, and Vermont, and potentially other \nStates, at a dump located in Texas. The dump is expected to be built in \nthe town of Sierra Blanca in Hudspeth County where 66 percent of the \nresidents are Latino, and 39 percent live below the poverty line.\n\n  Mr. President, the construction of this dump site in this community \nraises important questions of environmental justice. This is not just \nabout the people in Hudspeth County or about the people in Sierra \nBlanca, or about west Texas for that matter. This is a fight for \ncommunities all across the country who do not have the political clout \nto keep this pollution out. This is a fight for minority communities \nwho are burdened with a disproportionate share of these sites.\n  It seems to be a pattern in our country, whenever we decide where we \nare going to build a power line or where we are going to build a \nnuclear waste dump site or where we are going to put an incinerator, it \nnever is located in communities where people who live in those \ncommunities have political clout. It is not located where the heavy \nhitters and the well-connected and the people who give the big \ncontributions live. It is almost always located in communities of \ncolor.\n  Mr. President, there is an article today that I recommend for my \ncolleagues in the New York Times entitled, ``For Some, Texas Town Is \nToo Popular as Waste Disposal Site.'' This is all about what we are \ndebating today. I just read the conclusion. Maria Mendez, a retired \nschool aide from Allamore, who lives in the community, is quoted as \nsaying:\n\n       I think Sierra Blanca was chosen for all this dumping \n     because we don't have any political clout. I think it's a \n     racism thing; I really do. Here we are, the hugest dump in \n     the whole world. First sludge, now nuclear waste. Our home \n     has been taken over as the nation's dumping ground.\n\n  Mr. President and colleagues, environmental justice is a difficult \nissue. Too often we hide behind excuses. We say, ``These are private \nsector decisions. This is a matter of State and\n\n[[Page S9810]]\n\nlocal responsibility. It is too hard to prove.'' But this is pretty \neasy. The dump will not be built if we reject this compact. We have \ndirect responsibility, we have a Federal role, a direct Federal role. \nWe cannot wash our hands of this. We cannot walk away and pretend we \nare not to blame. We are all responsible. And it is important to take a \nstand.\n  This compact raises troubling issues of environmental justice. In \nthis case, the Texas Legislature selected Hudspeth County. They already \nselected Hudspeth County. And the Texas Waste Authority selected the \nSierra Blanca site after the Authority's scoping study had already \nruled out Sierra Blanca as scientifically unsuitable. The Waste \nAuthority selected the site after the Authority's own scoping study had \nruled Sierra Blanca out as scientifically unsuitable; that is to say a \ngeologically active area; that is to say an earthquake area.\n  Communities near the preferred site have had enough political clout \nto keep the dump out, but Sierra Blanca--already the site of the \nlargest sewage sludge project in our country--was not so fortunate. The \nWaste Authority does a scoping study. The scoping study says this is \nnot scientifically suitable, but the Waste Authority goes ahead and \nchooses this community. Why not? Disproportionately poor, \ndisproportionately Latino. This is an issue of environmental justice.\n  The residents of Sierra Blanca, Hudspeth County and west Texas do not \nwant this dump. Last night, some of my colleagues talked about the \nelection of one official, and they said the people want this dump. This \ncandidate was elected, and he was for it. But twenty surrounding \ncounties and 13 nearby cities have passed resolutions against it. And \nno city or county in west Texas supports it.\n  Nor would any Senator in this Chamber want this waste dump site built \nin their backyard. I doubt whether any Senator in this Chamber has ever \nbeen faced with this. These waste dump sites are not put where Senators \nlive. They are put in the communities disproportionately of color, \ndisproportionately low-income. This is a debate about environmental \njustice in our country.\n  Over 800 adult residents of Sierra Blanca have signed petitions \nopposing the dump. A 1992 poll, commissioned by the Texas Waste \nAuthority, showed 64 percent opposition in Hudspeth and Culberson \nCounties. Republican Congressman Bonilla, who represents Hudspeth \nCounty, and Democratic Congressmen Reyes and Rodriguez, who represent \nneighboring El Paso and San Antonio, have all actively opposed the dump \nsite.\n  In an October 1994 statewide poll, 82 percent of Texans said they \nwere against it. Local residents have had no say over whether the waste \ndump site will be constructed in Sierra Blanca. They were never \nconsulted at any stage in the decision-making process.\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. President, a 1984 public opinion survey \ncommissioned by the Texas Waste Authority provides some useful context \nfor what is going on. Let me just quote from what their consultant \nsaid. This is the report:\n\n       One population that may benefit from [a public information] \n     campaign is Hispanics, particularly those with little formal \n     education and low incomes. This group is the least informed \n     of all segments of the population. . . . The Authority should \n     be aware, however, that increasing the level of knowledge of \n     Hispanics may simply increase opposition to the [radioactive \n     dump] site, inasmuch as we have discovered a strong \n     relationship in the total sample between increased perceived \n     knowledge and increased opposition.\n\n  The concern is that if this poor Hispanic community finds out more \nabout this, they will be opposed to it. Indeed, people in the community \nare opposed. And they should be.\n  Mr. President, my colleague, with all due respect, last night said we \nneed to have the compact to protect the people in Hudspeth County from \nbecoming a national repository of nuclear waste. That is not the way it \nworks.\n  The conference report on H.R. 629 would allow appointed compact \ncommissioners to import radioactive waste from any State or territory. \nAnd both the State of Texas and nuclear utilities across the country \nwill have an economic incentive to bring as much waste as possible to \nmake this site economically viable and to reduce their disposal costs.\n  Section 3.05, paragraph 6 of the compact provides that the Compact \nCommission may enter into an agreement with any person, State, regional \nbody, or group of States for importation of low-level radioactive \nwaste. All it requires is a majority vote of the eight unelected \ncompact commissioners.\n  Mr. President, the Texas Observer, March 28, 1997, had it right:\n\n       More than two or three national dumps will drive fees so \n     low that profit margins anticipated by states (and now \n     private investors) will be threatened. This economic \n     reality--and growing public resistance to the dumps--has \n     raised the very real possibility that the next dump permitted \n     will be the nuclear waste depository for the whole nation, \n     for decades to come.\n\n  Of these nine compacts, I want to point out to my colleagues that not \none compact has built a nuclear waste dump site.\n  Mr. President, here is what is so egregious about what has happened \nhere. To avoid turning this low-income, Mexican-American community into \na national repository for radioactive waste, I offered two amendments. \nColleagues, this is really what the vote is about. Twice you have been \non record. The Senate has unanimously said, A, ``We support an \namendment which makes it clear that the waste can only come from Maine, \nVermont, and Texas. We support an amendment that puts in the language \nwhat we say this is about.'' That was passed twice by the unanimous \nvote of the U.S. Senate.\n  The second amendment said that the people in Hudspeth County would \nhave a chance to prove local discrimination in court, that if they \ncould show they have been unfairly targeted then they could go to court \nto challenge this.\n  My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, we have gone on record \ntwice supporting these amendments. In the dark of night--no wonder \npeople get so disillusioned about this process--the conference \ncommittee stripped out both amendments, took both amendments out.\n  Would it be such a crime if we passed this compact with an amendment \nthat made it clear that the waste could only come from Texas, Maine, \nand Vermont? That is what they say the compact is about. Would it be \nsuch a crime if this Hispanic community had some way of seeking redress \nof grievance and could challenge discrimination in court? That \namendment was taken out. That is why this compact is flawed. That is \nwhy we should vote against it.\n\n  Environmental justice is a national responsibility. We have a \nnational responsibility to remedy this injustice because if we do not, \nthe Congress will be complicit in the construction of this dump.\n  This is not purely a State or local issue. We have to vote on it. We \nhave to vote up or down. That is what our constitutional system is all \nabout. This compact requires congressional consent. The Texas Compact \ncannot take effect without Federal legislation, since all 50 States--\nnot just the compact States--will be asked to give their consent.\n  Construction of the Sierra Blanca dump depends upon enactment of this \nconference report. If we reject it today, Texas will not build a dump \nin Sierra Blanca. But within 60 days of enactment, if you vote for \nthis, Maine and Vermont will pay Texas $25 million to begin \nconstruction.\n  Let me point out this is different from all the other compacts \nbecause it is crystal clear where the site is going to be. The Texas \nLegislature already selected Hudspeth County, and the Texas Waste \nAuthority already identified a dump site near Sierra Blanca. That is \nwhat is at issue here.\n  Our consent ought to be conditional. We ought to make it clear that \nthe compact can take effect only if the waste comes from these three \nStates only. But the conference committee knocked that amendment out--\nthe utility companies didn't want that.\n  We ought to make it clear the people of Hudspeth County at least have \na right to appeal this site selection. I think people in Maine and \nVermont agree with that idea, but we took that amendment out.\n  This is not a debate about State or local rights. The conference \ncommittee\n\n[[Page S9811]]\n\nfollowed the wishes of the nuclear utilities, not the local residents--\nthe utilities who were going to benefit from cheap disposal of nuclear \nwaste. They supported this legislation with no amendments. That is why \nthis legislation is so flawed.\n  On July 7, 1998, two administrative hearing officers recommended that \nthe license for the Sierra Blanca dump be denied. They made a good \ndecision. What they said was that this is a tectonically active area. \nWe have a very real danger of earthquakes. This does not make sense \nfrom the point of view of science. And they were right.\n  But the problem is that the Texas Environmental Agency, the TNRCC, \nmade up of officials appointed by the Governor, are not bound by what \nthese hearing officers have recommended. The executive director has \ngone on record saying that he doesn't agree. And the Governor has gone \non record saying that Hudspeth County and Sierra Blanca is the right \nplace for this dump to be.\n  I say to my colleagues that we really have two choices here. We can \nsay, look, if we don't know where the site is going to be, then let's \nput off the vote. But, no, that is not what we are doing. The idea here \nis to just ram this through. As soon as we do, believe me, it will go \nin Hudspeth County, Sierra Blanca. That will be a travesty.\n  I want to just cite for colleagues the broad coalition of religious, \nenvironmental, social justice and public interest groups that oppose \nthis: The League of United Latin American Citizens, LULAC; Greenpeace; \nthe Texas NAACP; the Mexican American Legislative Caucus of the Texas \nHouse of Representatives; the Sierra Club; the House Hispanic Caucus; \nthe Bishop and the Catholic Diocese of El Paso; the United Methodist \nChurch General Board of Church and Society; Friends of the Earth; \nPhysicians for Social Responsibility; the League of Conservation \nVoters; and 100 other local and national civic organizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nRobert Bullard, a professor at Clark Atlanta University, a leading \nexpert on environmental justice.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     Clark Atlanta University,\n\n                                   Atlanta, GA, September 1, 1998.\n     Vice President Al Gore,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Vice President Gore: We are pleased to have an \n     administration that cares about people, the environment, and \n     justice. This letter is to express my concern about the \n     Texas/Maine/Vermont Compact and its environmental justice \n     implications. The issue is plain and simple. To allow the \n     compact to go forward would be an act of environmental \n     racism. For this administration to stand silent does not show \n     a commitment to environmental injustice that follows a \n     national pattern of siting waste facilities and other locally \n     unwanted land uses or LULUS in people of color and low-income \n     communities.\n       Having written several books and researched environmental \n     problems in communities of color for more than two decades, \n     it is very clear to me that the Sierra Blanca case is a \n     classic case of environmental racism. For this administration \n     to stand silent does not show a commitment to environmental \n     justice or a commitment to protect the civil rights of the \n     residents in Sierra Blanca, Texas. Many grassroots community \n     leaders I have talked to want to see the Clinton \n     Administration come out with a strong, bold, and powerful \n     public statement in opposition to the Texas/Maine/Vermont \n     Compact.\n       The people in Texas and across the nation need your help \n     and support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert D. Bullard,\n                                      Ware Professor and Director.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me read a portion of the letter.\n\n       This letter is to express my concern about the Texas/Maine/\n     Vermont Compact and its environmental justice implications. \n     The issue is plain and simple. To allow the compact to go \n     forward would be an act of environmental injustice that \n     follows a national pattern of siting waste facilities and \n     other LULUs [locally unwanted land uses] in people of color \n     and low-income communities. Having . . . researched \n     environmental problems in communities of color for more than \n     two decades, it is very clear to me that the Sierra Blanca \n     case is a classic case of environmental racism.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 15 minutes 50 \nseconds remaining and the Senator from Minnesota has 3 minutes 59 \nseconds remaining.\n  Ms. SNOWE. May I be informed when I have consumed 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senator when she has \nconsumed 10 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I think it is important this morning to \nreview some of the facts regarding this conference report before the \nSenate that creates this Texas Compact, because I do think that some of \nthe facts have been lightly regarded during the course of this debate.\n  This is nothing that hasn't been done before. This conference report \nwill ratify a compact between the States of Texas, Maine and Vermont \nfor the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, as has been done on \nnine previous occasions by the U.S. Congress in response to a mandate \nby the Congress in both 1980 and 1985 that required the States to \naccept responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste.\n  Mr. President, 41 States--including the State of Minnesota, the State \nwhich the Senator represents and who opposes this compact--have entered \ninto a compact over the last 20 years in response to the mandate that \nwas issued by the U.S. Congress. There are nine such compacts.\n  This compact in this conference report does not deviate from the \nprevious compacts. The fact of the matter is this compact gives greater \ncontrol to the State of Texas in terms of the determination of the \nsiting and all of the other factors to repeatedly and safely dispose of \nlow-level radioactive waste. This compact allows the State of Texas, \nthe State of Vermont and the State of Maine to do what 41 other States, \nincluding Senator Wellstone's own State of Minnesota, do--to dispose of \nthis low-level radioactive waste. The States are responsible for making \nthis determination, whether it is in their State or out of their State, \nfor the waste that is generated within their borders.\n  There are other factors that have to be clarified here today. The \nSenator from Minnesota said no other States in these compacts have \ndetermined or designated other sites--which is incorrect--at the time \nof the ratification. In fact, three other compacts--the Northwest, the \nRocky Mountain and the Southeast, which passed by the Congress in \n1985--had operating facilities that were intentionally designated as \nthe compact's regional facility.\n  As has been said, the failure of this Congress to ratify this \nconference report to create this compact will result in no facility \nbeing built in Texas.\n  As this chart illustrates, there are 684 such storage sites in the \nState of Texas. They are temporary. They are interim storage \nfacilities. What does that mean? It means that they don't have to meet \nall the same strict requirements that a permanent storage facility will \nhave to meet. So if this conference report is ratified by the Congress, \nthat means the State of Texas can consolidate into one permanent \nfacility to meet all of the State, local and Federal requirements.\n  It is not, as the Senator from Minnesota has suggested, that we are \nrunning roughshod, we are going to override all of the strict Federal, \nState and local regulatory requirements with respect to safety and \nhealth regulations, and of course environmental regulations. This issue \nisn't going to go away. The waste has already been generated. In fact, \neven the administrative law judge wants the commission to go back to \nreview essential factors to indicate that the process is working so \nthat all of the requirements under Federal, State and local law are \nexamined very carefully, in terms of the site, so that it is \nenvironmentally and geologically safe and sound. But even the \nadministrative law judge determined on July 7 that, indeed, the State \nof Texas is in need of a low-level waste disposal site.\n\n  Congress did not put conditions on the nine other compacts that were \nratified by Congress on previous occasions. So this compact should not \nbe dealt with any differently. We are going to adhere to all of the \nsafe requirements that have been established in law. So the siting in \nTexas is not being done in a vacuum. To the contrary.\n  Just to name a few of the regulatory requirements that have to be \nreviewed and have to be satisfied and have to be adhered to and are \nbeing done, as included in this book right here that goes through the \nentirety of the process\n\n[[Page S9812]]\n\nthat has been implemented in the State of Texas for a siting of a \nfacility, there is the Civil Rights Act, which has to be adhered to; \ntitle VI of the Civil Rights Act has to be regarded; the Clean Water \nAct; the Clean Air Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Atomic \nEnergy Act; the 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act; the 1985 \nAmendments; the Texas Radiation Control Act, and the Texas Health and \nSafety Code. They all must be adhered to.\n  So there is a process. The Senator from Minnesota suggests that there \nhas not been a process, or public participation. To the contrary, there \nhas been extensive public participation, and the process is not over. \nThis compact is site neutral. That doesn't mean to say that the State \nof Texas hasn't been examining the site in Sierra Blanca, but the \nprocess has not been completed. It is being examined very carefully. \nThere has been public participation. There have been numerous hearings \nwithin Hudspeth County and Sierra Blanca specifically about this issue. \nThe Texas Legislature overwhelmingly has supported it in both the house \nand senate, as have the Governors, Governor Richards and Governor Bush; \nthe State of Vermont, both legislatures, and the State of Maine, on a \nbipartisan basis. In fact, 24 of the 30 members of the Texas \ncongressional delegation are all in support of this conference report. \nSo it has been regarded.\n  I want to read to my colleagues an open letter to the people of the \nState of Texas from 100 residents of Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County. \nI ask unanimous consent to have a letter from Judge Peace, the county \njudge, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Hudspeth County Courthouse,\n\n                               Sierra Blanca, TX, August 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: It is my understanding that the \n     United States Senate will be considering the Texas/Maine/\n     Vermont Compact soon. I want to thank you for supporting this \n     important measure. Its passage will bring needed revenue and \n     opportunity to our area. Sierra Blanca has already benefited \n     greatly from the presence of the Texas Low-Level Radioactive \n     Waste Disposal Authority in the area. The benefits (jobs and \n     infrastructure improvement) will increase during construction \n     and operation of the low-level radioactive waste disposal \n     facility. The truth is the socieconomic benefits for the \n     residents of Sierra Blanca are enormous and overwhelmingly \n     positive. Continued economic benefits are absolutely critical \n     to the future development of Hudspeth County.\n       I want you to know that the majority of citizens favor the \n     development of such a facility. I have enclosed an \n     advertisement that recently ran in the Austin American \n     Statesman, paid for by donations and community funds. The \n     people of Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County voiced their \n     support for a better future and tangible real life advances \n     that will make our communities more livable. The \n     advertisement reflects the widespread support in our area for \n     this project; the support runs across the business community \n     to elected officials. During the recent primary elections, \n     this issue was openly debated in the County Judge, \n     Commissioners Court, and County Democratic Chairmanship \n     races; those who supported the project won, while those who \n     opposed it lost.\n       Thank you for your continued support. If you have further \n     questions or if I can help you in any other way, please feel \n     free to call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Judge James A. Peace.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I want to read this open letter that was placed as an \nadvertisement in a local newspaper:\n\n       We support the approval of the license for the proposed \n     radioactive waste disposal facility near our town. It offers \n     hope for a better future and tangible, real-life advances \n     that will make Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County more \n     livable. The overwhelming majority of residents support this \n     project near our town for the following reasons:\n       A halt to exporting our children to other areas for \n     employment; a larger job market for all residents of Sierra \n     Blanca and Hudspeth County; the ripple effect seen from \n     additional businesses and services to support the facility; \n     improved medical care; increased property values; a broader \n     tax base; enhanced infrastructure; disposal fees paid to the \n     county; upward mobility, and an improved standard of living; \n     a better perception of our community by ourselves and others.\n       The critics--almost all of whom live outside the \n     community--say the proposed site is not a reasonable road to \n     economic development for Sierra Blanca. We say that these \n     people do not speak for us and that this is our only road in \n     sight.\n\n  I believe the people of Hudspeth County have spoken. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n          [From the Austin American-Statesman, July 22, 1998]\n\n An Open Letter to the People of the State of Texas From Residents of \n                Sierra Blanca, Texas and Hudspeth County\n\n       We support the approval of the license for the proposed \n     radioactive waste disposal facility near our town. It offers \n     hope for a better future and tangible, real life advances \n     that will make Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County more \n     livable. The overwhelming majority of residents support this \n     project near our town for the following reasons:\n       A halt to exporting our children to other areas for \n     employment,\n       A larger job market for all the residents of Sierra Blanca \n     and Hudspeth County,\n       The ripple effect seen from additional businesses and \n     services to support the facility,\n       Improved medical care,\n       A broader tax base,\n       Enhanced infrastructure,\n       Disposal fees paid to the County,\n       Upward mobility and an improved standard of living, and\n       A better perception of our community by ourselves and \n     others.\n       Until the proposed project, the only method of upward \n     mobility and economic development for the residents of Sierra \n     Blanca was a bus ticket out of town. There was little hope \n     for economic progress. Sierra Blanca was destined to be a \n     small, remote, dying community.\n       The critics--almost all of whom live outside the \n     community--say the proposed site is not a reasonable road to \n     economic development for Sierra Blanca. We say that these \n     people do not speak for us and that this is the only road in \n     sight.\n       After four years of intensive review, TNRCC issued a \n     favorable Environmental Assessment. We are totally satisfied \n     that the project will be safe and the residents of Sierra \n     Blanca want it to be licensed. It is a sign of hope and a \n     brighter future.\n       The only negative socio-economic impact would be the denial \n     of the license and the decision to site the facility \n     elsewhere.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. The fact of the matter is that there has been extensive \npublic participation, and it has not been completed. In fact, there \nwere local elections in Hudspeth County, and all of the candidates who \nwere in support of this facility were elected or reelected. I think \nthat speaks volumes. This was an issue in those campaigns. I will also \nsubmit for the Record the list of supporters of the compact and the \nfollowing letters; a letter from nine Texas Members of the House of \nRepresentatives; the Governors of Maine, Texas and Vermont; a letter \nfrom the National Governors' Association; the National Conference of \nState Legislatures; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; a ``Dear \nColleague'' by two members of the Texas House of Representatives. All \nof them are in support of the Texas Compact before us here today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list and these letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Support for Texas Compact Consent Act\n\n\n    Organizational Support (18 national organizations, 11 regional \n                             organizations)\n\n       Organizations United (American Association of Physicists in \n     Medicine, American College of Nuclear Physicians, American \n     Council on Education, American Heart Association, American \n     Medical Association, American Nuclear Society, American \n     Society of Nuclear Cardiology, Appalachian Compact Users of \n     Radioactive Isotopes Association, Association of American \n     Medical Colleges, California Radioactive Materials Management \n     Forum, Council on Radionuclides and Radiopharmaceuticals, \n     Edison Electrical Institute, Health Physics Society, \n     International Isotope Society, Michigan Coalition of \n     Radioactive Material Users, National Association of Cancer \n     Patients, National Electrical Manufacturers Association, \n     Nuclear Energy Institute, Pharmaceutical Research and \n     Manufacturers of America, Society of Nuclear Medicine, \n     Society of Prospective Medicine); Robert Carretta, Chair, \n     Organizations United.--March 16, 1998; May 1, 1996.\n       Society of Nuclear Medicine, Southwestern Chapter; \n     Resolution.

Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: As members of the Texas delegation, \n     we urge you to lift your hold on H.R. 629/ S. 270, the Texas \n     Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact.\n       This bill follows the guidelines set forth by Congress in \n     1985, setting up a compact for the disposal of low-level \n     radioactive waste. The legislation is strongly supported by \n     the three states affected--Texas, Maine, and Vermont--and \n     H.R. 629 passed the House by an overwhelming vote of 309-107.\n       We appreciate the concerns that have been expressed about \n     radioactive waste, and the impact that it could have on our \n     environment if not properly handled. We agree that these are \n     important issues which must be fully and completely \n     examined--a process that is currently under way in Texas \n     through an intense administrative hearing process.\n       But ultimately, low-level radioactive waste exists and all \n     parties are better served if there are safe and secure \n     disposal facilities. While this may not be the best solution \n     for all states--such as Minnesota--the Texas State \n     Legislature, in conjunction with the state leadership of \n     Vermont and Maine, has come to agreement for the waste \n     generated in those states.\n       Finally, concerns have been raised regarding the location \n     of the proposed disposal site in Texas. This site was not \n     selected by the U.S. Congress, and the bill before us does \n     not reference a specific site.\n       We urge you to lift your hold on this Texas bill so that \n     the process may move forward and this agreement may be \n     implemented.\n         Chet Edwards, Martin Frost, Max Sandlin, Eddie Bernice \n           Johnson, Ralph Hall, Charles W. Stenholm, Ken Bentsen, \n           Gene Green, Jim Turner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   State of Texas,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                        Austin, TX, July 15, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: As the Governors of the member states, we \n     strongly urge passage by the U.S. Senate of S. 270, the Texas \n     Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Consent Act.\n       The 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act and its \n     1985 amendments make each state ``responsible for providing, \n     either by itself or in cooperation with other states,'' for \n     disposal of its own commercial low-level radioactive waste. \n     In compliance with this federal legislation, the states of \n     Texas, Maine and Vermont have arranged to manage their waste \n     through the terms of the Texas Compact. This compact passed \n     the legislatures of the states involved and is supported by \n     all three Governors. Texas, Maine and Vermont have complied \n     with all federal and state laws and regulations in forming \n     this compact. For the Congress to deny ratification of the \n     Texas Compact would be a serious breach of states' rights and \n     a rejection of Congress' previous mandate to the states.\n       It is important to remember that S. 270 is site neutral--a \n     vote on S. 270 is neither a vote to endorse nor oppose the \n     proposed site in Texas. Federal legislation leaves the siting \n     of a facility to state governments and should be resolved \n     during formal licensing proceedings. Currently, the Texas \n     Natural Resource Conservation Commission is conducting the \n     appropriate hearings.\n       Please vote to supply the member states of the Texas \n     Compact with the same protections that you have already given \n     42 states in the nine previously approved compacts. Thank you \n     for your time and attention on this very important matter. We \n     appreciate all efforts made on behalf of states' rights.\n           Sincerely,\n     George W. Bush.\n     Howard Dean, M.D.\n     Angus S. King, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                                    March 2, 1998.\n       Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the National \n     Governors' Association, we urge you to adopt S. 270 without \n     amendment. This bill provides congressional consent to the \n     Texas-Maine-Vermont Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact. The \n     National Governors' Association (NGA) policy in support of \n     this compact is attached. We are convinced that this \n     voluntary compact provides for the safe and responsible \n     disposal of low-level waste produced in the three member \n     states.\n       As you know, under the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy \n     Act (LLRWPA) of 1980, Congress mandated that states assume \n     responsibility for disposal of low level radioactive waste, \n     and created a compact system that provides states with the \n     legal authority to restrict, dispose of, and manage waste. \n     Since 1995, forty-one states have entered into nine \n     congressional approved compacts without amendments or \n     objections. The Texas-Maine-Vermont Compact deserves to be \n     the tenth.\n       Your support for this bipartisan measure, which has the \n     full support and cooperation of the Governors and \n     legislatures of the three participant states, will be \n     crucial.\n       If you have any questions concerning this matter, please \n     don't hesitate to contact Tom Curtis of the NGA staff at \n     (202) 624-5389.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor George V. Veinovich,\n       Chairman, National Governors' Association.\n     Governor Tom Carper,\n       Vice Chairman, National Governors' Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Conference\n\n\n                                        of State Legislatures,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1998.\n     Re: S. 270, the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal \n         Compact Consent Act\n\n\n         NCSL urges you to support this bill WITHOUT AMENDMENT\n\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The National Conference of State \n     Legislatures (NCSL) urges you to support S. 270, the Texas \n     Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Consent Act, \n     which will allow the states of Maine, Texas, and Vermont to \n     continue to work together to develop a facility in Hudspeth \n     County, Texas for the disposal of the low-level radioactive \n     waste produced in those three states. NCSL has consistently \n     reiterated its firm belief that states must be allowed to \n     exercise their authority over the storage and disposal of \n     low-level radioactive waste, authority that was granted to \n     them by Congress in the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy \n     Act of 1980 and the Low-Level Waste Policy Act Amendments of \n     1985.\n       NCSL is concerned about H.R. 629, the version of the Texas \n     Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Consent Act \n     which passed through the House of Representatives last \n     October. H.R. 629 was amended with language that was not in \n     the compact as approved by the Maine, Texas and Vermont state \n     legislatures. No low-level radioactive waste compact between \n     states has ever been amended by Congress. We believe that the \n     amendments to H.R. 629 would establish an unfortunate \n     precedent for Congressional tinkering with agreements that \n     have already been passed by their relevant state \n     legislatures.\n       The states of Maine, Texas, and Vermont have already \n     expended significant time and resources in order to negotiate \n     an agreement on the Hudspeth County facility. It would be \n     inappropriate for Congress to attempt to alter a valid effort \n     by the Compact states to meet their responsibilities under \n     the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. We urge you to \n     support S. 270 without amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Craig Peterson,\n       Utah State Senate, Chair, NCSL Environment Committee.\n     Carol S. Petzold,\n       Maryland House of Delegates, Chair, NCSL Energy & \n     Transportation Committee\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Nuclear Regulatory Commission,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: In response to the request from your \n     staff, here are the views of the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission (NRC) on two proposed amendments to S. 270, a bill \n     to provide the consent of Congress to the Texas Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste (LLW) Disposal Compact. The proposed \n     amendments would add two new conditions to the conditions of \n     consent to the compact: (1) that no LLW may be brought into \n     Texas for disposal at a compact facility from any State other \n     than Maine or Vermont (referred to below as the ``exclusion'' \n     amendment): and (2) that ``the compact not be implemented . . \n     . in any way that discriminates against any community \n     (through disparate treatment or disparate impact) by reason \n     of the composition of the community in terms of race, color, \n     national origin, or income level'' (referred to below as the \n     ``discrimination clause''). These amendments raise some \n     significant questions of concern to the NRC.\n       First, no other Congressional compact ratification \n     legislation has included such conditions to Congress' \n     consent. Making the Congressional consent for this compact \n     different from that for other compacts would create an \n     asymmetrical system and could lead to conflicts among \n     regions. In the past, Congress has set a high priority on \n     establishing a consistent set of rules under which the \n     interstate compact system for LLW disposal would operate.\n       With respect to the exclusion condition, while the Low-\n     Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 and the Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 authorize \n     compact States to exclude LLW from outside their compact \n     region, the terms of doing so are left to the States. This is \n     consistent with the intent of these statutes to make LLW \n     disposal the responsibility of the States and to leave the \n     implementation of that responsibility largely to the States' \n     discretion. Thus, the addition of the exclusion condition to \n     the compact would deprive the party States of the ability to \n     make their own choices as to how to handle this important \n     area. In addition, restriction on importation of LLW into \n     Texas to waste coming\n\n[[Page S9814]]\n\n     from Maine or Vermont could prevent other compacts (or non-\n     compact States) from contracting with the Texas compact for \n     disposal of their waste (such as has occurred between the \n     Rocky Mountain and Northwest compacts). This type of \n     arrangement with existing LLW disposal facilities may well \n     become a preferred economical method of LLW disposal. It is \n     also important to note that the exclusion condition may \n     hamper NRC emergency access to the Texas facility pursuant to \n     section 8 of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy \n     Amendments Act of 1985.\n       With respect to the discrimination clause, the Commission \n     supports the general objectives of efforts to address \n     discrimination involving ``race, color, national origin, or \n     income level.'' However, it is unclear how a condition \n     containing broad language of the type contained in the \n     proposed amendment would be applied in a specific case \n     involving a compact. This lack of clarity is likely to create \n     confusion and uncertainty for all parties involved, and could \n     lead to costly, time-consuming litigation. Including such a \n     provision in binding legislation may have broad significance \n     for the affected States and other parties and would appear to \n     warrant extensive Congressional review of its implications.\n       In light of the above, the NRC opposes the approval of \n     amendments to S. 270 that would incorporate the exclusion \n     condition or an undefined discrimination clause into the \n     Texas compact bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Shirley Ann Jackson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear CBC Member: We are writing to ask you to vote for H.R. \n     629, a bill we both are cosponsoring to ratify the Texas-\n     Maine-Vermont Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact.\n       Although H.R. 629 specifically provides Congressional \n     consent for the Texas, Maine, and Vermont Compact which \n     provides for the safe, responsible disposal of low-level \n     waste produced in those three states, every state has a stake \n     in the success of this compact. The Low-Level Radioactive \n     Waste Policy Act (LLRWPA) of 1980 requires states to manage \n     the disposal of low-level waste. The compact system provides \n     a mechanism for states to ensure their control over the \n     origin of the waste and allows the individual host staet--\n     with input from interested citizens--to determine the \n     appropriate location for the disposal site.\n       Your state may or may not be one of the 41 states that have \n     entered into the 9 compacts previously ratified by congress. \n     Either way, passage of H.R. 629 will reaffirm your State's \n     right both to control local land use and, subject to federal \n     and state health, safety, and environmental laws, to \n     determine the best and safest location for disposing of your \n     State's waste.\n       Through bipartisan cooperation, the Governors and \n     Legislatures of Texas, Vermont, and Maine negotiated and \n     ratified this Compact in full compliance with all federal and \n     state laws. Since 1985, nine other compacts comprising 41 \n     states have been ratified by congress without amendment or \n     objection. Please join us in helping all of our States to \n     protect the health and safety of our citizens by co-\n     sponsoring and voting for the Texas-Maine-Vermont Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste Compact ratification bill.\n       In the last Congress, some members of the Texas delegation \n     opposed ratification of the Compact because of concerns over \n     the location for the proposed site in Texas. We are satisfied \n     that all appropriate health, safety, and environmental \n     concerns are being addressed in a responsible manner by the \n     Texas state government.\n       The Commerce Committee reported H.R. 629 on June 25th. The \n     bill will be coming to the floor soon. We strongly urge you \n     to vote for this bill.\n     Eddie Bernice Johnson,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Sheila Jackson Lee,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. The fact of the matter is that there has been a public \nprocess. There has been very careful evaluation and concern about the \nviews of the constituents in the local area of Hudspeth County, of \nSierra Blanca, of the State of Texas. The fact is, the Senator from \nMinnesota wants to treat the States of Texas, Vermont, and Maine \ndifferently from 41 other States, including the Senator's own State of \nMinnesota.\n  The States of Texas, Vermont, and Maine are doing just what the \nCongress required them to do--enter into a compact. The failure of this \nCongress to approve this conference report and ratify this compact \nwould mean that the State of Texas could not create one safe permanent \ndisposal for low-level radioactive waste; that they would have to \nmaintain 684 temporary storage facilities that do not meet the strict \nFederal, State and local requirements that this permanent facility \nwould be required to meet.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt this conference \nreport. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, would the Chair please notify me when I \nhave 2 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, A, this is the only compact the Senate \nhas considered where we have a site identified for construction of a \ncompact dump. In this particular case, 90 percent or more of that waste \nis going to come from nuclear power plants.\n  B, with all due respect to my colleague, the argument that the people \nin Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County want this is an argument that just \ncannot be accepted on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Eight hundred adult \nresidents of this town of Sierra Blanca signed petitions in opposition. \nA 1992 poll commissioned by the Texas Waste Authority showed 64 percent \nin opposition. In a poll in 1994, 82 percent of Texans were against it. \nIt just doesn't wash.\n  Third, as colleagues follow this debate, again, the Texas legislature \nselected Hudspeth County. The Texas Waste Authority selected the Sierra \nBlanca site after the Authority's own scoping study said it is not \nscientifically suitable. But this was the path of least political \nresistance. This is an issue of environmental justice. This is being \nput on the back of a community that is disproportionately Hispanic and \npoor. That is what today's article in the New York Times is all about.\n  Finally, let me name some of the members of a coalition of religious, \nenvironmental, social justice and public interest groups who oppose the \ncompact. I cite the League of United Latin American Citizens, LULAC. \nThe Latino community should make us accountable on this vote. This is \nan issue of environmental justice. Then there is GreenPeace, the Texas \nNAACP, the Texas House of Representatives Mexican-American Legislative \nCaucus, the Sierra Club, the House Hispanic Caucus, and the League of \nConservation Voters. I reserve my final 2 minutes, the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me go back to the basic reason we are \ndebating this Compact today. This Compact is before the Senate today \nbecause we shifted the responsibility to manage low-level nuclear waste \nto the states almost a decade ago. Congress encouraged the states to \nenter into compacts to share this responsibility. Forty-one states have \nalready followed our direction by entering into compacts very similar \nto the one we have before us today. With the expectation that Congress \nwould ratify their compact, just like we have nine other times, the \nstates of Texas, Vermont and Maine entered into this Compact.\n  That was more than four years ago. We have delayed this Compact long \nenough. The amendments that Senator Wellstone offered to the Compact \nwhen it passed the Senate earlier this year would delay implementation \nof this Compact even further. When the Conference Committee considered \nthese amendments, we not only heard opposition to the amendments from \nthe National Governors' Association and the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, but also from each of the governors of Texas, Maine and \nVermont.\n  Their letter urges Congress to pass the Compact without amendments. \nThe letter makes it clear that the governors believe that the \namendments would require re-ratification by the states and would \nundoubtedly lead to costly and time-consuming litigation. But their \nletter raises what I think is the most important question: what is our \nrole in ratifying this Compact? Congress has passed nine other compacts \nwithout any amendments. In fact, we passed them by unanimous consent. \nSo why is this Compact so different? Contrary to Senator Wellstone's \nstatement, the Compact makes no mention of a site. Nowhere in this \nlegislation will you find a mention of Sierra Blanca, Texas. The people \nof Texas will make a decision for themselves. The Compact will not.\n  We are not here to select the site for them. We are not here to write \nthe Compact agreement for them. We are not here to decide how much \nwaste should be deposited at the facility or where that waste should \ncome from. The states have already made those decisions for themselves. \nAs the governors pointed out, the Wellstone amendments would have been \nan ``infringement on state sovereignty.'' It\n\n[[Page S9815]]\n\nwould have been the first time Congress amended an original contract \nnegotiated by the states. Inclusion of these amendments in the Compact \nwould deny the states the right Congress gave them to make their own \nchoices as to how to handle disposal of low-level nuclear waste.\n  The amendments offered to the Compact by Senator Wellstone were \ninappropriate. I can understand Senator Wellstone's concern that too \nmany sources of pollution and waste facilities are targeted to minority \nand low-income areas, but one of his amendments would have created new \nopportunities for litigation that go far beyond the ``environmental \njustice'' guidance recently proposed by the Environmental Protection \nAgency. The amendment would also apply federal environmental justice \nstandards to states for the first time. Congress should address the \nissue of environmental justice. But we should take the time to do it \nright, not through amendments to an agreement between three states that \nare following the lead of nine other similar agreements.\n  The second amendment attached by Senator Wellstone also expands the \nrole of Congress in approving these compacts. This Compact is the \nresult of years of negotiation among the three states and approved by \nthe legislatures of those states. Senator Wellstone argues that his \namendment would give Texas protection from having to accept waste from \nstates other than Maine and Vermont. However, the Compact already gives \nTexas the majority vote in deciding if and from whom additional waste \nmay come. This amendment is unnecessary and would only lead to further \ndelay of the Compact since it will likely require re-ratification by \nthe member states. In fact, under the Wellstone amendment, Texas may be \nmore open to accepting waste from other states because it would not \nhave the protection of the exclusionary provisions of the Compact.\n  The States of Texas, Maine and Vermont have done their job. They have \nnegotiated a compact among them to provide for the responsible disposal \nof low-level radioactive waste and submitted it to this body as \nrequired under Federal statute, for the consent of the Congress. Now, \nwe need to do our job. Those Senators who support the basic premise \nthat we agreed to in 1980, that states should have the responsibility \nto dispose of their waste, should vote for this bill. It is the \nresponsibility of Congress to follow through on the direction we gave \nto states in 1980 and ratify this Compact.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to yield 4 \nminutes to my colleague from the State of Texas, Senator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMaine.\n  Mr. President, I think it should be noted that all six Senators from \nthree affected States are supportive of this legislation.\n  I want to begin my remarks with the most important thing I can \npossibly say, and that is, I would never support a hazardous waste site \nin my State that wasn't in full compliance with Federal and Texas \nenvironmental laws and regulations. This is the most important of all \nof the things that I could possibly say.\n  This compact came about because of Federal legislation--the Low-Level \nRadioactive Waste Policy Act and its 1985 amendments. They allowed \nStates to come together, and encouraged States to come together, to \nfind waste disposal facilities that would meet the needs of our \ncountry.\n  In fact, all of us would love not to have any waste that would be put \nanywhere. But if we didn't have waste, we wouldn't have medical \nremedies, we wouldn't have the cures for people's diseases. That is \nwhat this waste is. It is not nuclear waste. It not high-level \nhazardous waste. It is low-level medical waste.\n  The law has created 41 States that have formed 9 low-level \nradioactive waste compacts. Minnesota is a member of one such compact \nratified by Congress in 1985. Nine compacts have been formed. And the \ncompact that Texas, Maine, and Vermont have created is no different \nfrom these, and it seeks to provide the citizens of our three States \nthe same protections enjoyed by the State of Minnesota and the other 40 \nStates that have formed compacts.\n  I think it is very important that we address the issue of how this \ncame about.\n  A compact agreement was negotiated by former Governor Ann Richards \nwith the Governors of Maine and Vermont. The compact was overwhelmingly \napproved by the Texas State Legislature and signed by Governor Richards \nin 1993. That compact now enjoys the support of our current Governor, \nGeorge Bush, and our Lieutenant Governor, Bob Bullock.\n  Maine's compact was passed by their legislature and signed in 1993. \nIt also passed a State-wide referendum. In Vermont, legislation was \npassed by the legislature and signed by the Governor in 1994. I don't \nthink the Federal Government has a mandate to nullify a contract among \nthree State Governors and ratified by their legislatures.\n  I think it is also important that we address the local issue that has \nbeen addressed by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  We have not yet--the three States together, nor the State of Texas--\ndecided on a place for this radioactive waste. However, there is \ncareful consideration being given to Hudspeth County, which is the \nfocus of where they are looking for the site of this low-level waste \ncompact as a place where they are going to put the waste.\n  Hudspeth County is the third largest county in Texas, with 4,566 \nsquare miles. It has a population of 3,200 people.\n  I want my colleagues to know that the vast majority of the county's \nleadership support locating this facility in Hudspeth County as long as \nit is done in an environmentally safe way, which the Governor has \npromised will happen or it will not be created.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Texas have 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has only 1 additional \nminute remaining.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I was informed earlier that I had 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute and the Senator from \nMinnesota to have an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I certainly will not object. My \nunderstanding is that the Senator from Texas needed additional time.\n  If additional time is added on your side and then added to my side as \nwell, that will be fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. There is one other addition I would like to have, and \nthat is that the Senator from Minnesota have an additional 1 minute as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what is \nthe agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think this side would have 4 additional \nminutes remaining, of which the Senator from Texas would use 1, and you \nwould have 3 additional minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So the additional minutes added to the side in favor \nof this would be the same as the amount of time added to the \nopposition. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There would be 2 additional minutes remaining, \nand you would be getting 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will say what would be fair would be 2 additional \nminutes on each side.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I agree with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S9816]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  It is very important that the people of our country know that the \npeople of Hudspeth County want this low-level waste authority. They in \nfact had an election this past May in the primaries. The county \nelections were held. And every opponent of the Low-Level Radioactive \nWaste Compact who sought office in Hudspeth County lost.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of \nsupport from the Hudspeth County judge, James Peace, and 300 community \nleaders in the county in support of the compact; and, furthermore, \nletters from the National Governors' Association, the Western \nGovernors' Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission of the United States, the M.D. \nAnderson Cancer Center in Houston, the University of Texas System, the \nTexas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso, and the \nUniversity of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.\n  There being no obligation, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 1998.\n       Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the National \n     Governors' Association, we urge you to adopt S. 270 without \n     amendment. This bill provides congressional consent to the \n     Texas-Maine-Vermont Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact. The \n     National Governor's Association (NGA) policy in support of \n     this compact is attached. We are convinced that this \n     voluntary compact provides for the safe and responsible \n     disposal of low-level waste produced in the three member \n     states.\n       As you know, under the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy \n     Act (LLRWPA) of 1980, Congress mandated that states assume \n     responsibility for disposal of low level radioactive waste, \n     and created a compact system that provided states with the \n     legal authority to restrict, dispose of, and manage waste. \n     Since 1995, forty-one states have entered into nine \n     congressional approved compacts without amendments or \n     objections. The Texas-Maine-Vermont Compact deserves to be \n     the tenth.\n       Your support for this bipartisan measure, which has the \n     full support and cooperation of the Governors and \n     legislatures of the three participant states, will be \n     crucial.\n       If you have any questions concerning this matter, please \n     don't hesitate to contact Tom Curtis of the NGA staff at \n     (202) 624-5389.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gov. George V. Voinovich,\n       Chairman.\n     Gov. Tom Carper,\n       Vice Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Western Governors' Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: The Western Governors' Association urges you \n     and your fellow Senators to pass S. 270, without amendment. \n     This legislation would ratify the Texas-Maine-Vermont Low \n     Level Radioactive Waste Compact. Congress envisioned this \n     type of compact when it passed the Low Level Radioactive \n     Waste Policy Act (LLRWA) of 1980. This Compact is a voluntary \n     group of states which joined together to identify and operate \n     a site for the disposal of low level radioactive waste. The \n     site and management program is fully supported by the \n     Governor of Texas, the host state.\n       As you know, Congress requires the states to take \n     responsibility for the proper disposal of the low level \n     radioactive waste generated within their borders, and created \n     the compact system to allow states to join together to meet \n     this mandate. The Western Governors support such compacts \n     particularly when the states join voluntarily and when the \n     host governor supports the location and operation of the \n     disposal site.\n       Your vote for adoption of S. 270, without amendment, is \n     critical to its ratification. This will allow the three \n     states to move towards complying with the LLRWA.\n       If you have questions please contact me or Rich Bechtel, \n     Director of the WGA Washington Office.\n           Sincerely,\n     James M. Souby.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1998.\n     Re S. 270, the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal \n         Compact Consent Act NCSL urges you to support this bill \n         without amendment.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The National Conference of State \n     Legislatures (NCSL) urges you to support S. 270, the Texas \n     Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Consent Act, \n     which will allow the states of Maine, Texas, and Vermont to \n     continue to work together to develop a facility in Hudspeth \n     County, Texas for the disposal of the low-level radioactive \n     waste produced in those three states. NCSL has consistently \n     reiterated its firm belief that states must be allowed to \n     exercise their authority over the storage and disposal of \n     low-level radioactive waste, authority that was granted to \n     them by Congress in the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy \n     Act of 1980 and the Low-Level Waste Policy Act Amendments of \n     1985.\n       NCSL is concerned about H.R. 629, the version of the Texas \n     Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Consent Act \n     which passed through the House of Representatives last \n     October. H.R. 629 was amended with language that was not in \n     the compact as approved by the Maine, Texas and Vermont state \n     legislatures. No low-level radioactive waste compact between \n     states has ever been amended by Congress. We believe that the \n     amendments to H.R. 629 would establish an unfortunate \n     precedent for Congressional tinkering with agreements that \n     have already been passed by their relevant state \n     legislatures.\n       The states of Maine, Texas, and Vermont have already \n     expended significant time and resources in order to negotiate \n     an agreement on the Hudspeth County facility. It would be \n     inappropriate for Congress to attempt to alter a valid effort \n     by the Compact states to meet their responsibilities under \n     the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. We urge you to \n     support S. 270 without amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Craig Peterson,\n       Utah State Senate, Chair, NCSL Environment Committee.\n     Carol S.

Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: In response to the request from your \n     staff, here are the views of the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission (NRC) on two proposed amendments to S. 270, a bill \n     to provide the consent of Congress to the Texas Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste (LLW) Disposal Compact. The proposed \n     amendments would add two new conditions to the conditions of \n     consent to the compact: (1) that no LLW may be brought into \n     Texas for disposal at a compact facility from any State other \n     than Maine or Vermont (referred to below as the ``exclusion'' \n     amendment); and (2) that ``the compact not be implemented . . \n     . in any way that discriminates against any community \n     (through disparate treatment or disparate impact) by reason \n     of the composition of the community in terms of race, color, \n     national origin, or income level'' (referred to below as the \n     ``discrimination clause''). These amendments raise some \n     significant questions of concern to the NRC.\n       First, no other Congressional compact ratification \n     legislation has included such conditions to Congress' \n     consent. Making the Congressional consent for this compact \n     different from that for other compacts would create an \n     asymmetrical system and could lead to conflicts among \n     regions. In the past, Congress has set a high priority on \n     establishing a consistent set of rules under which the \n     interstate compact system for LLW disposal would operate.\n       With respect to the exclusion condition, while the Low-\n     Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 and the Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 authorize \n     compact States to exclude LLW from outside their compact \n     region, the terms of doing so are left to the States. This is \n     consistent with the intent of these statutes to make LLW \n     disposal the responsibility of the States and to leave the \n     implementation of that responsibility largely to the States' \n     discretion. Thus, the addition of the exclusion condition to \n     the compact would deprive the party States of the ability to \n     make their own choices as to how to handle this important \n     area. In addition, restriction on importation of LLW into \n     Texas to waste coming from Maine or Vermont could prevent \n     other compacts (or non-compact States) from contracting with \n     the Texas compact for disposal of their waste (such as has \n     occurred between the Rocky Mountain and Northwest compacts). \n     This type of arrangement with existing LLW disposal \n     facilities may well become a preferred economical method of \n     LLW disposal. It is also important to note that the exclusion \n     condition may hamper NRC emergency access to the Texas \n     facility pursuant to section 8 of the Low-Level Radioactive \n     Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985.\n       With respect to the discrimination clause, the Commission \n     supports the general objectives of efforts to address \n     discrimination involving ``race, color, national origin, or \n     income level.'' However, it is unclear how a condition \n     containing broad language of the type contained in the \n     proposed amendment would be applied in a specific case \n     involving a compact. This lack of clarity is likely to create \n     confusion and uncertainty for all parties involved, and could \n     lead to costly, time-consuming litigation. Including such a \n     provision in binding legislation may have broad significance \n     for the affected States and other parties and would appear to \n     warrant extensive Congressional review of its implications.\n       In light of the above, the NRC opposes the approval of \n     amendments to S. 270 that would\n\n[[Page S9817]]\n\n     incorporate the exclusion condition or an undefined \n     discrimination clause into the Texas compact bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Shirley Ann Jackson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Hudspeth County Judge,\n\n                               Sierra Blanca, TX, August 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: It is my understanding that the \n     United States Senate will be considering the Texas/Maine/\n     Vermont Compact soon. I want to thank you for supporting this \n     important measure. Its passage will bring needed revenue and \n     opportunity to our area. Sierra Blanca has already benefited \n     greatly from the presence of the Texas Low-Level Radioactive \n     Waste Disposal Authority in the area. The benefits (jobs and \n     infrastructure improvement) will increase during construction \n     and operation of the low-level radioactive waste disposal \n     facility. The truth is the socioeconomic benefits for the \n     residents of Sierra Blanca are enormous and overwhelmingly \n     positive. Continued economic benefits are absolutely critical \n     to the future development of Hudspeth County.\n       I want you to know that the majority of citizens favor the \n     development of such a facility. I have enclosed an \n     advertisement that recently ran in the Austin American \n     Statesman, paid for by donations and community funds. The \n     people of Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County voiced their \n     support for a better future and tangible real life advances \n     that will make our communities more livable. The \n     advertisement reflects the widespread support in our area for \n     this project; the support runs across the business community \n     to elected officials. During the recent primary elections, \n     this issue was openly debated in the County Judge, \n     Commissioners Court, and County Democratic Chairmanship \n     races; those who supported the project won, while those who \n     opposed it lost.\n       Thank you for your continued support. If you have further \n     questions or if I can help you in any other way, please feel \n     free to call.\n           Sincerely,\n     James A.

It offers \n     hope for a better future and tangible, real life advances \n     that will make Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County more \n     livable. The overwhelming majority of residents support this \n     project near our town for the following reasons:\n\n     A halt to exporting our children to other areas for \n         employment\n     A larger job market for all the residents of Sierra Blanca \n         and Hudspeth County\n     The ripple effect seen from additional businesses and \n         services to support the facility\n     Improved medical care\n     Increased property values\n     A broader tax base\n     Enhanced infrastructure\n     Disposal fees paid to the County\n     Upward mobility and an improved standard of living\n     A better perception of our community by ourselves and others\n\n       Until the proposed project, the only method of upward \n     mobility and economic development for the residents of Sierra \n     Blanca was a bus ticket out of town. There was little hope \n     for economic progress. Sierra Blanca was destined to be a \n     small, remote, dying community.\n       The critics--almost all of whom live outside the \n     community--say the proposed site is not a reasonable road to \n     economic development for Sierra Blanca. We say that these \n     people do not speak for us and that this is the only road in \n     sight.\n       After four years of intensive review, TNRCC issued a \n     favorable Environmental Assessment. We are totally satisfied \n     that the project will be safe and the residents of Sierra \n     Blanca want it to be licensed. It is a sign of hope and a \n     brighter future.\n       The only negative socio-economic impact would be the denial \n     of the license and the decision to site the facility \n     elsewhere.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The University of Texas\n\n\n                                    MD Anderson Cancer Center,\n\n                                   Houston, TX, February 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Henry Bonilla,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Bonilla: Early this session, Congress \n     will have the opportunity to ratify the Texas Compact, an \n     interstate compact entered into by Texas, Maine and Vermont \n     for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste at a joint \n     facility. As President of The University of Texas M.D. \n     Anderson Cancer Center at Houston, I write to tell you of the \n     great importance of this legislation to M.D. Anderson Cancer \n     Center.\n       Along with five other health related components of The \n     University of Texas System, M.D. Anderson engages in \n     important research and medical activities which require the \n     use of radioactive materials. Such materials are an essential \n     part of biomedical research into illness like cancer, AIDS, \n     and Alzheimer's disease. Radioactive matter is used \n     extensively in the development of new drugs and is critical \n     to the process of diagnosing and treating patients. For \n     example, radioactive tracer elements are used to detect \n     coronary artery disease and lung and bone scans help locate \n     blood clots or cancerous cells. Radiation therapy is also \n     effective in controlling the spread of many types of cancer.\n       The low-level radioactive waste generated by research and \n     detection and treatment of illnesses must be disposed of in a \n     responsible, permanent manner. Ratification of the compact \n     between Texas, Maine and Vermont will provide Texas with $25 \n     million, sent by the other two states, to help defray the \n     costs involved with developing a safe facility. This \n     legislation which will be sponsored by Congressman Jack \n     Fields and several co-sponsors from the Texas delegation, \n     finalizes years of negotiations between the states and \n     safeguards Texas against having to accept out-of-compact \n     waste in the future.\n       Again, I urge your support of the Texas Compact and your \n     consideration to join Congressman Fields as a co-sponsor. \n     Congress gave the states a mandate to manage their low-level \n     radioactive waste. With your vote for ratification, Texas can \n     move forward toward that goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Charles A.

Texas needs this radioactive waste disposal site. We \n     have 2,217 users of radioisotopes in Texas. We know of 684 \n     sites that produce radioactive waste that must be disposed of \n     properly in order to safeguard the health of all Texans.\n       Medical diagnosis and treatment with radioisotopes is a \n     significant factor at hospitals and cancer treatment centers. \n     Radioisotopes are used at many Texas Universities and \n     teaching institutions. There has to be a site for disposal of \n     their wastes. We can not simply store this material on site \n     at 684 different places.\n       We have to look to the total disposal of radioactive waste \n     in Texas and do the best possible job so that future \n     generations are not affected by sloppy disposal and \n     contamination of ground water or food chains. The Eagle Flat \n     site at Sierra Blanca meets those needs.\n       We need your support in approving HR 558 which is the \n     compact between Texas, Maine, and Vermont. Congress has \n     approved 9 compacts which includes 41 states. Please vote for \n     approval of the 10th compact so that Texas can move forward \n     on proper disposal of radioactive wastes with input and \n     monies from Maine and Vermont.\n       The site selected in Hudspeth County is being reviewed by \n     the Texas Department of Natural Resources. Approval by that \n     state agency will enable Texas to properly dispose of its \n     radioactive waste. The state approval process continues to \n     move forward at this time. Public hearings at the state level \n     are scheduled for Spring 96.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles H. Williams,\n     Chairman, Institutional Review Board.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    The University of Texas Health\n\n\n                                Science Center at San Antonio,\n\n                                San Antonio, TX, December 5, 1995.\n     Re passage of H.R. 558/low-level radioactive waste compact.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith,\n     U.S. Representative, District 21,\n     San Antonio, TX.\n       Dear Congressman Smith: It is my understanding that the \n     House of Representative may once again vote on a low-level \n     radioactive waste (LLW) compact among Texas, Maine, and \n     Vermont. As you evaluate this issue, I thought you might be \n     interested in the importance of such compacts to The \n     University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.\n       As you know, UTHSCSA engages in important research, medical \n     treatment, and diagnosis using radioactive materials. These \n     activities could be curtailed, or even possibly eliminated, \n     if long-term, reliable LLW disposal is not available. Much, \n     if not all, of our research depends on radioisotopes used as \n     ``tracers.'' These isotopes allow researchers to identify \n     cells being studied without using dyes or chemicals which \n     would interfere with the experiment. Virtually all aspects of \n     contemporary biomedical research depends on the use of these \n     radioisotopes.\n       Currently, at UTHSCSA, the following research is underway \n     using low-level radioactive materials: (1) Cancer research on \n     causes and treatment of different types of cancer; (2) \n     Exploration and mapping of human genomes; (3) Studies on the \n     effects of aging; (4) Diabetes in the Hispanic population; \n     (5) Bone loss, density, growth, and osteoporosis; (6) Genes \n     that suppress tumors; (7) Pathogenicity of various infectious \n     agents; and (8) Studies of neuroendocrinology and pineal \n     physiology.\n       According to figures from the Texas Low-level Radioactive \n     Waste Disposal Authority, approximately 23% of the LLW sent \n     to the proposed Texas disposal facility will be generated by \n     medical research and health facilities, including the fifteen \n     academic and health institutions of The University of\n\n[[Page S9818]]\n\n     Texas System. The University of Texas System and the UTHSCSA \n     rely on Congress to support the State's efforts to provide \n     generators of LLW a safe, secure, and permanent LLW disposal \n     facility.\n       Thank you for your further consideration of this issue, \n     which is of great concern to this University and its \n     important research and health care goals. We appreciate your \n     interests and support.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 John P. Howe III,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the issue before us today is whether \nthe citizens of Texas, Maine, and Vermont will enjoy the same \nprotections as 41 other States to ensure safe and environmentally sound \ndisposal of dangerous radioactive material.\n  The local support is there. The Governor has assured us that there \nwill not be a site selected until all of the scientific data shows that \nthis is where it should go, and we are doing exactly what Congress \ndirected us to do in creating safe places for this low-level \nradioactive waste.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this, as all of the six Senators \nwho have a direct interest in this are doing.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Maine. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Chair notify me when I have 1 \nminute left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that the site has been \nselected. The only remaining question is final licensing. The site in \nHudspeth County, Sierra Blanca, is disproportionately Hispanic and \ndisproportionately poor. That is what this debate is all about. This is \nan injustice. If you vote for this compact, you will be ratifying this \ninjustice. If you vote against this compact, then this will not happen.\n  That is why LULAC, that is why the League of Conservation Voters, \nthat is why the Sierra Club, that is why the religious community, that \nis why 100 different organizations from around the country, that is why \npeople came here, as difficult as it was, all the way from Hudspeth \nCounty to say please don't do this.\n  We had two amendments that would have made this fair.\n  Please, colleagues, listen to this. One amendment that you voted for \nsaid that if the people in Hudspeth County can prove that this is \ndiscriminatory, they should have a right to do so in court. The other \namendment says let's make it clear that the waste can only come from \nMaine, Vermont, and Texas. Twice the Senate went on record with \nunanimous votes supporting both those amendments, and in the conference \ncommittee those amendments were knocked out. The utility industry \nwanted them knocked out. They don't want the people to have any kind of \nremedy for discrimination. There is no assurance that the waste will \ncome just from Maine, Vermont, and Texas. They want this to be a \nnational repository site.\n  That is why we should vote against this compact--the first compact \never with a clear site for building a compact nuclear waste dump. This \nis an environmental injustice.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, let me make a final comment. I think we \nhave had very extensive debate.\n  I believe that the facts have been emphasized and clarified with \nrespect to this issue. The fact of the matter is, this compact adheres \nto all of the standards that have been applied to previous compacts \nratified by the Congress, nine such instances as mandated by the U.S. \nCongress. The fact is, 82 Senators in this body represent States that \nhave compacts, but the Senator from Minnesota is saying that somehow \nthe States of Texas and Vermont and Maine should be discriminated \nagainst, that they should not be allowed to enter into a compact to \nsafely dispose of low-level radioactive waste--waste, yes, that is \ngenerated by universities, by medical centers, by defense facilities, \nby power plants.\n\n  The Senator from Minnesota is saying that somehow we should be \ntreated differently from his own State of Minnesota and all of the \nother 40 States that are included in these compacts. The State of Texas \nhas procedures, has a public process, has a political process to \ndetermine where the site should be located. The Senator from Minnesota \nis somehow suggesting that the State of Texas does not have the trust \nand the confidence of the people that it serves to make a judgment in \nadherence to their State environmental and public and health and safety \nlaws as well as the Federal Government, all of which, I might add, have \nto be adhered to, all of which have been outlined in this process \nthroughout. This has not been something that somehow has materialized \nout of thin air, overriding and breaching all of the environmental and \nsafety laws in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. So I would urge my colleagues to adopt this conference \nreport that allows the States of Texas and Vermont and Maine to do what \n41 other States, including the State of Minnesota, have been able to do \nin the past.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Colleagues, you have never voted for a compact with a \nspecific site for building a compact dump, not with a site in Sierra \nBlanca, not with a site disproportionately Hispanic and poor.\n  This is an environmental vote. This is a geologically active area. \nThe science says no, but it is the path of least political resistance. \nThis community is targeted. We will now vote. If you vote for this \ncompact, you vote for an injustice. Do the right thing and vote against \nthis compact.\n  Twice you have gone on record, colleagues, by unanimous vote: yes, \nfor the compact as long as people have a right to challenge this and \nhave a chance to prove discrimination. Yes, we vote for the compact if \nwe make it clear that this won't become a national repository site and \nthe waste can only come from Maine and Vermont and Texas. And both of \nthose amendments, in the dark of night, were stripped by the conference \ncommittee.\n  That is why so many religious and civil rights organizations have \nsaid vote against this. LULAC, the League of Conservation Voters, the \nSierra Club, the Catholic diocese, the Methodist Church, so on and so \nforth. This is a justice vote. We have to vote on this, and once and \nfor all it is important for us to be on the side of justice and vote no \non this compact.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Does my colleague have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Her time has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I then will yield the remainder of my time, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nCoverdell), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), and the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), \nthe Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. \nInouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 78, nays 15, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9819]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 255 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--78\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--15\n\n     Akaka\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Bingaman\n     Coverdell\n     Domenici\n     Glenn\n     Helms\n     Inouye\n     Murkowski\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think that we want to finish this \nforeign operations appropriations legislation, and I hope that we can \ndo it. I hope we can do it sometime soon. I note there are a number of \namendments that are left to be considered on this important piece of \nlegislation. I commend our ranking member and the chairman for their \nefforts in resolving this important piece of legislation in a timely \nway. There are a number of other amendments that must be considered \nbefore we can come to closure.\n  The question then comes as to what we take up next. Yesterday, we \ndiscussed on the Senate floor how important it is that one of the bills \nthat we take up next be the Patients' Bill of Rights, managed care \nreform. The other piece of legislation, Mr. President, that ought to be \ntaken up immediately is legislation that was already passed in the \nHouse, the Shays-Meehan bill, H.R. 2183, the campaign finance reform \nbill.\n  Mr. President, the House deliberated on that bill for some time. \nHouse Members worked their will. They did a good job in dealing with \nall of the controversial aspects of campaign reform this year. They \nrecognize, as many of us recognize, that we are not going to solve the \nproblem with one piece of legislation. But they made a major \ncontribution to solving the problems we face with regard to soft money \nand independent expenditures and reporting and enforcement.\n  Whether or not we move this issue forward will be determined by \nwhether or not we are willing to act in the course of the next 6 weeks. \nTime is running out. I applaud Senators McCain and Feingold for their \nnews conference this week wherein they said they will press for this \nlegislation, they will offer their bill as an amendment to another bill \nat some point in the future.\n  Mr. President, whether it is the McCain-Feingold bill or the Shays-\nMeehan bill, this Senate must not lose the opportunity to complete its \nwork on campaign finance reform this year. We must have the opportunity \nto address the issue. We must take up that legislation.\n  I will be propounding a unanimous consent request at some point this \nmorning--in just a few moments--to ask that campaign finance reform be \nthe next order of business, to ask, again as we did yesterday, that it \nbe laid aside for other important appropriations bills simply because \nwe recognize the urgency of passing appropriations legislation on time. \nWe are way past due. We have not passed a budget. We have not passed \nany of the appropriations bills. Not one has been signed into law.\n  Mr. President, to the extent we can do all that we can to resolve the \nremaining procedural and other related problems on appropriations, we \nmust do so. But there is no question that, as we look to what must be \ncompleted prior to the end of this year, the two issues that have to be \naddressed are the campaign finance reform bill and the Patients' Bill \nof Rights that we discussed yesterday.\n  We come to the floor this morning simply to focus attention on the \nneed for expeditious consideration of this legislation, on how critical \nit is that we, as Republicans and Democrats, agree, as did Members in \nthe House, to make it the kind of priority it deserves to be, to \naddress the array of problems that we have.\n  I cannot think of a more diverse philosophical body than the House \ntoday. We have the far left and we have the far right. We have the \nextremes on both sides. With all of the extreme positions that Members \nare capable of taking, they came together and passed the Shays-Meehan \nbill just before we left.\n  Mr. President, now it is our turn. Now we have an opportunity to do \nthe same thing. Now we can pass the legislation here. We had a debate \nearlier. We were disappointed that we were not able to come to closure \non it. But now is the time. The House has acted. So must we.\n  So far this cycle Republicans and Democrats have spent $37 million \nmore than the last cycle--$37 million. Campaigns continue to escalate \nin cost and degrade in quality. More and more, there is a rush for \ndollars. More and more questions are asked about how money is raised. \nMore and more, the people are turned off and tuned out by a political \nprocess that has gone awry. They ask that we react. They ask that we \nshow some leadership. They ask that we take some steps to correct this \nsituation before it gets even worse. The House heard; and the House \nreacted. The Senate now must do the same.\n  There is no better time to do it than now. We all are cognizant of \nthe fact that there are only 60 days left before the next election. \nWithin those 60 days, there will be even more money raised, tens of \nmillions of dollars raised, across this country. As we speak, I \nguarantee you, there are Senators and House Members and candidates in \nsmall rooms everywhere dialing for dollars--incessant dollar dialing \nthat has reached an unprecedented threshold. And the implications of \nall that money become more serious, the implications for the \nlegislative process, the implications for campaigns themselves, the \nimplications for the democracy that we all treasure.\n\n  Mr. President, there has to be an end at some point. We have to \ncurtail this incessant effort to raise more and more money at the cost \nof the credibility of the American people as they view our campaigns in \n1998.\n  Not all of us are on the floor right now, but if we were, I say with \nunanimity our Democratic caucus wishes to express the hope that we can \npass the Shays-Meehan bill this week, next week, or certainly at some \npoint before we leave. If we pass the Shays-Meehan bill as it passed in \nthe House, which I am prepared to do, I will accept it. I will take the \nlanguage that was passed in the House and I will send it off to the \nPresident. He has already indicated he will sign it. We don't have to \ngo to conference. There is nothing we have to do that would complicate \nour actions once it passes in the Senate.\n  So let's do it. Let's agree, as Republicans and Democrats, that it is \nimportant to do it now. The time is running out. I urge my colleagues--\nurge my colleagues--to agree.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of \nthe foreign operations appropriations bill, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 2183, the House-passed campaign finance reform \nbill, that only relevant amendments be in order, that it be the regular \norder, but that the majority leader may lay the bill aside for any \nappropriations bills and appropriations conference reports.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S9820]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am not surprised, but I am \ndisappointed.\n  We will continue to persist. We will continue to make the effort each \nday, either in the form of unanimous consent requests like this, or \nwith amendments offered to bills that will be considered. We will not \nlet this issue pass. It is essential that we consider this legislation \nbefore it is too late, before we run out of time, before we miss a \ngolden opportunity to seize the moment and do what the Senate should \nhave done earlier this year, should have done last year, should have \ndone 10 years ago. This will not go away. We can do it either the easy \nway or the hard way, but we will continue to persist.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the minority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before coming back, I was at the \nMinnesota State Fair, which is quite a focus group--almost half the \nState's population comes there in 13 days. Without going through my \nconversations with people in Minnesota, I want to ask you whether or \nnot back home in South Dakota or as you travel around the country, what \nkind of discussions do citizens have with you about the mix of money \nand politics and reform?\n  Does the minority leader think that this is, in fact, a burning issue \nto people? We have been told for so long that people don't really care \nabout campaign finance reform. What is the minority leader hearing from \npeople in South Dakota? What is he hearing from citizens in our \ncountry? Why does he, as the leader of our party, put this at the very \ntop of his priorities?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Minnesota raises an important point.\n  As I talked to South Dakotans all over the state this last month of \nAugust, I found it remarkable how many people simply said they don't \nwant to have anything to do with the political process anymore. I had \nmany, many Republicans who said they are just sick and tired of what is \nhappening out there. Most of it, they said, relates to the money--the \nmoney chase, the implications of more money, the influence of big money \non the legislative process. They are tired of it.\n  I think without question they all understand that the rules, the \nlaws, need to be changed.\n  It was remarkable to hear the consistency with which people expressed \nthat point of view to me--Republicans, independents, and Democrats; \nthey all said it. They all indicated with increasing intensity that \nunless we change the system we could lose it, that unless we change the \nrules we will become victims of the current ones.\n  That, to me, is the essence of why this is so essential, why it is \nimportant that we act now.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Wisconsin for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, before I ask a question, let me thank \nthe minority leader for his tremendous leadership on this issue and for \nmaintaining the support of the entire Democratic caucus for reform--\nwhether it be the McCain-Feingold bill or the Shays-Meehan bill, which \nis very similar.\n  One of the criticisms made of this bill consistently, which I \nobviously have never found very valid, is that it is a partisan bill. \nThe fact is that seven Republicans have supported this bill out here on \nthe floor, and the number in the House was overwhelming.\n  I wonder if the minority leader is aware that a quarter of all the \nmembers of the Republican Party in the House supported this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I was aware of that, and I think the Senator from \nWisconsin raises a very important point. I actually believe that there \nare at least 25 percent of the Republican caucus in the Senate who \nsupport campaign reform. I just wish they would express themselves, as \nI know the House already has, in that regard.\n  As I talk to colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they tell me \nthey are supportive of it. They tell me they understand we need to see \nsome change. I just hope that some additional courageous Republican \nSenators will step forth and join us. All we need are 60 votes; we \nalready have 45 Democratic Senators. As the Senator from Wisconsin \nknows, we already have several Republican Senators who have expressed \nsupport and are willing to continue to support our effort. So a dozen \nor so additional Republican Senators would put us over the top.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is precisely the reason the senior \nSenator from Arizona and I announced yesterday that we will be forcing \nthe issue if your proposal is not agreed to, to bring this up, because \nwe do believe that there will be Members on the other side of the aisle \nhere who will support us. In fact, we are down, now, to only eight \npeople.\n  The fact is that originally people said, ``You only have several \ncosponsors. You only have two Republicans. It will never get through \nthe House.'' That is just a series of what I regard as excuses.\n  Mr. President, now it is very simple. The President has said he is \nready to sign the bill. A majority of this body has indicated on the \nrecord they are for the bill and a majority of the other House is \ndramatically in favor of the bill.\n  I just wonder if the leader would comment for a minute on the \nsignificance if we don't get this done this year. Unfortunately, we \ncan't pass a bill that will affect this election, the one that will \nhappen in 60-some days. That was an agreement we had. We worked hard \nand we would have loved to avoid the abuses that are going on right now \nas we speak. But there is another election coming up in the year 2000.\n  I wonder if the leader would talk for a minute about what it means if \nwe don't get the job done now.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Wisconsin probably knows better than \nanybody in this Chamber the implications of doing nothing. No one has \nworked harder, provided greater leadership, and engendered more respect \non both sides of the aisle than the Senator from Wisconsin. He is \nrunning, as am I, this year. He knows the race for dollars. He \nunderstands the implications of that race. He understands, as well, the \naverage cost of a Senate race right now is over $4 million. He knows, \nas I do, that we have already surpassed last year's record-breaking \nlevels, last cycle's record-breaking levels in the amount of money \nrequired to be successful.\n  He knows, as I do, we will be seeing double-digit figures when it \ncomes to what it will take to wage a successful Senate race anywhere in \nthe country. He knows the implications of that. I must say, Mr. \nPresident, you don't need any imagination to recognize just what a \ndevastating effect that has.\n  I was at two fundraising breakfasts this morning, neither for myself. \nThat is exactly what is happening all over this city and across this \ncountry--fundraiser after fundraiser, more and more money generated \nwith implications on the legislative and political process.\n  Where does it end? How will we possibly recruit candidates in the \nfuture when we tell them: We want you to be a part of the Democratic \nprocess, but we want you to cough up $10 million to do so if you are \ngoing to be in the U.S. Senate?\n  How can we do that? How can we recruit with a straight face--except \nfor those who have the resources and the wherewithal? How many more \nmillionaires should we have in a representative body of 100 people? We \nhave some very good and diligent and hard-working people of wealth in \nthis country, and I am glad they are here. But I want to make sure that \nworking families are also represented, that we elect people who \nunderstand what it takes to earn a paycheck and make ends meet, to send \na child to college. I want those people in the Senate as well. How do \nyou do it when you have to raise $10 million? Who do you turn to? So \nthe Senator from Wisconsin very appropriately raises the question, \n``What are the implications?'' There are many, many more. We can talk \nall day long about the implications. Those are just a few.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his statements \nand for his leadership on this issue. I was enthusiastic about coming \nback to work on this issue again after I have had conversations with \npeople like the Senator from Michigan. I was very enthusiastic when I \nhad a chance to meet with the senior Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S9821]]\n\n We decided definitely yesterday to move, and move soon, on this issue. \nI am even more excited and enthusiastic that we can finish the job. The \nexcuses are over. The whole thing is down to eight Senators. It is time \nto do the job. I thank the leader very much.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for his comments. I appreciate the \ncontribution he has made. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts for a question, if he has one.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the leader. I will ask the leader, first of all, a \nseries of questions. My first question is, I assume the leader has \nreached out to the majority leader of the Senate and suggested to him \nthat there is a way in which the U.S. Senate could take an appropriate \namount of time to properly deal with this effort. I wonder if the \nleader will share with the Senate and with the country what the \nresponse is of the Republican side of the aisle with respect to the \nability of the Senate to carry out its responsibilities here.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts raises the question, \n``What is the response?'' We got it a few minutes ago. We asked very \nreasonably that we take up this bill next--that we finish the foreign \nops appropriations bill, which is critical. We have to get these \nappropriations bills done.\n  As I have noted, not one of the 13 appropriations bills has been \nsigned into law. Here it is now September. The next fiscal year is less \nthan 4 weeks away, and we have yet to pass one appropriations bill. So \nwe recognize that we have to get our work done in that regard, but we \nalso recognize that there will be gaps, that there are other needs out \nthere, legislatively, and there can be no greater needs than the \nrequest we made yesterday about a Patients' Bill of Rights \nconsideration and the request we make today on campaign finance reform. \nWhy? Because the House has already acted on both bills.\n  So the response we got today, as I noted, was disappointing because \nwe are trying to be reasonable. We are suggesting that only relevant \namendments be offered. We are suggesting that we lay the bill aside to \nfinish our work on appropriations bills. We would be prepared to \nsuggest other options. In fact, I would even go so far--and I haven't \ntalked to my colleagues about this, so I am premature in making this \noffer, but just for the record I would be willing to accept a vote, up \nor down, on the Shays-Meehan bill--no questions asked; no amendments. \nLet's just have a vote, up or down, on Shays-Meehan and send it to the \nPresident if it passes. I would be prepared to do even that. Many \ncolleagues might want to go farther than that.\n  How much time does it take to have one vote? How much time does it \ntake to consider something that has already passed in the House, such \nas the Shays-Meehan bill? I talked to the Senator from Wisconsin. He is \nnot one of those who is so concerned about pride of authorship that his \nname has to be on it. He said he would be prepared to take whatever we \nwould do here to get either bill passed. He has taken a very \nmeritorious position on this issue. My point is, in answer to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, we have tried to be as reasonable about \nthis as we know how to be.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask the leader further, what options, then, might be \navailable to the minority at this point in order to try to make clear \nour serious determination to see this issue properly addressed in the \nU.S. Senate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, the Senator from Massachusetts is as much of a \nlegislative strategist as I am, and he and I and others have talked \nabout what our recourse is given the intransigence on the other side. I \nsuppose we have two options that I am aware of. There may be others, \nbut there are two in particular. One we tried this morning--asking \nconsent over and over that this legislation be scheduled. The second is \nto take it upon ourselves to schedule it by offering it in the form of \nan amendment to whatever bill may come along. I have noted already \npublicly, and the Senator from Wisconsin has noted yesterday in a news \nconference, that those options are available to us and we will use them \nas we see the need.\n  I hope that will not be necessary. I hope that we can come to some \nagreement. I hope that we can be reasonable about this and recognize \nthat the House has acted, and that having a vote on Shays-Meehan isn't \ntoo much to ask. But those are our options. We aren't going to lay back \nand just accept the fact that our Republican colleagues would prefer \nnot to deal with this issue. It is too important not to deal with it. \nIt is too much of a priority for too many Americans and for the \npolitical system, not to mention the Democratic caucus, for us to \nignore it. So we will use those options and others, if they become \navailable to us, because this is as important a bill and important an \nissue as there is pending before the Senate today.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer of the leader. I \nask him further if he would agree that despite the fact that there is a \ngreat difficulty in the current atmosphere in this country and in the \ncontext within which our politics is being played out in Washington and \nin the national media--there is a great difficulty in conveying to the \npublic the importance of an issue, but I assume that the leader would \nagree with me that all the great words that are spoken on the floor of \nthe Senate, all of the meaning of this institution, all of the history \nthat is wrapped up in this most watched and intriguing and certainly \nsuccessful experiment in democracy on the face of the planet, that all \nof us really are facing a fundamental distortion that the American \npeople understand today--in a process that has seen the cost of \nelections rise more than 100 percent; more and more millions of dollars \nare being spent and less and less Americans are able to access the \nsystem. Less and less people are able to take part, and more and more \nspecial interests are taking the system and defining it in terms of the \nmoney that they have available to them.\n  I assume that the leader will share with me that this is not an \nordinary issue that we are talking about. This is something that goes \nto the fundamental notion of what kind of democracy we market to the \nrest of the world, and that if we are not capable of changing our own \nhouse and putting in order this system, then we lose something, not \njust with respect to our democracy at home, but with respect to the \nrest of the world. I assume the leader will share with me and others \nhere that, somehow, we have a responsibility in the next days to get \nthis issue to rise to the full measure of importance that it has. I \nalso assume the leader shares with me the view that, otherwise, what \nhappened in the House becomes a sham, that the House may have taken a \nfreebie vote, knowing that all they had to do was rely on the \nleadership of the Senate to say, ``We are not going to let it come up; \nwe are going to let the parliamentary process kill this.'' I assume the \nleader will agree with me that that would do an enormous disservice to \nthe full measure of what this issue is really all about.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts puts his finger right on \nthe question. What was that vote all about? Did they really hope, as we \ndo, that it will be put on the President's desk for signature some time \nbefore we adjourn? Or was there some cynical ploy here to position \nthemselves for election back home with the realization that it wasn't \ngoing anywhere? That is why this unanimous consent request is a test. \nThat is why our continued persistence will continue to be the test as \nto how serious many of our Republican colleagues are, who publicly \nespouse campaign reform, when it comes to passing a bill. He is also \ncorrect in what he said about its implications.\n\n  This isn't my desk. I am standing at the Democratic whip's desk. But \nthis desk happens to be Henry Clay's desk. Henry Clay sat at this desk \nover 100 years ago. I must say that in all of the time since he sat at \nthis desk I don't know that our democratic process has ever been in \ngreater jeopardy than it is today. Henry Clay used to sit at this desk \nand would have incredible debates about the direction this country was \ngoing to take. People would stay here overnight. People would be here \nfor days and weeks fighting the issues and the policies of the day \nbecause they believed so deeply in the direction our country was going \nto take.\n  But do you know what happens? What happens is that we get told by our \ncolleagues that ``I cannot be here on Monday. I have to go campaign. I\n\n[[Page S9822]]\n\ncan't be here on Friday. I have to go raise money. In fact, I can't \neven be here on Tuesday mornings or Thursday afternoons because I have \nto go raise money.''\n  Henry Clay must be turning over in his grave. That isn't the U.S. \nSenate. The money chase? That isn't what he fought his whole life to \nprotect and preserve as one of our finest patriots. We have to live up \nto that standard. And I swear we are not doing it so long as we are \nbridled and enslaved by the incredible money chase that goes on day \nafter day relentlessly and gets worse each political season.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the leader for that important connection to the \nreal history and the reality of what we are talking about.\n  In 1988, both parties--Democrats and Republicans--raised $45 million \ncombined in so-called ``soft money''--$45 million only 10 years ago. In \n1992, that number doubled to $90 million. And in the last race in 1996 \nwhen this Senator was running, that number rose to $262 million. \nEveryone knows that this time, in 1998, even more money will be spent, \nand everyone knows that money is being spent outside of the spirit of \nthe law. It is being spent to directly impact candidacies to elect \ncandidates even though it is so-called ``under the issue exception'' of \nthe first amendment.\n  We have a very, very fundamental challenge. I thank the distinguished \nleader for his persistence and for his commitment to the notion that \nthis issue is going to find its footing, its honest footing; it is \ngoing to find a way to penetrate the cynicism and the skepticism; and \nwe are somehow going to break through and let the American people know \nthat a majority of the U.S. Senate wants campaign finance reform and is \nprepared to vote for the Shays-Meehan bill now. There is only one thing \nstopping us. It is called the Republican majority. They don't want this \nto happen. They don't want it to happen because they are in favor of \nincumbency protection.\n  I am sure that the Democrat leader would agree with me that this \nreally is one of the most fundamental and important changes we could \nmake because how we can change health care, how we can affect \neducation, how we can properly have all the disparate elements of \nAmerican society represented is ultimately decided by the amount of \nmoney in our campaigns. I am sure that the leader will agree with me \nthat if we are going to be a democracy representing all of America, we \nsimply have to make this process more accessible and more available to \nthe average person and to all Americans.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I agree completely with what the Senator just said. In a \ndemocracy, it is supposed to be of and by the people. But how can it be \nof and by the people when you need the millions of dollars it now takes \nto be a legitimate candidate anywhere in the country? How can you say \nto people from working families, ``Look, we want you to be engaged, and \nnot only vote and participate, but we would like you to help lead,'' if \nall we can do in response to their question about what it is going to \ncost is to admit that it costs millions of dollars that he or she \ndoesn't have? How is it of and by the people when it becomes even more \nproblematic with each cycle of escalating costs, already $37 million \nmore this cycle than last cycle? That isn't democracy. That isn't what \nthe Founding Fathers and what Henry Clay thought about when he thought \nabout this system and what they were going to do to protect it.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \nmaking this unanimous consent request. I would like to ask him a \nquestion.\n  Many people who are watching this debate are not quite sure it is on \nthe square. Is it possible that incumbent Senators now standing on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate really want to change the system that brought \nthem to this body? I think there is a healthy degree of skepticism by \npeople who are watching this debate wondering how they could want to \nchange the system that brought them to their political position in \nlife, brought them to the U.S. Senate.\n  Can the Senator from South Dakota tell us how close we are to \nenacting meaningful reform, whether it is the legislation by Senator \nFeingold, by Senator McCain, or by the Shays-Meehan bill from the \nHouse? How close are we to that moment where we could call a vote and \nactually produce a bill that would change the system dramatically? Is \nthis a pipe dream? Is this a theory? Is this a political stunt, or is \nthis a reality, a real possibility on the legislative side?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I like the way the Senator from Illinois poses the \nquestion because it really brings it down to the essence of what we are \nasking. He asks how close we are. I would suggest we are 1 hour and one \nvote close. That is how close we are. I would be willing to settle for \nan hour of debate on either side and have the vote on Shays-Meehan this \nafternoon and send it off to the President.\n  What we get when we pass Shays-Meehan, or McCain-Feingold, is we \nfinally get an end to ``soft money''; we finally get some constraints \non this outrageous escalation of so-called independent issue ads. We \nget an array of additional improvements in our systems that constrain \nand further constrict the money-hungry process from continuing to \nescalate out of control. That is what we get with one vote and 1 hour.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask the Senator from South Dakota a further \nquestion, anyone watching this debate has to be puzzled. If the Senator \nfrom South Dakota is truthful in what he says, as I believe he is, and \nif a majority of the Senate supports this reform, why isn't this bill \non the floor? If a majority of the Senators are prepared to vote for \nit, why isn't this bill being brought up for consideration at this \nmoment?\n  Just a few minutes ago, the Senator from South Dakota made what is \ncalled a unanimous consent request to go to the bill. That is literally \nwhat it means. It takes unanimous consent of the Senate--not a majority \nvote--to bring it to the floor, and one Senator on the Republican side \nstood up and objected. So we were stopped in our tracks.\n  But can the Senator from South Dakota explain to those who are \nwatching this debate why we have to go to a unanimous consent request \nto bring a matter to the floor which we believe enjoys the support of \nmore than a majority of the membership of the Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois asks a good question. Why we \nhave to ask unanimous consent is because even though it is in this \ncalendar, the calendar of business--I could find the page very easily--\nof Wednesday, September 2nd, it is an item of business to be taken up \nby the Senate. Why? Because it has already passed in the House. But we \nhave to ask unanimous consent because the Republican leadership is \nunwilling to schedule it. Even though it has now passed in the House, \neven though there is a majority of Senators who are prepared to support \nit, there is intransigence on the part of our Republican leadership to \nbring this bill up.\n  All we can do is hope that perhaps with some persistence and some \nrepetition asking unanimous consent, or offering the bill as an \namendment, we can take up what should be a normal course of business \ngiven the Senate Calendar.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask one more question. I see my colleague \nfrom the State of Connecticut is up for a question as well. I will make \none last request of the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The argument used most often by the critics of this campaign finance \nreform is an argument often used by the Senator from Kentucky, the \nRepublican Senator who objected to this unanimous consent, which is \nthat to reduce the amount of money being spent on a campaign will \nrestrict free speech in America, will restrict the right of American \ncitizens to express their views by spending their money in a political \ncampaign.\n  Would the Senator from South Dakota address this, because I think it \nis the core issue here. Are we in fact reducing the amount of money at \nthe expense of restricting the constitutional right to free speech? \nThat I think is the crux of this debate, at least the nominal debate \nthat we hear, and I would like the Senator from South Dakota to address \nit.\n  (Mr. STEVENS assumed the Chair.)\n\n[[Page S9823]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think it is a sad commentary that anyone could \nactually subscribe to the proposition that freedom of speech is \ndirectly related to the freedom to spend. The freedom to spend actually \nblocks out the freedom of speech, because if we are spending more and \nthat becomes in essence the cacophony of voices in a campaign, the real \nfreedom of speech--that is, the substantive debate, the opportunity to \nconduct meaningful campaigns on the issues--is drowned out.\n  So that in essence is what is happening. More and more money goes \ninto 30-second attack ads, and less and less real speaking to the \nissues occurs. That in essence is the irony of this whole debate. That \nis the problem we are facing. We are reducing real freedom of speech \nwith this unlimited freedom to spend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from South Dakota in closing, \nbeyond our rhetoric in the Chamber, take a look at the facts, and in \n1996 we had more money spent on campaigns than any time in our history. \nWe had the lowest percentage of eligible voters in American history in \n72 years cast a vote in the Presidential election between President \nClinton and Senator Dole.\n  That is an indication to me that the American people understand what \nthe Senator from South Dakota is saying. They think there is something \nfundamentally flawed with this system and negative advertising, the \nmoney chase that the Senator from South Dakota addresses. If we do \nnothing else before we leave this year, I hope this Senate will address \nthis important issue.\n  I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his leadership.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his good \nquestions. And I yield to the Senator from Connecticut for a question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from South Dakota.\n  If I may, before posing my question, I want to reflect upon an \nexperience I had last year as a member of the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee which held extensive hearings into this subject \nmatter of the 1996 campaign and how it was financed. And I must say as \nI look back to it, the mental image I have of it is being waist deep in \nmuck and fighting our way through it. It was a stunning, mind-altering, \nultimately embarrassing experience, to see what has happened to our \ngreat democracy and the extent to which, at a time when we question the \npublic's trust in government, we have created a system that amounts to \nevasion of law clearly by lawmakers, by all of us in the lawmaking \nclass, by those who are running for office.\n  And why do I say that? What became clear in those hearings, we have \nlaws, we have laws that limit the amount of money that individuals can \ngive to campaigns--$2,000 per individual. We have laws that limit the \namount that a political action committee can give--$10,000 in the whole \ncycle--to a given campaign. We have laws that prohibit corporations and \nunions from contributing to political campaigns. It could not be \nclearer. And then there is created this so-called soft money loophole \nthrough which is driven not a Mack truck, a whole division, a whole \narmy which has obliterated the limits.\n  So we have individuals giving hundreds of thousands of dollars, we \nhave corporations and unions giving millions of dollars, we make a \nmockery of the law, and we have just the effect the Senator from South \nDakota and the Senator from Illinois have just talked about, which is \nquite the opposite of reform here--restricting people's rights.\n  The reality, the place we have come to, the sad place we have come \nto, limits individual rights and, even more underneath that, the \nindividual American's confidence that he or she has the same ability \nroughly as every other American to affect their Government. Why? You \ndon't have to be a rocket scientist or a political scientist to come to \nthe belief that an individual or a group that can give hundreds of \nthousands of dollars has more access to their Government than the \naverage American does.\n\n  I remember that during the debate we had--one of the earlier debates \nwe had on this subject--one of our colleagues brought out a chart, and \nto me it told a lot of the story, and it responds to, I know, some of \nthe conclusions made by Members of the Senate that the public doesn't \nreally care about campaign finance reform. I disagree. When you ask \npeople what problems they are most worried about, campaign finance \nreform is not going to come out on the top of that list, in part \nbecause I think there is a misapprehension. I read a quote last year \nfrom somebody who said, ``Oh, campaign finance reform. Well, I care \nmore about how they spend my tax money than how they raise their \ncampaign money.'' The reality is that how campaign money is raised, as \nwe have seen here and the leader has spoken to quite eloquently--how \ncampaign money is raised affects how their tax money is spent and who \npays taxes.\n  But look, we are leaders. We were elected to do what we think is \nright. We were elected to build confidence in our Government. So \nhopefully we will respond to more than just polls here.\n  The chart that I referred to earlier that one of our colleagues \nbrought out had two lines on it. One showed the trend line of \ncontributions to American political campaigns. The other showed the \ntrend line of the turnout of Americans in voting--startling difference. \nAs the money goes up, the public participation in elections goes down \nbecause people don't think their vote counts anymore.\n  I say to the Senator from South Dakota, as I think about the \nsituation, as I know we got 52 votes for the McCain-Feingold bill here, \nand we were all raised to believe the will of the majority prevails in \nour democracy, it is not so in the Senate apparently. In the House, \nmuch to everybody's surprise--and I must say with some pride, due in \ngood measure to the great leadership given by Congressman Chris Shays \nof Connecticut--the Shays-Meehan bill passed.\n  We have another opportunity to right this wrong. The problem is not \ngoing to go away. Just in the last week, the Attorney General has \ncommenced initial inquiries that relate to campaign finance practices \nin 1996. And I can't believe after all that we have learned, after all \nthat the media has told us, after all that we know--because as the \nSenator from South Dakota has said, it is our lives; we are being \npulled by the money chase away from what should be the focus of our \ninterest, which is the people's business--I can't believe that we are \ngoing to end this 105th session of Congress without doing something to \nreform our campaign finance laws.\n  So my question to the Senator from South Dakota, with thanks for his \npersistent leadership on this serious matter, is--well, two really. \nOne, in the course of the Senator's career, if we are not able to pass \ncampaign finance reform in this session, would the Senator not agree \nthat this is one of the most grievous abdications of this Chamber's \nresponsibility in a long time faced with a real problem? And second, I \nsuppose, does the leader agree that part of what is needed here is for \nthe public to speak to their elected leaders and plead with them, \nparticularly in the Senate, those of our colleagues who can take us \neither to a vote or from 52 to 60 to break the filibuster, that it \nreally matters to them that we adopt campaign finance reform this year?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut for \nhis leadership and tremendous effort that he has put forth to bring us \nto this point.\n  As to his first question, I hadn't raised until now the point that \nthe Senator made so appropriately. I don't know if there are many \nCongresses that have spent more time investigating than this one has. \nThis Congress has probably spent more money and more time investigating \nthan any since the early 1970s. And as the Senator from Connecticut so \nappropriately points out, with all that investigation, there can be no \nquestion about the need for some reform. Obviously, there is a question \nabout the need for enforcement and follow through after enforcement \nwith regard to what may or may not have happened, the allegations, all \nof the information raised in these investigations. But then the \nquestion comes, What do we do about it? And we have been asking that \nquestion ever since the investigations here in the Senate have ended. \nWhat do we do about it?\n\n  How tragic it would be for us to say, ``Look, we have now exposed all \nof\n\n[[Page S9824]]\n\nthese problems but we choose to do nothing. We choose to ignore the \nfact that reform is so critical.'' What does that say to the American \npeople? Look, here are the problems. But, look here, we are not going \nto do anything about them.\n  So, the Senator from Connecticut raises, I think, the essence of what \nit is that we, as Senators, need to confront in our minds, in our \nhearts, about what is important before we close in a mere 6 weeks. We \nhave investigated. We now know without any question, with great \nauthority, there are some serious problems that have to be addressed. \nTo wash our hands of the matter now would be a tragedy of an order that \nI do not think we have seen in this country.\n  As to what those of you who are watching may do, I hope Senators will \nreceive mail and phone calls and comments from every constituent who \nhas any interest in the democratic process, who understands that \nwithout some contact with your Senators there is a real chance they may \nnot change their minds. So, contact is of the essence. I think it ought \nto be done as soon as possible.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I will be happy to yield to the \nSenator from Michigan for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the leader for yielding. I do have a number of \nquestions.\n  First, let me say I think we have never been closer to enacting \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform than we are at this moment. The \nmajority of the Senate favors it. The House, through a very courageous \nact on the part of many of its Members, has overcome the opposition of \nthe House leadership to pass Shays-Meehan.\n  It was said earlier this year that there would be no way of passing \nShays-Meehan against the will of the leadership of the House of \nRepresentatives. But a very stalwart, gutsy coalition of Democrats and \nRepublicans in the House found a way to have the majority rule in the \nHouse of Representatives. It was not easy. It took incredible energy \nand willpower. They exercised it and they prevailed, and the majority \nprevailed over the wishes of the leaders of the House of \nRepresentatives. So, now we are in a situation where the majority of \nthe Senate favors comprehensive reform and the House has passed \ncomprehensive reform.\n  The leader has spoken earlier as to what it is that is stopping us \nfrom trying to get comprehensive reform adopted in the Senate this \nyear. The majority of the public clearly favors it. All public opinion \npolls show it. They are skeptical that we will do anything about it--\nthe polls show that as well--but they favor it. Now we are going to \ncome down, it seems to me, to a test of wills, a great and a historic \ntest of wills in the U.S. Senate. The opponents of campaign finance \nreform have the right to filibuster. They have used that right, and \nthey have the right to filibuster. But the proponents, the supporters \nof campaign finance reform, do not need to withdraw simply because \nthere is a filibuster on the floor. If that were done, we would not \nhave civil rights legislation. The people who supported civil rights \nlegislation did not always have 67 votes going in. You can start with a \nmajority and offer an amendment, or offer a bill, and just because the \nopponents filibuster the bill does not require us, those of us who \nsupport campaign finance reform, to give up our right to offer the \namendment and to have the amendment disposed of by the Senate. And if \nthe filibusterers want to tie up the Senate and prevent the Senate from \nvoting, that is their right. But the supporters of campaign finance \nreform are not obligated to withdraw an amendment simply because the \nopponents use their right to filibuster.\n  That is why what we are now facing, given the opposition to the \nunanimous consent request this morning, is a historic test of wills \nbetween the majority that favors campaign finance reform, a bipartisan \nmajority that now has seven Republicans and all the Democrats, and \nthose who oppose campaign finance reform. We must not withdraw in the \nface of a filibuster. The stakes are too huge. They have been \nilluminated here this morning eloquently by the Democratic leader. The \nstakes are whether we are going to restore public confidence to a \ncampaign finance system which is in tatters. We are supposed to have \nlimits on contributions. It is supposed to be $1,000 per person per \ncampaign. Corporations are not allowed to contribute to campaigns, and \nneither are unions. Yet, we have corporations and unions contributing \nhuge amounts of money which, for all intents and purposes under any \nreasonable interpretation, support or oppose campaigns. That is what is \nnow happening because of the soft money loophole.\n  We have a chance this year, better than we have ever had, to close \nthat soft money loophole and to restore public confidence in the \ncampaign finance system. We have a chance to do it. If we will show the \nsame courage on a bipartisan basis as was shown in the House of \nRepresentatives, down that hall just a few weeks ago, we can pass \ncampaign finance reform in the Senate. But what it will take is a \ndetermination on the part of the supporters not to withdraw our \nmajority view in the face of a filibuster. The filibusterers have their \nrights to tie up the Senate. We have our rights to offer an amendment \nand seek a vote on that amendment. And, in the face of a filibuster, we \nneed not withdraw and give in to a filibuster.\n  My question of the Democratic leader is this: Was it his hope this \nmorning, and intent this morning in offering this unanimous consent \nproposal, that we have a course of action which would allow the Senate \nto work its will, to permit amendments to Shays-Meehan providing they \nare relevant? As I read the unanimous consent request and heard the \nunanimous consent proposal, relevant amendments would be in order. Was \nit the Democratic leader's proposal this morning that we have an \nopportunity to resolve this issue in a way which would allow us to do \nall of our other business and to avoid the kind of filibuster which we \nnow very clearly see is going to be forthcoming from the objection to \nthis unanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will respond to the Senator from Michigan. Before I \ndo, let me say I wish the entire Chamber had heard what he has just \nsaid with regard to what it is we are trying to do and what the \nimplications of this really are. I don't know of anybody in the Senate \nwho has put more force, personally, and more of his own personal \ncredibility, behind this issue than has the Senator from Michigan. I \nappreciate deeply his commitment.\n  The Senator poses a very understandable question. What is it we are \nasking here? What do we want? We simply want the opportunity to reflect \nthe will of the majority of the Senate on an issue for which there is a \nmoment of opportunity, from a historical perspective. This is our \nmoment. If we fail in the next 6 weeks, we start all over with a new \nCongress, with all of the odds stacked as much against us, if not more, \nthan they were this Congress. So what we are saying is let's seize the \nopportunity, let's seize the moment here and do what the House has \nalready done. On a bipartisan basis, let's work with Republicans and \nDemocrats to pass the Shays-Meehan bill. We will take it in any shape \nor form we can. I offered, as I know the Senator from Michigan heard, \nto simply take up the bill that was passed in the House and, on a 1-\nhour, one-vote basis, let's move it on to the President.\n  Obviously, I recognize the complexity of this legislation. I would be \nmore than happy, as the request suggests, to consider entertaining \nrelevant amendments because there are differences of opinion. Just \nyesterday, we argued for the need for relevant amendments to the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. So we are consistent in our request here. \nLet's have relevant amendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Let's \nhave relevant amendments on campaign finance reform, if the minority \nchooses--the minority in this case being those who oppose campaign \nreform--to have them. So we are not asking for much. We are simply \nsaying let's seize the moment, as the Senator from Michigan so \nappropriately described, and let's get on with doing what we were \nelected to do before it is too late.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the leader for his leadership and for his \ncomments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Michigan. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9825]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9819-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9819-S9825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2183\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think that we want to finish this \nforeign operations appropriations legislation, and I hope that we can \ndo it. I hope we can do it sometime soon. I note there are a number of \namendments that are left to be considered on this important piece of \nlegislation. I commend our ranking member and the chairman for their \nefforts in resolving this important piece of legislation in a timely \nway. There are a number of other amendments that must be considered \nbefore we can come to closure.\n  The question then comes as to what we take up next. Yesterday, we \ndiscussed on the Senate floor how important it is that one of the bills \nthat we take up next be the Patients' Bill of Rights, managed care \nreform. The other piece of legislation, Mr. President, that ought to be \ntaken up immediately is legislation that was already passed in the \nHouse, the Shays-Meehan bill, H.R. 2183, the campaign finance reform \nbill.\n  Mr. President, the House deliberated on that bill for some time. \nHouse Members worked their will. They did a good job in dealing with \nall of the controversial aspects of campaign reform this year. They \nrecognize, as many of us recognize, that we are not going to solve the \nproblem with one piece of legislation. But they made a major \ncontribution to solving the problems we face with regard to soft money \nand independent expenditures and reporting and enforcement.\n  Whether or not we move this issue forward will be determined by \nwhether or not we are willing to act in the course of the next 6 weeks. \nTime is running out. I applaud Senators McCain and Feingold for their \nnews conference this week wherein they said they will press for this \nlegislation, they will offer their bill as an amendment to another bill \nat some point in the future.\n  Mr. President, whether it is the McCain-Feingold bill or the Shays-\nMeehan bill, this Senate must not lose the opportunity to complete its \nwork on campaign finance reform this year. We must have the opportunity \nto address the issue. We must take up that legislation.\n  I will be propounding a unanimous consent request at some point this \nmorning--in just a few moments--to ask that campaign finance reform be \nthe next order of business, to ask, again as we did yesterday, that it \nbe laid aside for other important appropriations bills simply because \nwe recognize the urgency of passing appropriations legislation on time. \nWe are way past due. We have not passed a budget. We have not passed \nany of the appropriations bills. Not one has been signed into law.\n  Mr. President, to the extent we can do all that we can to resolve the \nremaining procedural and other related problems on appropriations, we \nmust do so. But there is no question that, as we look to what must be \ncompleted prior to the end of this year, the two issues that have to be \naddressed are the campaign finance reform bill and the Patients' Bill \nof Rights that we discussed yesterday.\n  We come to the floor this morning simply to focus attention on the \nneed for expeditious consideration of this legislation, on how critical \nit is that we, as Republicans and Democrats, agree, as did Members in \nthe House, to make it the kind of priority it deserves to be, to \naddress the array of problems that we have.\n  I cannot think of a more diverse philosophical body than the House \ntoday. We have the far left and we have the far right. We have the \nextremes on both sides. With all of the extreme positions that Members \nare capable of taking, they came together and passed the Shays-Meehan \nbill just before we left.\n  Mr. President, now it is our turn. Now we have an opportunity to do \nthe same thing. Now we can pass the legislation here. We had a debate \nearlier. We were disappointed that we were not able to come to closure \non it. But now is the time. The House has acted. So must we.\n  So far this cycle Republicans and Democrats have spent $37 million \nmore than the last cycle--$37 million. Campaigns continue to escalate \nin cost and degrade in quality. More and more, there is a rush for \ndollars. More and more questions are asked about how money is raised. \nMore and more, the people are turned off and tuned out by a political \nprocess that has gone awry. They ask that we react. They ask that we \nshow some leadership. They ask that we take some steps to correct this \nsituation before it gets even worse. The House heard; and the House \nreacted. The Senate now must do the same.\n  There is no better time to do it than now. We all are cognizant of \nthe fact that there are only 60 days left before the next election. \nWithin those 60 days, there will be even more money raised, tens of \nmillions of dollars raised, across this country. As we speak, I \nguarantee you, there are Senators and House Members and candidates in \nsmall rooms everywhere dialing for dollars--incessant dollar dialing \nthat has reached an unprecedented threshold. And the implications of \nall that money become more serious, the implications for the \nlegislative process, the implications for campaigns themselves, the \nimplications for the democracy that we all treasure.\n\n  Mr. President, there has to be an end at some point. We have to \ncurtail this incessant effort to raise more and more money at the cost \nof the credibility of the American people as they view our campaigns in \n1998.\n  Not all of us are on the floor right now, but if we were, I say with \nunanimity our Democratic caucus wishes to express the hope that we can \npass the Shays-Meehan bill this week, next week, or certainly at some \npoint before we leave. If we pass the Shays-Meehan bill as it passed in \nthe House, which I am prepared to do, I will accept it. I will take the \nlanguage that was passed in the House and I will send it off to the \nPresident. He has already indicated he will sign it. We don't have to \ngo to conference. There is nothing we have to do that would complicate \nour actions once it passes in the Senate.\n  So let's do it. Let's agree, as Republicans and Democrats, that it is \nimportant to do it now. The time is running out. I urge my colleagues--\nurge my colleagues--to agree.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of \nthe foreign operations appropriations bill, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 2183, the House-passed campaign finance reform \nbill, that only relevant amendments be in order, that it be the regular \norder, but that the majority leader may lay the bill aside for any \nappropriations bills and appropriations conference reports.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S9820]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am not surprised, but I am \ndisappointed.\n  We will continue to persist. We will continue to make the effort each \nday, either in the form of unanimous consent requests like this, or \nwith amendments offered to bills that will be considered. We will not \nlet this issue pass. It is essential that we consider this legislation \nbefore it is too late, before we run out of time, before we miss a \ngolden opportunity to seize the moment and do what the Senate should \nhave done earlier this year, should have done last year, should have \ndone 10 years ago. This will not go away. We can do it either the easy \nway or the hard way, but we will continue to persist.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the minority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before coming back, I was at the \nMinnesota State Fair, which is quite a focus group--almost half the \nState's population comes there in 13 days. Without going through my \nconversations with people in Minnesota, I want to ask you whether or \nnot back home in South Dakota or as you travel around the country, what \nkind of discussions do citizens have with you about the mix of money \nand politics and reform?\n  Does the minority leader think that this is, in fact, a burning issue \nto people? We have been told for so long that people don't really care \nabout campaign finance reform. What is the minority leader hearing from \npeople in South Dakota? What is he hearing from citizens in our \ncountry? Why does he, as the leader of our party, put this at the very \ntop of his priorities?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Minnesota raises an important point.\n  As I talked to South Dakotans all over the state this last month of \nAugust, I found it remarkable how many people simply said they don't \nwant to have anything to do with the political process anymore. I had \nmany, many Republicans who said they are just sick and tired of what is \nhappening out there. Most of it, they said, relates to the money--the \nmoney chase, the implications of more money, the influence of big money \non the legislative process. They are tired of it.\n  I think without question they all understand that the rules, the \nlaws, need to be changed.\n  It was remarkable to hear the consistency with which people expressed \nthat point of view to me--Republicans, independents, and Democrats; \nthey all said it. They all indicated with increasing intensity that \nunless we change the system we could lose it, that unless we change the \nrules we will become victims of the current ones.\n  That, to me, is the essence of why this is so essential, why it is \nimportant that we act now.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Wisconsin for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, before I ask a question, let me thank \nthe minority leader for his tremendous leadership on this issue and for \nmaintaining the support of the entire Democratic caucus for reform--\nwhether it be the McCain-Feingold bill or the Shays-Meehan bill, which \nis very similar.\n  One of the criticisms made of this bill consistently, which I \nobviously have never found very valid, is that it is a partisan bill. \nThe fact is that seven Republicans have supported this bill out here on \nthe floor, and the number in the House was overwhelming.\n  I wonder if the minority leader is aware that a quarter of all the \nmembers of the Republican Party in the House supported this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I was aware of that, and I think the Senator from \nWisconsin raises a very important point. I actually believe that there \nare at least 25 percent of the Republican caucus in the Senate who \nsupport campaign reform. I just wish they would express themselves, as \nI know the House already has, in that regard.\n  As I talk to colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they tell me \nthey are supportive of it. They tell me they understand we need to see \nsome change. I just hope that some additional courageous Republican \nSenators will step forth and join us. All we need are 60 votes; we \nalready have 45 Democratic Senators. As the Senator from Wisconsin \nknows, we already have several Republican Senators who have expressed \nsupport and are willing to continue to support our effort. So a dozen \nor so additional Republican Senators would put us over the top.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is precisely the reason the senior \nSenator from Arizona and I announced yesterday that we will be forcing \nthe issue if your proposal is not agreed to, to bring this up, because \nwe do believe that there will be Members on the other side of the aisle \nhere who will support us. In fact, we are down, now, to only eight \npeople.\n  The fact is that originally people said, ``You only have several \ncosponsors. You only have two Republicans. It will never get through \nthe House.'' That is just a series of what I regard as excuses.\n  Mr. President, now it is very simple. The President has said he is \nready to sign the bill. A majority of this body has indicated on the \nrecord they are for the bill and a majority of the other House is \ndramatically in favor of the bill.\n  I just wonder if the leader would comment for a minute on the \nsignificance if we don't get this done this year. Unfortunately, we \ncan't pass a bill that will affect this election, the one that will \nhappen in 60-some days. That was an agreement we had. We worked hard \nand we would have loved to avoid the abuses that are going on right now \nas we speak. But there is another election coming up in the year 2000.\n  I wonder if the leader would talk for a minute about what it means if \nwe don't get the job done now.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Wisconsin probably knows better than \nanybody in this Chamber the implications of doing nothing. No one has \nworked harder, provided greater leadership, and engendered more respect \non both sides of the aisle than the Senator from Wisconsin. He is \nrunning, as am I, this year. He knows the race for dollars. He \nunderstands the implications of that race. He understands, as well, the \naverage cost of a Senate race right now is over $4 million. He knows, \nas I do, that we have already surpassed last year's record-breaking \nlevels, last cycle's record-breaking levels in the amount of money \nrequired to be successful.\n  He knows, as I do, we will be seeing double-digit figures when it \ncomes to what it will take to wage a successful Senate race anywhere in \nthe country. He knows the implications of that. I must say, Mr. \nPresident, you don't need any imagination to recognize just what a \ndevastating effect that has.\n  I was at two fundraising breakfasts this morning, neither for myself. \nThat is exactly what is happening all over this city and across this \ncountry--fundraiser after fundraiser, more and more money generated \nwith implications on the legislative and political process.\n  Where does it end? How will we possibly recruit candidates in the \nfuture when we tell them: We want you to be a part of the Democratic \nprocess, but we want you to cough up $10 million to do so if you are \ngoing to be in the U.S. Senate?\n  How can we do that? How can we recruit with a straight face--except \nfor those who have the resources and the wherewithal? How many more \nmillionaires should we have in a representative body of 100 people? We \nhave some very good and diligent and hard-working people of wealth in \nthis country, and I am glad they are here. But I want to make sure that \nworking families are also represented, that we elect people who \nunderstand what it takes to earn a paycheck and make ends meet, to send \na child to college. I want those people in the Senate as well. How do \nyou do it when you have to raise $10 million? Who do you turn to? So \nthe Senator from Wisconsin very appropriately raises the question, \n``What are the implications?'' There are many, many more. We can talk \nall day long about the implications. Those are just a few.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his statements \nand for his leadership on this issue. I was enthusiastic about coming \nback to work on this issue again after I have had conversations with \npeople like the Senator from Michigan. I was very enthusiastic when I \nhad a chance to meet with the senior Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S9821]]\n\n We decided definitely yesterday to move, and move soon, on this issue. \nI am even more excited and enthusiastic that we can finish the job. The \nexcuses are over. The whole thing is down to eight Senators. It is time \nto do the job. I thank the leader very much.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for his comments. I appreciate the \ncontribution he has made. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts for a question, if he has one.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the leader. I will ask the leader, first of all, a \nseries of questions. My first question is, I assume the leader has \nreached out to the majority leader of the Senate and suggested to him \nthat there is a way in which the U.S. Senate could take an appropriate \namount of time to properly deal with this effort. I wonder if the \nleader will share with the Senate and with the country what the \nresponse is of the Republican side of the aisle with respect to the \nability of the Senate to carry out its responsibilities here.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts raises the question, \n``What is the response?'' We got it a few minutes ago. We asked very \nreasonably that we take up this bill next--that we finish the foreign \nops appropriations bill, which is critical. We have to get these \nappropriations bills done.\n  As I have noted, not one of the 13 appropriations bills has been \nsigned into law. Here it is now September. The next fiscal year is less \nthan 4 weeks away, and we have yet to pass one appropriations bill. So \nwe recognize that we have to get our work done in that regard, but we \nalso recognize that there will be gaps, that there are other needs out \nthere, legislatively, and there can be no greater needs than the \nrequest we made yesterday about a Patients' Bill of Rights \nconsideration and the request we make today on campaign finance reform. \nWhy? Because the House has already acted on both bills.\n  So the response we got today, as I noted, was disappointing because \nwe are trying to be reasonable. We are suggesting that only relevant \namendments be offered. We are suggesting that we lay the bill aside to \nfinish our work on appropriations bills. We would be prepared to \nsuggest other options. In fact, I would even go so far--and I haven't \ntalked to my colleagues about this, so I am premature in making this \noffer, but just for the record I would be willing to accept a vote, up \nor down, on the Shays-Meehan bill--no questions asked; no amendments. \nLet's just have a vote, up or down, on Shays-Meehan and send it to the \nPresident if it passes. I would be prepared to do even that. Many \ncolleagues might want to go farther than that.\n  How much time does it take to have one vote? How much time does it \ntake to consider something that has already passed in the House, such \nas the Shays-Meehan bill? I talked to the Senator from Wisconsin. He is \nnot one of those who is so concerned about pride of authorship that his \nname has to be on it. He said he would be prepared to take whatever we \nwould do here to get either bill passed. He has taken a very \nmeritorious position on this issue. My point is, in answer to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, we have tried to be as reasonable about \nthis as we know how to be.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask the leader further, what options, then, might be \navailable to the minority at this point in order to try to make clear \nour serious determination to see this issue properly addressed in the \nU.S. Senate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, the Senator from Massachusetts is as much of a \nlegislative strategist as I am, and he and I and others have talked \nabout what our recourse is given the intransigence on the other side. I \nsuppose we have two options that I am aware of. There may be others, \nbut there are two in particular. One we tried this morning--asking \nconsent over and over that this legislation be scheduled. The second is \nto take it upon ourselves to schedule it by offering it in the form of \nan amendment to whatever bill may come along. I have noted already \npublicly, and the Senator from Wisconsin has noted yesterday in a news \nconference, that those options are available to us and we will use them \nas we see the need.\n  I hope that will not be necessary. I hope that we can come to some \nagreement. I hope that we can be reasonable about this and recognize \nthat the House has acted, and that having a vote on Shays-Meehan isn't \ntoo much to ask. But those are our options. We aren't going to lay back \nand just accept the fact that our Republican colleagues would prefer \nnot to deal with this issue. It is too important not to deal with it. \nIt is too much of a priority for too many Americans and for the \npolitical system, not to mention the Democratic caucus, for us to \nignore it. So we will use those options and others, if they become \navailable to us, because this is as important a bill and important an \nissue as there is pending before the Senate today.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer of the leader. I \nask him further if he would agree that despite the fact that there is a \ngreat difficulty in the current atmosphere in this country and in the \ncontext within which our politics is being played out in Washington and \nin the national media--there is a great difficulty in conveying to the \npublic the importance of an issue, but I assume that the leader would \nagree with me that all the great words that are spoken on the floor of \nthe Senate, all of the meaning of this institution, all of the history \nthat is wrapped up in this most watched and intriguing and certainly \nsuccessful experiment in democracy on the face of the planet, that all \nof us really are facing a fundamental distortion that the American \npeople understand today--in a process that has seen the cost of \nelections rise more than 100 percent; more and more millions of dollars \nare being spent and less and less Americans are able to access the \nsystem. Less and less people are able to take part, and more and more \nspecial interests are taking the system and defining it in terms of the \nmoney that they have available to them.\n  I assume that the leader will share with me that this is not an \nordinary issue that we are talking about. This is something that goes \nto the fundamental notion of what kind of democracy we market to the \nrest of the world, and that if we are not capable of changing our own \nhouse and putting in order this system, then we lose something, not \njust with respect to our democracy at home, but with respect to the \nrest of the world. I assume the leader will share with me and others \nhere that, somehow, we have a responsibility in the next days to get \nthis issue to rise to the full measure of importance that it has. I \nalso assume the leader shares with me the view that, otherwise, what \nhappened in the House becomes a sham, that the House may have taken a \nfreebie vote, knowing that all they had to do was rely on the \nleadership of the Senate to say, ``We are not going to let it come up; \nwe are going to let the parliamentary process kill this.'' I assume the \nleader will agree with me that that would do an enormous disservice to \nthe full measure of what this issue is really all about.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts puts his finger right on \nthe question. What was that vote all about? Did they really hope, as we \ndo, that it will be put on the President's desk for signature some time \nbefore we adjourn? Or was there some cynical ploy here to position \nthemselves for election back home with the realization that it wasn't \ngoing anywhere? That is why this unanimous consent request is a test. \nThat is why our continued persistence will continue to be the test as \nto how serious many of our Republican colleagues are, who publicly \nespouse campaign reform, when it comes to passing a bill. He is also \ncorrect in what he said about its implications.\n\n  This isn't my desk. I am standing at the Democratic whip's desk. But \nthis desk happens to be Henry Clay's desk. Henry Clay sat at this desk \nover 100 years ago. I must say that in all of the time since he sat at \nthis desk I don't know that our democratic process has ever been in \ngreater jeopardy than it is today. Henry Clay used to sit at this desk \nand would have incredible debates about the direction this country was \ngoing to take. People would stay here overnight. People would be here \nfor days and weeks fighting the issues and the policies of the day \nbecause they believed so deeply in the direction our country was going \nto take.\n  But do you know what happens? What happens is that we get told by our \ncolleagues that ``I cannot be here on Monday. I have to go campaign. I\n\n[[Page S9822]]\n\ncan't be here on Friday. I have to go raise money. In fact, I can't \neven be here on Tuesday mornings or Thursday afternoons because I have \nto go raise money.''\n  Henry Clay must be turning over in his grave. That isn't the U.S. \nSenate. The money chase? That isn't what he fought his whole life to \nprotect and preserve as one of our finest patriots. We have to live up \nto that standard. And I swear we are not doing it so long as we are \nbridled and enslaved by the incredible money chase that goes on day \nafter day relentlessly and gets worse each political season.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the leader for that important connection to the \nreal history and the reality of what we are talking about.\n  In 1988, both parties--Democrats and Republicans--raised $45 million \ncombined in so-called ``soft money''--$45 million only 10 years ago. In \n1992, that number doubled to $90 million. And in the last race in 1996 \nwhen this Senator was running, that number rose to $262 million. \nEveryone knows that this time, in 1998, even more money will be spent, \nand everyone knows that money is being spent outside of the spirit of \nthe law. It is being spent to directly impact candidacies to elect \ncandidates even though it is so-called ``under the issue exception'' of \nthe first amendment.\n  We have a very, very fundamental challenge. I thank the distinguished \nleader for his persistence and for his commitment to the notion that \nthis issue is going to find its footing, its honest footing; it is \ngoing to find a way to penetrate the cynicism and the skepticism; and \nwe are somehow going to break through and let the American people know \nthat a majority of the U.S. Senate wants campaign finance reform and is \nprepared to vote for the Shays-Meehan bill now. There is only one thing \nstopping us. It is called the Republican majority. They don't want this \nto happen. They don't want it to happen because they are in favor of \nincumbency protection.\n  I am sure that the Democrat leader would agree with me that this \nreally is one of the most fundamental and important changes we could \nmake because how we can change health care, how we can affect \neducation, how we can properly have all the disparate elements of \nAmerican society represented is ultimately decided by the amount of \nmoney in our campaigns. I am sure that the leader will agree with me \nthat if we are going to be a democracy representing all of America, we \nsimply have to make this process more accessible and more available to \nthe average person and to all Americans.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I agree completely with what the Senator just said. In a \ndemocracy, it is supposed to be of and by the people. But how can it be \nof and by the people when you need the millions of dollars it now takes \nto be a legitimate candidate anywhere in the country? How can you say \nto people from working families, ``Look, we want you to be engaged, and \nnot only vote and participate, but we would like you to help lead,'' if \nall we can do in response to their question about what it is going to \ncost is to admit that it costs millions of dollars that he or she \ndoesn't have? How is it of and by the people when it becomes even more \nproblematic with each cycle of escalating costs, already $37 million \nmore this cycle than last cycle? That isn't democracy. That isn't what \nthe Founding Fathers and what Henry Clay thought about when he thought \nabout this system and what they were going to do to protect it.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \nmaking this unanimous consent request. I would like to ask him a \nquestion.\n  Many people who are watching this debate are not quite sure it is on \nthe square. Is it possible that incumbent Senators now standing on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate really want to change the system that brought \nthem to this body? I think there is a healthy degree of skepticism by \npeople who are watching this debate wondering how they could want to \nchange the system that brought them to their political position in \nlife, brought them to the U.S. Senate.\n  Can the Senator from South Dakota tell us how close we are to \nenacting meaningful reform, whether it is the legislation by Senator \nFeingold, by Senator McCain, or by the Shays-Meehan bill from the \nHouse? How close are we to that moment where we could call a vote and \nactually produce a bill that would change the system dramatically? Is \nthis a pipe dream? Is this a theory? Is this a political stunt, or is \nthis a reality, a real possibility on the legislative side?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I like the way the Senator from Illinois poses the \nquestion because it really brings it down to the essence of what we are \nasking. He asks how close we are. I would suggest we are 1 hour and one \nvote close. That is how close we are. I would be willing to settle for \nan hour of debate on either side and have the vote on Shays-Meehan this \nafternoon and send it off to the President.\n  What we get when we pass Shays-Meehan, or McCain-Feingold, is we \nfinally get an end to ``soft money''; we finally get some constraints \non this outrageous escalation of so-called independent issue ads. We \nget an array of additional improvements in our systems that constrain \nand further constrict the money-hungry process from continuing to \nescalate out of control. That is what we get with one vote and 1 hour.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask the Senator from South Dakota a further \nquestion, anyone watching this debate has to be puzzled. If the Senator \nfrom South Dakota is truthful in what he says, as I believe he is, and \nif a majority of the Senate supports this reform, why isn't this bill \non the floor? If a majority of the Senators are prepared to vote for \nit, why isn't this bill being brought up for consideration at this \nmoment?\n  Just a few minutes ago, the Senator from South Dakota made what is \ncalled a unanimous consent request to go to the bill. That is literally \nwhat it means. It takes unanimous consent of the Senate--not a majority \nvote--to bring it to the floor, and one Senator on the Republican side \nstood up and objected. So we were stopped in our tracks.\n  But can the Senator from South Dakota explain to those who are \nwatching this debate why we have to go to a unanimous consent request \nto bring a matter to the floor which we believe enjoys the support of \nmore than a majority of the membership of the Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois asks a good question. Why we \nhave to ask unanimous consent is because even though it is in this \ncalendar, the calendar of business--I could find the page very easily--\nof Wednesday, September 2nd, it is an item of business to be taken up \nby the Senate. Why? Because it has already passed in the House. But we \nhave to ask unanimous consent because the Republican leadership is \nunwilling to schedule it. Even though it has now passed in the House, \neven though there is a majority of Senators who are prepared to support \nit, there is intransigence on the part of our Republican leadership to \nbring this bill up.\n  All we can do is hope that perhaps with some persistence and some \nrepetition asking unanimous consent, or offering the bill as an \namendment, we can take up what should be a normal course of business \ngiven the Senate Calendar.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask one more question. I see my colleague \nfrom the State of Connecticut is up for a question as well. I will make \none last request of the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The argument used most often by the critics of this campaign finance \nreform is an argument often used by the Senator from Kentucky, the \nRepublican Senator who objected to this unanimous consent, which is \nthat to reduce the amount of money being spent on a campaign will \nrestrict free speech in America, will restrict the right of American \ncitizens to express their views by spending their money in a political \ncampaign.\n  Would the Senator from South Dakota address this, because I think it \nis the core issue here. Are we in fact reducing the amount of money at \nthe expense of restricting the constitutional right to free speech? \nThat I think is the crux of this debate, at least the nominal debate \nthat we hear, and I would like the Senator from South Dakota to address \nit.\n  (Mr. STEVENS assumed the Chair.)\n\n[[Page S9823]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think it is a sad commentary that anyone could \nactually subscribe to the proposition that freedom of speech is \ndirectly related to the freedom to spend. The freedom to spend actually \nblocks out the freedom of speech, because if we are spending more and \nthat becomes in essence the cacophony of voices in a campaign, the real \nfreedom of speech--that is, the substantive debate, the opportunity to \nconduct meaningful campaigns on the issues--is drowned out.\n  So that in essence is what is happening. More and more money goes \ninto 30-second attack ads, and less and less real speaking to the \nissues occurs. That in essence is the irony of this whole debate. That \nis the problem we are facing. We are reducing real freedom of speech \nwith this unlimited freedom to spend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from South Dakota in closing, \nbeyond our rhetoric in the Chamber, take a look at the facts, and in \n1996 we had more money spent on campaigns than any time in our history. \nWe had the lowest percentage of eligible voters in American history in \n72 years cast a vote in the Presidential election between President \nClinton and Senator Dole.\n  That is an indication to me that the American people understand what \nthe Senator from South Dakota is saying. They think there is something \nfundamentally flawed with this system and negative advertising, the \nmoney chase that the Senator from South Dakota addresses. If we do \nnothing else before we leave this year, I hope this Senate will address \nthis important issue.\n  I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his leadership.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his good \nquestions. And I yield to the Senator from Connecticut for a question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from South Dakota.\n  If I may, before posing my question, I want to reflect upon an \nexperience I had last year as a member of the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee which held extensive hearings into this subject \nmatter of the 1996 campaign and how it was financed. And I must say as \nI look back to it, the mental image I have of it is being waist deep in \nmuck and fighting our way through it. It was a stunning, mind-altering, \nultimately embarrassing experience, to see what has happened to our \ngreat democracy and the extent to which, at a time when we question the \npublic's trust in government, we have created a system that amounts to \nevasion of law clearly by lawmakers, by all of us in the lawmaking \nclass, by those who are running for office.\n  And why do I say that? What became clear in those hearings, we have \nlaws, we have laws that limit the amount of money that individuals can \ngive to campaigns--$2,000 per individual. We have laws that limit the \namount that a political action committee can give--$10,000 in the whole \ncycle--to a given campaign. We have laws that prohibit corporations and \nunions from contributing to political campaigns. It could not be \nclearer. And then there is created this so-called soft money loophole \nthrough which is driven not a Mack truck, a whole division, a whole \narmy which has obliterated the limits.\n  So we have individuals giving hundreds of thousands of dollars, we \nhave corporations and unions giving millions of dollars, we make a \nmockery of the law, and we have just the effect the Senator from South \nDakota and the Senator from Illinois have just talked about, which is \nquite the opposite of reform here--restricting people's rights.\n  The reality, the place we have come to, the sad place we have come \nto, limits individual rights and, even more underneath that, the \nindividual American's confidence that he or she has the same ability \nroughly as every other American to affect their Government. Why? You \ndon't have to be a rocket scientist or a political scientist to come to \nthe belief that an individual or a group that can give hundreds of \nthousands of dollars has more access to their Government than the \naverage American does.\n\n  I remember that during the debate we had--one of the earlier debates \nwe had on this subject--one of our colleagues brought out a chart, and \nto me it told a lot of the story, and it responds to, I know, some of \nthe conclusions made by Members of the Senate that the public doesn't \nreally care about campaign finance reform. I disagree. When you ask \npeople what problems they are most worried about, campaign finance \nreform is not going to come out on the top of that list, in part \nbecause I think there is a misapprehension. I read a quote last year \nfrom somebody who said, ``Oh, campaign finance reform. Well, I care \nmore about how they spend my tax money than how they raise their \ncampaign money.'' The reality is that how campaign money is raised, as \nwe have seen here and the leader has spoken to quite eloquently--how \ncampaign money is raised affects how their tax money is spent and who \npays taxes.\n  But look, we are leaders. We were elected to do what we think is \nright. We were elected to build confidence in our Government. So \nhopefully we will respond to more than just polls here.\n  The chart that I referred to earlier that one of our colleagues \nbrought out had two lines on it. One showed the trend line of \ncontributions to American political campaigns. The other showed the \ntrend line of the turnout of Americans in voting--startling difference. \nAs the money goes up, the public participation in elections goes down \nbecause people don't think their vote counts anymore.\n  I say to the Senator from South Dakota, as I think about the \nsituation, as I know we got 52 votes for the McCain-Feingold bill here, \nand we were all raised to believe the will of the majority prevails in \nour democracy, it is not so in the Senate apparently. In the House, \nmuch to everybody's surprise--and I must say with some pride, due in \ngood measure to the great leadership given by Congressman Chris Shays \nof Connecticut--the Shays-Meehan bill passed.\n  We have another opportunity to right this wrong. The problem is not \ngoing to go away. Just in the last week, the Attorney General has \ncommenced initial inquiries that relate to campaign finance practices \nin 1996. And I can't believe after all that we have learned, after all \nthat the media has told us, after all that we know--because as the \nSenator from South Dakota has said, it is our lives; we are being \npulled by the money chase away from what should be the focus of our \ninterest, which is the people's business--I can't believe that we are \ngoing to end this 105th session of Congress without doing something to \nreform our campaign finance laws.\n  So my question to the Senator from South Dakota, with thanks for his \npersistent leadership on this serious matter, is--well, two really. \nOne, in the course of the Senator's career, if we are not able to pass \ncampaign finance reform in this session, would the Senator not agree \nthat this is one of the most grievous abdications of this Chamber's \nresponsibility in a long time faced with a real problem? And second, I \nsuppose, does the leader agree that part of what is needed here is for \nthe public to speak to their elected leaders and plead with them, \nparticularly in the Senate, those of our colleagues who can take us \neither to a vote or from 52 to 60 to break the filibuster, that it \nreally matters to them that we adopt campaign finance reform this year?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut for \nhis leadership and tremendous effort that he has put forth to bring us \nto this point.\n  As to his first question, I hadn't raised until now the point that \nthe Senator made so appropriately. I don't know if there are many \nCongresses that have spent more time investigating than this one has. \nThis Congress has probably spent more money and more time investigating \nthan any since the early 1970s. And as the Senator from Connecticut so \nappropriately points out, with all that investigation, there can be no \nquestion about the need for some reform. Obviously, there is a question \nabout the need for enforcement and follow through after enforcement \nwith regard to what may or may not have happened, the allegations, all \nof the information raised in these investigations. But then the \nquestion comes, What do we do about it? And we have been asking that \nquestion ever since the investigations here in the Senate have ended. \nWhat do we do about it?\n\n  How tragic it would be for us to say, ``Look, we have now exposed all \nof\n\n[[Page S9824]]\n\nthese problems but we choose to do nothing. We choose to ignore the \nfact that reform is so critical.'' What does that say to the American \npeople? Look, here are the problems. But, look here, we are not going \nto do anything about them.\n  So, the Senator from Connecticut raises, I think, the essence of what \nit is that we, as Senators, need to confront in our minds, in our \nhearts, about what is important before we close in a mere 6 weeks. We \nhave investigated. We now know without any question, with great \nauthority, there are some serious problems that have to be addressed. \nTo wash our hands of the matter now would be a tragedy of an order that \nI do not think we have seen in this country.\n  As to what those of you who are watching may do, I hope Senators will \nreceive mail and phone calls and comments from every constituent who \nhas any interest in the democratic process, who understands that \nwithout some contact with your Senators there is a real chance they may \nnot change their minds. So, contact is of the essence. I think it ought \nto be done as soon as possible.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I will be happy to yield to the \nSenator from Michigan for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the leader for yielding. I do have a number of \nquestions.\n  First, let me say I think we have never been closer to enacting \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform than we are at this moment. The \nmajority of the Senate favors it. The House, through a very courageous \nact on the part of many of its Members, has overcome the opposition of \nthe House leadership to pass Shays-Meehan.\n  It was said earlier this year that there would be no way of passing \nShays-Meehan against the will of the leadership of the House of \nRepresentatives. But a very stalwart, gutsy coalition of Democrats and \nRepublicans in the House found a way to have the majority rule in the \nHouse of Representatives. It was not easy. It took incredible energy \nand willpower. They exercised it and they prevailed, and the majority \nprevailed over the wishes of the leaders of the House of \nRepresentatives. So, now we are in a situation where the majority of \nthe Senate favors comprehensive reform and the House has passed \ncomprehensive reform.\n  The leader has spoken earlier as to what it is that is stopping us \nfrom trying to get comprehensive reform adopted in the Senate this \nyear. The majority of the public clearly favors it. All public opinion \npolls show it. They are skeptical that we will do anything about it--\nthe polls show that as well--but they favor it. Now we are going to \ncome down, it seems to me, to a test of wills, a great and a historic \ntest of wills in the U.S. Senate. The opponents of campaign finance \nreform have the right to filibuster. They have used that right, and \nthey have the right to filibuster. But the proponents, the supporters \nof campaign finance reform, do not need to withdraw simply because \nthere is a filibuster on the floor. If that were done, we would not \nhave civil rights legislation. The people who supported civil rights \nlegislation did not always have 67 votes going in. You can start with a \nmajority and offer an amendment, or offer a bill, and just because the \nopponents filibuster the bill does not require us, those of us who \nsupport campaign finance reform, to give up our right to offer the \namendment and to have the amendment disposed of by the Senate. And if \nthe filibusterers want to tie up the Senate and prevent the Senate from \nvoting, that is their right. But the supporters of campaign finance \nreform are not obligated to withdraw an amendment simply because the \nopponents use their right to filibuster.\n  That is why what we are now facing, given the opposition to the \nunanimous consent request this morning, is a historic test of wills \nbetween the majority that favors campaign finance reform, a bipartisan \nmajority that now has seven Republicans and all the Democrats, and \nthose who oppose campaign finance reform. We must not withdraw in the \nface of a filibuster. The stakes are too huge. They have been \nilluminated here this morning eloquently by the Democratic leader. The \nstakes are whether we are going to restore public confidence to a \ncampaign finance system which is in tatters. We are supposed to have \nlimits on contributions. It is supposed to be $1,000 per person per \ncampaign. Corporations are not allowed to contribute to campaigns, and \nneither are unions. Yet, we have corporations and unions contributing \nhuge amounts of money which, for all intents and purposes under any \nreasonable interpretation, support or oppose campaigns. That is what is \nnow happening because of the soft money loophole.\n  We have a chance this year, better than we have ever had, to close \nthat soft money loophole and to restore public confidence in the \ncampaign finance system. We have a chance to do it. If we will show the \nsame courage on a bipartisan basis as was shown in the House of \nRepresentatives, down that hall just a few weeks ago, we can pass \ncampaign finance reform in the Senate. But what it will take is a \ndetermination on the part of the supporters not to withdraw our \nmajority view in the face of a filibuster. The filibusterers have their \nrights to tie up the Senate. We have our rights to offer an amendment \nand seek a vote on that amendment. And, in the face of a filibuster, we \nneed not withdraw and give in to a filibuster.\n  My question of the Democratic leader is this: Was it his hope this \nmorning, and intent this morning in offering this unanimous consent \nproposal, that we have a course of action which would allow the Senate \nto work its will, to permit amendments to Shays-Meehan providing they \nare relevant? As I read the unanimous consent request and heard the \nunanimous consent proposal, relevant amendments would be in order. Was \nit the Democratic leader's proposal this morning that we have an \nopportunity to resolve this issue in a way which would allow us to do \nall of our other business and to avoid the kind of filibuster which we \nnow very clearly see is going to be forthcoming from the objection to \nthis unanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will respond to the Senator from Michigan. Before I \ndo, let me say I wish the entire Chamber had heard what he has just \nsaid with regard to what it is we are trying to do and what the \nimplications of this really are. I don't know of anybody in the Senate \nwho has put more force, personally, and more of his own personal \ncredibility, behind this issue than has the Senator from Michigan. I \nappreciate deeply his commitment.\n  The Senator poses a very understandable question. What is it we are \nasking here? What do we want? We simply want the opportunity to reflect \nthe will of the majority of the Senate on an issue for which there is a \nmoment of opportunity, from a historical perspective. This is our \nmoment. If we fail in the next 6 weeks, we start all over with a new \nCongress, with all of the odds stacked as much against us, if not more, \nthan they were this Congress. So what we are saying is let's seize the \nopportunity, let's seize the moment here and do what the House has \nalready done. On a bipartisan basis, let's work with Republicans and \nDemocrats to pass the Shays-Meehan bill. We will take it in any shape \nor form we can. I offered, as I know the Senator from Michigan heard, \nto simply take up the bill that was passed in the House and, on a 1-\nhour, one-vote basis, let's move it on to the President.\n  Obviously, I recognize the complexity of this legislation. I would be \nmore than happy, as the request suggests, to consider entertaining \nrelevant amendments because there are differences of opinion. Just \nyesterday, we argued for the need for relevant amendments to the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. So we are consistent in our request here. \nLet's have relevant amendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Let's \nhave relevant amendments on campaign finance reform, if the minority \nchooses--the minority in this case being those who oppose campaign \nreform--to have them. So we are not asking for much. We are simply \nsaying let's seize the moment, as the Senator from Michigan so \nappropriately described, and let's get on with doing what we were \nelected to do before it is too late.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the leader for his leadership and for his \ncomments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Michigan. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9825]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9819-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9825-S9834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Texas \nhas patiently been waiting to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to \namendment No. 3500 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself and \n     Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered 3526 to \n     amendment No. 3500.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Add the following proviso: (5) North Korea is not providing \n     ballistic missiles or ballistic missile technology to a \n     country the government of which the Secretary of State has \n     determined is a terrorist government for the purposes of \n     section 40(d) of the Arms Export Control Act or any other \n     comparable provision of law.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will speak briefly about what \nSenator McCain and I are trying to do.\n  My amendment says that no funds will be contributed to North Korea \nuntil the President has certified that North Korea is not providing \nballistic missiles or ballistic missile technology to a country, the \ngovernment of which the Secretary of State has determined is a \nterrorist government.\n  This adds to Senator McCain's amendment which has the same \nprohibition of funding for North Korea if they are continuing to build \na nuclear weapon.\n  Senator McCain and I are clearly saying that the United States will \nnot continue to fund an agreement with North Korea that we know is \nbeing violated. The McCain amendment deals with the nuclear capability \nNorth Korea appears to be building. It would restrict the use of funds \nfor the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization pending a \nPresidential certification that North Korea has stopped its nuclear \nweapons program as it has promised to do. My amendment adds the \nrequirement that North Korea is not transferring ballistic missile \ntechnology to other terrorist countries.\n  Mr. President, this week, we saw what trying to coerce and reward a \ntotalitarian dictatorship will achieve. North Korea launched a two-\nstage ballistic missile toward Japan, a country which has provided \nemergency food relief to North Korea and wound up having a ballistic \nmissile pass through their air space as thanks.\n  North Korea has admitted selling ballistic missiles to raise hard \ncurrency. It has made repeated threats to restart its nuclear program, \nclaiming that the United States has not honored its obligations. \nRecently we learned of evidence that the North Koreans are ignoring \ntheir part of the agreement and building a new underground site for \nnuclear weapons development.\n  I raised concerns 4 years ago when the Clinton administration \nproposed this framework agreement. It seemed to be an all-carrot-no-\nstick approach to North Korea. The agreement was to help develop a \npeaceful nuclear program giving them 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil. I \nwas concerned that the nuclear weapons program would continue and that \nthe fuel oil that we promised would be diverted to military use. I am \nsorry to say both seem to have occurred. The fuel was diverted almost \nimmediately for military use.\n  Since signing the agreement, the North Koreans have also continued to \nconduct military operations against South Korea, sending spy submarines \ninto South Korean waters and discharging commandos on to South Korean \nterritory. This is hardly the behavior of a partner to an agreement, \nand sending them a no-strings gift of 35 million American taxpayer \ndollars is hardly a responsible act for the U.S. Congress to make.\n  The North Korean launch this week of the ballistic missile over the \nairspace of Japan was truly a shot across the bow of the civilized \nworld. North Korea was warned beforehand that testing this type of \nmissile would have a direct impact on our negotiations. They ignored \nthe warning. We must make it clear to the North Koreans that we cannot \nand will not disconnect North Korean conventional military activity \nfrom the nuclear issue. Their failure to meet their obligations not to \nbuild nuclear weapons, nor to sell the technology to rogue nations, \ncannot be disassociated from our contribution to their country. We must \nstop rewarding dangerous North Korean provocations. This amendment will \nensure that we do just that.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the second-degree amendment to the \nMcCain amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I support the amendment by Senator \nHutchison modifying the bill's language on funding for the Korean \nEnergy Development Organization, which we refer to as KEDO.\n  I would like to step back for a moment to 1995, shortly after the \nagreed framework was signed in October of 1994. By March of 1995, there \nwas the first evidence that the North Koreans were cheating. In \nhearings before this subcommittee and in writing, I challenged the \nadministration's assertions that the North was in full compliance and \nthat no U.S. oil was being diverted. Eventually, it became clear that \nthe North was cheating and diverting oil. Although new monitoring \nprocedures were established, there was no suspension of oil or a threat \nto cut off the program. I am convinced that this is when the North \nlearned that they could engage in a pattern of challenge, deception and \nnoncompliance without any penalty at all.\n  In fiscal year 1997, the Senate had an extensive debate about \nproviding U.S. assistance to provide fuel oil to North Korea and to \nsupport administrative expenses for KEDO. The bill my subcommittee \nreported to the Senate capped funds at $13 million, half the \nadministration's request, and provided the funds in three stages, \nrequiring certification that the fuel was not--I repeat, not--being \ndiverted for military purposes.\n  At that time, many of us were uncomfortable continuing any aid to \nthis\n\n[[Page S9826]]\n\nterrorist regime, let alone doubling the amount available which the \nadministration had requested. In its statement of policy, this is what \nthe administration had to say at that time about any curbs, cuts or \nconditions:\n\n       Among our most serious concerns are the restrictions placed \n     on the U.S. contributions to KEDO, especially the funding cap \n     that reduces the request by nearly half. This funding is \n     inadequate to meet our commitment to support the North Korea \n     framework agreement and is unacceptable to the Secretaries of \n     State and Defense. KEDO is one of the pillars of U.S. \n     nonproliferation policy which seeks to ensure strategic \n     stability in the Pacific. Our very modest $25 million request \n     for funds helps continue the reduction of North Korea's \n     nuclear weapons capacity, while leveraging strong \n     burdensharing contributions from South Korea, Japan and other \n     countries. The administration strongly urges the committee to \n     remove the cap . . . and drop the needlessly restrictive \n     certification language.\n\n  Again, that is what they had to say.\n  Regrettably, the administration prevailed on this floor in a 73-to-27 \nvote allowing full funding for KEDO. So I lost that one, I say to my \nfriend from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I think it is now safe to say that on both the \nnonproliferation and burden-sharing front, KEDO is a bust.\n  All last week, the administration was too busy with bilateral talks \nin New York to brief the committee on the status of negotiations over \nallegations disclosed in the press that the North is building a secret \nfacility to house a nuclear reactor replacing the one sealed under the \nAgreed Framework.\n  With those talks still underway, as the Senator from Texas pointed \nout, Monday--this week--for the first time in more than 5 years, North \nKorea carried out a flight test of a ballistic missile which the South \nKorean Government estimates has a range of over 1,200 miles. The first \nstage of the missile landed in waters between Russia and Japan, with \nthe second stage flying over Japanese territory and falling into the \nPacific. Understandably, the Japanese have withdrawn their pledge of \nbillions of dollars for the construction of an alternative reactor--a \nperfectly logical response to what happened Monday.\n  Mr. President, if U.S. funding for KEDO is the pillar of our \nnonproliferation policy and the key to burden sharing, I think it is \ntime we start building a new foundation for our policy. Secret nuclear \nfacilities, flight testing, ballistic missiles, and who knows what \nother activities are not a nonproliferation policy, they are simply a \nnonpolicy.\n  Today, I say to the Senator from Texas, I think her amendment is \nexcellent and is exactly the direction in which we should go. The \nadministration will complain that these new conditions are not \nconsistent with the Agreed Framework, that the North did not agree to \nsuspend its nuclear weapons program in return for $30 million, they \nonly agreed to freeze part of it.\n  Mr. President, it makes no sense for the United States to continue to \npay for an agreement which fails to protect our allies and our \ninterests in the Pacific. Monday's tests, along with the past pattern \nof deception and diversion, should convince all of us we should not \nspend millions more from our limited foreign aid coffers to prop up a \ngovernment determined to acquire and to sell nuclear weapons.\n  As I mentioned previously, this is hardly the first time we have \ndebated the administration's flawed policy on the peninsula. We have \nhad years of compromise, capitulation, and concessions from the \nadministration. The North blusters and blackmails; there is tough talk \nfollowed by no action or, worse still, concessions for more fuel and \nfood.\n  Thirty-six thousand American troops standing guard in the South \ndeserve more than that. Once and for all, it should be absolutely clear \nto the North, we will not pay their way to test, deploy, or sell \nnuclear weapons. We will not pay for the appearance or possibility of \ncompliance with the Agreed Framework.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Texas. I think her amendment is \nright on the mark and I congratulate her for it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to thank the Senator from Kentucky, who is a \ncosponsor of this second-degree amendment, for helping us with it \nbecause obviously, when the committee was putting together its bill, we \ndid not know of North Korea's provocative actions of last week.\n  I think it is imperative that the Senate act very decisively to say \nthat we are not going to continue to appease a country that is clearly \nselling technology to rogue nations that would harm our own allies and, \nfurthermore, is breaking an agreement they made with us in return for \nwhich we would have assisted the people of North Korea in developing \npeaceful energy sources.\n  I hope, with all my heart, that North Korea will back up, that it \nwill keep its commitment to stop building a nuclear weapon. I hope that \nit will step back and stop selling ballistic missile technology to \nrogue nations. Then it would be eligible for the money that has been \nfenced in this bill.\n  But until they do, it would be highly irresponsible for the U.S. \nSenate to go forward with a no-strings-attached gift of 35 million \ntaxpayer dollars that are against the interests of the United States \nand all of our allies.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank again the Senator from Texas \nand ask unanimous consent that her amendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona is here. We have a time agreement on \nhis amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3522\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3522. I inquire of \nthe Chair as to what the time agreement is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The time limit is \n40 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the Senate passed the supplemental appropriations bill \nlast March. Included in that bill was a provision to provide $18 \nbillion in additional budget authority for the International Monetary \nFund. That funding, as we all know, was eventually stripped out of the \nsupplemental conference report because Members could not come to an \nagreement on the funding or on reforms for the IMF.\n  Today, of course, we are back debating the foreign operations bill. \nObviously, we are trying to develop some kind of consensus in going \nforward for the funding of the IMF. Unfortunately, in my view, this \nbill that we are debating right now does not go far enough to move the \nIMF toward reform, including in the areas of transparency and \nbankruptcy reform. It includes conditions much less restrictive than \nthose voted out of the Appropriations Committee earlier this year.\n  I support the restrictions that were developed by the Appropriations \nCommittee. As a result, I am offering this amendment today which, while \nnot going as far as I would like, would move the IMF closer to reform \nthan the current provisions of the fiscal year 1999 foreign operations \nbill will do.\n  As I said, when the Senate debated IMF reform in March, the full \nSenate Appropriations Committee approved, by a vote of 26-2, a series \nof reforms affecting IMF funding. They were not as strong as some of us \nwould have liked. But instead of strengthening the provisions on the \nSenate floor, an amendment was offered to weaken them, and that \namendment passed 84-16.\n  Those of us who voted against the weakening amendment in March are \nhere today again to request that the Senate vote for this amendment and \nrequire the IMF and its recipients to use the $18 billion in U.S. \ntaxpayer-contributed funds in more open and responsible ways.\n  The Kyl amendment changes only one of the reform sections included in \nthe foreign operations bill. It does not prevent the United States from \nreleasing funding to the IMF. The current IMF language requires the G-7 \nnations to publicly agree to seek policies that provide for new \nconditions. But seeking policies is not the same as requiring policies.\n  So my provision simply returns to the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee-passed language and states that:\n\n\n[[Page S9827]]\n\n\n       None of the funds appropriated in this Act under the \n     heading ``United States Quota, International Monetary Fund'' \n     may be obligated, transferred or made available to the \n     International Monetary Fund until 30 days after the Secretary \n     of the Treasury certifies that the Board of Executive \n     Directors of the Fund have agreed by resolution that stand-by \n     agreements or other arrangements regarding the use of Fund \n     resources shall include provisions requiring the borrower [to \n     agree to a set of conditions].\n\n  Passing an amendment that requires a commitment from the board of \ndirectors of the Fund to pass such a resolution makes more sense than \njust asking for a public commitment to such reforms. The IMF, by its \nnature, is often the antithesis of free market reform. IMF intervention \noften rewards negligent bankers or corrupt or incompetent governments \nand often does not reward individual countries that work through the \nprivate sector to get through tough times.\n  So my amendment, which does not cut off funding for the IMF, would \nnevertheless return to a stricter version of reforms than is currently \nincluded in this bill. There is a case that some have made that IMF \nfunding should be eliminated altogether. I will not try to make that \ncase today, although people like Lawrence Lindsay and Allan Metzer of \nAEI, for example, have made a strong argument that much of the money we \nhave contributed to the IMF has been wasted. It is true that no money \nhas been lost yet, although Lindsay suggests that the IMF is like the \nFDIC in the late 1970s or early 1980s. At that time, the taxpayers had \nnot lost any money in the FDIC either.\n  If the world is ready to topple into an economic abyss, there \nprobably is not much the IMF could do about it in any event. Its $23 \nbillion in lending in 1997 was about a tenth of the private capital \nflow into developing countries alone. And in any event, there is \nevidence that suggests that the IMF has actually been a barrier to \neconomic growth in poorer countries.\n  According to Johns Hopkins University economist Steve Hanke, few \nnations actually graduate from IMF emergency loans. Many stay on the \ndole for years on end. One study found of 137 mostly developing \ncountries from 1965 to 1995, less than a third graduated from IMF loan \nprograms. The Heritage Foundation found that of IMF borrowers from 1965 \nto 1995, no more than half were better off than when they started the \nloan programs. Almost all were actually poorer. Almost all were deeper \nin debt.\n  So what we are trying to do with this amendment is to restore some of \nthe conditions that will ensure that the money American taxpayers have \nworked hard to earn will actually serve a useful and productive purpose \nif contributed to the IMF.\n  Clearly, the policies promoted by the IMF are important. Whether debt \nincurred by other nations as a result of IMF intervention is good or \nbad depends on the uses to which that debt is put. If it increases \nproductive capital, income increases and the debt can be serviced from \nthe increased wealth that is generated. If, however, borrowing is used \nto hold the exchange rate steady so private lenders can flee, there are \nno productive assets from which later interest payments can be made.\n  Unfortunately, it is the latter type of policies that are typically \npromoted by the IMF. The IMF promotes trade barriers in order to cut \ncurrent account deficits. The IMF promotes tax increases to reduce \nbudget deficits, and currency devaluations to adjust exchange rates. \nThe IMF long ago admitted it was not committed to free markets, \nexplaining that ``programs have accommodated such nonmarket devices as \nproduction controls, administered prices, and subsidies.'' These are \nthe kind of policies that often bring economies to a halt.\n  The better policy is to promote fair and reliable bankruptcy laws, \ntransparent and internationally accepted accounting procedures, minimal \ngovernment interference in the allocation of credit, prudent oversight \nof banking systems, and competition among foreign and domestic banking \norganizations. All of these are the kind of reforms that we all agree \nshould be pursued.\n  But that is as far as the foreign operations bill before us goes. \nBasically, it just says this is what we ought to be doing. It does not \nrequire the implementation of these reforms in the countries that are \ngoing to receive the IMF loans. As a result, it does nothing to assure \nthat that money will not be wasted. By contrast, my amendment would \nensure that reforms are accomplished before taxpayer dollars are \nallocated.\n  Why is it important to ensure that reform is accomplished first? In \nsome cases, IMF programs have effectively subsidized very inefficient \nand even corrupt political systems. Former Secretary of State George \nShultz suggested in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee \nearlier this year that creditors must be held accountable for their \nmistakes. Taxpayers should not assume the risk of bad decisions or \nthose bad decisions will continue to be made.\n  That is the sad record, unfortunately, of many of the countries that \nhave received these IMF loans in the past.\n  Bailouts effectively shield investors and politicians from the \nconsequences of their poor economic decisions by ``socializing'' the \nrisks and reducing the cost to failure associated with investment. \nRisks are socialized because everyone ends up paying for an individual \ninvestors' errors; the costs of failure are reduced because either \ndirectly or indirectly the IMF can compensate investors when their \ninvestments fail. IMF bailouts, as they are currently constructed, \nencourage investors to engage in activity they would likely avoid if \nthere were no IMF to shield them from actions. Investors, not people or \ncountries, are being bailed out. We should understand that when we talk \nabout bailing out a country, that is really inaccurate. We are talking \nabout bailing out investors. In the so-called Mexican bailout in 1995, \nthe Mexican people suffered a sharp decline in the standard of living \nthere, and there were large increases in unemployment and an overnight \nerosion of the savings. Investors, however, escaped with minimal \nlosses.\n  Lawrence Lindsay contends IMF bailouts probably make systematic \ncontagion more likely in the long run and suggests that the best \nprotection we have against bankers overextending themselves to \nimprudent borrowers is the bankers' fear of losing money.\n  The amendment I am presenting today is an effort to ensure that these \npoor lending practices are not continuing. Virtually all of us have \nagreed that the IMF needs reform. In fact, we put that reform in the \namendment that was adopted earlier this year to the supplemental \nappropriations bill. But that amendment rejected the Senate \nappropriations decision, which was made on a 26-2 vote, to have really \nmeaningful reforms required--not simply pursued. That is the \ndifference--do you try to pursue it or do you guarantee it before you \ngive this taxpayer money.\n  Let me close with the final thought about what is not at issue \nbecause of our very real concern about the state of the Russian economy \nnow. All of the experts agree that assistance to Russia will only work \nif Russia makes fundamental reforms, the kind of things that would be \nrequired under my amendment.\n  For example, the President in Moscow yesterday urged the Russians--\nquoting from a Washington Times story of today--to follow free market \nprinciples.\n\n  Here is what the President said:\n\n       Investors move in the direction of openness, fairness and \n     freedom . . . you have to play by the rules.\n\n  That is precisely what would be required by my amendment.\n  The President said he would not give ``any fresh money unless it \nmoves decisively toward reform.''\n  The article points out that IMF detractors are not proposing to \nwithdraw money that has already been committed. I want to make that \npoint crystal clear. We are not talking about not loaning money to the \nRussians, money that has already been committed. We are saying the same \nthing the President of the United States is telling them: You have to \nmake a commitment to the fundamental reforms, otherwise the money is \nwasted and we both lose.\n  Mr. President, the same thing could be said of other countries in the \nworld. These countries are not going to be denied loans if they \nestablish the kind of rules of law required for a functioning\n\n[[Page S9828]]\n\neconomy. If they don't, all the money in the world will not help them \nanyway. That is true for Russia, as well as it is for the other \ncountries that might be receiving IMF loans.\n  In conclusion, my amendment simply restores the original committee \nlanguage setting forth reasonable conditions for IMF loans. If we are \nunwilling to do this, then some will suggest that we are simply \ncommitting $18 billion in taxpayer funds to feel good about having done \nsomething to help countries having economic difficulties. Let's ensure \nthat in approving our contributions to the IMF, that that money will be \neffectively spent.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, who controls time on the Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Kyl is in charge of 20 minutes. Do you \nrise in opposition or in support?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Maybe it was not clear in the unanimous consent \nagreement, but it was my understanding that Senator Hagel would control \nthe time in opposition to the amendment.\n  If not, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel control the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized in opposition.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield myself such time that I will need \nto complete my statement.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of my friend, \nSenator Kyl. Six months ago this body spoke very clearly and strongly \non IMF. We voted 84-16 to approve a strong IMF package that has two \nparts: Strong and achievable IMF reforms and the full $17.9 billion \nfunding for America's IMF contribution.\n  The IMF reform and funding language in the foreign operations bill \ntoday is identical to the reform package of the Senate-passed bill 6 \nmonths ago. We should not now start second-guessing ourselves and \nundoing what we have done. We should stand by the solid reforms and the \nfunding package that won 84 votes in March.\n  The Kyl amendment would replace that carefully crafted language with \na different and untested mechanism for reform, a mechanism that we \nconsidered but abandoned on the Senate floor early in our negotiation 6 \nmonths ago. I might add, Mr. President, this was after very long and \ndetailed consultations with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan \nGreenspan, the Treasury Secretary, Bob Rubin, and many others.\n  Along with Senator McConnell, Appropriations Chairman Stevens, \nSenator Gramm, Senator Biden and others, I helped craft the reforms \nthat passed the Senate. We negotiated the reforms carefully, with the \ninvolvement of many Senators. It took weeks, many weeks. We worked word \nby word, line by line to present something to this body that was \nachievable, workable. The package we passed in March and includes \nmeaningful IMF reforms that are also achievable.\n  We recognize that America alone cannot shape the world economy. So we \nrequired in our reform language the G-7 countries to come together to \nhelp reform the IMF. These reforms consist of the following: Reforms so \nIMF will require recipient countries to live up to their international \ntrade obligations; reform so IMF will require recipient countries to \neliminate crony capitalism and clean up corruption; reforms that will \nimprove transparency of IMF operations, and to encourage bankruptcy law \nreforms in recipient countries.\n  Mr. President, these are not funny reforms. These are not patsy, weak \nreforms. The new IMF funding will go forward, but not until the \nTreasury Department succeeds in getting these reforms accomplished at \nthe IMF. This is written into the reform legislation. These reforms are \nreal and they will make a real difference at the IMF.\n  It would be absolutely irresponsible for Congress to shrug off the \nIMF as economies around the globe falter. We should not go backwards. \nAmerica must continue to lead. The Senate must continue to lead. Global \nevents, such as we have talked about today, yesterday, and will \ncontinue to talk about, have demonstrated even more forcefully the need \nfor the U.S. to support the IMF.\n  Mr. President, the IMF is not perfect. It is not without flaws. It \nneeds reform; indeed it needs reform. But, my goodness, at a time when \nwe have economic chaos around the globe, we need many confidence \nbuilders, and the IMF institution in itself will not change this, but \nit will help. If we didn't have an IMF, what would we have? Would the \nUnited States want to step up to this alone? Would France or Germany? \nThe second largest economy in the world--Japan--is in economic chaos, \nwith no banking structure. We need some type of a mechanism to help \naddress these issues. Asia was burning when the Senate acted 6 months \nago. Now that fire has engulfed Russia and is spreading to Latin \nAmerica. Our own economy is feeling this heat.\n  Mr. President, markets respond to confidence. Markets respond to \nconfidence. Our debates today about IMF and other economic issues are \nnot just about numbers, or about the arcane comparisons of one reform \nversus another reform. No, these debates are real and they are about \nsending a signal around the world. Is America engaged? Will we continue \nto lead? Or will America pull back? America's interests require us to \nhelp shore up confidence around the world.\n  This debate is about America's interests. This is not esoteric. This \nis about America's interests, America's economic stability and global \nstability. The U.S. suffered a record trade deficit in May, the fourth \nconsecutive month. Exports hit their lowest point in 15 months. Over \nthe first 5 months of this year, America's trade deficit increased \nnearly 40 percent from the same period last year. Why is that? Many \nparts of America's economy are already feeling the pain of the \nspreading Asian ``flu.'' Wall Street is on a roller coaster ride. The \nfarm economy is suffering, largely due to the loss of overseas markets. \nCorn and soybean exports are down more than 50 percent from 2 years \nago. Wheat exports are down more than 30 percent.\n  These economic problems will not be limited to American farmers and \nranchers, and not even to America's investors. They will ripple through \nthe economies of the Midwest and the rest of this Nation. Events around \nthe world will continue to affect our economy here at home and global \nstability. When you have global instability, Mr. President, it goes far \nbeyond economic instability. Global instability affects everything--our \nnational defense, our interests and our economy. The situation in Japan \nis very dangerous. Many economies in Asia are clinging to Japan for \nsupport. Japan was a direct contributor to the financial package to \nRussia. I don't think I need to spell out to colleagues the disastrous \neffect of a significant downturn in the Japanese economy. Let me point \nout a headline from today's Washington Times: ``Tokyo's Troubles \nOvershadow Russia's: With Bad Economic Decisions, Japan Could Start a \nWorldwide Recession.''\n  This is not the time to lose our perspective and diddle and dawdle--\nreform versus technicality and reform versus technicality. This is the \ntime for America to do the right thing, to step up and lead the world, \nhelp the IMF and insert the reforms that we passed by 84 votes last \nMarch.\n  I want to close, Mr. President, by quoting the last paragraph of a \nletter from the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Bob Rubin, which he sent to \nthe congressional leadership yesterday. He talks about the IMF. He \ntalks about how broadly the IMF plays a role across the global economic \nscene:\n\n       More broadly, a fully equipped IMF is in the economic \n     interest of our important trading partners throughout the \n     world. While we agree that the IMF needs reform, and are \n     committed to continuing our strong efforts to achieve \n     meaningful change, it remains an effective and indispensable \n     tool in the management of the international economy. I \n     respectfully urge you and your colleagues to act with the \n     utmost dispatch to pass this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate should stand by the leadership that we \nprovided on this issue in March. I respectfully suggest that my \ncolleagues look at this Kyl amendment and defeat this Kyl amendment. \nMr. President, I end by saying that when the time on the debate on this \nissue expires, I intend to make a motion to table the Kyl amendment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S9829]]\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair. I came, as a matter of fact, to read \nthe letter he has just read. So I will just be very brief.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, very clearly, this is a matter of the \nimage of the United States in the total global economics of today. If \nwe retreat from the vote that we achieved last spring, I think we will \nsend a terrible message to the world at a time when we should be viewed \nas a leader in trying to restore the economies of the world.\n  So I hope this Senate will vote once again to support, providing the \nadditional funding for the IMF that it needs, and that we will insist \nthat we achieve the agreement of the House on this provision that is in \nthe bill.\n  This is not the time for us to change our minds. This is a time to \nshow the strong will of the Senate, that the United States remains \nclear in its objectives to assure that there are mechanisms to deal \nwith international crises such as so many of our global trading \npartners face today.\n  I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his leadership. As a matter of \nfact, I thank all of those who come from the Agriculture Committee; \nthey have been very forthright and direct in supporting the proper \nposition on the IMF. I thank the Chair and the Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: As the 105th Congress returns to complete \n     its business in the few weeks remaining before adjournment, I \n     am writing to urge once again that Congress immediately \n     consider and pass the Administration's request for $18 \n     billion in critical funding for the International Monetary \n     Fund (IMF).\n       Since late last year, we have been urging action on this \n     priority legislation. Events over the last eight months--not \n     to mention the last few days and weeks--underscore the impact \n     on the U.S. economy of developments abroad, including in Asia \n     and Russia. We simply cannot afford any further delay in \n     providing the IMF with the resources it requires to help \n     contain the threat of further financial and political \n     instability around the world.\n       Let me be clear, the fundamentals of the American economy \n     remain sound, with continuing good prospects for strong \n     growth with low inflation, but recent developments testify \n     clearly to the impact of global uncertainty on U.S. financial \n     markets and, ultimately, on our economy. While there has been \n     progress in stabilizing economies in countries such as Korea \n     and Thailand, which are implementing strong IMF programs, we \n     have already seen a decline in US exports to key markets in \n     Asia by over 20 percent through June of this year, amounting \n     to over $22 billion worth of exports to key markets in Asia \n     by over 20 percent through June of this year, amounting to \n     over $22 billion worth of exports on an annualized basis.\n       Against this backdrop, it is critical that the United \n     States takes the steps necessary to protect the interests of \n     American workers, businesses, and farmers. More broadly, a \n     fully equipped IMF is in the economic interest of our \n     important trade partners throughout Latin America. While we \n     agree that the IMF needs reform, and are committed to \n     continuing our strong efforts to achieve meaningful change, \n     it remains an effective and indispensable tool in the \n     management of the international economy. I respectfully urge \n     you and your colleagues to act with the utmost dispatch to \n     pass this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I inquire how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 9 minutes. The \nSenator from Nebraska has 9 minutes 3 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you. I doubt that we have to take the full amount of \ntime in completing this debate. I want to make one critical point. The \nSenator from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has \njust made the point that the United States cannot retreat from our \ninternational obligations or we will be sending a terrible message. I \nwant to make it very clear that the Kyl amendment doesn't retreat at \nall. In fact, it moves forward.\n  The Kyl amendment simply institutes the language that the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee supported when the committee voted 21-1 to \nensure that the money lent by the United States would be effectively \nspent by requiring some conditions that will work.\n  Now, what the bill before us does is erase those conditions and put \nin some good-sounding language that isn't going to do the trick. As a \nmatter of fact, both the lead editorial in the Wall Street Journal \ntoday, and a lead op-ed piece by David Malpass, the chief international \neconomist at Bear Stearns, make the point that this money will not be \nspent effectively if we continue to follow current practices. As a \nmatter of fact, from the latter op-ed piece, ``To avoid accountability, \nthe U.S. maintains the facade that the IMF is dealing with the crisis \nand that Japan is to blame for much of it.''\n  Are we really going to do something about this crisis? I totally \nagree with my friend from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, on the nature of the \nproblem, and I believe that we essentially agree on the solution.\n  The only difference is how serious we are about implementing the \nsolution. Here is the crux of the debate. Under the bill before us, \nthere are two key phrases about how we are going to implement the \nfunding, how we are going to spend the money and implement the reforms \nthat we all agree to.\n  One, we are going to seek to implement these reforms--the language is \non line 2 of page 120: ``and will seek to implement.'' And then down on \nline 19, ``The United States shall exert its influence with the Fund \nand its members to encourage'' these reforms. We are going to ``seek'' \nand we are going to try to ``encourage.''\n  That is not going to work. It is the same old thing.\n  What the Appropriations Committee voted 26 to 2 to do was to actually \ninclude the reforms. The language in my amendment says ``shall \ninclude.''\n  Those are the two operative phrases. That is the difference we are \ndebating about the reforms we all agree to. The question is, Are we \ngoing to encourage these other countries that we lend the money to, to \neffect the reforms, or are we going to require that they shall be \nincluded in the agreement that we enter into with these countries?\n  All of us agree about the nature of the problem. We are all just as \ncommitted to an international economy. We all agree on the solution--\nthe bankruptcy reforms, the transparency. There is no disagreement \nabout that. The only disagreement is, are we going to require it--the \nKyl amendment that the Appropriations Committee voted 26 to 2 to do--or \nare we going to seek to encourage people to do these things?\n  I submit that if all we are going to do is seek to encourage, we are \ngoing to end up in the same place as we have been, with countries \nspiraling downward and downward and downward.\n  The President of the United States had it right when he said in \nRussia yesterday, to get your fair share of investment, you have to \nplay by the rules. If that is his opinion--and I know it is, and I \nagree with it--``have to play by the rules'' is a requirement. It is \nnot something we are just asking them to do; it is something we are \ngoing to require them to do. It is our money we are lending to them for \nthe good of us all. U.S. taxpayers have some right to insist that it is \ngoing to be spent wisely. We all agree that it hasn't worked in the \npast. The President is saying to the Russians: What you have been doing \nhas not worked. You have to play by the rules.\n  The Kyl amendment says that the agreements shall require that the \nreforms be included. The current bill says we will seek to implement \nand will exert our influence to encourage.\n  On the one hand, you have a requirement; on the other hand, you have \nthe same loose language that will allow these countries to continue to \nslide into economic despair because they don't have the courage or the \nability to adopt the reforms, and they are not being required to do so \nby the Fund that is lending them the money.\n  That is why I urge the adoption of the original committee language \nwhich will be much stronger and will guarantee that this money will be \nspent wisely.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S9830]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask my friend if he would be willing--does he have any \ntime to yield?\n  Mr. HAGEL. We have 9 minutes. I would be very happy to yield time. \nHow much time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I didn't want to take all that time. Will the Senator \nyield me 4 minutes?\n  Mr. HAGEL. All right. Thank you. I yield the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senate has already spoken on the \nimportant question of U.S. support for a stronger International \nMonetary Fund.\n  Following the essential leadership of Senator Stevens, along with my \ncolleague on the foreign relations committee, Senator Hagel, we went on \nrecord in March, by vote of 84 to 16, to provide full funding for U.S. \nparticipation in the IMF.\n  At that time, we also declined to place unworkable conditions on that \nfunding.\n  As international lender of last resort, the IMF is right now part of \nour last line of defense against an economic chain reaction that could \nturn the financial turmoil on the front pages of today's newspapers \ninto a real global crisis.\n  Mr. President, as I have said before, the IMF is certainly not a \nperfect institution. But I have not stopped going to my doctor because \nI think the health care system needs reform.\n  The Kyl amendment guarantees indefinite delay in the availability of \nthe U.S. contribution to the basic reserves of the IMF, and in turn \nthrows into doubt the participation of other nations who look to us for \nleadership.\n  This amendment would require that the IMF change its basic rules for \nproviding emergency financial support--essentially a change in its \nbylaws--before the U.S. contribution can go forward.\n  Those rule changes themselves may well make sense--in fact, the IMF \nalready makes such conditions part of the requirements for its loans.\n  But the requirement that the IMF must first formally adopt reforms in \nthe conditions on countries that receive its funds--conditions, I might \nadd, that we here in the United States could not meet in every case \noutselves--is a formula for deadlock and indefinite delay.\n  This is the opposite what is required of us at this crucial period.\n  As the leading economy in the world, we have a special obligation to \nsupport this international instutution--that we created, I might add--\ncharged with maintaining stability in international financial markets.\n  The amendment now before us is a formula for delay, at the very time \nwhen we must act to restore confidence so lacking those markets.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. President, one of the most able Senators in terms of his \nwillingness to reason on this floor is the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator Kyl.\n  I listened to what he just said about his amendment. He says: Look, \nall we are doing is going to require the IMF to do what the President \nsays they should have to do anyway before we lend money. By \nimplication, don't throw good money after bad, and so on and so forth.\n  What we are doing here is, if we adopt the Kyl amendment, it \nguarantees, in my view, an indefinite delay in the ability of the U.S. \ncontribution to the basic reserve of the IMF and throws in doubt the \nparticipation of other nations who look to us for leadership. Right now \nit is a really simple deal. If we come up with our $18 billion \ncommitment in total, roughly, what happens is, we control the outcome. \nNo loan can be made. It needs an 85 percent vote. I think we have 18 \npercent control.\n  Why go ahead and throw sand in the gears here now knowing that we are \ngoing to, by fiat, in the minds of other nations, amend the way in \nwhich the IMF runs now without consultation or agreement by the other \nparticipants who make up 82 percent of the Fund, guaranteeing that this \nthing comes to a screeching halt?\n  If in fact the Senator believes the President is right, then he has \nto assume the President is not going to instruct the U.S. \nrepresentative at the IMF to vote for releasing dollars without the \ncommitments being met. But what you do now if you adopt the Kyl \namendment is as good as not coming up with the $18 billion, because the \nother nations say: Hey, look, you once again are unilaterally changing \nthe basic rule for providing emergency support, essentially a change in \nthe bylaws of the IMF. Where I come from, that is not how you usually \nget cooperation. You don't unilaterally tell the French and the Brits \nand everyone else this is the way it is going to be. You already have \nthat power. You have the power. Without the U.S. vote, nothing goes. \nBingo. Nothing goes.\n  It seems to me the way to do this is, let's deal, as my friend from \nNebraska has been often the lone voice in pointing out with this \ninternational financial crisis, and still have a little bit of \nconfidence. This isn't going to fix the thing. This is just going to do \nin a shot--like a shot of adrenaline, a shot of confidence, we are \nstepping up to the plate. We are not backing away from an international \nobligation, as we see it, for our own safety's sake.\n  Then, if we want to sit down with our partners in the IMF and say, \n``Look, it is time to change the bylaws,'' that is a different deal. \nBut let's not do unilaterally what is going to, in my view, in my \nopinion, get a response from the other 82 percent of the voting block \nout there saying, ``Hey, U.S., you don't call it. You don't \nunilaterally change the rules.'' You can in effect unilaterally change \nthe rules by voting no. You can sit in those meetings and say, ``Look, \nwe ain't voting for this deal unless the following conditions are \nmet.''\n  I respectfully suggest--and I realize my time is probably up--that we \nshould oppose the Kyl amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Minnesota 1\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \n1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise to respectively oppose the amendment by my \ncolleague, Senator Kyl. As has been noted before, this amendment would \nreverse all of the progress made on the conditions package negotiated \namong many of us when we supported the $18 billion replenishment for \nthe IMF on the Supplemental earlier this year. Senator Kyl's amendment \nincludes a negotiating position that was debated, and rejected by \nmembers of this body. It would, in effect, result in the U.S. share of \nthe replenishment being delayed or withheld at a time when IMF \nassistance is needed to help us shore up economies in crisis, now \nexpanding well beyond Asia. We need to stabilize and improve these \nmarkets for our farmers and exporters, whose losses have begun to \nresonate, most recently in our own stock market. As was noted before, \nour agriculture exports are down 30 percent since the beginning of the \nyear. This is not the time to play games with IMF funding.\n  I believe few of us want to reopen these sensitive negotiations. I \nurge my colleagues to stick to the agreement we passed earlier. It was \na good one that will result in progress toward improving the way the \nIMF operates. This is not the time for the Senate to reverse its \nleadership on IMF funding. We should stay the course--and urge our \ncolleagues in the House and in the White House to do the same.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kyl amendment.\n  I yield the remaining time.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to support the proposed amendment and \nurge my colleagues to vote against tabling it.\n  The current world economic crises and the International Monetary \nFund's request for financial replenishment offer us a chance to re-\nexamine the United States' role in the world economy. If the U.S. is \ngoing to participate in institutions that influence economic policy \naround the world, then we must exert our influence in strong support of \nsound economic policies, not just rubber-stamp whatever plans \ninternational bureaucrats cook up. It does us no good to stand idly by \nand let the IMF squander our resources on ill-conceived rescue plans, \nsuch as the tax-hike package recently foisted on Russia.\n  What should the IMF be promoting? The same policies that we support \nhere\n\n[[Page S9831]]\n\nin the United States. To name just a few, these include: a monetary \npolicy dedicated to long-term price stability, a sensible tax system \nthat encourages people to work, save and invest, free and open markets \nand sound banking systems that use consistent accounting methods, have \ntransparent balance sheets and lend based on market forces, not \npolitical pressure.\n  The best way to start down this path is to set strong conditions on \nthe IMF. This amendment moves us in this direction. In particular, it \nwould promote free trade, market-based lending and the fair treatment \nof international investors. I urge my colleagues to vote against \ntabling it.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 3 minutes 12 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Kansas 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 2\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I want to refer to the statement made by \nmy distinguished colleague and friend from Arizona about the 21-1 vote \nthat happened in committee. I must say that it is my observation over a \nweekend of deliberations things were changed in that particular bill \nthat we needed to address, and we did. And so the Senate spoke 84 to 16 \nto endorse the reforms, and they are not passive reforms, that were \nworked on by a whole group of Senators--Senator Grams, myself, Senator \nHagel, Senator Biden, Senator McConnell, and Senator Stevens.\n  Basically, what are we talking about here? We require consensus in \nregard to achieving these reforms not only with the G-7 nations but the \n37 other nations involved. This isn't just a U.S. IMF program. Under \nthe Kyl amendment, he says that we have to micromanage basically from \nCongress, from the U.S. standpoint something called a board of \nexecutive directors. That process is very slow. We don't have the time \nin regard to that, with the global contagion, maybe the global \npneumonia, that is occurring right now. So the Senate has spoken 84 to \n16.\n  I would point out that the seriousness of this is extremely critical. \nThe Senator from Nebraska has talked about what is happening in \nagriculture. It is happening in every segment in regard to the economy, \nnot only in this country but all over the world.\n  We have a package. We have been meeting here with other Senators \nacross the aisle for normal trading status with China, with fast-track \nlegislation, with sanctions reform and now IMF. If this amendment \npasses, it is a killer amendment. I don't mean to perjure the \namendment, but it is a killer amendment. A, it will kill IMF, and, B, \nIMF cannot work under the circumstances of this amendment. And the \ntestimony to that certainly comes from Chairman Greenspan and many \nothers.\n  And so I urge the Senate to stick by that early vote. Again, I would \nmention it was, what, 86 to 14? No, 84 to 16. Well, there were two that \nwere off base, but we will get it back.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 45 seconds.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I ask that the remainder of my time be allotted to the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I just want to follow along with what the able Senator \nfrom Kansas has said. Adoption of this amendment would prevent the \nUnited States from consenting to a quota increase until all of these \nconditions had been met. These conditions cannot be met immediately. \nThat is a guaranteed thing. It means that the United States would, in \neffect, not be carrying through a quota increase.\n  We are facing a very serious financial crisis worldwide. One of the \ninstruments we have to deal with that is the IMF. We need to pass this \nquota increase, and we need to do it immediately, and we need to \naddress this situation. If the IMF is perceived, as it now is, not to \nhave the resources with which to deal with the international crisis, it \nwill only worsen and intensify the crisis. If anyone wants to ask what \nis the one thing we can do to try to address this crisis, it is to pass \nthis legislation without this amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired for the Senator from \nNebraska, and the Senator from Arizona has 3 minutes 48 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. I won't use all of that time. In my \nremaining time, I, first of all, ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the two articles from the Wall Street Journal to which I \nalluded earlier.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 2, 1998]\n\n                U.S. Needs to Promote Currency Stability\n\n                           (By David Malpass)\n\n       The ruble devaluation has plunged Russia into political and \n     economic upheaval. Already the financial fallout has spread \n     beyond its borders, helping to knock $1 trillion off the \n     value of U.S. equities alone and worsening the now-global \n     currency crisis. Expressed in U.S. dollars, world output will \n     fall more than 2% in 1998, pressuring debtors and hurting \n     corporate earnings world-wide. As we enter the second year of \n     the ``Asian'' crisis, the risk is clear: Countries everywhere \n     that borrowed dollars or produced commodities could collapse.\n       The U.S. has the power to stop the contagion and start the \n     recovery, but has not used it. The International Monetary \n     Fund has only added to the problem. Working in tandem, the \n     U.S. and the IMF have lurched from one bad policy idea to \n     another, with no vision, not even any apparent comprehension \n     of the severity of the crisis.\n\n\n                             Russia Beware\n\n       Their initial approach to Thailand's crisis last year was \n     to promote a limited devaluation, advise Bangkok to raise \n     taxes, and hope for the best--a strategy that had disastrous \n     results in Mexico in 1994. Thailand's per capita income has \n     fallen to $1,800 this year from $3,000 in 1996, and the \n     country is now on its fifth IMF program revision.\n       During South Korea's December crisis, the policy evolved \n     into a massive bailout by the U.S., the IMF and international \n     banks that had lent Korea too much money. The Korea approach \n     included a devaluation, a floating exchange rate backed by \n     impossibly high interest rates, rosy IMF economic forecasts, \n     the false hope of export-led growth and a heavy dose of \n     patience. Result: South Korea's economy will shrink to $280 \n     billion this year from $485 billion in 1996, a 42% \n     contraction. The IMF has revised its forecast for Korea's \n     1998 growth rate, down to minus 4% in July from plus 2.5% in \n     January. These figures quantify the failure of its floating \n     exchange rate austerity policies. Russia beware.\n       By the time the devaluation scythe pointed toward Russia \n     this June, a third U.S. policy had emerged. In a telephone \n     conversation on July 10, Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill \n     Clinton agreed on a plan to bail Russia out, this time before \n     the devaluation. However, no measures were included to anchor \n     the ruble. All Russia got was another IMF austerity program--\n     a Russian commitment to shrink the economy further by \n     squeezing taxes out of the energy companies, the country's \n     lifeblood. Result: capital flight, a devastating betrayal of \n     the ruble, a standstill on debt payments, and the likelihood \n     of a cold winter for Russians as energy companies prepare to \n     cut off cities and provinces that can't pay their bills.\n       Throughout it all, the U.S. has had no policy that would \n     deal with the heart of the global currency problem: a strong \n     dollar and a cycle of devaluations. The current Band-Aid \n     approach includes the following elements: Until further \n     notice, all developing countries are to keep interest rates \n     dramatically higher than they can afford, spreading recession \n     across the developing world. Economies that link their \n     currencies to the U.S. dollar--important ones such as \n     Argentina, Brazil, China and Hong Kong--get no clear guidance \n     on the future value of the greenback. To avoid \n     accountability, the U.S. maintains the facade that the IMF is \n     dealing with the crisis and that Japan is to blame for much \n     of it. The U.S. encourages countries to enact vague and \n     painful ``reforms,'' never mentioning or forcing the one \n     reform that matters most--a policy of currency stability.\n\n[[Page S9832]]\n\n       What, if anything, can the U.S. government do to stop the \n     contagion? First, even if it won't cut interest rates, it can \n     state unequivocally that Washington wants the value of the \n     dollar to be stable and will place a high priority on this \n     responsibility. Simply changing from the current ``strong \n     dollar'' policy to a ``stable dollar'' policy would allow \n     gold and commodity prices to recover moderately from their \n     current deflation-spooked levels and end the talk of world \n     deflation.\n       The U.S. should then begin to promote stable money for \n     developing countries at the Group of Seven, the IMF, the \n     World Bank and elsewhere. Consideration should be given to \n     transparent price-rule monetary policies, currency boards, \n     dollarization, currency unions and other techniques that have \n     dependably created growth. Such an effort alone would lift \n     financial markets in many developing countries by 30% or more \n     in a matter of days. Public statements and actions on \n     currencies matter a lot. Across most of the world, financial \n     markets bottomed on June 17 at the exact minute the U.S. \n     intervened to stop the Japanese yen's free-fall. Over the \n     next four weeks, equity markets across the industrialized \n     world hit record highs on the hope that the U.S. cared about \n     currencies and wanted the yen, the Chinese renminbi and the \n     Russian ruble to be stable.\n       The correction in world financial markets began in mid-July \n     when it became clear that America didn't intend to follow \n     through. The U.S. gave no sign that the dollar would stop \n     strengthening, further driving down the dollar price of gold \n     and oil. Washington also offered no supportive comments on \n     the renminbi or the yen, contributing to speculative selling. \n     The U.S. declined to make even a simple statement of the \n     obvious--that a Hong Kong devaluation would destroy Hong Kong \n     as a world financial center and was unthinkable. And by July \n     21, details on Russia's IMF program came out showing just \n     another failed austerity package.\n       As for Russia, now that it has embarked on the road of \n     devaluation, Moscow should think of how to lessen the blow. \n     There are ways to do this.\n       First, Russia should announce a monetary program aimed \n     explicitly at limiting the devaluation and providing future \n     stability for the ruble. It should also use its leverage with \n     the U.S. to fight the IMF penchant for free-floating exchange \n     rates and private-sector austerity. Russia's formal Aug. 17 \n     statement was an IMF recipe for disaster. It promised a \n     policy of balanced budgets (meaningless during a recession), \n     high interest rates to fight inflation (inflation is a \n     currency phenomenon, not an interest-rate one) and a floating \n     ruble defined by market prices (meaning it will sink due to \n     neglect). The IMF statement after the devaluation made not \n     one mention of the ruble, complimented Russia on its \n     satisfactory economic progress and promised more funds if \n     Russia carried out its IMF program. These are the same IMF \n     policies that caused the depression in Asia, and prolonged \n     the lost decade in Latin America in the 1980s.\n       A new, credible monetary policy would entice capital back \n     into Russia, and the country could then begin to treat its \n     debt crisis with economic growth rather than default, Russia \n     and the world should agree that a free-floating exchange rate \n     is an unworkable policy for the ruble and would lead Russia \n     down the path Indonesia followed.\n\n\n                           devaluation damage\n\n       When exchange rates float after a devaluation, interest \n     rates have to stay impossibly high to compensate for currency \n     uncertainty. Russia should establish a monetary-policy \n     mechanism in which the amount of liquidity in the economy is \n     regulated by the central bank for the primary purpose of \n     keeping the currency stable. Russia could anchor the value of \n     the ruble against gold, the dollar or the euro, and could use \n     a currency board or an automatic price-rule monetary policy. \n     It should immediately legalize the use of foreign currency, \n     as economist Steve Hanke argued on this page last week. At \n     this point in the ruble's collapse, the key aim is to make a \n     dramatic policy change at the central bank to allow the \n     people of Russia a stable currency as they work to salvage \n     the economy.\n       Time and again, the U.S. and the IMF have underestimated \n     the importance of currency stability and the damage caused by \n     devaluations. The devaluationists' promise of a quick \n     recovery in Asia has been dashed, but no constructive policy \n     has emerged. Russia now heads down the same path, dragging \n     others with it. The American farm belt feels the consequences \n     when the dollar appreciates and people in Asia buy less \n     wheat. U.S. towns on the Canadian border feel it when \n     Canadians get priced out of U.S. stores. Yet 18 months into \n     the global currency crisis, the world's biggest economic and \n     military power has no whiff of a policy to address it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Interdependence, After All\n\n              (By Michael Camdessus and Lawrence Summers)\n\n       So U.S. stocks could not go ever upward while the rest of \n     the world falls apart. We have interdependence after all, and \n     what the markets' remarkable voltality--plunging 500 one day, \n     rising 288 the next--is telling us is that the world economy \n     has been terribly mismanaged.\n       Secretary Robert Rubin dropped by the Treasury press room \n     after the 512-point drop Monday to say that the fundamentals \n     ``are strong due in part to the sound policies we've been \n     following.'' The market is telling us that the market was too \n     high, he suggests, neither he nor the Federal Reserve feels \n     the need to do anything about it, fishing in Alaska was fun, \n     and Congress should pony up the next installment of funding \n     for the International Monetary Fund.\n       There is of course a lot to be said for refusing to panic \n     because of a market drop. Stocks will fluctuate as we've seen \n     in recent days and several hundred points aren't what they \n     used to be. But the Dow Jones industrials are still off \n     nearly 16% from their July high. Historically, a plunge in \n     the stock market predicts recession in the real economy only \n     about half the time. In the other half, economic policy \n     makers get the message in time.\n       The last market crash in 1987 reflected disturbances in the \n     world financial mechanism, as is so often the case, arguably \n     as far back as 1929, when the issues were international \n     liquidity and impending protectionism. In 1987, the market \n     crashed when Treasury Secretary Baker went on television to \n     argue with the Bundesbank about which side should adjust to \n     keep the mark and dollar in reasonable alignment. The markets \n     stayed sick through year-end, but recovered when the world \n     central banks staged a huge joint intervention showing that \n     international cooperation had been restored. With this timely \n     demonstration, the real economy escaped without damage.\n       This time around the international influences are even more \n     palpable. The Russian devaluation, coming as President \n     Yeltsin was losing power and President Clinton was self-\n     destructing, was clearly the immediate spark. In and of \n     itself, neither the value of the ruble nor the output of \n     Russia is important to world commerce. But the message was \n     that we are not yet out of the round of competitive \n     devaluation that started a year ago in Thailand. A continuing \n     worldwide cycle of devaluation and a world-wide collapse in \n     liquidity would be a big event indeed, from which the real \n     economy in the U.S. could not be immune.\n       The most likely form of panic right now would be for the \n     Congress to yield to Secretary Rubin's entreaties on the IMF \n     funding. The IMF and what it represents is the problem, not \n     the solution. If we were the Congress, there would be no \n     funding for the IMF without a change in management. IMF head \n     Michel Camdessus should be replaced, along with Deputy \n     Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the U.S. point man in \n     international finance. The needed rethinking is impossible so \n     long as they are there to defend the errors that caused the \n     present world-wide mess.\n       It is, of course, always true that economies around the \n     world have their own share of mismanagement. Indonesia has \n     been an exemplar of crony capitalism, and Russia has its \n     tycoonocrats instead of the rule of law. Japan ``pricked the \n     bubble'' into its current deflationary impasse--an example \n     U.S. policy makers should heed well. But such problems have \n     persisted for decades; they were pushed over the brink and \n     into crisis by specific policy errors.\n       The first of these was the Mexican bailout masterminded by \n     Mr. Summers. The 1994 devaluation was a disaster for Mexico, \n     where workers still have not reclaimed their share of world \n     purchasing power, especially with the peso just now on \n     another sharp decline. Yet the Wall Street lenders and \n     Mexican billionaires did just fine with their tesobonos--\n     short-term dollar-denominated Mexican government paper--\n     because Mr. Summers arranged to have them bailed out, \n     including interest at risk-screaming rates like 14%. The \n     lesson the markets had to draw was: Wheee! Crossborder loans \n     are a one-way bet. Throw money at the world. Russia, even.\n       This enormous escalation in moral hazard was compounded by \n     sheer intellectual error at the IMF, which persisted against \n     all evidence in believing that devaluations can rebalance \n     economies. Devaluations cause inflation, with all of its \n     economic and social dislocation. What's more, devaluations \n     tend to spread as each country feels it has to ``remain \n     competitive'' in international markets. Mr. Camdessus is on \n     record as repeatedly having advised Thailand not to get its \n     banks and property companies under control, but to devalue \n     the baht. When he got his way, the current crisis dawned.\n       What is to be done, now that we see even the U.S. cannot \n     escape unscathed? The first priority is to stop the cycle of \n     devaluation somewhere. Unhappily, Hong Kong authorities have \n     been behaving foolishly, pouring monetary reserves into the \n     stock market. But central bank purchases of shares, like \n     purchases of any other asset, inject Hong Kong dollars into \n     the markets; you defend a currency by restricting domestic \n     liquidity, not creating it. Brazil, the key to whether the \n     cycle will spread to Latin America, seems to understand \n     better.\n       The Federal Reserve could ease much of this pressure by \n     creating more American dollars. It is certainly true that the \n     Fed should\n\n[[Page S9833]]\n\n     not be using monetary policy to support the stock market at \n     current levels, any more than it should use monetary policy \n     to combat ``irrational exuberance.'' But the case for easing \n     rests on nothing more or less than a commitment to price \n     stability, since Alan Greenspan's own advance indicators of \n     the price level--foreign exchange, gold and the yield curve--\n     are all signaling deflation ahead. The demand for dollars is \n     clearly on the rise, and Mr. Greenspan should accommodate it, \n     rather than restricting the supply of dollars to keep short-\n     term interest rates from falling as the market drives long \n     rates down.\n       The saving grace of market drops is that they provide time \n     for policy to adjust before the real economy is affected. But \n     around the world ordinary producers and consumers are already \n     suffering, and trouble lies ahead in the U.S. as well if the \n     Treasury, Fed and IMF fail to use this time to get \n     international financial management back on an even keel.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Secondly, Mr. President, I was just advised of an error, and \nI appreciate being advised of that, on line 1 of my amendment. Instead \nof ``line 1,'' it should read ``line 19''--beginning on page 119, line \n19 of the bill. I ask unanimous consent to make that change in my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I also ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. I will just conclude with this point.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware, for whom I have great \nadmiration, made the point that the President may instruct our \ndelegates to seek these reforms and, indeed, he may but we do not \ncurrently have the means to insist on them. My amendment would change \nthat.\n  The distinguished Senator from Kansas made the point that the reforms \nin the current bill are not patsy reforms, and, indeed, he is correct \nin that. As I said, we essentially all agree on the reforms. The only \ndifference is whether they are going to be urged upon the nations to \nwhich the money is lent or they are going to be imposed as requirements \non the lending of the money. That is what this amendment boils down to. \nDo we ensure that the reforms are included by requiring it, or do we \nsimply seek to include them and merely encourage the borrowers to \nengage in the reforms that we all support?\n  I think the debate is clear. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment and yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I move to table the Kyl amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Kyl amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

The Senator from \nVirginia.\n\n\n                    Baltic States and NATO Expansion\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am joined here by my distinguished \ncolleague from New York. We would like to bring to the attention of the \nSenate certain language in the report accompanying the bill. And I \nrefer to page 40. It is entitled ``Baltic States and NATO Expansion.''\n\n       The Committee has provided $15,300,000 in FMF grant \n     assistance to accelerate the Baltic States integration into \n     NATO.\n\n  This action comes following similar action in last year's statement \nof managers. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nexcerpts from the text of last year's language.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Baltic States and NATO Expansion\n\n       The Committee has provided $15,300,000 in FMF grant \n     assistance to accelerate the Baltic States integration into \n     NATO. The Committee regrets that budget constraints prevent \n     matching last year's levels but remains supportive of this \n     initiative. This assistance supports these democracies as \n     they enhance their military capacities and adopt NATO \n     standards. The Committee believes that FMF should be \n     allocated among the three nations on a proportional basis.\n       The Committee has not continued the prior limitations on \n     the international military education and training program for \n     Indonesia. However, the Committee expects the Defense \n     Security Assistance Agency to consult with the Committee \n     regarding any plans to provide IMET to Indonesia, given past \n     human rights concerns and the continued influence of the \n     Armed Forces in Indonesian political and economic affairs. \n     Any participants should be carefully vetted and courses \n     should emphasize civilian control of the armed services.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n                           The Baltic Nations\n\n       The conference agreement provides that $18,300,000 should \n     be made available to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. These \n     funds are provided to enhance programs aimed at improving the \n     military capabilities of these nations and to strengthen \n     their interoperability and standardization with NATO, \n     including the development of a regional airspace control \n     system. Given progress in economic reform and meeting \n     military guidelines for prospective NATO members, the \n     conferees believe the Baltic nations will make an important \n     contribution to enhancing stability and peace in Europe and \n     are strong candidates for NATO membership.\n       The conference agreement retains House language which \n     provides that the obligation of funds for any non-NATO \n     country participating in the Partnership for Peace shall be \n     subject to notification.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Here the language says:\n\n       These funds [$18,300,000] are provided to enhance programs \n     aimed at improving the military capabilities of these nations \n     and to strengthen their interoperability and standardization \n     with NATO. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, Partnership for Peace, is, I presume, the primary \nmeans by which these countries could work within the NATO framework. \nBut I must say that I regret that this language is so specific as to \nuse the word ``grant assistance to accelerate the Baltic States \nintegration into NATO.''\n  The Senate considered NATO expansion very thoroughly earlier this \nyear, at which time I, together with my distinguished colleague from \nNew York, expressed our strongest reservations, particularly as it \nrelated to a timetable of any nature, for further admission of nations \ninto NATO.\n  This does not spell out a timetable, but it certainly gives them, in \nthis language, together with the funds, a recognition which in my \njudgment is inappropriate, certainly at this time when\n\n[[Page S9834]]\n\nthe situation in Russia is so tenuous, as explained in the previous \ndebate on NATO expansion, and in the context of the Baltic States. I \nwill leave it to my colleague further details on that. But it is the \njudgment of the military planners in NATO that providing NATO \nassistance to these countries, should it be necessary, could well \ninvolve the use of nuclear weapons. I say that because inclusion of \nthese nations in NATO at some future date is a matter that will have to \nbe considered with great care and thoroughness by all NATO nations.\n  I just think at this time to incorporate the language in an act of \nthe Congress of the United States, presumably to be signed by the \nPresident, would send an improper signal into the community of nations \nwho are desiring to join NATO at some future date.\n  So I basically stated my views on it. I yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I join my revered friend the senior Senator from \nVirginia in this matter and would begin by reminding the Senate that in \nthe debate on expanding NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic, he forcefully made the point that the administration was \nalready talking about a further expansion to the Baltic States. That \nwould be a thumb in the eye of the Russians. The language from the \nCommittee report which Senator Warner has just read implies that the \nSenate has come to agreement on the matter when it clearly has not.\n  Estonia and Latvia have large Russian minority populations and all \nthree have tenuous relationships with Russia. Yet it seems to be \nworking, considering these three independent nations were held \n``captive''--subsumed by the Soviet Union--for three-quarters of a \ncentury. Latvia recently dismantled a Soviet radar station, and there \nare some accommodations being made for minorities in these nations.\n  Expanding NATO to include the Baltics would be provocative in the \nextreme, as the Russians have made so clear. The Russians who would \nlike to continue to make reforms in their troubled country have said: \n``Don't do this.'' Those leaders who seek the greatest liberalization \nof Russian society have said ``Heavens, don't give this weapon to the \nenemies of democracy and market enterprise. Don't put us in a situation \nwhere nuclear war in Central Europe is not to be dismissed as an \noutlandish improbability.''\n  I remarked yesterday, in a statement supporting the International \nMonetary Fund replenishment that the situation of the Soviet military \nis alarming to the point of despair. In Krasnoyarsk, General Alexander \nLebed, who is now governor there, has, by reports published in Moscow, \nundertaken to pay the Soviet strategic forces located in his Krai. The \npeople with their hands on the triggers of the nuclear missiles are not \nbeing paid. I suggest the first rule of government is: Pay the Army. In \na situation that is unstable, to take this posture regarding Nato \nexpansion is to invite misunderstanding and worse.\n  Mr. President, there is nothing we can do to change the report \nlanguage, but I would like to make the point that it has not been \ndecided that any of the Baltic states should join Nato. I do not think \nthat the term ``accelerate the Baltic States integration into NATO''--\naccelerate: faster than planned--such a term is not appropriate.\n  If it were possible in conference for the distinguished chairman and \nthe ranking member to see that this does not become part of the \nconference report itself or the accompanying statement of managers, I \nthink that would serve stability in Central Europe and the security of \nthe United States.\n  I will make no accusations. The Senator from Virginia and I simply \nsay: Do not casually get into a situation that will be thoroughly \nmisread and deeply resented by the people we most want to have as our \nfriends in Moscow. And particularly not on a day when the President \nhimself is there.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see no other Senator \nseeking recognition, so I respectfully suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9825-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9834-S9837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE CRISIS IN AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know a lot of us were out in our States \nduring the August recess. I was too. I had a series of meetings around \nthe State with farm families and people in small towns and communities \nand rural areas. Quite frankly, what I found was more than just \ndisturbing. What I found was that there is a looming crisis in \nagriculture and in our farm economy.\n  For some time I and a number of my colleagues have been trying to \ncall attention in this body to the very serious situation in the farm \neconomy. The livelihood and the life savings of hundreds of thousands \nof farm families are in jeopardy. The economic underpinnings of many \nrural communities are also at stake. In mid-July, the entire Senate \nwent on record noting the existence of the serious farm economic \nproblems and calling for immediate action. But later on, just before we \nbroke for the August recess, this Senate rejected an amendment that \nSenator Daschle and I offered to restore farming protection that was \ntaken out in the 1996 farm bill.\n  All we wanted to do in a very modest attempt was to take off the caps \nthat were put on the loan rates in the 1996 farm bill. We did not in \nany way want to attempt at that point to change the farm bill. We just \nsimply wanted to remove the caps. The loan rates were still there. They \nwere just capped at the 1996 level. All we wanted to do was remove \nthose.\n  As I listened to the debate on that amendment, it seemed clear to me \nthat many of my colleagues doubted the seriousness of the problems in \nthe farm economy. I heard statements that if we just let the market \nwork, if exports would just get back on track, the situation would turn \naround, or so the argument went.\n  So, I went out to my State to have some meetings in August to sort of \ntake the temperature and gauge just how serious the situation was. In \nthe intervening time since we left here, the situation has become, I am \nsad to say, far worse. The bottom literally has dropped out of \ncommodity prices. I point out that the falling commodity prices cover \nboth livestock and crops. Often, at least in my State, if the commodity \nprice of a crop was low, the livestock prices might be up a little bit, \nand the farmer would at least have something to sell to make some \nmoney. Now all of the major commodities--corn, soybeans, pork, and \nbeef--are all deeply in the red.\n  So at this point I don't see how there can be any doubt that we have \nan economic disaster in the farm sector.\n  I have some charts that will show just what happened over the last 6 \nweeks since the Senate considered this amendment that Senator Daschle \nand I offered on July 17.\n  Here are central Illinois, corn prices. Here is where they were when \nwe debated the amendment. Here is where they are now--a 21 percent \ndecline in 6 weeks in the corn prices.\n  Here is central Illinois, soybean prices--again, a 21 percent decline \nin the past 6 weeks.\n  Here is Kansas City, hard red winter wheat prices--down 13 percent in \nthe past 6 weeks, and headed south. There is nothing to indicate that \nit is going to come up.\n  Since July 16, the day the Senate passed its version of the \nagriculture appropriations bill, the following market prices declined:\n  Dodge City, KS, wheat--down 20 percent;\n  North central Iowa corn--down 26.1 percent;\n  North central Iowa soybeans--down 20.7 percent;\n  South Iowa and Minnesota hogs--down 11.5 percent;\n  Billings, MT, feed barley--down 20 percent.\n  That is just since the middle of July.\n  Here are the charts that I used in July to show what was happening to \ncommodity prices, going clear back to 1990. It sort of drifts along, \nand we had a big spike in here from 1994 up to 1996. Then, after the \n1996 farm bill was passed, the prices have been coming\n\n[[Page S9835]]\n\ndown and coming down. This little red figure shows just what happened \nsince we were here in July.\n  I dare say if we do nothing, if we sit here and twiddle our thumbs \nand do nothing, that line will continue to go down during the fall \nmonths.\n  That was corn.\n  Here is the farm-level soybean price. Again, since the farm bill \npassed, the price has been coming down; now in the last 6 weeks, its \ndown even more.\n  Here is the wheat price. Again, it spiked up here about 1996, has \nbeen generally coming down the last 6 weeks--a precipitous drop in the \nprice of wheat.\n  Again, as I said, Mr. President, I don't think there can be doubt any \nlonger that we have an economic disaster in the farm sector.\n  In my State, corn prices have fallen to the levels of the farm crisis \nyears of the 1980s, and they still remain under downward pressures. As \nI say, there is nothing indicating that it is going to pull these back \nup. The prices have fallen over 25 percent since mid-July and are about \n$1 a bushel below the cost of production.\n  USDA's most recent estimation indicates that 1998 net farm income \nwill be 20 percent lower than it was in 1996--about $42.5 billion. And \nit was about $53.3 billion in 1996.\n  I could go on and on citing more discouraging figures. But it is \nobvious that the numbers tell the story. It is simply no longer \npossible to deny the severity of the problems in the farm economy. \nThose problems are already spilling over into rural economies and into \nour small towns and communities.\n  If the situation continues, it will affect our entire national \neconomy.\n  Let me just, again, underscore the consequences if we do not act. If \nwe do not act, we are going to lose thousands of farm families that we \ncannot afford to lose. Many of us here remember the 1980s farm crisis. \nI can just tell you that my State of Iowa can't bear to go through that \nagain. Our Nation can't bear to go through that again.\n  Farmers are, indeed, resourceful people. Farmers and farm families \ncan handle a lot of adversity and survive in business and maintain \ntheir families on the farm. But when commodity prices fall the way they \nhave recently, farmers are at the mercy of the market. If we do not \nhave some actions to ameliorate the effects of these low commodity \nprices, we are going to see a lot of farm families forced out of \nbusiness. They will be gone forever and often gone from their community \nentirely. By and large, they will not be able to return when the farm \neconomy turns around. Farming is too capital intensive for that kind of \nin and out and in again type of approach.\n  Basically, we are talking here a lot about younger farm families who \nhave money borrowed and who do not have a lot of equity built up, who \nare the most vulnerable to severe downturns in the farm economy like we \nare now seeing. They are energetic, they are perhaps some of the most \neducated farmers we have ever had in America, but they often do not \nhave the financial resources to hang on through the kind of long, \nserious economic downturn that we have now. These younger farmers are \nthe ones we can least afford to lose; they are the future of \nagriculture and the future of our rural communities. As they are forced \nout of agriculture, food production becomes concentrated in fewer and \nfewer hands, and this is not a healthy trend for rural communities, \nconsumers or our Nation as a whole.\n  I just point out that in Russia, the former Soviet Union, they are \nbreaking up these old, huge farms because they did not work. I don't \nthink we want to go down that path of having larger and larger land \nholdings in this country.\n  Now, I just focused my remarks on younger farmers and young farm \nfamilies. I mentioned that, Mr. President, at one of my farm meetings \nin Iowa, and there were a number of older farmers there who jumped all \nover me and said, well, you are missing us. I said, yes, but I want to \ntalk about the younger farmers and how they don't have a lot of equity. \nOne of the older farmers shook his finger at me and said that is just \nmy point. I have built up my equity in my farm. That is my retirement. \nI haven't made a lot of money.\n  I am reminded of the old adage: Farmers live poor and die rich. They \nhave a lot of land, they have a lot of equity built up, but they have \nnever made a lot of money. He said that is my retirement, and I see it \ngoing away before my very eyes because of these low commodity prices, \nbecause of what is happening out there, because they are having to \nborrow now, because they are digging into their equity base just to \nstay afloat.\n  So it is not just the younger farmers. I think it spreads across the \nwhole spectrum.\n  I also read in the newspaper a comment made by a certain politician, \nwho will remain unnamed, who said basically if farmers are having \ntrouble now, it is because they were simply not managing their farms \ncorrectly; they were bad managers. That is my own words, ``bad \nmanagers.''\n  Well, he mentioned this, and this was, of course, the topic of \nconversation at one of my farm meetings, and several of the farmers \nthere pointed to the fact that they had survived the 1980s. And as they \npointed out, any farmer that got through the 1980s is not a bad \nmanager. If they could manage their debt loads and the low prices and \nthe shakeout that we had in agriculture in the 1980s, they are pretty \ngood managers. But now they can't handle this. Farm debt is now at the \nhighest level it has been since 1985, and that was the beginning of the \nwashout of a lot of farmers in the mid and late 1980s.\n  We can all look to the causes, what causes all this. Well, I don't \nknow that they are all that complicated. We have had good crop \nproduction conditions. We are going to have a bumper crop of soybeans \nthis year, the largest production of soybeans this year. We are going \nto have a big crop of soybeans in my State, too. Corn may not have a \nrecord year, but may be the second largest record year. So we have a \nlot of supplies and a lot of farm commodities in the world market.\n  At the same time, the demand has gotten weak for a number of reasons, \nnot the least of which has been the economic downturn in Asia. I saw \nsome figures--I don't have the charts for them. I will bring them up in \nthe next couple of days--which showed our exports to Asia not off all \nthat much in terms of quantity but in terms of price. What we are \ngetting for what we are selling is way, way down. And so we have a very \nweak foreign market there. They don't have any money in Asia, and so a \nlot of our sales have eroded.\n  Now, another aspect is the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the \ncurrencies of these other countries that compete with us to sell ag \nexports. The weakness of those currencies allows those other countries \nto gain a competitive advantage over us. Now, there isn't a farmer in \nmy State that has any ability to control that. If these other \ncurrencies are weak and they can undercut us in selling their \ncommodities to other countries, there is not a darned thing that one or \nten or a thousand farmers in my State can do about it. But it is a fact \nand that is what is happening. So they have gained competitive \nadvantage over us.\n  In addition, farmers in several areas of the U.S. have suffered \nsevere losses because of weather and crop disease problems. So while we \nhave a bumper crop, we have places such as North Dakota and Texas where \nthey have had tremendous drought problems and weather problems and they \ndon't have a crop at all or they have crop disease problems.\n  So you put all this together, and with total freedom to plant and \nthen farmers have planted--in fact, I have heard more than one comment \nin my State about how much of the conserved land that we had in the \npast is now being planted, and that farmers are planting them more \nintensely. And again, if you understand ag economics, you understand \nthat if you have a fixed base, fixed amount of land, you are going to \ntry to get the most production out of that land, even if the prices \nfall.\n  That is why I don't think there are a lot of people--I know a lot of \npeople understand it. I know the Presiding Officer understands ag \neconomics. But a lot of them think that a farmer is like General \nMotors, that if prices fall you can cut back production to meet the \nsupply and demand situation. The farmer can't do that. One farmer is \nnot General Motors. That one farmer has no control over the total \nsupply and the total demand.\n\n[[Page S9836]]\n\n  Secondly, it is counterintuitive. You would think if prices would \nfall, for example, in corn, a corn farmer would say, well, if the \nprices are down, I am not going to plant corn; I will plant something \nelse. We heard a lot of this during the debate on the farm bill. Well, \nquite frankly, what happens, if the price drops, the farmer looks at \nhis fixed base and says, gee, you know, the marginal cost of planting \nan extra acre or 2 or 5 or 10 acres of corn is almost nothing, and \nmaybe I can plant more intensively and I can get more out of that fixed \nunit that I have. And therefore, even if the prices drop, I will have \nmore production out of that unit and that will cover the lower prices. \nTherefore, low prices don't lead to decreased production of crops. It, \nin fact, can lead to increased production of a crop.\n  That is what we are seeing right now--simple, basic farm economics. \nAnd so you put all these forces together, and what we have is the \ndisaster we are having right now. But again, keep in mind these are \nforces beyond the control of a farmer. The farmer is at the mercy of \nweather, at the mercy of world commodity surpluses, at the mercy of \neconomic problems, and they are at the mercy of other foreign \ncurrencies and their values, all of which are things that conspire \ntogether to ruin our markets.\n  It is because of these forces that are beyond the control of farmers \nthat we in our country have traditionally had in place a system of farm \nincome protection. Certainly, we want to let the market work, but we \nalso recognize that when the market turns around, or when disaster \nstrikes, or when things intervene to skew the market, that it should \nnot wipe out farm families who have done everything within their power \nto produce and to meet the demands of the market. These farmers should \nnot be forced out without any protection against events beyond their \ncontrol.\n  Again, a lot of people say, Why should we treat farmers differently \nthan any other business? The reason we have always had these policies \nin place is because farming is not like any other business. As Neil \nHarl, the distinguished professor of agricultural economics at Iowa \nState University, has said repeatedly, farmers are not like General \nMotors. Farmers are uniquely vulnerable to forces over which they have \nno control.\n  The 1996 farm bill greatly pared back protections against forces over \nwhich farmers have no control. The 1996 farm bill said to farmers: \nProduce all you can and export all you can. That is fine until foreign \nmarkets turn sour. That is fine until other countries' currencies are \nable to beat our own and they can get a competitive advantage over us \nbecause of the competitive value of their currencies. That is fine \nuntil other governments intervene, in terms of their support and their \ncontrol of their own agricultural commodities. When foreign markets \nturn sour because of these events, like we are now seeing, the 1996 \nfarm bill basically leaves American farmers to bear the brunt of these \npowerful world economic forces that are totally beyond their control.\n  Basically, the 1996 farm bill put farmers on a high wire and then \ntook away the safety net. Again, I will keep reminding my colleagues \nthat under previous farm policies farmers got a lot more help in \ncontending with those world economic forces beyond their control. There \nwere deficiency payments that compensated for low prices. There was the \nFarmer Owned Reserve which paid farmers to pull grain off of the market \nin times of surpluses. There were not artificially low caps on \ncommodity loan rates. There were paid land diversions and acreage \nlimitations to keep production in line with demand. So there were all \nkinds of policies in place to help farmers weather these powerful \neconomic forces over which they have no control. But the 1996 farm bill \ntook that all away.\n  Now, again, we have to ask ourselves, are we so ideologically rigidly \nattached to the 1996 farm bill that our hands are so tied that we \ncannot respond to these low farm prices and to the disaster that is \nfacing us in rural America? Ideology is fine, but let's be practical \nabout it. Let's use some common sense here. I do not mind if people \nhave an ideology they want to pursue. That is fine. I think there is a \nlot of ideology in the 1996 farm bill. Those who had that ideology won \nthe votes, won the bill and got it through. But, as President Clinton \nsaid when he signed the bill into law, that it is seriously flawed \nbecause there is not an adequate safety net there to help farmers \nthrough these kind of times that we will see in the future.\n  I think what we need is to set our ideology aside and come together \nhere to recognize that we have a disastrous farm economy out there \nright now. I might also say to my colleagues and friends who want to \nsee the 1996 farm bill continue, that if we do not take some modest \nsteps now to make some minor fixes in the 1996 farm bill, then there \nwill be mounting pressure to make drastic changes in farm policy. In \nother words, if we do not get ahead of the curve, then we may have to \ntake very dramatic steps, and those steps could go back to something \neven previous to the 1996 farm bill.\n  So all I am saying is that there is no reason to keep the loan rates \ncapped. We ought to take the caps off of loan rates. I also believe \nthat we need to put into place, at least over the next couple or 3 \nyears, just for this year, a form of a Farmer Owned Reserve where, as \nwe have in the past, we actually paid farmers some up-front money to \nstore their grain and then the farmer can decide when to market that \ngrain. I call it giving the farmers more freedom to market. Right now, \nfarmers have freedom to plant, under the 1996 farm bill. But, because \nof the 1996 farm bill, they are forced to market their grain at the \nlowest possible prices. That is inherently unfair. Let's give the \nfarmer some more freedom to market, and that means giving the farmer \nthe ability to store the grain, either on the farm or in local \nelevators or the warehouse, and then be able to market that grain over \nthe next couple or 3 years, when, we hope, prices will recover.\n  If we do fund the International Monetary Fund and they can straighten \nout the Asian economy, it is likely that the Asian economy can rebound \nin the next 12 to 15 months. That would put upward pressure on our \ngrain prices. The problem is the farmers won't have the grain then. But \nif we had some system where the farmer could store that, as he could in \nthe past under the Farmer Owned Reserve, then the farmer could market \nthat grain at the higher prices in the future.\n  I think those two items, taking off the loan rate caps and giving the \nfarmers the ability to store their grain and to market it when they \nwant to rather than dumping it on the market this fall, are the two \nthings that we could do to save the 1996 farm bill. They are modest \nsteps. They don't take away planting flexibility. They don't take away \nall of the abilities that we gave the farmers. It does not reinstitute \nany kind of set-asides or Government mandates on what a farmer has to \nplant or where they have to plant. All that would stay in place. Those \nwere the good features of the 1996 farm bill.\n  But, what we need to do in order to save those, I believe, is to take \na couple of these modest steps. If we do not do that, we are going to \nsee a lot of grain dumped on the market this fall. We are going to see \nthese prices go down even further, and we will have a full-blown \ndepression in rural America. It is almost there right now. It is almost \nthere. We are on the brink of it in rural America. Many farmers \nbasically see this as their last year if we do not do something.\n  So, again, I take this time on the floor to point out to my \ncolleagues that we have to address this. I do not believe it is a \npartisan matter. I think bipartisan support is growing all over this \ncountry. I have seen letters, documents from different places around \nthe country that indicate that we ought to do something. North Dakota \nGovernor Edward T. Schafer and Republican legislators supported what \nthe North Dakota Farmers' Union and the North Dakota farmers both \nembraced in an agreement last week. One of them was a 1-year lifting of \nthe loan rate caps. So here we have, I think, some bipartisan support \nfor doing this. I do not think it is a partisan effort.\n  Again, we have to be practical. We cannot be held prisoner by an \nideology or blind devotion to every last provision of a farm bill \npassed over 2 years ago, 2 years ago when we saw some of the highest \nprices we have ever seen for crops. That is when the farm bill was \npassed. Now we are in the basement.\n\n[[Page S9837]]\n\n  So let's work for a practical solution that will help our farm \nfamilies and rural communities this fall. Let's take the caps off of \nloan rates. Let's have at least a 1-year provision for a Farmer Owned \nReserve to give the farmer the opportunity to market when prices are \nhigh. We must act soon. It is our responsibility. I think it would be a \ndereliction of our duty to leave here in October without passing \nlegislation to address the deepening farm income crisis in our Nation. \nI hope and expect sometime within the next several days, perhaps next \nweek, Senator Daschle and I and others, hopefully in a bipartisan \nmanner, will again be offering an amendment to lift the loan rate caps, \nto get the loan rates up, the marketing loan basis for these farmers \nthis fall.\n  I am hopeful that our colleagues will really take a serious look at \nthis, because we are facing a farm crisis in America unlike any we have \nseen in a long, long time, and we have to act and we have to act now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9834-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9837-S9847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3500, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment, and the modification is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator's amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n       On page 33, line 4, before the colon insert the following: \n     ``; and (4) North Korea is not actively pursuing the \n     acquisition or development of a nuclear capability (other \n     than the light-water reactors provided for by the 1994 Agreed \n     Framework Between the United States and North Korea).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the modification, by the way, takes out \nthe provision, at the request of the administration and others, that \nrequires that the North Koreans be fully meeting their obligations \nunder the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. I did that \nwith some reluctance, but, at the same time, the important aspect of \nthis amendment is that the President must certify that North Korea is \nnot actively pursuing the acquisition or development of nuclear \ncapability, other than light-water reactors provided for in the 1994 \nAgreed Framework between the United States and North Korea.\n  I think it is the desire of the distinguished manager that we vote on \nthis amendment. First of all, I ask, if it has not taken place, that \nthe Hutchison second-degree amendment be voice voted at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Hutchison \namendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator from Arizona will withhold for just a \nmoment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will make some additional remarks which \nare so compelling, and as soon as the Senator from Kentucky desires, I \nwill yield so that we can proceed with this vote. I know the Senator \nfrom Kentucky is very interested in concluding this legislation, as are \nthe rest of us. Given the conditions in the world today, I argue this \nis one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will \nconsider in the Senate.\n  Yesterday there was an article in the New York Times, parts of which \nI think are important to note.\n  It is titled ``Missile Test By North Korea: Dark Omen for \nWashington.'' Part of the article says:\n\n       The officials and arms experts said the test also suggested \n     that North Korea had made real progress towards building \n     Taepodong-2, which is reportedly capable of traveling 2,400 \n     to 3,600 miles and could strike targets throughout Asia and \n     as far away as Alaska.\n       Henry D. Sokolski, the executive director of the \n     Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington, said \n     the ability to build rockets in stages opened the door to \n     intercontinental missiles, which in theory have virtually \n     unlimited range.\n       ``We're entering a new era,'' Mr. Sokolski said.\n       Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on \n     Nuclear Arms Control, another research organization in \n     Washington, said the missile test was ``a clear sign'' of \n     North Korea's intent to develop nuclear weapons, despite its \n     1994 agreement with the United States to stop in exchange for \n     energy assistance.\n       Mr. Milhollin said a two-stage missile was too costly to \n     build simply for delivering conventional weapons. ``It means \n     they plan to put a nuclear warhead on it or export it to \n     somebody who will,'' he said. ``The missile makes no sense \n     otherwise.''\n\n  Mr. President, these are important statements. Some argue that \nperhaps the North Koreans are just simply building a missile and they \nare not pursuing the acquisition of nuclear weapons.\n  As Mr. Milhollin said, it doesn't make sense. Why else would they be \nbuilding a two-stage rocket without planning also to have that missile \narmed with a weapon of mass destruction?--from what we have seen in the \npast, most likely a nuclear weapon.\n  I don't want to go through the litany of my complaints about this \nagreement that was made with North Korea in 1994. I spoke at length on \nthe floor of the Senate and with the media. I did not see any \nindication that the North Koreans were serious. I did see indications \nthey were in violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to which they \nwere signatories and that we were basically providing them with a \nbribe. I also believed and still believe that unless the North Koreans \nunderstand they have to pay a significant price, then they will \ncontinue in this most destabilizing activity.\n  The Florida Times Union on August 28 said:\n\n       An argument could be made that Pyongyang feels it must \n     renew its nuclear program to keep people warm, but it also \n     claims it cannot feed its people and has been begging \n     successfully for free rice. If it doesn't have enough money \n     to feed its people, how can it have enough money to build \n     expensive nuclear facilities and two-stage rockets? Pyongyang \n     presumably is taking money that would have been spent on food \n     and heat if not for western charity in building a nuclear \n     arsenal.\n       Unfortunately, the administration made it easy for \n     Pyongyang to cheat. The agreement does not require \n     inspections to verify North Korean compliance. Oddly enough, \n     Pyongyang threatened earlier this month to pull out of the \n     agreement over the U.S. failure to lift economic sanctions \n     quickly enough. It has also complained about the lack of \n     progress toward diplomatic ties. Those sound more like \n     excuses to me for cheating on an agreement rather than \n     reasons to break it. Not once since its inception in the \n     aftermath of World War II has North Korea proven itself \n     trustworthy. That makes it difficult for the United States to \n     continue making agreements based purely on trust.\n\n  Mr. Hoagland, probably one of the most respected, if not the most \nrespected, individual commentators on the issues of national security, \nsaid:\n\n       The U.S.-negotiated agreement that froze North Korea's \n     nuclear weapons development in 1994 is coming apart.\n       With their economy in trouble, South Korea and Japan have \n     been having second thoughts about the high levels of economic \n     aid the deal mandates, and Congress has always been unhappy \n     about the fuel oil shipments the administration agreed to \n     make without congressional consultation. These concerns were \n     undermining the accord even before the discovery this month \n     that North Korea has been working on an underground secret \n     facility that almost certainly violates the accord.\n       That discovery could be the nail in the coffin of the \n     agreement, which pulled North Korea and the United States \n     back from a military confrontation that could soon resume.\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Charles Krauthammer, a man whom I have great \nrespect for, also wrote on August 30:\n\n       Consider North Korea. In 1994, it broke the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty and embarked on nuke building. How did \n     Clinton react? By agreeing to supply North Korea indefinitely \n     with free oil while the United States and allies build for it \n     two brand new (ostensibly safer) $5 billion nuclear reactors \n     in return for a promise to freeze its weapon program.\n       Now it turns out that while taking this gigantic bribe \n     North Korea was building a huge new nuclear facility inside a \n     mountain. The administration, inert and dismayed by such \n     ungentle manliness, refuses to call this a violation of the \n     agreement. Why? Because concrete has not been poured.\n\n  Today the Los Angeles Times editorial reads, ``Time to Rethink North \nKorea Policy'':\n       If ever there was a time for Washington to reappraise its \n     policy toward North Korea, it is now. In the midst of \n     meetings between American and North Korean negotiators in New \n     York, the Pyongyang regime fired a new, longer-range missile \n     across the Sea of Japan and over the Japanese mainland. That \n     provocative act constitutes a major setback in diplomatic \n     efforts to draw hostile North Korea into the world community.\n       The missile was discussed at Monday's meeting in New York, \n     which focused on implementation of a 1994 accord under which\n\n[[Page S9838]]\n\n     the United States, South Korea, Japan and the European Union \n     would help North Korea build two nuclear power reactors of no \n     military use in exchange for a freeze on nuclear weapons \n     development. U.S. representatives did not say Monday what, if \n     any, explanation was given by Pyongyang. On Tuesday, North \n     Korea declined to meet.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       U.S officials, curiously, said they were not surprised by \n     the test and had warned of it in advance. Military analysts \n     pointed to the range capability that North Korea has now \n     shown and said that chemical, biological and even nuclear \n     warheads could be put on such a missile. The test came only a \n     few weeks after U.S. intelligence satellites uncovered \n     activity at a huge, supposedly shuttled nuclear facility.\n       Perhaps Pyongyang fired the missile as a ploy to get \n     Washington to fully deliver on its pledge to provide 500,000 \n     tons of fuel oil this year as part of the reactor deal. If \n     so, the tactic has backfired. Members of Congress who had \n     balked at paying for the fuel now are irate.\n       North Korea may have also been advertising its missile to \n     other renegade nations. Military sales are one of the few \n     money-making ventures left for the impoverished country, \n     which has been warning that it may have to restart its \n     nuclear weapons program. The episode smacks of blackmail, not \n     diplomacy. All the more reason for the Clinton administration \n     to reconsider its long, patient persuasion of Pyongyang.\n\n  Mr. President, on July 8, 1998, Secretary of State Albright said:\n\n       Regional security is another matter on which dialogue with \n     Beijing has enhanced cooperation and fostered progress. For \n     example, the People's Republic of China has consistently \n     supported the Agreed Framework that has frozen North Korea's \n     dangerous nuclear weapons program, and has urged the North to \n     continue complying with it.\n\n  Secretary Albright said, on March 4, 1998:\n\n       Our request this year includes $35 million for the Korean \n     Energy Development Organization. The Agreed Framework has \n     succeeded in freezing North Korea's dangerous nuclear \n     program. Now it has begun that program one step at a time--\n     having secured over 90% of the program's spent fuel, which \n     represents several bombs' worth of weapons-grade plutonium \n     after reprocessing.\n\n  Secretary Albright, on February 10, 1998:\n\n       We believe our FY99 budget request for $35 million for KEDO \n     is both necessary and justified to maintain U.S. leadership \n     within KEDO, ensure that KEDO continues to fulfill its \n     important mission, and secure continued DPRK compliance with \n     its nonproliferation obligations under the U.S. DPRK Agreed \n     Framework.\n\n  She said, on February 12, 1997:\n\n       Let me just say this is obviously a very complex subject, \n     but I believe that the framework agreement is one of the best \n     things that the administration has done because it stopped a \n     nuclear weapons program in North Korea.\n\n  Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal on Friday, August 21, said \nNorth Korea's nukes--\n\n       In essence, what was signed in 1994 was an arms-control \n     agreement that suffered from the central flaws common to all \n     such efforts: Even when verification is possible--and in this \n     case it was specifically excluded--there is no way to enforce \n     compliance. More to the point, there is no will to enforce \n     it. So much effort and face and prestige goes into getting \n     these deals signed that when something goes wrong, nobody \n     wants to admit it.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       North Korea is different only because Pyongyang openly \n     conducts foreign policy through blackmail. Earlier this year, \n     it threatened to resume its nuclear weapons program and \n     declared it would keep selling missiles to clients like Iran \n     and Iraq unless the U.S. lifted economic sanctions. It also \n     has demanded more fuel oil and more food for its hungry \n     population. A group of U.S. Congressmen in North Korea for a \n     whirlwind official famine tour this week came away convinced \n     that millions are near starvation and hundreds of thousands \n     of others have already died of hunger. As terrible as this \n     is, it is all the more horrifying when you consider that the \n     Stalinist regime is spending what little money it does have \n     building long-range missiles that will be able to hit the \n     United States, according to a commission appointed by the \n     U.S. Congress. Or on that giant new underground complex where \n     nuclear weapons production was ``frozen'' in 1994.\n       It may turn out that the complex is not a nuclear-weapons \n     plant after all. Even so, the administration's timely \n     retaliation in Afghanistan and the Sudan will have two \n     beneficial effects. It will signal the North Koreans that \n     America's patience is not unlimited, and that consequently \n     they may wish to rethink their current strategy of trying to \n     blackmail the U.S. into coughing up more aid by playing the \n     nuclear card.\n\n  Mr. President, the fact is that no one understands North Korea. No \none understands what goes on inside that Orwellian country. And it is \nimpossible to predict what the thinking is that would cause them to \nhave a delegation in New York supposedly in serious negotiations and at \nthe same time launch this two-stage missile. I cannot imagine the \nreaction of the American people if a foreign country launched a missile \none stage of which hit on one side of Florida and the other one hit on \nthe other side of Florida.\n  Mr. President, I think the American people would be incredulous and \ngreatly disturbed over such an event. Well, that is what the North \nKoreans just did vis-a-vis Japan, a country that had pledged to provide \nthe bulk of several billion dollars worth of construction of a nuclear \npowerplant.\n  This is a serious situation. Obviously, the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction and the means to deliver them is one of the \ngreatest challenges we face in this post-cold war era. We have to bring \nthis threat to a halt. I hope that the administration, as the Los \nAngeles Times recommends, rethinks the North Korean policy. In the \nmeantime, we cannot continue to fund any program that would provide any \nencouragement as well as financial assistance to a country that clearly \nhas time after time after time broken its word and has committed acts \nof provocation and aggression.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. But, Mr. President, \nbefore I do that, I want to say that I would like to move this \namendment as soon as possible, and hope that we can do so. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, I have an \namendment I would like to offer. If my colleague from Arizona has \ncompleted his debate on this, I would ask----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I am told by staff \nhere that they would prefer to wait until the manager of the bill comes \nto the floor before that permission be granted. So I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I defer to the managers to make a proper \nmotion to temporarily set aside the McCain amendment for the purposes \nof offering and debating at this point my amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have an understanding with the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut that at whatever point the two \ndemocratic Senators who are requesting an opportunity to be heard on \nthe McCain amendment arrive on the Senate floor, we can go back to the \nMcCain amendment and dispose of that. With that understanding with the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, I have no objection to \ntemporarily laying aside the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I inform my colleagues I know there are other Members who \nwant to be heard on this amendment, and I certainly would not ask for a \nvote on this amendment until other Members have had a chance to be on \nit. Specifically, my colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, and \npossibly others, will speak in opposition, I am told, to this \namendment. I will not make an attempt to have the amendment disposed of \nuntil they have had an opportunity to be heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3527\n\n(Purpose: Establish a procedure for the declassification of information \n                 pertaining to Guatemala and Honduras)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, and \n     Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Leahy, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3527.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following new \n     section:\n\n[[Page S9839]]\n\n     SEC.   . RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE AVAILABLE HUMAN RIGHTS \n                   RECORDS PURSUANT TO PENDING REQUESTS.\n\n       (a) Guatemala and Honduras.--\n       (1) The United States has received specific written \n     requests for human rights records from the Guatemala \n     Clarification Commission and the National Human Rights \n     Commissioner in Honduras, and from American citizens and \n     their relatives who have been victims of gross violations of \n     human rights in those countries.\n       (2) Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, each agency shall review all requested human rights \n     records referred to in subsection (a)(1) which it has not yet \n     located or reviewed for the purpose of declassifying and \n     disclosing such records to the public except as provided in \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Postponement of Public Disclosure.--\n       (1) Grounds for postponement of public disclosure of human \n     rights records.--An agency may only postpone public \n     disclosure of a human rights record or portions thereof that \n     are responsive to the pending requests--\n       (A) pursuant to the declassification standards contained in \n     section 6 of P.L. 102-526, or\n       (B)(i) if its public disclosure should be expected to \n     reveal the identity of a confidential human source,\n       (ii) however it shall not be grounds for withholding from \n     public disclosure relevant information about an individual's \n     involvement in a human rights matter solely because that \n     individual was or is an intelligence source, however, the \n     public disclosure of the fact that the individual was or is \n     such a source may be withheld pursuant to this section.\n       (2) Review of decision to withhold records.--The \n     Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel \n     (hereinafter in this section the ``Panel''), established \n     under Executive Order No. 12958, shall--\n       (A) review all decisions to withhold the public disclosure \n     of any human rights record that has been identified pursuant \n     to requests referred to in subsection (a)(1), subject to the \n     declassification standards referred to in subsection (b)(1);\n       (B) notify the head of the agency in control or possession \n     of the human rights record that was the subject of the review \n     of its determination and publish such determination in the \n     Federal Register;\n       (C) contemporaneously notify the President of its \n     determination, who shall have the sole and nondelegable \n     authority to review any determination of the Panel, and whose \n     review shall be based on the declassification standards \n     referred to in subsection (b)(1). Within 30 calendar days of \n     notification, the President shall provide the Panel with an \n     unclassified certification setting forth his decision and the \n     reasons therefor; and\n       (D) publish in the Federal Register a copy of any \n     unclassified written certification, statement, and any other \n     materials that the President deems appropriate in each \n     instance.\n       (3) References.--For purposes of this section, references \n     in sections 6 and 9 of P.L. 102-526 to ``assassination \n     records'' shall be deemed to be references to ``human rights \n     records''.\n       (c) Creation of Positions.--(1) For purposes of carrying \n     out the provisions of this section, there shall be two \n     additional positions on the Panel. The President shall \n     appoint individuals, not currently employees of the United \n     States Government, who have substantial human rights \n     expertise and who are able to meet the requisite security \n     clearance requirements for these positions.\n       (2) The rights and obligations of such individuals on the \n     Panel shall be limited to matters relating to the review of \n     human rights records and their service on the panel shall end \n     upon completion of that review.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this Section:\n       (1) Human rights record.--The term ``human rights record'' \n     means a record in the possession, custody, or control of the \n     United States Government containing information about gross \n     violations of internationally recognized human rights \n     committed in Honduras and Guatemala.\n       (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency of the \n     United States Government charged with the conduct of foreign \n     policy or foreign intelligence, including the Department of \n     State, the Agency for International Development, the Defense \n     Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National \n     Reconnaissance Office, the Department of Justice, the \n     National Security Council, and the Executive Office of the \n     President.\n       (3) Gross violations of internationally recognized human \n     rights.--The term ``gross violations of internationally \n     recognized human rights'' has the same meaning as is \n     contained in section 502(B)(d)(1) of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have brief remarks about this amendment. \nIt is focused on two countries, Guatemala and Honduras. It is not \nworldwide. It is designed to try to have documents declassified, dating \nback to a decade ago. Many people recall the tragedies of the conflict \nin Central America. It actually goes back more than two decades. In the \ncase of Guatemala, it goes back 30 or 40 years.\n  Civil wars have now been concluded. There are democratically led \ngovernments moving in a direction to try to address their underlying \neconomic and social needs. The conflict that plagued these countries \nand ourselves cost the lives of thousands of people, as well as \nthousands more who were injured and brutalized in those conflicts.\n  We are seeking with this amendment to declassify certain information \nthat might allow us, in the case particularly of an American citizen \nwho was brutalized in that conflict almost a decade ago, to gather \nnecessary information so that those who perpetrated the crimes against \nher could be brought to the bar of justice.\n  The Clinton administration has already agreed in principle to assist \nthe Guatemalan and Honduran authorities investigating past human rights \nabuses that occurred during this period. These investigations are \ncritical to these societies being able to complete the process of \nreconciliation and establish a credible foundation on which to build \ndemocratic institutions which truly reflect the rule of law and to put \nan end to impunity.\n  While some U.S. agencies have already responded very fully and \npositively to these requests, others appear to have done little or \nnothing meaningful to review and turn over materials that could be \ncritical to the success of this exercise. The slowness of certain \nagencies in the production of materials, in some cases which are \ntotally nonresponsive to these requests, have caused a level of \ncynicism about the commitment of some agencies to fully support this \neffort.\n  I know my colleagues, Senator Leahy and Senator McConnell, are very \nfamiliar with the case of the American citizen, Sister Diana Ortiz, who \nwas abducted and brutally raped and tortured while serving in a rural \ncommunity in Guatemala in 1989. Not surprisingly, Sister Ortiz's life \nhas never been the same. Her efforts to shed light on the details of \nthe crimes against her have been met with indifference, at best. As is \ntoo often the case in rape cases, she believes that rather than being \nviewed as the victim, she has been treated by certain government \nofficials as a perpetrator of some crime or involved in nefarious \nbehavior. I don't think the 101 cigarette burns on her back would \nindicate necessarily at all that someone was the perpetrator rather \nthan the victim.\n  Just today, I received a very moving letter from Sister Ortiz. \nAttached to her letter was a statement that she recently gave laying \nout some of the new information about her case. Let me quote from her \nletter, because I think it helps explain why I am offering this \namendment today. Sister Ortiz writes:\n\n       Despite my efforts, I still don't know the truth of why I \n     was abducted and tortured. It is true that government \n     agencies have released documents to me. They consist of such \n     public items as articles written by the press, human rights \n     reports from the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala, documents \n     relating to cases other than my own, and letters written to \n     Members of Congress. I have also received blank sheets of \n     white paper.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not just some isolated document. This is \nbasically what a lot of the released documents look like here. This is \ndeclassified human rights documents, blank pages: ``Honduran armed \nservices human rights and corruption.'' A blank page.\n  Here is another example of the declassified documents released on her \ncase:\n\n       A U.S. ally has received U.S. Embassy and Honduran \n     government support.\n\n  It goes on. That has little or nothing to do with the situation \ninvolving Sister Ortiz. The rest is blank.\n  This is one of the released documents:\n\n       Press reports of January 1988 indicate that the 316 \n     battalion was deactivated in September 1987 to quell \n     speculation following allegations of death squad activities \n     made against the battalion.\n\n  The rest is blank, as if this were some highly pertinent document. \nThis is obviously not readable here at all. For the purpose of \ndemonstrating to my colleagues, here is what we are talking about. I \ncould go through this quickly. These are all blank pages. I am not \nfilling these in. These are sheets of blank pages that come up on this \nreport.\n  Now, obviously, there are legitimate concerns that intelligence \nagencies can have about just releasing any and all documents that \npeople would like to have access to. You can't tolerate that, even in a \ncase as moving as that of Sister Ortiz.\n  This amendment says that within 120 days of enactment of the \nunderlying bill it would search the documents for\n\n[[Page S9840]]\n\nrelevant material in Honduras and Guatemala if documents are discovered \nand found, and the agencies, for whatever reasons--there are a list of \nreasons--adopted in law where methods and sources could be revealed and \nother important information that could be harmful to U.S. interests. \nThen there is a panel made up of representatives from the Central \nIntelligence Agency, the Department of State, the Department of \nDefense, the Archivist of the United States and the Justice Department, \nwhich would review that request from the agency objecting to the \nrelease of certain documents. So there is a system whereby they would \nreview whether or not, in fact, the decision not to release information \nwas worthwhile.\n  So there is a process in place here. It is not worldwide. It is, in \nfact, situations surrounding these two countries. It involves an \nAmerican citizen who was brutally tortured and would like to get to the \nbottom of what happened to her--an American nun working in Honduras and \nin Guatemala doing work that she and others felt made a significant \ncontribution to the well-being of people there. She would like to find \nout why it happened. It is not asking too much, in the case of these \ntwo countries, for the declassification of documents which could help \nher pursue this case, again, allowing for a very legitimate process to \nbe in place so that there is not the unintentional release of documents \nthat could in some way compromise the interests of the United States.\n  That is the sum and substance of this amendment, Mr. President. I \nhope that our colleagues will see fit to be supportive of it. It \ndoesn't go too far, in my view. As I said, it is limited in scope, in \nterms of the countries involved, and also there is a process in place \nin this amendment that would allow for the information, in cases where \nit should not be released, to be withheld.\n  I also point out, Mr. President, that I am particularly grateful to \nmy colleagues, Senators Leahy, Mikulski, Kerry of Massachusetts and \nKerrey of Nebraska, the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nwho is a cosponsor of this amendment, along with Senator Harkin and \nseveral others who have joined with me in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter from Sister \nOrtiz, as well as the very moving testimony that she gave on June 25, \n1998, be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 2, 1998.\n     Senator Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: I cannot begin to thank you enough for \n     being in the forefront of the struggle for the Human Rights \n     Information Act. Thousands upon thousands of Guatemalans and \n     Hondurans await the outcome of Senate action on this \n     legislation which is of so much importance to them. It is, of \n     course, of great importance to me as well.\n       It may seem to many in Congress that my search for justice \n     is never-ending. This is hardly surprising for it is exactly \n     how it has felt to me during these past nine long years. \n     Despite my best efforts, I still don't know the truth of why \n     I was abducted and tortured nor have I obtained any \n     information on the identity of ``Alejandro.'' It is true that \n     various government agencies have released documents to me. \n     Now, let me tell you a little about them. They consist of \n     such (public) items as articles written by the press, human \n     rights reports from the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala, documents \n     relating to cases other than my own, and letters written to \n     members of Congress. I have also received black white sheets, \n     and a few messages from former Ambassador Thomas Stroock--one \n     written a week after I was abducted that stated: ``Her story, \n     as told is not accurate.'' Other cables from Stroock's \n     office/State Department describe me as a political \n     strategist, who had perhaps staged my own abduction to secure \n     a cut--off of U.S. aid to the Guatemalan military. These are \n     examples of ``relevant documents'' which have been released \n     to me.\n       In the summer of 1996, the Justice Department conducted a \n     criminal investigation. What I learned only during my \n     participation was that I was to be the subject of the \n     investigation and not those who abducted and tortured me. \n     During my testimony before the House Human Rights Caucus on \n     June 24th of this year, I spoke publicly of the treatment I \n     received at the hands of DOJ officials. I am enclosing that \n     testimony as both description of and further witness to how \n     my case has, in fact, been investigated.\n       Now, on top of all this, I have been told by a legislative \n     aide to another Senator that members of the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee are saying that only 3 or 4 documents \n     (pages) have been withheld from me. At this moment, a 284+ \n     page Classified Report pertaining to my case remains in the \n     hands of the Justice Department, which has been made \n     available to the Intelligence Oversight Board, the former \n     Ambassador to Guatemala, Thomas Stroock, and who knows how \n     many others. But I, on the other hand, am denied access to it \n     in order to protect my privacy and that of their sources, or \n     so I am told (refer to June 24th Statement enclosed).\n       Again Senator Dodd, I thank you for your efforts on behalf \n     of all who seek the truth. Like countless Guatemalans and \n     Hondurans, this is all I seek. By calling on my government to \n     declassify documents, I am simply pleading with it to allow \n     us to heal. I want to put this nightmare behind me. I want to \n     be able to have a good night's rest. I want peace--for myself \n     and for the people of Guatemala and Honduras. And I don't \n     think that is too much to ask.\n       In a spirit of gratitude,\n                                                     Dianna Ortiz,\n     OSU.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Congressional Human Rights Caucus Briefing on Torture\n\n                        (By Sister Dianna Ortiz)\n\n       Thank you all for coming. As a survivor of torture, I want \n     to urge you to support declassification of United States \n     government documents that shed light on human rights abuses. \n     Simply by declassifying documents, our government can save \n     lives. Survivors of human rights violations need to know as \n     much as possible about who committed the atrocities against \n     them. With this information, justice is possible, and only \n     justice can lay the foundation for reconciliation, stability, \n     and peace. Guatemala and Honduras are two countries that \n     would benefit immeasurably from full declassification. The \n     sticking point in these instances seems to be that the US has \n     supported the abusers.\n       Take my case, for example. In 1989, while I was working as \n     a missionary in Guatemala, I was abducted and brutally \n     tortured by Guatemalan security agents. My back was burned \n     over 100 times with cigarettes. I was gang-raped repeatedly. \n     I was beaten, and I was tortured psychologically as well--I \n     was lowered into a pit where injured women, children, and men \n     writhed and moaned, and dead decayed, under swarms of rats. \n     Finally, I was forced to stab another human being.\n       Throughout the ordeal, my Guatemalan torturers said that if \n     I did not cooperate, they would have to communicate with \n     Alejandro. My last minutes in detention, I met Alejandro, \n     whom the torturers referred to as their boss. He was tall and \n     fair skinned and spoke halting Spanish, with a thick American \n     accent. His English was American, flawless, unaccented. When \n     I asked him if he was an American, his answer was evasive: \n     ``Why do you want to know?''\n       He told me to get into his jeep and said he would take me \n     to a friend of his at the United States embassy, who would \n     help me leave the country. During the ride, he enjoined me to \n     forgive my torturers and said if I didn't, there would be \n     consequences for me. He reminded me that may torturers had \n     made videotapes and taken photos of the parts of the torture \n     I was most ashamed of. He said if I didn't forgive my \n     torturers, he would have no choice but to release those \n     photos and tapes to the press. At that point, I jumped out \n     the jeep and ran.\n       For the last nine years, I have tried to stop running. I \n     have tried to face the torturers head on and demand answers, \n     demanded justice. Instead of ``forgiving'' my torturers, I \n     filed suit against the Guatemalan government and called for \n     an investigation. Like so many investigations in Guatemala, \n     it led nowhere. Guatemalan and US officials alike said in \n     public and in private that I was a lesbian who had never been \n     tortured but had sneaked out for a tryst. The 111 cigarette \n     burns on my back were the result of kinky sex.\n       Two years ago, I held a five-week vigil before the White \n     House, asking for the declassification of all US government \n     documents related to human rights abuses in Guatemala since \n     1954, including documents on my own case. I asked to know the \n     identity of Alejandro. The Justice Department had begun an \n     investigation August 1995, and the Intelligence Oversight \n     Board had been investigating my case for more than a year, \n     but I still had no answers. Finally, after weeks of fasting \n     and camping day and night before the White House, a number of \n     State Department documents were released to me. The following \n     year, various FBI documents were declassified, but none of \n     these documents contained anything about the identities of my \n     torturers or of their boss, Alejandro.\n       Efforts to obtain information through US government \n     investigations also led nowhere. The Department of Justice \n     interviewed me for more than forty hours, during which time \n     DOJ attorneys accused me of lying. They interrogated my \n     friends and family members and generally made it clear that I \n     was the culprit, I was the one being investigated, not the US \n     government officials who might have acted wrongly in my case. \n     Ultimately, the investigators seemed unable to comprehend the \n     effects on a torture survivor of testifying in intricate \n     detail for hours on end. Extremely dangerous and painful \n     flashbacks were the consequence in my case. A torture \n     survivor should never be asked to re-enter the torture \n     chamber, to relive the brutal abuse. After I had given the \n     great majority\n\n[[Page S9841]]\n\n     of my testimony, I felt compelled to withdraw from direct \n     participation in the DOJ investigation. The investigators had \n     the sketches I had made with the help of a professional \n     forensic artist, delineating the characteristics of each \n     torturer, including Alejandro, and the investigators had my \n     testimony, in detail. The responsibility for finding answers \n     lay with them.\n       Because I could no longer subject myself to the \n     retraumatization brought on by the investigators' questions \n     and manner, the DOJ closed my case. Exactly what the DOJ's \n     final conclusions were, I do not know. I do know that as a \n     result of the investigation, the DOJ came up with a 200+page \n     report, which is classified. The Department of Justice told \n     me the report was classified to protect sources and methods \n     and to protect my own privacy. Dan Seikely, who was in charge \n     of the Department of Justice investigation, said only three \n     people would be able to see the report: Attorney General \n     Janet Reno, the deputy attorney general, and himself. Only \n     four copies of the report existed, he said, and they would be \n     kept under lock and key.\n       In recent months, however, it has become clear to me that a \n     number of other people have read the report. A government \n     official recently told me that he had seen the report and \n     added that officials in the State Department also had seen \n     it, as had Thomas Stroock, the US ambassador to Guatemala at \n     the time I was abducted. I can't help but wonder how my \n     government intends to protect my privacy by releasing the \n     report to such individuals. It was under Stroock's command \n     that an embassy staff member told a visiting religious \n     delegation--``I'm tired of all these lesbian nuns coming down \n     to Guatemala.'' It was Stroock who said, a week after I was \n     abducted, before any embassy member had interviewed me, ``Her \n     story as told is not accurate.'' It was Stroock who told the \n     State Department that my motives were questionable, that I \n     had perhaps staged my own abduction to secure a cut-off of US \n     aid to the Guatemalan army. Yet it is Stroock to whom the US \n     government gives the report--a report so private that even I \n     cannot see it. After he had read the DOJ report, Stroock \n     spoke to a journalist, who in turn called me. Stroock was \n     informing the press of his access to the report. In spite of \n     his questionable right to see it, he was making no secret of \n     the privileges he enjoyed. There are things in the report \n     that I have kept secret, that I have been ashamed of--\n     things that I didn't tell DOJ investigators but that my \n     friends revealed as they were being interrogated--and I \n     have lived under this tacit blackmail: If I push for more \n     answers in my case, or if I even file a Freedom of \n     Information Act request to get the DOJ report \n     declassified, the secret information the investigators \n     have will be leaked.\n       Instead of having that information leaked, let me simply \n     tell you: I got pregnant as a result of the multiple gang \n     rapes by my torturers, and unable to carry within me what \n     they had engendered, what I could view only as a monster, the \n     product of the men who had raped me, I turned to someone for \n     assistance and I destroyed that life. Am I proud of this \n     decision? No. But if I had to make the decision again, I \n     believe I would again decide as I did eight years ago.\n       I had little choice. My survival was so precarious at that \n     time that to have to grow within me what the torturers had \n     left me would have killed me. I tell you this simply to free \n     myself so that I can proceed to uncover the truth. Today, I \n     am filing a FOIA to demand the DOJ report on my case. After \n     such anguish that the DOJ interviews caused me, I have the \n     right to know what was learned in my case, what conclusions \n     were reached and why. I demand access to the report, the same \n     access that members of the State Department, Thomas Stroock, \n     and members of the Intelligence Oversight Board have had, in \n     spite of Seikely's guarantee of confidentiality.\n       I want to be able to evaluate the thoroughness of the \n     investigation so that I can make informed decisions about \n     what step to take next. My torturers were never brought to \n     justice. It is possible that, individually, they will never \n     be identified or apprehended. And in some senses, I would \n     like to resign myself to this fact and move on. I have a \n     responsibility, however, to the people of Guatemala and to \n     the people of the world, a responsibility to insist on \n     accountability where accountability is possible. If the US \n     government was involved in my torture in Guatemala, in what \n     other countries of the world are torturers receiving orders \n     from Americans? We have to know what the United States has \n     done and where. For our own peace of mind as US citizens and \n     for the good of the citizens of the world, we need the files \n     released. If the US has done nothing wrong, then we can all \n     rest easy. If the US is culpable, we must know this and \n     expose this and take steps to ensure that our government \n     never again collaborates with or hires torturers, in any \n     place, for any reason.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again, at the request of the managers of the \nbill, at this point, I will yield the floor. I presume what will happen \nis that there are other Members who may show up to debate the McCain \namendment, and then there would be a vote on that, and then there may \nbe another amendment that would be disposed of. If I could be notified \nby my staff, or others, as to when the appropriate time to come back \nand engage in a further debate with those who have a differing point of \nview, I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If my friend has completed his remarks, we will simply \nlay aside his amendment. Senator Thomas is here to speak on the McCain \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Kentucky very, very much for his \ncourtesies in this, and my colleagues, as well, who have other \namendments pending. I appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Dodd \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3500, As Further modified\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to address briefly the McCain \namendment on S. 2334. I will talk a little bit about the situation in \nNorth Korea and the bill relating to the Korean Peninsula Energy \nDevelopment Organization, KEDO. I have been chairman of the \nSubcommittee on East Asia for almost 4 years, and we have held five \nhearings on North Korea during that time--more than any other single \ncountry, with the exception of China. In all of that time, I have \ncontinued to be amazed at and concerned by the dangerous, unpredictable \nand unbalanced nature of the regime in North Korea. Despite widespread \nstarvation and disease, the Government continues to adhere to the very \neconomic policies which have led to famine in the first place. Despite \nthe worldwide reputation of communism, the Government continues to \nrevolve around sort of a Stalinist cult of personality slavishly \ndevoted to Kim Jong Il.\n  Despite international norms and conventions, the North Koreans \ncontinue to sell nuclear and conventional missile technology to such \nrogue states as Iraq and Libya in violation of the Nuclear \nProliferation Treaty. Despite the terms of the Agreed Nuclear Framework \nwith the United States, North Korea continues to develop its program \naimed at producing nuclear missiles.\n  Mr. President, I have been sort of a begrudging supporter of the \nAgreed Framework since its inception. Although the agreement is far \nfrom perfect, I supported it because I believed that, in the end, it \nwas in our best interest and in the best interest of the East Asia \nregion to do so. I supported it through its fits and starts. I \nsupported it when the North diverted oil deliveries to military use and \nwhen the North showed signs of restarting their nuclear program. I \nsupported it because, on the whole, North Korean movement forward in \nthe Four-Party Talks and cooperation in the nuclear area outweighed the \nNorth's traditional tendency to always push the envelope with us.\n  Mr. President, when North Korea fired off a missile last week over \nJapanese air space, it was kind of the straw that broke the camel's \nback. This is what I consider to be a clearly belligerent act and \nshould drive home the fact to this body that the Agreed Framework has \nbeen gutted by North Korea. At present, it seems no better than the \npaper on which it was written. Time after time, the DPRK has broken its \ncommitment under the agreement. While the North took our oil and \ndragged its heels, it has constructed underground facilities to test \nboth propulsion and warhead systems with only one purpose: the \ndevelopment of long- and short-range nuclear weapon capabilities.\n\n  Frankly, I have a sinking feeling that they have used us, played us \nfor a fool, and have played it very well. Mr. President, I intend to \nmeet with the Defense Intelligence Agency this week, and to hold a \nhearing next week in our subcommittee to examine the present situation \nand to ask the State Department and Defense Department some tough \nquestions.\n  If these questions can't be answered to our satisfaction, and if we \ncan't be convinced that adherence to the Agreed Framework under the \ncircumstances are in our best interests, then our support, I am sure, \nwill evaporate very quickly.\n  I am pleased that we are considering it here. I am supportive of the \nMcCain amendment. I look forward to having a chance to vote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9842]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment reflects a significant \nchange in course on how we administer U.S. assistance in Haiti. From a \npractical standpoint, the amendment will not decrease our total \ncommitment to the people of Haiti. However, it does place very clear \nrestrictions on assistance to the Haitian government.\n  To best understand the reasons for this amendment--and why we have \nchosen to place more conditions on direct aid to the government of \nHaiti--it is important to first talk about the current situation in \nHaiti.\n  Mr. President, I have visited Haiti six times in the past three \nyears. I have taken a great interest in assisting the people of Haiti \nas they establish, develop and sustain democracy, economic stability \nand a better quality of life. Through these visits, I have had the \nopportunity to see what changes have taken place and the general \ndirection of events in Haiti.\n  My colleagues may recall that on April 3, 1998, I provided the Senate \nan update on the current economic, and political state of Haiti. At \nthat time, I stated that Haiti's political system was not stable. \nLittle has changed for the better since then. This continued \ninstability is of direct concern to the United States. The concern of \ncourse is that this unstable democracy could descend into outright \nchaos. If this occurs, the result could be an exodus of boat people \ncoming to our shores.\n  Mr. President, let me mention a few key facts to describe the current \nsituation there.\n  First, it has been over 14 months since then Haitian Prime Minister \nRosny Smarth resigned due to his frustration with the government's \ninability to resolve an electoral dispute and implement his economic \nmodernization plan. Since then, a Prime Minister has not been confirmed \nby the Parliament.\n  The Prime Minister is designated as the Chief Executive of the \nGovernment. He appoints the Cabinet and basically runs the government. \nWithout a Prime Minister, the country simply cannot function. Bills \nthat may be passed by the Haitian Parliament cannot be signed into law \nand the privatization of any government industries cannot be fully \nimplemented.\n  It is truly unfortunate, that to date, this vacancy has not been \nfilled. The current Education Minister has been nominated for the \nposition. It is, however, unclear if he will be confirmed by the \nHaitian Senate. One of the main reasons for this continued delay stems \nfrom the Haitian government's inability to resolve the serious \ndiscrepancy surrounding the April 1997 elections.\n  This current political impasse stems from pervasive fraud and \nimproper vote tabulation regarding elections held in April of 1997. Not \nonly have the Haitian opposition political parties demanded that the \nApril 1997 elections be annulled, the international community, \nincluding the United Nations, has also deemed the elections--which \nproduced only a meager five percent turnout--fraudulent. The opposition \npolitical parties continue to insist that they will not move forward to \nconfirm a Prime Minister until the April 1997 electoral dispute is \nresolved.\n  This paralysis in government is being felt everywhere: economic \nreform efforts have stalled. The legislature still has not passed a \nbudget. It has not enacted structural reforms needed to free up over \n$100 million in foreign assistance, nor has it approved loans for \nmillions in technical assistance. The process of privatizing key \ngovernment industries is dramatically slow, as are plans to downsize \nthe public sector. With progress impeded by a political stalemate it is \nno surprise that potential investors who could play a key role in \nuplifting Haiti's economic development are discouraged from going \nforward.\n  Complicating matters even more was an upcoming national/municipal \nelection in Haiti slated for November 1998. Hundreds of seats were up, \nincluding the entire lower chamber of the Haitian Parliament, up to \ntwo-thirds of the Senate and all municipal seats. Since there continues \nto be no resolution to the irregularities surrounding the previous \nelection, however, the elections that constitutionally should be held \nin November have not been scheduled nor is there reason to believe that \nthey will occur any earlier than next spring. All of this raises even \nmore questions and concerns on Haiti's ability to administer future \nelections, including the presidential elections scheduled for the year \n2000.\n  Democracy literally is at a standstill in Haiti. And it will remain \nstagnant until previous electoral disputes are resolved, and a \ncredible, nonpartisan, competent electoral commission to oversee \nelections is established.\n  The composition of the electoral commission is the key source of \ncontroversy. A number of opposition parties in Haiti would like to have \nsome representation on the commission, or at least make sure that the \ncommission is neutral and not biased.\n  Mr. President, I understand that Haitian President Preval recently \nsaid he will move forward with naming a provisional electoral council. \nThere is concern that he intends not to consult with all opposition \nparties--meaning that the interests of other political parties will \nlikely be excluded. This step would not seem to be an effective way to \nresolve the current political impasse.\n\n  When I spoke about Haiti last April, I urged that no U.S. assistance \nbe used to underwrite the proposed November elections until a \nsettlement of the April 1997 electoral dispute is reached--and until a \nfair and independent Electoral Council is established in accordance \nwith the constitution. I am pleased that these conditions on funding \nare currently in the pending Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, as \nwell as in the House version.\n  Even if the electoral disputes are resolved and an electoral \ncommission appointed, democracy cannot be sustained as long as lethal \nviolence is seem as an effective tool to achieve political goals. To \ndate, not one single case of the dozens of political killings that have \noccurred in Haiti since the early 1990's have been resolved. As a \nresult, no one has been convicted and sentenced for any one of these \ncrimes.\n  Mr. President, according to a House International Relations Committee \nstaff report released just last week, fears of a new wave of political \nkillings are on the rise following the recent murder of a Catholic \npriest who was a vocal critic of the current government, as well as of \nformer President Aristide. The report also states that ``A key \nopposition leader expressed concern that three other political figures \nmay be targeted for assassination.''\n  Not only have opposition political leaders been allegedly threatened, \nHaitians working for democratic institutions such as the International \nRepublican Institute have also been targeted for intimidation and \nthreats on their lives. One Haitian IRI employee was even held at \ngunpoint for his involvement in democratic activities in Haiti.\n  Mr. President, I also am concerned about new reports of drug \ncorruption within the Haitian government. Specifically, there have been \nnumerous reports in Haitian newspapers that Haitian National Police \nemployees were arrested for involvement in drug trafficking. Haiti has \nbecome increasingly attractive as a transit point for international \ndrug traffickers. Unless we address this situation soon, Haiti could \nturn into a full-fledged narco-state. And that means more and more \nillegal drugs coming through Haiti to the United States.\n  Mr. President, I have given you a brief outline and assessment of the \ncurrent political situation in Haiti.\n  It has been the policy of this Congress for three years that until \nthe Haitian government is able to meet specific economic, political and \nsocial reforms, our assistance to that government should be extremely \nlimited. The money, instead should go to benefit Haitians directly.\n\n[[Page S9844]]\n\n  That was the fundamental purpose of an amendment originally offered \nby our former Majority Leader, Bob Dole in 1995. Under the original \nDole amendment, benchmarks for reform had to be met if assistance was \nto be provided. If these conditions were not met, government assistance \nwould be transferred to non-governmental organizations, of NGOs. In the \nend, the President called for and received from Congress the power to \nwaive these conditions and allow aid to go forward if he believed \nrestricting aid to the Haitian government posed a national security \nconcern to the United States. Congress included this national security \nwaiver with the hope that things would improve in Haiti. Each year for \nthe past three years, we have renewed the Dole amendment with some \nmarginal modifications. Each year, the President has exercised his \nwaiver authority to keep U.S. aid flowing to the Haitian government. \nAnd each year we hope the Haitian government will finally get its act \ntogether.\n  Well, Mr. President, three years have gone by. And the situation \nremains bleak. Based on a review of that situation, I now believe that \nit is necessary to go back to the original Dole proposal by removing \nthe national security waiver. We have tried--patiently--for three years \nto work with the Haitian government to establish and sustain democracy \nthere. Yet, I find it extremely difficult to invest in a government \nthat is not willing to make changes to advance democracy and its \neconomic health. We have spent well over $2 billion in the past four \nyears in Haiti.\n  We should continue to fund programs through NGOs that will benefit \nHaitians. But giving the government money for programs if they are not \nwilling to implement needed political and economic reforms is wasted \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, let me turn now to an explanation of my amendment to \nthe this bill. Let me first make it clear that this amendment does not \nprohibit assistance to Haiti. Just like current law, this amendment \nconditions our assistance to the Government of Haiti--but not the \nHaitian people. That means that any funds distrtibuted to Haiti through \nNGOs for the benefit of Haitians will not be threatened nor compromised \nin any manner.\n  Let me first outline the important general conditions that the \nHaitian government must meet before we believe it receives any \nadditional funding from the US government. These conditions are \noutlined--almost verbatim--in the pending Senate and House Foreign \nOperations Approprations bill.\n\n  These general conditions include:\n  First, the Haitian government must re-sign the Agreement on Migration \nInterdiction and Operations with the United States and must cooperate \nwith the US in halting illegal emigration from Haiti. It has been \nnearly four years since this agreement expired and the US government \nhas been waiting for Haiti to resign this agreement.\n  The second condition is that the Haitian government must conduct \nthorough investigations of extrajudicial and political killings and \nthat it must cooperate with US authorities in these investigations. \nThere have been dozens of political murders in Haiti over the past \nseveral years. Not a single one has been solved. That has got to \nchange.\n  Third, the Haitian government must take action to remove from the \nHaitian National Police, and other national palace and ministerial \nguards, individuals who are credibly alleged to have engaged in or \nconspired to conceal gross violations of human rights or to have \nengaged in narcotics trafficking.\n  Fourth, that the Haitian government must complete privatization of at \nleast three major public entities. The Haitian government is now years \nbehind its own drafted scheduled in privatizing several key public \nentities.\n  The final condition is that the Haitian government must implement the \ncounter-narcotics agreements recently signed between both countries \nlast October. There are a total of six counter-narcotics agreements \nincluding the Ship Rider and Maritime Pursuit Agreements which allow US \nlaw enforcement to patrol Haitian waters for drug interdiction matters. \nThese agreements basically allow for instantaneous implementation of \ndrug enforcement activities between the two countries.\n  These are very important and reasonable conditions that must be met \nbefore the US government releases any general assistance directly to \nthe government of Haiti. Many of them are not new.\n  Let me now address a more controversial question--whether the \nAdministration can waive these conditions for national security \nreasons, and allow funding to go forward. For the past three years, the \nAdministration has exercised its waiver authority to allow funding to \ngo to the government. The pending bill before us continues this waiver; \nthe pending House bill does not. My amendment would adopt the House \nversion on this point. We must send a message to the government of \nHaiti that we cannot continue to give them money if they lack political \nwill to make necessary reforms.\n  Mr. President, while my amendment would remove the national security \ninterest waiver; there are several important exceptions to this \namendment as well as in the pending bill that would enable the US \ngovernment to continue funding certain important government programs. \nTaken together, these exceptions include--counter-narcotics assistance; \nsupport for the Haitian National Police's Special Investigative Unit; \nthe International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program; \ncustoms assistance; anti-corruption programs; urgent humanitarian \nassistance; and education. There is also a separate provision on \nconditioning electoral and administration of justice assistance to the \ngovernment of Haiti under a separate set of conditions.\n  One additional point I want to make is while I have included several \nadditional exceptions to the Limitation of Assistance provision to the \ngovernment of Haiti--I intend to explore during the conference of this \nbill the possible need to limit the total amount of money the Haitian \ngovernment can receive if conditions set for in this amendment are not \nmet while assistance to the government in these areas continues to \nflow.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, I would like to mention two \nessential assistance programs that we provide to Haiti through NGO's.\n  First and foremost, US assistance through P.L. 480 Title II feeding \nprograms to the poor is absolutely critical and should be continued. \nThere are impoverished people in Haiti--particularly children--who \ndesperately need help. They are not responsible for the country's \npolitical crisis. They should not have to suffer because of it.\n  Mr. President, there has been a proliferation of facilities in Haiti \nwhich must care not only for a vast number of orphans but also for an \nincreasing number of abandoned and neglected children. The capital \ncity, Port-au-Prince, has seventy orphanages--all of these which are \nrun by only one relief organization, Christian Relief Services (CRS). \nThere are many other orphanages throughout the entire country which \ntake care of thousands and thousands of orphaned and abandoned children \nin Haiti.\n  I have visited these facilities in Haiti and I can give you a first-\nhand account of the heart breaking stories. The flow of desperate \nchildren into these orphanges is constant and these institutions face \nan increasing challenge in accommodating all of these needy children. \nThe sad part is that these many of these orphanages get no other means \nof support other than the food administered to them through CRS, which \nin turn receives its resources through AID.\n\n  Last year and again this year, I have worked with Senators Cochran \nand Bumpers--the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee--to ensure we continue the emergency \nfeeding programs in Haiti through the PL 480 Title feeding program. I \nthank Chairman Cochran and Senator Bumpers for their assistance in \nfunding this program last year and for doing so again in this year's \nbill.\n  Similarly, I have worked with Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy to \ninclude up to $250,000 to support a pilot program to assist Haitian \nchildren in orphanages. The objective behind the program is to find \nways to help orphanages better organize and manage themselves to seek \noutside help for resources for these children. I thank the Chairman, \nand Senator Leahy for funding this initiative last year and for doing \nso again in the pending bill.\n  Another very important assistance program that should be maintained, \nif\n\n[[Page S9845]]\n\nnot expanded, is agricultural assistance programs. Agricultural \nproduction in Haiti is extremely low. In the long run, agricultural \nproduction is necessary if Haiti is to provide jobs and food for its \npopulation.\n  Haiti today imports two thirds of its food. Every day, thousands of \nHaitians leave rural areas where they are unable to provide for \nthemselves, and flood into the cities which are unable to sustain the \npopulation pressures. In the long run, agricultural and rural \ndevelopment is crucial to the goal of providing jobs, income and food \nfor Haiti's people.\n  To further develop the rural and agricultural sectors of Haiti, \nattention needs to be given to a decentralized development strategy. I \nbelieve that continued focus on non-governmental organizations is \nappropriate. In fact, current USAID funding for agriculture and \nenvironmental programs in Haiti is all administered through NGOs. I \nbelieve that we should be promoting regional development and that \nassociations linking private sector interests with local government \nneed to be established. One way to do this is to link our own \nsuccessful foundations and institutions of higher education together \nwith local Haitians interested in pursuing this goal.\n  Given the importance of developing and expanding sound agriculture \nand environment programs in Haiti, I intend to work with Chairman \nMcConnell and Senator Leahy to ensure that at least 20% of our total \nassistance for Haiti be for the promotion of agriculture and \nenvironment programs in Haiti. It is my hope that they will accept this \nrequest in conference report language.\n  Mr. President, I cannot overestimate enough the need to continue \nassistance programs to Haiti through the NGO community. We want to help \nHaitians in terms of feeding programs, agriculture and environment \nprograms, and other initiatives such as basic health and education.\n  Mr. President, as you can see from the specifics of my speech, I have \ngiven serious thought to our assistance policy toward Haiti. U.S. \npolicy toward Haiti is complicated. As I said at the beginning of these \nremarks, establishing, developing and sustaining democracy in Haiti is \nan important national interest.\n  One thing is clear: The U.S. cannot do for Haiti what it will not do \nfor itself. The Haitians first have to realize the need to solve their \npolitical crisis. They clearly have not yet hit rock bottom; maybe \nthat's what it will take to create the political will to move forward. \nUnfortunately, I do not yet see the requisite political will and \ndetermination in Haiti.\n  In the meantime, we cannot just walk away from Haiti completely. We \nmust find ways to help the Haitian people, primarily through NGO's--\nsince the Haitian Government has proven itself to be incapable of \nproviding for its own people.\n  There's a tough road ahead for Haiti. With this amendment, we are \nhelping to set some realistic conditions whereby that country can \nsucceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3528 through 3534) en bloc were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I heard the distinguish Senator from \nKentucky say--and I know we have word of those who wish to speak. The \nSenator from Kentucky and I have been on the floor, as have other \nSenators, since early yesterday morning on this bill. We are within \nsight of land, and we would kind of like to get some things moving.\n  If people have a matter they wish to add to the debate, or a matter \nthat they wish to say, or things that they feel the Senate should \nconsider for this side of the aisle, I would strongly urge them to come \nto do that, because there will be the effort of the chairman and myself \nto wrap this bill up as soon as we can.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Vermont that as \nfar as we are aware there are only three more amendments that may \nrequire a rollcall vote, and then we would be ready to go to final \npassage. So we can, indeed, see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3500, As further modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while waiting for others, I note with \nregard to the North Korea McCain amendment that I stand behind no \nMember of this body in my respect for my friend from Arizona, and \ncertainly I know no one who has followed the situation in North Korea \ncloser than he has. I give him a great deal of weight for his insight. \nI understand his concerns. I share them. I suspect that most Senators \ndo, especially as we watched the unbelievably irresponsible activity on \nthe part of North Korea in their recent missile firing.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment would prevent the United States from \nfulfilling its obligations under the Korea nuclear reactor agreement. \nMaybe the Congress will make that decision to do that. Of course the \nCongress can. But I hope that Senators would think long and hard before \nwe go down that road. This North Korea agreement is not perfect. There \nis no disagreement about that on this side of the aisle. There is also \nno disagreement about the behavior of the North Korean Government. It \nis reprehensible. At times it seems inexplicable. It is certainly the \nmost irresponsible activity of any country on Earth today. They almost \nseem to want the United States to back out of this agreement.\n  But I think the questions we should ask, if I could have the \nattention of my friend from Arizona, would be just these:\n  Does the Secretary of Defense support this amendment? Does the \ncommander of our forces in Korea support the amendment? What do they \nthink the level of danger between the United States and North Korea \nwill be with this amendment?\n  I ask this because I share the frustration of the Senator from \nArizona toward North Korea.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I appreciate the efforts of the \ndistinguished Chairman of the subcommittee who mentioned he has had \nfive hearings on this issue. We obviously paid close attention to the \nSenator from Wyoming who now feels that the time has come to support \nthis amendment. I believe that the commander of the forces in Korea, \nthe Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, probably the national \nsecurity adviser, and even the President, if he knows about the \namendment, is probably in opposition.\n  I want to tell the Senator from Vermont this agreement was flawed \nfrom the beginning. I stood on the floor of the Senate and said it \nwould fail. It was a bribe. It was kicking the can down the road. There \nwas no inspections required. The reality is that North Korea, which is \nthe most Orwellian, bizarre government in history, they have a ruler \nwho is--well, he likes to kidnap Japanese movie actresses. We are \nsupposed to trust the word of these people? And they just launched a \nmissile--a two-stage missile--which every arms control expert in \nAmerica will tell you that you don't build these kind of missiles \nunless they are armed with weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  This thing was wrong from the start, and everything that we have seen \nhas proven that to be the case, including every major newspaper in \nAmerica--the L.A. Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and, \nfrankly, the former national security adviser, Mr. Brzezinski, and many \nothers; Dr. Kissinger, and many others.\n  For each expert that the Senator from Vermont could present, I could \ngive you one who is as well regarded, or more highly regarded, who \nfeels that it is time that we at least demand that they stop building \nnuclear weapons.\n  I reply to the Senator from Vermont. The amendment simply says that \nwe won't continue to pay them millions of dollars if they in return \ncontinue to try to build nuclear weapons, which is what the whole \nagreement was about, supposedly, to start with.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator for his answer, which is precisely \nwhat I anticipated. I am not suggesting experts are in opposition. I \nmerely wanted, for purposes of debate, to have that.\n  He speaks of these Orwellian, bizarre people. I suspect it is giving \nthe North Korean leadership the benefit of the doubt to call them \nOrwellian and bizarre. They are worse than that. We can't ignore what \nhas happened there.\n\n[[Page S9846]]\n\n But we are not dealing with rationale people.\n  Had I been the one to write the agreement we have with them, I would \nlike to think that I would have written it a lot differently than it \nis. But I also understand the concerns that countries like South Korea, \nJapan, and others have put a lot more money and a lot more effort into \nthis agreement than the United States has.\n  I do not want to give the North Korean Government an excuse to make \nthe situation we now have a lot worse.\n  We have done some things with this agreement. The North Korean \nnuclear facility at Yongbyon and Taechom have been frozen under the \nIAEA inspection. Virtually all of the spent fuel in the Yongbyon \nreactor has been safely canned under IAEA seals. Those are spelled \nforth.\n  At the same time, this is a country which I think both the Senator \nfrom Arizona and I would agree has the ability to make inspections. The \nability to determine what they are doing is probably as difficult as \nany country in the world. What makes it worse, unlike some other \ncountries where it is difficult to find out what they are doing, they \nare not countries with the potential nuclear power and potential \nnuclear weapons power.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withhold the suggestion of the absence of a quorum. I see the \nSenator from Arizona on the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, is it still the desire of the Senator from \nVermont that--does Senator Levin still wish to speak on this?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder if the Senator from Arizona and the distinguished \nchairman would mind if we put in a quorum call for 2 minutes. If at \nthat time we do not hear from the Senator, I will not do anything to \ndelay this further.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And then there will be no objection to lifting it \nlater?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, if I may, I wish to make another comment \nor so on this amendment.\n  I understand the notion that you want to make this thing work, and we \nhave tried for quite a long time. It just seems to me that around the \nworld right now in a number of places we are having these kinds of \ncountries with the dictators sort of testing the United States, saying, \n``You have told us certain things, we have made certain agreements, but \nwe are not going to keep them, and what are you going to do about it?''\n  I feel as if that is an increasing tendency around the world, and \nthis is one of them, as well as Iraq and some other places. So I think \nwe want to continue to work, we would like to have the KEDO agreement, \nwe would like to go ahead with the light-water reactor to avoid the \nnuclear development in North Korea, but that is the deal. And if that \nisn't being adhered to, then I think you have to do something. I think \nwe have to take a tougher position than we have in the past.\n  I just do not see that it is good for the United States in the future \nto be making agreements with these sorts of rogue countries, trying to \nmake things better, going ahead and doing our part, and them not doing \ntheirs. I think that is what this amendment is about. And what we are \nchallenged with, frankly, is to say, ``We have things that need to be \ndone, we are willing to work with you, but you have to keep up your \npart of the bargain.'' I think that is what this is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  By the way, if I may take that back, I was also listening to Senator \nDodd's proposal that has to do with things in Central America that have \nbeen kept secret, and I am very much interested in part of that myself, \nthe Sister Ortiz thing that really needs to be declassified, in my \njudgment. So I just wanted to comment that I speak in support of the \nDodd amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I move to table the McCain amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the McCain amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nCoverdell), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Mr. Murkowski), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Kempthorne), \nand the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback) are necessarily absent.\n  I also anounce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), \nthe Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. \nInouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 11, nays 80, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 257 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--11\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Daschle\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--80\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--9\n\n     Bingaman\n     Brownback\n     Coverdell\n     Domenici\n     Glenn\n     Helms\n     Inouye\n     Kempthorne\n     Murkowski\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3500), as further \nmodified, was rejected.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I voted to table the McCain amendment \nbecause I believe it undermines the agreement we have in place with \nNorth Korea that is designed to denuclearize North Korea. This could \neffectively give North Korea an excuse to produce plutonium that it \ncould use for nuclear weapons, which would be absolutely contrary to \nour most basic national security interests.\n  The McCain amendment would add a requirement for a certification \nrelative to North Korea that would undermine the Agreed Framework that \nhas frozen North Korea's nuclear weapons plutonium production program, \nbecause it would change the terms of that agreement. Before any of the \nfiscal year 1999 funds for implementation of that Agreed Framework \ncould be spent, the McCain amendment would require the President to \ncertify that North Korea is essentially denuclearized, which is not yet \nthe case but which is the very goal of the Agreed Framework.\n  The Agreed Framework stipulates that North Korea must freeze its \nplutonium production facilities, namely three graphite-moderated \nnuclear reactors (either operating or under construction) and a \nplutonium reprocessing facility, in exchange for an international \nconsortium (the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, or \nKEDO) providing two proliferation-resistant light water nuclear power \nreactors.\n  Before the U.S. delivers key nuclear components to the North Korean \nlight-water reactor program, North Korea must come into full compliance \nwith its nuclear safeguards agreement with the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA) under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). \nIt was understood from the outset that it would take a number of years, \nand probably\n\n[[Page S9847]]\n\nnot before the year 2003, before North Korea would come into full \ncompliance with its obligations under the NPT.\n  The whole idea of the Agreed Framework was in fact to bring North \nKorea into full compliance with the NPT and to go beyond the NPT's \nrequirements by requiring North Korea to freeze and then dismantle its \nplutonium production facilities, and to place all its spent nuclear \nfuel in canisters safeguarded and monitored by the IAEA and eventually \nremove that spent fuel from North Korea. These represent significant \nsecurity gains for the United States and we should honor our \ncommitments under the agreement to realize these gains.\n  We should not give North Korea an excuse to walk away from its \nobligations under the Agreed Framework and to resume the production of \nplutonium for nuclear weapons. I believe that is what the McCain \namendment would do, and that is why I voted to table the McCain \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3526\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, is the Senator from Kentucky correct \nthat the pending amendment is the Hutchison amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding Senator Hutchison may want to \nmodify her amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I would like to offer a modification \nto my amendment that will be argued and offered by Senator Coats from \nIndiana. It is acceptable to me as a modification of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify the \namendment.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. There is apparently some question about clearing this \namendment, which we believe is not objectionable to anybody. But I have \njust been informed it is cleared. I would like to----\n  Mr. LEAHY. I tell the Senator from Indiana he is correct on that.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator.\n  I would like a brief amount of time in which to explain what the \nmodification is, because it is relevant to the action that was just \ntaken by the Senate and I think important and determinative perhaps of \naction that will be taken subsequent to the disposition of this bill by \nthe Senate in the conference. I am willing to do that at whatever time \nis appropriate. I know the majority leader is here, and I defer to him \non that or to any other business that the----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The majority leader would like to make a few comments, \nif you would just withhold.\n  Mr. COATS. I would be more than pleased to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know other Senators may want to speak briefly also on \nthis subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9837-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9847-S9851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SENATOR STROM THURMOND CASTS HIS 15,000TH VOTE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I speak, I am sure, for the entire Senate \nin extending congratulations to Senator Thurmond, a great Senator from \nSouth Carolina, for having just cast his 15,000th vote in this Chamber.\n  An occasion like this reminds us of the continuity and the stability \nwhich the framers of the Constitution sought to establish in the \nSenate. I am sure that they had Senator Strom Thurmond in mind when \nthey sought that. In the person of Senator Thurmond their intent was \nmost notably fulfilled.\n  I am sure that if our distinguished President pro tempore were to ask \nwhich of those 15,000 votes he considers his most important, he would \nprobably respond, even though I am sure he was proud of the vote he \njust cast, that the most important one is the next vote, for Strom \nalways looks ahead.\n  Today, we join him in looking ahead, not recounting the tremendous \nrecord that he sets with this vote and all the votes of the past but, \nrather, counting on his future votes for what is good and right for the \ncountry he has served so long.\n  Madam President, this is a milestone. This is a magnificent gentleman \nwho brings tremendous credit to his constituency, his State, to the \nU.S. Senate, and to America. I am very proud to call him a colleague \nand to commend him for this 15,000th vote he has just cast.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I join my colleagues in congratulating \ntoday the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  With the previous vote, Senator Thurmond joins the extraordinary \nSenator Robert C. Byrd, as one of only two U.S. Senators in the history \nof our Nation to cast 15,000 votes in this institution.\n  People outside of the Senate may not understand how astounding an \nachievement that is.\n  Let me put it this way: If this were baseball, Senator Thurmond and \nSenator Byrd would be Mark McGwire and Cal Ripken rolled into one. It \nis unlikely any of us will ever see their likes again.\n  But this is not baseball.\n  This is something even more fundamental to who we are as Americans.\n  This is the United States Senate. This is the place where we make the \nlaws for a nation dedicated to the rule of law.\n  To serve here is a great honor--and an even greater responsibility.\n  In his 45 years in this body, Senator Thurmond has fought \npassionately to fulfill that responsibility as he has understood it. \nHis tenacity and dedication to the causes in which he believes are \nlegendary.\n  He fought for 20 years to require warning labels on alcohol. In 1988, \nthanks to Senator Thurmond's unwavering leadership, the Senate finally \nvoted to do just that.\n  Five years later, in a tragic irony, Senator Thurmond's family \nexperienced the kind of agony known to too many American families.\n  His beloved daughter Nancy was lost, killed by a drunk driver. She \nwas only 22.\n  Nothing can heal the pain of losing someone so dear.\n  But I hope that this distinguished Senator takes some comfort in \nknowing that, thanks to his tenacity, perhaps another father, somewhere \nin America, will tuck his own little girl safely into bed tonight, \ninstead of mourning her too-early death at the hands of a drunk driver.\n  Senator Thurmond truly is an institution within an institution.\n  His long and distinguished career is remarkable for its many \nsuccesses--both in and out of the Senate.\n  In addition to being the longest-serving U.S. Senator in history, he \nhas also served as a senator in the South Carolina State legislature \nand as Governor of that great State.\n  He has been a senior member of both the Democratic and Republican \nparties and the Presidential candidate of a third party. How many more \npeople can say that in this country?\n  He volunteered for service in World War II and, on June 5, 1945, at \nthe age of 43, took part in the first drop of the D-Day invasion--the \nair drop of American troops on Normandy Beach.\n  I am told that Senator Thurmond wanted to parachute onto Normandy \nBeach. But another officer--who clearly did not know who he was dealing \nwith--decided Senator Thurmond was too old to jump out of an airplane. \nSo he piloted a glider instead, landing, with the rest of his company, \nbehind enemy lines.\n  Senator Thurmond is today a retired major general in the Army \nreserves.\n  He is also a member of the South Carolina Hall of Fame, and a \nrecipient of more honors and awards than any of us can name, including \nthe prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n  Years from now, when we look back on this summer, millions of \nAmericans will tell their grandchildren what it was like to watch Mark \nMcGwire and Sammy Sosa chase Roger Maris' home run record.\n  If I am lucky enough to have grandchildren, I will tell them about a \nmilestone that was reached this summer for a second time, another \nrecord that people thought would remain forever unchallenged--15,000 \nvotes in the U.S. Senate.\n  And I will tell them, ``I was there. I got to work with both of those \nmen. And they were truly amazing.''\n\n[[Page S9848]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, on this day when Senator Thurmond enters the \nrecord books yet again, I congratulate him on behalf of Senate \nDemocrats for his historic achievement. And I thank him for his many \ncontributions to this body and to this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I join with my two illustrious leaders in \nsaluting Senator Thurmond--truly an outstanding Senator. None of us has \never seen a Senator like Senator Thurmond. He has served in the U.S. \nSenate 44 years. He has accumulated scores of honors, awards, and \naccolades.\n  Today, he adds yet another accomplishment to his roster of \nachievements: the casting of his 15,000th vote in the Senate.\n  This is a remarkable milestone for a remarkable individual.\n  I would suggest if anyone wants to read a truly remarkable \nautobiography or biographical sketch, they read in the Senate \nCongressional Record about Senator Thurmond. I have never seen anything \nlike the accounts of his career.\n  Casting fifteen thousand votes in the United States Senate represents \na record of service that few in this Chamber can hope to achieve in a \nlifetime. For Senator Thurmond, it is only part of the story.\n  It was only after a rich and varied career that spanned more than \nthree decades--a career as a teacher, a decorated World War II soldier, \na governor, and a lawyer in private practice and he studied Blackstone; \nBlackstone; not many lawyers can say they studied Blackstone--that \nStrom Thurmond embarked on a new chapter in his life. In 1954, at the \nage of 52, he became the first--and only--person to be elected to the \nSenate on a write-in ballot. That is a remarkable achievement in \nitself. He remains today the oldest and the longest serving Senator in \nhistory, a true legend in this institution and in his home state of \nSouth Carolina.\n  Although he has worn many different hats over the years--teacher, \nsoldier, lawyer, governor, Senator--the common threads that are woven \nthroughout his life are those of patriotism and service to his fellow \ncitizens. His first job out of college, after graduating from Clemson \nUniversity in 1923, was as a teacher and athletic coach in his hometown \nof Edgefield, South Carolina. It wasn't long before he was named county \nsuperintendent of education while studying law--Blackstone--in his \nspare time. By 1930, he had his law degree and was serving as city and \ncounty attorney in his hometown.\n  He was elected state senator in 1933 and began service as a circuit \njudge in 1938. So he has been in all of the branches of Government--the \njudicial branch, the executive branch, and the legislative branch. Four \nyears later, after 1938, he left his promising judicial career behind \nto volunteer--volunteer--for service in World War II. He was soon flung \ndirectly into the eye of the storm, landing at Normandy on D-Day with \nthe Army's 82nd Airborne Division. The distinction with which he served \nin World War II earned him five Battle Stars and 15 decorations, \nmedals, and other awards. Now, who can match that?\n  At the end of the war, Strom Thurmond returned home and was elected \ngovernor of South Carolina. It was only after a run for President in \n1948, the completion of his term of office as governor, and a brief \nperiod of private law practice that Senator Thurmond turned his sights \nto the United States Senate. His length of service and the thousands of \nvotes he has cast in this institution are proof that he has never \nlooked back.\n  At a time in his life when most would have put the rigors of the \nworkplace long behind them, Senator Thurmond continues his public \nservice. He serves ably as chairman of the Senate Armed Service \nCommittee and as the senior member of the Judiciary and Veterans \nAffairs Committees. As President pro tempore of the Senate, he is \nmeticulous in attending to his duties, often as I have said being the \nfirst to arrive in this chamber in order to call the Senate into \nsession.\n  For many years, the walls of Senator Thurmond's office in the Russell \nSenate Office Building were lined, floor to ceiling, with hundreds of \nplaques and pictures and certificates of appreciation for his service \nto the people of South Carolina and to the nation. Those awards and \ncitations marked the moments in history that Senator Thurmond has \nwitnessed, and influenced, from his position as a United States \nSenator. No doubt he could connect many of his 15,000 votes with the \nevents chronicled and memorialized on the walls of his office. Many of \nthose mementoes have been transferred to the Strom Thurmond Institute \nof Government and Public Affairs at Senator Thurmond's alma mater, \nClemson University, but for those of us who have been privileged to see \nthem, it was a striking sight.\n  And yet, if one were to visit Senator Thurmond's office when all of \nthose citations were displayed there, one would find that the Senator \nwould not direct your attention to the case displaying his military \nmedals. He would not point out the photos of him with Presidents and \nworld leaders. He would not urge you to read the commendations from \nesteemed organizations in his state or in the nation. No, Senator \nThurmond would draw your attention to the photos of his four children, \nNancy Moore, a promising college student whose life was cut short by a \ntragic automobile accident; Strom Jr., a lawyer like his father--I \ndoubt he studied Blackstone; Julie, who works for the Red Cross; and \nPaul, who works for the Senate Government Affairs Committee. Those \nchildren are the crowning achievements of Senator Thurmond's career; \namong all of his historic votes and all of his honors and awards, they \nare the accomplishments of which he is most proud.\n  The sheer number of votes that he has cast is a wonderful achievement \nfor which we honor Senator Thurmond, but as a fellow Senator, a father, \nand a grandfather myself, I salute Senator Thurmond not only for the \nnumber of votes that he has cast but also for his lifelong dedication \nto the Senate, to his family, his patriotism, and his service to the \npeople of America.\n  Mr. President, 1,843 Senators have served in this body since the \nSenate first met on April 6, 1789. I can remember Strom Thurmond when I \nfirst came to the Senate. As I look around me, he is the only Senator \nin this body whom I recognize as a Senator who sat here when I took my \noath of office for the first time as a Senator.\n  I can remember his wife, his first wife, as she sat in the galleries \nand looked down at the Senate, listening to Strom as he spoke. Then \nwhen she was taken away by the Father of us all, I came to the Senate \nthat day and I saw Strom Thurmond, sitting right there at his desk, as \nI recall. I walked up to him, held out my hand and told him I was \nsorry. That same stern, strong look that we so often see on Strom \nThurmond's face was the look that he gave to me; a strong, firm \nhandshake; straight as an arrow, stern as an Indian, he thanked me for \nmy expression of condolences.\n  It has been said that ``the measure of a man's life is the well \nspending of it, and not the length.'' By any measure, Senator Thurmond \nis an example of a life both great in length and well spent. I \ncongratulate my esteemed and illustrious colleague on his remarkable \ncareer and on his remarkable life.\n  I thank my Creator for having blessed me with the many thousands of \nfriendships that I have enjoyed over the years, so many scores of which \nhave been other Members of this Chamber, among whom only one do I look \nupon as senior to myself. I congratulate myself on having lived to \nserve with this man, and I hope that God's blessings will continue to \nbe upon Strom Thurmond.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, as we say in this body, I would like to \nassociate myself with the remarks of all those who have spoken and make \na slightly different point--not as well as my colleagues have spoken.\n  You know, I don't think a Senator can be measured merely in terms of \nthe number of votes he or she has cast. It is a reflection of their \nsense of responsibility and the exercise of their duty. But there is \nsomething special about that fellow sitting over there from South \nCarolina. I have been here 26\n\n[[Page S9849]]\n\nyears with the Senator from South Carolina, and for 16 of those I got \nto sit as either the ranking member or chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee right next to Strom.\n  I think it is fair to say that a lot of people thought we were \nstrange bedfellows because everybody could tell that we truly liked one \nanother. People would ask me, ``Why do you like Strom Thurmond so much? \nYou disagree with him on so many things.'' I would say, ``I'll tell you \nwhy.'' There are two reasons, and it is a measure, in my view, of what \nmakes him a great Senator. No. 1, he is here to get things done. He is \nnot here to stop things. He is here to get things done. He is a \nlegislator.\n  I remember when I first took over as the chairman of the committee, I \nwent to Strom and said, ``Strom, I would like to make a deal with you. \nThere is a lot we disagree on and some we agree on. Let's put aside \nwhat we disagree on and focus on the things we agree on.'' He looked at \nme, and he finally said, ``OK.'' He stood up and put his hand out, and \nfrom that point on, as much as we may disagree, there wasn't anything \nwe have ever had a cross word on.\n  One of my most memorable occasions was when he and I went down to the \nWhite House to try to convince President Reagan to sign a crime bill. \nPresident Reagan was in the beginning of his second term. We sat in \nthat Cabinet room. We were on one side of the table and William French \nSmith, Ed Meese, and someone else was on the other side. The President \nwalked in and sat down between Strom and me. We made our pitch as to \nwhy he should sign onto the Thurmond-Biden crime bill back then. The \nPresident looked like he was getting convinced, like maybe he was going \nto come our way. This is absolutely a true story. With that, Ed Meese \nstood up and said, ``Mr. President, it's time to go.'' The President \nwanted to hear what Strom had to say a little longer, but Ed Meese \nsaid, ``Mr. President, it's time to go.''\n  The President was sitting down and then decided it was time to go. He \nhad his arms like this, and he went to get up, and Strom reached over \nand put his hand on the President's arm and pulled him back down in the \nseat and he said, ``Mr. President, the one thing you got to know about \nWashington is that when you get as old as I am, you want to get things \ndone, you have to compromise.''\n  Who in the Lord's name could have possibly told Ronald Reagan that--\nhe was almost as old as Strom and had been around as long--and smile \nand make the President laugh? He not only got away with it, he talked \nthe President into his position. That is a remarkable ability. This man \ncan say and do things that if any of the rest of us ever did them, we \nwould be long gone. But do you know why it works? It is because people \nknow where his heart is. People know what his objective is. People know \nthat he is doing what he is doing not for political purposes but \nbecause he really believes it.\n\n  If you will allow another point of personal privilege here. I \nremember a very tough time in my career. I was chairman of a committee \nand there were wild accusations being made about me. I was foolish \nenough to be trying to run for President of the United States. It was \nbefore a very contentious hearing on a Supreme Court Justice. He and I \ndisagreed on whether the justice should be a Justice. I called a \nmeeting of the entire committee off of the committee room in the back \nand I said, ``Gentlemen''--there were all men on the committee at the \ntime--I said, ``Gentlemen, if these accusations relevant to me are \ngetting in the way of the ability to conduct this committee, I am \nwilling to step down as chairman.'' Before the last syllable got out of \nmy mouth, Strom Thurmond stood up in that meeting and said, ``That's \nridiculous. You stay as chairman. We all have confidence in you.'' I \nsaid, ``Don't you want me to explain?'' He said, ``There is no need to \nexplain. I know you.''\n  I will never forget that. I can't think of many other men or women \nwho would, having a significant political advantage at that moment, not \nonly not take advantage, but stand by me--stand by me.\n  And so I think the thing that makes his 15,000 votes matter so much \nis that everybody knows they matter to him. They matter to him.\n  I will close by saying--and I apologize for being so personal, but I \nthink it is the measure of this man, at least in my view. My daughter \nis 17 years old. She has, like all of us in here who have served in the \nU.S. Senate for a long time, had the great honor and opportunity to \nmeet kings and princes and presidents and significant political \nfigures. She, like all of our children, pays the price for having a \nfather or mother who is a Senator or who holds high public office. But \nthey also have the advantage of meeting these people as well. She has \nhad scores of pictures taken.\n  To this day, my beautiful 17-year-old daughter has one picture of a \npublic figure in her bedroom on her dresser that has been there for 9 \nyears, and it is a picture of Senator Strom Thurmond handing her a key \nchain behind his desk in his office. I didn't ask her to keep that. I \nkind of wish she would put a Democrat's picture in there. I didn't even \nmake the bureau. But Strom Thurmond is there. I think the reason is \nbecause all the time my wife Jill was carrying her, Strom would, every \nthird day, ask me during a hearing what was going on and give me all \nkinds of advice about what I should and should not do.\n  My wife and I were in the delivery room and were just handed our \nbeautiful baby girl, and a doctor walked around the corner with a cell \nphone and said, ``There's a call for you, Senator.'' We were literally \nin the delivery room. I thought, my God, war must have been declared. I \ngrabbed the phone, thinking it was the most incredible and unusual \nthing to hand me a phone in the delivery room. I say to my friend from \nWest Virginia that he is not going to be surprised to hear this. ``Joe, \nStrom. Congratulations.'' How in the Lord's name he knew at that moment \nis beyond me. But everything with him is personal. It is personal in \nthat he gives. It is personal in that he gives. It is not personal that \nhe holds a grudge. It is not personal that he takes advantage. It is \npersonal. Politics is personal.\n  Those votes meant something, and the way he has conducted himself in \nthis body makes me very, very, very proud to say I serve with him and \nvery proud to think that he likes me.\n  It has been a pleasure serving with you. I just hope you do what you \ndid for me on your 90th birthday. I had the great honor to be one of \nthe four speakers at your 90th birthday. But, you old devil, you never \ntold me Richard Nixon was going to be the other speaker when I showed \nup. It was me, President Nixon, Bob Dole, and a Presbyterian minister, \nwhom I don't remember; he used to work in the Nixon White House.\n  I just ask for one favor. On your 100th birthday, as you are running \nfor your next term of office, I volunteer to be one of the 500 people, \nassuming I am still around, who will be happy to stand up and speak for \nyou on your 100th birthday, because I want to be around on your 110th \nafter you finish your next term and a half. I congratulate you, \nSenator, not on the 15,000 votes, but it is the way you cast them, the \nway you talked about them, the way you dared about them that makes you \nunique among all of us in this Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to say that when I came to this \nChamber I was 100th in seniority. I sat up here at the end of the line. \nWhen I came to this Chamber, I had not served in the House of \nRepresentatives before this. So I didn't know many of the Members. But \nthere was one Senator who was always unfailingly courteous, polite, and \nwarm. And that is the Senator from South Carolina. Whenever he saw me, \nthere was a cheery word, a note of encouragement, and a willingness to \nbe helpful. I have never forgotten his courtesy and his kindness.\n  Once again, this week, when my chief of staff died suddenly, among \nthe very first Senators to call me with condolences was the senior \nSenator from South Carolina. He called my office. When he saw me in the \nhall, he took me aside and said how he felt about the loss of my top \naide.\n  Mr. President, we are here to celebrate a record of a remarkable \nstream of votes by the Senator from South Carolina. But, more than \nthat, I think we want to celebrate the kind of man\n\n[[Page S9850]]\n\nthat he is and the contribution that he makes to this Chamber and to \nthis country.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  Let me also congratulate Senator Thurmond for this remarkable record.\n  I just have two things to say. One is, I think one of the ways that \nwe should evaluate Senators is just how they treat people. I say to the \npages, I don't know over the years how many times I have seen Senator \nThurmond have ice cream with the pages. I don't know how many times I \nhave seen him constantly being so gracious and having a good time and \ntalking with and treating people really well--support staff, whether \nthey be elevator operators or you name it.\n  I just would like to thank Senator Thurmond, not always for the \nposition he takes on issues, but for the way he treats people, which I \nthink might matter more than anything else.\n  Then finally, Strom, since I am being so nice here on the floor and \nsaying exactly what I believe, I would like to ask you a favor. Since I \ncame out here to congratulate you, next time when you shake my hand or \ngrab my shoulder, could you do it just a little more gently?\n  I yield the floor. (Laughter.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today marks a milestone in the history \nof my state, in the history of the Senate, and in the history of the \nUnited States. Today Senator Strom Thurmond, the longest-serving \nSenator in United States history, cast his 15,000th vote. This is a \nproud moment for not only Senator Thurmond but for the great state he \nserves and for the venerable history of this institution.\n  What is perhaps even more remarkable than the number of votes Senator \nThurmond has cast is the thought he put into each of those votes and \nthe conviction with which he has voted. I have not always voted with \nthe Senior Senator from South Carolina, but I have never doubted he \ncast each vote with no consideration other than the good of our state \nand nation in mind.\n  This is one of many records the senior Senator from South Carolina \nhas achieved. I well recall rising last year to pay tribute to the \nSenator on the occasion of his setting a new longevity mark in the \nSenate. In fact, Mr. President, Strom Thurmond's entire life is \nremarkable for his ability to blaze a trail for others and set new \nmarks.\n  Many of my colleagues today have spoken of Senator Thurmond's \ngracious manner, his compassion for others, and his profound respect \nfor the traditions and the history of the United States Senate. Indeed, \nno one possesses these qualities to a greater degree than Strom \nThurmond.\n  Senator Joseph Biden said today, ``politics is personal.'' And as he \npointed out, Strom Thurmond understands this better than anyone. No one \nknows better than Senator Thurmond that the Senate's success is \ndirectly related to its members' decorum and the warmth of their \npersonal relations. Senator Byrd spoke movingly of Senator Thurmond's \npresence at a memorial service after the death of his grandson. I have \nno doubt that many other Senators could tell similar stories. Strom \nThurmond is as devoted to his colleagues as anyone I have ever known. \nFor him, friendships transcend party lines.\n  Of course, Senator Thurmond's loyalty and dedication extend beyond \nthe confines of this room. An ardent patriot, he left his life as a \nfather and judge behind to volunteer for combat duty in World War II \nand participated in numerous campaigns. Senator Thurmond is one of \nthose rare people who we can say with certainty loves America even more \nthan he cherishes his own life.\n  If it is possible for one person to embody the traditions and \npersonality of an institution, Strom Thurmond personifies the United \nStates Senate. He is a man of respect, good will, humor, energy, \nprinciple, integrity, and loyalty. It is no exaggeration to say that \nserving the people of South Carolina and the United States is Senator \nThurmond's life. Today we have the great fortune to repay his \ndedication in a small way by making the sort of personal gestures for \nwhich Senator Thurmond is famous. Mr. President, it is my great \npleasure to congratulate my colleague and old friend on the occasion of \nhis 15,000th vote.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I know the pending business is the \nHutchison amendment and my modification to that. I know that the \nmanagers are anxious to move forward.\n  Just before I do that, I would like to add briefly my thoughts to \nthose that have already been expressed for perhaps the most remarkable \nindividual I have ever met.\n  I too am privileged, like the rest of us, to have served in this body \nas an associate and colleague of Strom Thurmond. I was 5 years old when \nStrom Thurmond ran for President. I learned about him in studying \nhistory and government in school. I never dreamed that I would have the \nopportunity to know the man personally and to be a colleague of his and \nserve with him.\n  Much has been said that I heartily agree with about the stature of \nthis man, the remarkable career that he has had and is having, and his \nremarkable service to the people of South Carolina and to our Nation.\n  I am one of those who share with the Senator from Delaware the \npleasure and surprise of a phone call from Strom Thurmond on the day of \nmy daughter's wedding apologizing for not being there, congratulating \nme and congratulating her. I, like Senator Biden, hadn't a clue as to \nhow he found out my daughter was being married. I never mentioned it to \nhim. But there he was.\n  I had the pleasure of coaching young Paul Thurmond in youth league \nbasketball on Saturday mornings as our boys, my son and Strom's son, \nwould run up and down the floor. We won the championship, by the way, \nthanks to the great athletic ability and talent of Paul. As they would \nrun up and down the floor, I only had to turn around just a little bit, \nbecause two rows behind the coaching bench was Paul's father, Strom \nThurmond, cheering on his son.\n  Each of us could stand here and tell stories, I think, until deep in \nthe night about the impact that this individual has had on each of us \nand the impact that he has had on this Senate.\n  Strom is an inspiration.\n  Bob Dole has said over and over, ``I just order whatever Strom \norders. Whatever he is eating must be the right thing.''\n  Strom has detailed for me his physical exercise regimen, which is \nsomething that I can't keep up with. I don't know how he does it, but \nhe does. I have been the recipient of his handshake, as Senator \nWellstone has, and I walk away rubbing my hand in awe and respect for \nthe strength of this individual.\n  Finally, I have sat with him shoulder to shoulder on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, and a deeper patriot, a more committed American, \nsomeone with a more remarkable story of a lifetime of service to the \nmilitary of this Nation I don't think has ever lived. Someone who flew \nin a glider in the invasion of Normandy, served as a distinguished \nofficer in the military, and then served as chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, as he now does--that is a story that is not going \nto be repeated. That is a story that is not going to be duplicated. God \nonly makes one of each of us. But he made Strom Thurmond a very, very, \nvery special human being.\n  It has been a deep honor and a deep privilege of mine to have known \nhim, to be counted as his friend, to have served with him. It is a \nmemory that I will cherish for as long as I live.\n  Mr. President, unless there are others who seek to add to these \nstatements in honor and recognition of Senator Thurmond, I will proffer \nmy modification. However, I will yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, just before the Senator's modification \nof my amendment, I want to add that as people in America today are \ngoing to the movie theaters and seeing for the first time the horrors \nof war, if every person who sees ``Saving Private Ryan'' will think \nabout this great leader, Strom Thurmond, whom we are talking about \ntoday, and realize that\n\n[[Page S9851]]\n\nthis was a man who, in his forties, volunteered to go into World War \nII, and went into Normandy--the sights of which most of us could not \nhave imagined unless we saw this movie--and was there in his forties, \nvolunteered to be there to serve his country--as Senator Coats so well \nsaid, they will never make another Strom Thurmond.\n  I just want to add my accolades for this great man and what he has \ngiven for our country besides voting 15,000 times. He has done so much \nmore.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from Indiana \nwill allow me, there have been other references made here of a personal \nnature involving Senator Thurmond. I would not want to let this \noccasion pass without my making one such reference.\n  It was on April 12 of 1982 that I lost my grandson in a truck \naccident. Memorial services were held 2 days later. My colleague, \nSenator Randolph, came to that memorial service--my then colleague. My \npresent colleague, Senator Rockefeller, was Governor of the State of \nWest Virginia at that time. He came. There was one other Senator who \nattended that memorial service for my grandson. And that Senator was \nStrom Thurmond. I can never forget that, and I would have been remiss \nin letting this opportunity pass without my having publicly expressed \nmy gratitude to Strom Thurmond for his having attended that service on \nthat day, a day that I can never, never forget. I thank him from the \nbottom of my heart.\n\n  I think Senator Thurmond wishes to say something and so I shall take \nmy seat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The very honorable and distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am speechless. I can't thank enough \nthe Members of the Senate for their kind words--Senator Lott, the \nmajority leader; Senator Daschle, the minority leader, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Biden, Senator Conrad, Senator Wellstone, Senator Hollings, \nSenator Coats, and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. I will not take time \nnow to say much. I just want to express my appreciation to all of them \nfor their kind words.\n  I have been in the Senate now for 44 years, and I have never known or \nserved with finer people than we have here. I have cast my 15,000th \nvote. The quality of the people in this body is just outstanding, and I \nwish all of them to stay here until they could cast 15,000 votes. It is \nan experience to be in this body that one will never forget. As time \ngoes by I think we appreciate more and more the Members of this body, \nwhat they stand for, and their outstanding service.\n  Again, I thank all of them for their kind words. I thank all of you \nfor listening, and I deeply appreciate everything that you have done \nfor me and to help me. After all, inspiration is one of the finest \nqualities, and you people here have inspired me, and I hope I have been \nable to be of some inspiration to you. Good luck and God bless all of \nyou.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before returning to the bill, many of \nus were at Senator Thurmond's 90th birthday, and I remember he said to \nall of us, ``If you eat right and don't drink whiskey and exercise, you \nwill be here for my 100th birthday.''\n  We thank you for being an inspiration to us all, and we look forward \nto being at your 100th birthday party.\n  Thank you, Senator Thurmond, for your contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9847-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9851-S9853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The honorable Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3526, as modified\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I have a modification to the Hutchison \namendment I would like to send to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3526), as modified, is as follows:\n       Add the following proviso:\n       (5) (a) North Korea is not providing ballistic missiles or \n     ballistic missile technology to a country the government of \n     which the Secretary of State has determined is a terrorist \n     government for the purposes of section 40(d) of the Arms \n     Export Control Act or any other comparable provision of law.\n       (b) Provision of Intelligence.--The Director of Central \n     Intelligence will provide for review and consideration by the \n     House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House \n     International Relations Committee, House National Security \n     Committee, Senate Appropriations Committee Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence, Senate Foreign Relations Committee \n     and Senate Armed Services Committee all relevant intelligence \n     bearing on North Korea's compliance with the provisions of \n     this amendment. Such provision will occur not less than 45 \n     days prior to the President's certification as provided for \n     under this section.\n       (c) Definition of Relevant Intelligence.--For the purposes \n     of this section, the term intelligence includes National \n     Intelligence Estimates, Intelligence Memoranda, Findings and \n     other intelligence reports based on multiple sources or \n     including the assessment of more than one member of the \n     Intelligence Community.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to just briefly explain to my \ncolleagues what I have attempted to do.\n  Yesterday, I sent to the desk an amendment which would have \ntransferred the $35 million that is appropriated in the foreign \noperations appropriations bill that is before us now, and reallocated \nthat money from the currently earmarked Korean Peninsula Energy \nDevelopment Organization to the antiterrorist portion of funding \ncontained within this bill. I did so because of the disturbing news \nthat have been reported on by the New York Times and other \norganizations relative to violations, apparent violations of the \nagreement that we entered into with North Korea to freeze their nuclear \ndevelopment program.\n  The New York Times--and I will recount some of that in a moment--\npointed out that U.S. intelligence agencies have detected a huge, \nsecret, underground complex in North Korea that they believe is the \ncenterpiece of an effort to revive the country's frozen nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  Members will remember that in return for a freeze on that program, \nthe United States entered into an agreement with North Korea to provide \ncertain items for humanitarian assistance, food aid, oil for energy \nproduction, as well as a commitment to put together a consortium which \nwould build two light-water nuclear reactors to supply energy, but that \ncould not be used for the purpose of developing material which might be \nused for weapons of mass destruction.\n  The Times report cites a senior administration official saying, and I \nquote:\n\n       ``The North had not yet technically violated the Agreed \n     Framework because there is no evidence that Pyongyang has \n     begun pouring cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing \n     plant . . .'' Nevertheless, an unidentified official has said \n     it is a serious development, to say nothing of it is an \n     incredibly stupid move, because it endangers both the nuclear \n     accord and humanitarian aid to North Korea.\n\n  The Washington Post stated that the site that was discovered is huge, \nthat some 15,000 reported North Koreans are at work on this underground \ncavern, and this comes only 6 months after the President of the United \nStates has certified that North Korea is complying with the provisions \nof the Agreed Framework. That certification is what is necessary in \norder for these funds to be released.\n  My amendment sought to take a portion of those funds, transfer it to \nthe antiterrorism section of this bill in recognition of the fact that \nthis Presidential certification was no longer relevant, now that the \nagreement had been violated.\n  I am willing to withdraw that amendment in light of the fact that \nSenator McCain has offered an amendment adding language to the \ncertification process so that the President, in addition to other items \nthat he has to certify, will have to certify that North Korea is not \nengaged in a violation of the agreement. The exact wording is \n``pursuing the acquisition or development of nuclear capability other \nthan the light-water reactors'' referred to in the agreement.\n  I would have voted against the McCain amendment, or for the motion\n\n[[Page S9852]]\n\nto table had we not been able to work out language which I could now \nadd to the amendment of the Senator from Texas which would add further \nconditions to this certification. The bottom line is, I think the \ncertification has turned into an empty process. It is a process by \nwhich the so-called host country, in this case North Korea, essentially \ntells us everything is OK, and then we, on the basis of that, go ahead \nand certify. The term ``certification'' is not defined, but yet if we \nlook at the use of the term that is used in the agreement that we have \nwith the People's Republic of China regarding nuclear nonproliferation, \nit simply says that the President certifies to the Congress that the \nRepublic of China has provided clear and convincing evidence that they \nare in compliance with the agreement. And so the burden of proof is on \nthe country which we are trying to determine whether or not they have \nviolated the agreement, rather than on our ability to verify the fact \nthat they have or have not complied with the agreement.\n  President Reagan used to say trust but verify. Well, this is trust \nbut not verify.\n  And so what I am attempting to do with this modification, which goes \nto an amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, is to say that not \nless than 45 days prior to the President's certification as provided \nfor in this bill, the Director of Central Intelligence will provide for \nreview and consideration by the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence, House International Relations Committee, House National \nSecurity Committee, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, and Senate Appropriations Committee as \nwell as the Senate Armed Services Committee, all relevant information \nbearing on North Korea's compliance with the provisions of this \namendment.\n  That gives us the opportunity in Congress to determine whether or not \nthe certification is a legitimate certification. That gives us the \ninformation to determine whether or not North Korea is in full \ncompliance with what they agreed to do. So I think this language is \nimportant.\n  One last thing. I am withdrawing my amendment, partly because I \nbelieve the other body will take action on some deferral of this money \nand that this item can be handled in conference. It is clear that \nwithout that assurance we may get bogged down here in this process, and \nI don't want to hold up this appropriation. I thank the Senator from \nKentucky for agreeing to this modification. I particularly thank the \nSenator from Texas for allowing me to make this modification to her \namendment, which will then become part of the bill.\n  I think this is a serious problem. If the New York Times report is \nsubstantiated, if it is correct, even remotely correct, it is a clear \nand direct violation of the promise and agreement made by North Korea \nto freeze its nuclear development capabilities. If that is the case, it \nis clear that this is a breach of promise which requires very serious \nreaction and response by the United States.\n  The President of the United States and the Secretary of State have \ncertified to us directly that there are no violations. Yet, we now \nreceive this particular information. I have quotes here from the \nPresident of the United States and from the Secretary of State which \nhave led us to believe that everything is in compliance. Yet, we now \nreceive this report. So it is the credibility of the certification \nprocess that is at stake here, and I would say it is the credibility of \nthis administration in evaluating the intelligence. Therefore, it is \nnecessary that, at the very least, the Congress have access to all \nrelevant intelligence regarding this particular agreement so in the \nfuture we can verify it, in addition to the trust that is placed by \nthis administration on the word of North Korea.\n  Mr. President, testifying before the House Subcommittee on Foreign \nOperations, Committee on Appropriations on March 4, 1998, Secretary \nAlbright stated:\n\n       Our request this year includes $35 million for the Korean \n     Energy Development Organization. The Agreed Framework has \n     succeeded in freezing North Korea's dangerous nuclear \n     program.\n\n  On May 8, 1998, James Foley, Department of State said:\n\n       We, of course, closely monitor the Agreed Framework. We \n     are, until now, satisfied that the DPRK has indeed met its \n     obligations to the present.\n\n  On May 13, 1998, Jamie Rubin said:\n\n       We are confident that North Korea has not violated the \n     across-the-board freeze on its nuclear activities . . . and \n     the Agreed Framework is alive and well.\n\n  On July 8, 1998, Secretary Albright testified before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee that:\n\n       The People's Republic of China has consistently supported \n     the Agreed Framework that has frozen North Korea's dangerous \n     nuclear weapons program. . . .\n\n  On July 19, 1998, Jamie Rubin, Department of State, responding to a \nGAO report alleging North Korea was blocking inspections at sites \ncovered by the Agreed Framework said:\n\n       We have frozen and stopped the North Korean nuclear program \n     from moving in a direction that would have threatened the \n     world. The freeze is still being monitored and we believe it \n     is still in effect.\n\n  Less than 1 month later on August 17, 1998, the New York Times broke \nthe following story:\n\n       U.S. Intelligence Agencies have detected a huge secret \n     underground complex in North Korea that they believe is the \n     centerpiece of an effort to revive the country's frozen \n     nuclear weapons program, according to officials who have been \n     briefed on the intelligence information.\n       The finding also follows a string of provocations by the \n     north, including missile sales to Pakistan and the incursion \n     of a small North Korean submarine carrying nine commandos off \n     the South Korean coast this year.\n\n  And what was the administration's reaction? According to the same New \nYork Times article:\n\n       A senior administration official said the north had not yet \n     technically violated . . . the Agreed Framework, because \n     there is no evidence that Pyongy Ang has begun pouring cement \n     for a new reactor or reprocessing plant. . . .\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       But spy satellites have extensively photographed a huge \n     work site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the nuclear center, \n     where, until the 1994 accord, the north is believed to have \n     created enough plutonium to build six or more bombs. \n     Thousands of North Korean workers are swarming around the new \n     site, burrowing into the mountainside, American officials \n     said.\n\n  And if that is not enough, Monday's test flight of the Taepo Dong-1 \nover Japan demonstrates that North Korea has mastered the technology of \ndelivering a nuclear warhead. Yesterday's New York Times reported the \nfollowing:\n\n       Gary Milhollin of the Wisconsin project on nuclear arms \n     control . . . said the missile test was ``a clear sign'' of \n     North Korea's intent to develop nuclear weapons, despite its \n     1994 agreement with the United States to stop in exchange for \n     western assistance. Milhollin said a two-stage missile was \n     too costly to construct simply for delivering conventional \n     weapons. ``It means they plan to put a nuclear warhead on it \n     or export it to somebody who will,'' he said. ``The missile \n     makes no sense otherwise.''\n\n  In short, this administration has negotiated an accord in 1994 that \nwe cannot and do not even attempt to monitor and verify. As we have \njust been reminded this week by the resignation of a key U.S. arms \ninspector in Iraq, William Ritter, ``The illusion of arms control is \nmore dangerous than no arms control at all.''\n  Yet that is precisely where we are left. An illusion that the \nadministration refuses to define as such. Certifications that are \nmeaningless. Ronald Reagan reminded us to ``trust, but verify.'' The \nNorth Koreans insist by their reluctance to admit inspectors that we \nwill not verify as a basic term of the agreement. So we are left simply \nwith trust. Trust the North Korean regime which has just launched long \nrange missiles over our allies. Trust of the administration. Trust that \nhas been frivolously squandered and badly eroded.\n  Again, I thank the participants in this for accepting this \nmodification of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coats for his addition \nto my amendment, because I do think it strengthens the base amendment. \nWhat Senator McCain has done is assure, in order to get this money, \nthat there would be no nuclear proliferation by North Korea. My \namendment then comes in and says we will not allow the ballistic \nmissile technology to be sold by North Korea to terrorist nations. I \nthink the amendment of Senator Coats\n\n[[Page S9853]]\n\nstrengthens both of these by assuring the certification process is \nreal.\n  I think it is very clear that the Senate is speaking with a very loud \nvoice that we are not going to continue to sit back and let North Korea \nbreak the agreement that they made, sell technology to terrorist \nnations that would use that technology against the United States or our \nallies anywhere in the world, and let them do it and reward them for \nit. We are not going to do it. The signal is clear. The Senate is \nspeaking.\n  I thank Senator Coats, I thank Senator McConnell, I thank Senator \nMcCain for working together to send a very clear message that we want \nNorth Korea to abide by the agreement they made. If they do, we will \nreward them. If they do not, they will not get one penny of taxpayers' \nmoney from this country.\n  Mr. President, I urge my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I understand there is no objection to the Hutchison \namendment as modified by Senator Coats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Hutchison \namendment? If not, without objection, the Hutchison amendment, as \nmodified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3526), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 3500, as further modified, as amended\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe the pending amendment is now the McCain \namendment. There are no objections to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Is there objection to \nvitiating the yeas and nays on the McCain amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  If there is no objection, the McCain amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3500), as further modified, as amended, was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3523\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the Coats amendment \nis withdrawn.\n  Amendment No. 3523 was withdrawn.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3532, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a technical correction to an \nearlier approved Craig amendment which has been cleared by both sides. \nI send it to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The previously agreed to amendment (No. 3532), as modified, is as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) It is the Sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) The U.S. Department of Agriculture should use the GSM-\n     102 credit guarantee program to provide 100 percent coverage, \n     including shipping costs, in some markets where it may be \n     temporarily necessary to encourage the export of US \n     agricultural products.\n       (2) The U.S. Department of Agriculture should increase the \n     amount of GSM export credit available above the $5.5 billion \n     minimum required by the 1996 Farm Bill (as it did in the \n     1991/1992 period). In addition to other nations, extra \n     allocations should be made in the following amounts to:\n       (A) Pakistan--an additional $150 million;\n       (B) Algeria--an additional $140 million;\n       (C) Bulgaria--an additional $20 million; and\n       (D) Romania--an additional $20 million.\n       (3) The U.S. Department of Agriculture should use the PL-\n     480 food assistance programs to the fullest extent possible, \n     including the allocation of assistance to Indonesia and other \n     Asian nations facing economic hardship.\n       (4) Given the President's reaffirmation of a Jackson-Vanik \n     waiver for Vietnam, the U.S. Department of Agriculture should \n     consider Vietnam for PL-480 assistance and increased GSM.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senators from North Dakota have \nbeen waiting patiently on the floor and would like to address another \nissue for a few moments. I, therefore, yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask consent I be recognized to speak as \nin morning business and that my colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nConrad, be recognized following my brief remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Saturday morning at 12:01 a.m., labor \nnegotiations between Northwest Airlines and its pilots broke down. \nThere was a labor strike and, therefore, a shutdown of Northwest \noperations. The result of that shutdown of operations means that all \njet airplane service to North Dakota is gone. The shutdown has a \nsubstantial impact on our entire region of the country, but on our \nState it has a profound impact because all jet service is now gone. \nThere is not one jet flying in or out of North Dakota.\n  I have talked to President Clinton. I have talked to Secretary of \nTransportation Slater. I have talked to Northwest Airlines and I have \ntalked to the pilots.\n  It is clear to me that this labor dispute is not going to be settled \nin the coming hours. We have waited now for several days following the \nshutdown, during which the Transportation Secretary called the parties \ntogether. But even from that, there is not a negotiation ongoing. None \nis scheduled tomorrow, and none is scheduled the next day, as I \nunderstand it. It is now clear to me this will not be settled quickly \nunless the President invokes his emergency powers.\n  This dispute is about corporate profits and pilots' paychecks, and \nthey have every right to have a dispute about that. But no one has a \nright to visit on our State the burden and the devastating consequences \nthat occur when an essential part of our transportation system is \nwithdrawn, when all jet service is withdrawn, and that is what has \nhappened in North Dakota.\n  Today, my colleagues, Senator Conrad and Congressman Pomeroy, and I \nhave asked President Clinton to appoint a Presidential emergency board, \nand to call the parties back to work to restore service to our State. \nDuring the 60-day period, we want the President to help resolve a \nsettlement in this dispute and to end this shutdown. We don't do this \nlightly. We understand that this is an important step.\n  I don't know who is at fault, but I know who is hurt. In a State like \nours, where all jet airplane service is gone, there are devastating \nconsequences. Because the airline industry has now retreated into \nregional monopolies, a shutdown of service or a labor strike causes \ndevastation to certain regions of the country. This can no longer be \nbusiness as usual. We must ask this President to invoke his emergency \npowers and get airline service restored to our region of the country.\n  Mr. President, one final point. We also ask that the regional carrier \nin North Dakota that has also discontinued service, Mesaba Airlines, of \nwhich Northwest is a minority shareholder, restore its service to our \nState as well. We are preparing a request to the president of Mesaba \nand to Northwest to do that.\n  This is a very difficult step for me and my colleagues to take, but \nwe have no choice. We cannot allow day after day after day to go by \nwith our State suffering the impact and the burden of a dispute that \nhas resulted in the discontinuation of all jet service in North Dakota. \nIt is unfair to the citizens of North Dakota and our region, and I want \nthe President to put a stop to it and restore air service in our region \nimmediately.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today we have asked the President of the United States \nto intervene to bring the parties back to work at Northwest Airlines, \nto get the planes flying, and to do it before Labor Day.\n  We had hoped that the two parties would reach agreement on their own. \nThis is a dispute between private parties, but it has a distinctly \npublic result, because all jet service is shut off from North Dakota.\n  We had asked the Secretary of Transportation to bring the two sides \nback\n\n[[Page S9854]]\n\ntogether. He did that yesterday. I have now had a chance to talk to the \nSecretary at some length. I have had a chance to talk to the two sides, \nand it is very clear to me, although the Secretary, I think, did the \nvery best job possible in the circumstances, that the two sides have \nnot resumed negotiations today, and they have no plan to resume \nnegotiations tomorrow. In fact, they have no plan to get back together \nuntil Saturday. That is too long. That is unacceptable.\n  We need the two parties to resolve this matter and to do it promptly \nso that the public trust can be restored, so the public can move, so \nthe blood supply that comes into the biggest hospital in our State can \nmove, can be supplied, so that key parts that are needed for important \nplants in North Dakota can come in by air, and so that our own \ntraveling public can move.\n  It is not too much to ask these parties to immediately go back to the \ntable and to resolve their differences. Given the continuing impasse, \nwe believe it is imperative that the White House acts, and acts \npromptly. That is what has triggered our request today to the President \nto invoke his emergency powers and bring the parties back to work, to \nget this airline up and operating again.\n  I hope the President will be listening closely to our plea to get the \nrelief that our State so desperately needs. I thank the Chair and yield \nthe floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Dodd amendment, \nNo. 3527.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Dodd amendment, and \nmy opposition is this:\n  First, the Dodd amendment would give foreign organizations--foreign \norganizations--extraordinary statutory privileges to expedite and to \ncompel declassification of U.S. national security information. Yes, it \nwould give foreign organizations--not us--extraordinary statutory \nprivileges to expedite and compel declassification of U.S. national \nsecurity information, something that we have not ever had.\n  Creating such statutory rights, which the Dodd amendment, if it is \nadopted and becomes law, will do, also opens the door to foreign \norganizations to take intelligence, law enforcement, defense and \nforeign policy agencies to court to compel special declassification \nrequests.\n  Second, to complete the review of the numerous documents that fall \nunder this amendment in just 4 months--4 months--agencies will be \nforced to reassign personnel, many of whom would otherwise be carrying \nout important mission functions, or risk being sued by foreign \norganizations for noncompliance. Imagine that, think about this, I ask \nmy colleagues this afternoon.\n  Third, this amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut is \nwoefully inadequate in protecting intelligence sources and methods and, \nas a result, will chill current and future sources from providing the \nCIA with critical information--the very information that policymakers \nneed to address human rights and other important foreign policy issues \nin many countries.\n  Fourth, the Dodd amendment applies the same standards for withholding \ninformation that are being used to declassify records relating to the \nJFK assassination. The JFK records are over 40 years old. The documents \ncovered by this amendment are much newer, some only a year old. Because \nthe privacy, law enforcement and intelligence concerns are much greater \nin newer documents, there is no reason for the standards to be any \ndifferent than those set out in President Clinton's Executive Order No. \n12958. Otherwise, we risk jeopardizing ongoing prosecutions, losing \ncritical intelligence sources and methods, and releasing private \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, while we have previously enacted declassification \nexceptions for other historical records, special statutory authority to \nexpedite and compel declassification of records should be exclusively \nreserved for American citizens, not foreign entities.\n  The intelligence community has informed the Intelligence Committee in \nthe Senate that it expects that substantial litigation costs will \nresult if the amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut becomes \nlaw.\n  Litigation costs can be approximately 100 times as much per case than \nprocessing information for declassification and usually results in \nlittle, if any, additional information being released. Just think about \nit, Mr. President. Think about how far this amendment will go.\n  Finally, the Dodd amendment is an unfunded mandate. Agencies would be \nrequired to pay for this declassification requirement out of existing \nfunds. I understand that there are only a limited number of personnel \nwith the necessary expertise to review and to declassify our \nintelligence records. As a result, resources spent on reviewing \ndocuments for the foreign organizations under this amendment, if it \nwere adopted, will no longer be available to process declassification \nrequests for others--including many U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens with \nequally meritorious requests for information will have to stand aside \nwhile these foreign entities go to the front of the line.\n  In the fiscal year 1998, Mr. President, Congress funded a special \ndeclassification program to review and to declassify many of these \ndocuments. Since this amendment changes the standards for withholding \ninformation, the intelligence community will have to re-review the \ndocuments that the taxpayers have already paid to review.\n  Mr. President, at the proper time I would hope that we would table \nthis amendment, especially until we have an opportunity to fully \nconsider its impact on the intelligence community and the Departments \nof State, Defense and Justice, as well as the American people.\n  I think this amendment has not been well thought out. I know it has \nnot been debated at length yet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, both the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, who has just spoken, and I have just come from a briefing \nby the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Director of the \nFBI, and a host of other officials involved in protecting American \nsecrets and engaging in counterterrorism around the world.\n  The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency has said that the \namendment that is pending before us is woefully inadequate to protect \nour national security and the information that we need to keep \nclassified in the United States.\n  I wholeheartedly associate myself with the remarks of the chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee and want to argue in the strongest way that \nthis amendment be defeated. It should be defeated on a 98-2 vote, \nfrankly, because it would be an astonishing precedent-setting action of \ngiving to foreign countries--foreign powers--power over United States \nclassified material, power that not even U.S. citizens possess.\n  It would greatly jeopardize the sources and methods for gathering \nintelligence that we have to employ in different parts of the world in \norder to get the information necessary to protect the security of the \nUnited States, all in the name of human rights, which all of us are, \nfrankly, extraordinarily committed to protect. As a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, I can tell you that the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, who has just spoken, and I, and others, have \ngone to great lengths to ensure that the CIA and other \nAmerican intelligence organizations are strictly adherent to standards \nfor human rights and that we will help others track down human rights \nabuses wherever and however it is necessary. But to provide for the\n\n[[Page S9855]]\n\nwholesale declassification of American secret information for \nGuatemalan and Honduran organizations under this amendment, as I said, \nis not only unprecedented, but is astonishing in its lack of concern \nfor American security.\n\n  I do not suggest, by any means, that the sponsors of the amendment do \nnot deeply care about the security of the United States. But the way \nthis amendment is written, as I said, according to the Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, is woefully inadequate in protecting \nintelligence sources and methods, and as a result will chill current \nand future sources from providing the CIA information, in fact, \ninformation that is essential for us to ensure the protection of human \nrights in the very countries for which this amendment is designed to \nget information.\n  It ostensibly applies the same standards that are used for the \ndeclassification of documents relating to the JFK assassination. And \nthat is the basis upon which it is argued, ``Oh, well, it must be OK.'' \nBut there are a couple of key factors here, Mr. President.\n  First of all, those are for Americans. This is declassification for \nAmerican citizens. This is not declassification for foreign governments \nor foreign organizations. But of equal importance, the JFK \nassassination documents are--what?--40 years old. We are talking, in \nthis amendment here, about information which is much more current. The \nprivacy, law enforcement, and intelligence concerns are much greater in \nthese newer documents.\n  There is no reason, frankly, for the standards to be different than \nthose set out in the President's Executive Order 12958. Otherwise, we \nrisk jeopardizing ongoing prosecutions, we risk losing critical \nintelligence information, compromising sources and methods, and, \nfrankly, releasing a lot of private information as well.\n  As I said, it is astonishing to me that we would have an amendment \nthat would literally give foreign organizations these extraordinary \nstatutory privileges to expedite and compel declassification of U.S. \nnational security information. And for the other reasons that the \nchairman pointed out--the unfunded mandate, the substantial costs \nassociated with it, the substantial litigation costs--I am not sure if \nthe chairman pointed that out, but the litigation costs alone could be \nwell over 100 times greater than just the processing cost for the \ninformation itself.\n  In fiscal year 1998, Congress funded a very special declassification \nprogram to review and declassify many of the documents. Since this \namendment changes the standards for withholding information, the \nintelligence community will have to re-review the documents, and, as I \nsaid, the taxpayers have already paid for that review.\n  We ought to table this amendment until we have an opportunity to \nfully consider its impact, the impact on the intelligence community, \nthe Departments of State, Defense and Justice, as well as on the human \nrights that, frankly, would be potentially abused and the human rights \nconcerns that we have as a result of not being able to have access to \nthe same information or to the information that we need to protect \nhuman rights because of the implication with respect to the sources and \nmethods that could well be degraded as a result of the passage of this \namendment.\n  So this is the kind of thing that ought to be considered very, very \ncarefully, first of all, in the Select Committee on Intelligence. It \nhas not been done. It ought to be very carefully vented through the \nadministration. As I said, the DCI is very, very concerned about this \nparticular amendment. It is premature at best and enormously \nantithetical to our intelligence collection efforts at worst. As a \nresult, at the appropriate time I will urge my colleagues to support a \nmotion to table this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the President.\n  Mr. President, let me thank, again, the distinguished manager of the \nunderlying bill. This has been a disjointed debate. We have had several \nintervening matters since I first offered the amendment a couple of \nhours ago, almost 3 hours ago. So I will just revisit the purpose of \nthe amendment, what it does.\n  Mr. President, I listened and had a chance to hear some brief \ncomments by the Senator from Alabama, and now the Senator from Arizona \non this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Jeffords be added \nas a cosponsor, as well, to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what this amendment does is it involves two \ncountries--Honduras and Guatemala. As most of my colleagues are aware, \nin these two countries we were deeply involved for about a decade. And \nactually conflict went on for some time longer than that where \nliterally thousands of people lost their lives. We as a country were \ndeeply involved in it. There were divisions here in the United States \nover that level of involvement, that type of involvement. We are not \nhere today to revisit the conflict in Central America of the \n1980s. There have been pending requests in both of these two situations \ninvolving Honduras and Guatemala going back 3 or 4 years, requesting \ninformation and documentation involving some very significant and \nsevere human rights violations.\n\n  I identified one earlier involving an American citizen who was raped \nand brutally tortured in Guatemala. Her case has never been resolved. \nShe would like to have it resolved. Sister Ortiz with the Carmelite \nOrder of Nuns would very much like to get to the bottom of it. I think \nall of us can understand that if that happened to anyone we knew. As an \nAmerican citizen, she would like to find out what happened. How do you \ndo that when you are trying to declassify information?\n  What this amendment does in both the case of Honduras and Guatemala, \nthere is a request for declassification, which we provide for all the \ntime, but in these particular cases, if the agency, whatever it may be, \nis unwilling for very important reasons to declassify everything, that \nthere would be an opportunity for a panel--and we have done this \nbefore; this is not unprecedented--made up of people from the CIA, the \nJustice Department, the Department of Defense, the State Department and \nothers, that would review the request and if, in fact, they felt that \nthe request for certain information would violate existing law, \nmethods, resources, procedures, personnel and so forth--then they would \ndeny the request. If they think it is OK, despite the agency's \nobjection--and that is not too big a surprise to us that the agency \nhistorically takes the position of being opposed to declassification of \nany documents; that is not new at all. That has been their reaction.\n  As I showed my colleagues, we have blank page after blank page when \nasking for documentation. That is a request, and we have one entire \nblank page. You are trying to get to the bottom of a case involving an \nAmerican citizen or other people where human rights violations occur. \nThis should not be that controversial. I would not ask that just anyone \nbe able to have access to documents or the declassification without \ngoing through a process here to determine whether or not any of that \ninformation could be harmful to our own country. But it seems to me \nwhen a citizen has been hurt, when others who make legitimate requests \nand don't get to the bottom of information, and we can help by \nproviding information through a declassification process, in two very \nspecific cases here, these two countries, this ought not to be too much \nto ask. It is not costly; it need not go on long.\n  The notion somehow that a non-U.S. citizen may request this \ninformation, that somehow this is unprecedented, that is not \nunprecedented. Many people all over the world request information. It \ndoesn't mean they automatically get it.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues, I point out that Senator \nKerrey of Nebraska, the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, is \na cosponsor of this amendment. We have talked about a number of other \ncases. Michael DeVine, American citizen, murdered in Guatemala by the \nGuatemalan military. It was covered up for years. We are trying to get \nto the bottom of it.\n  Is it wrong for American citizens not to be able to request \ndeclassification of material that might shed light on who brutalized \nthem or murdered them? We\n\n[[Page S9856]]\n\ncan go through a very legitimate process where we can examine whether \nor not that information ought to be declassified. If a determination is \nmade that it can be, then we can release it to help get to the bottom \nof that. The administration has already, by Executive order, said it \nhas no problem with this in terms of getting to a declassification, but \nwe want to have an orderly process.\n  This amendment, and I do not claim perfection, this amendment is an \neffort here to try to do it in an orderly way, to say that you can make \nyour application; that if the respective agency has a problem with a \nrequest, there is a way of evaluating whether or not that information \nought to be forthcoming, and not just a panel made up of anybody but \npeople who come from the various agencies that I think people would be \nconcerned about.\n  I was hoping the amendment would just be agreed to here, that this, \nagain, shouldn't rise to the level of a major concern. In the case of \nSister Ortiz, I don't think it is outrageous to make this request. \nAmbassador Stroock, who was the Ambassador in Guatemala appointed by \nPresident Bush, supports this amendment. I am told now by our \ncolleague, Craig Thomas, who spoke on behalf of this amendment, from \nWyoming, that he believes, in fact the declassification would help put \nthis matter to rest once and for all.\n  My view is people can overreact on these matters here when it comes \nto this kind of information, but we have heard and know of other cases \nof American citizens overseas where their lives have been threatened. \nIn the case of Sister Ortiz, a rape and torture. In the case of Michael \nDeVine, murdered. I don't think it is outrageous for this body to \nprovide a procedure and a mechanism whereby people can find out, \nthrough an orderly and proper process of declassification, information \nthat might lead to those who are responsible for it. I hope we would be \nable to support an amendment that would adopt a process that is orderly \nand one that will, I hope, assist these people.\n  There may not be anything in this information. Some have suggested \nthere is not a lot of information in some of these cases. If that is \nthe case, there is less reason to be opposed to it. In two specific \ncases here, if there is some information, and it helped to get to the \nbottom of it, I think we could all have a sense of pride that we \ncontributed to that.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Harkin, Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator \nLeahy, Senator Jeffords, and myself in adopting this amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator \nDodd that requires the declassification of information pertaining to \nhuman rights violations in Guatemala and Honduras. Americans citizens \nand their relatives, as well as many Guatemalan and Honduran citizens, \nwere victims of gross human rights violations in these nations, and it \nis our government's duty to provide them with as much information as \njudiciously possible. Further, I believe the release of this \ninformation will help the democratic governments of Guatemala and \nHonduras pursue justice, acknowledge the truth, cement the rule of law, \nand help enable the healing of these societies rent by decades of civil \nwar.\n  When we deal with the declassification of intelligence information, \nthe issues are never simple. The mission of our intelligence agencies \nis to collect information that will protect American lives and preserve \nour national security. But, in order to provide this vital information, \nour intelligence personnel must persuade clandestine sources to provide \ninformation covertly, and they must use specialized methods that help \ncollect and protect those secrets. Revelation of sources and methods, \neven if done in pursuit of moral ends, will only increase the threat to \nAmerican lives and security. Revelation of sources and methods would, \nironically, diminish America's ability to get information on human \nrights abuses. This amendment has been crafted with an awareness of the \nneed to inform Americans more broadly while at the same time protecting \nintelligence sources and methods. I appreciate Senator Dodd's \nunderstanding of these issues and his leadership on this amendment.\n  American citizens and their relatives have been wrongfully \nimprisoned, injured, raped, and killed during the course of the civil \nwars in Guatemala and Honduras. Our government may not have all the \ninformation they seek about what occurred in these countries, but what \nrelevant information we do have we should provide them. This amendment \nwill help their pursuit of justice and hopefully provide answers to the \nmany questions that surround these events.\n  Fortunately, the violence and strife that plagued Guatemala and \nHonduras over the years has abated. These nations now have democratic \ngovernments that bring hope and promise to their citizens. But, each of \nthese nations must face their past in order to build a just and \nprosperous society in the future. The Guatemala Clarification \nCommission and the National Human Rights Commissioner in Honduras are \nintegral to this process. The information that will be provided to \nthese groups under this amendment can only help bring healing and \npromote peace in our hemisphere.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in 1989, Sister Dianna Ortiz was \nbrutally abducted and raped in Guatemala where she was working as a \nmissionary.\n  She was victimized by the Guatemalan government and by her own \ngovernment. From the day of the attack, the United States government \nhas compounded her suffering. She was accused of fabricating her story. \nShe has been treated like a criminal instead of as a victim.\n  I am horrified by the reports of Sister Dianna's abduction and \ntorture--and by our government's cruel response to her suffering, which \ncontinues today.\n  I would like to read to my colleagues from a column written by Paul \nFerris in the National Catholic Reporter:\n\n       Her kidnaping and confinement included multiple gang rapes; \n     repeated beatings; intimidation and interrogation; over 100 \n     cigarette burns on her back; video taping her captivity as a \n     form of blackmail; and lowering her in a pit where injured \n     women, children and men writhed and moaned and the dead \n     decayed under swarms of rats. Finally, her abductors held her \n     hand and arms as she was physically coerced into stabbing a \n     woman with a machete.\n\n  That is why I am a cosponsor of Senator Dodd's amendment to \ndeclassify government documents that shed light on human rights abuses. \nFederal agencies would be required to identify, organize and declassify \nall records regarding American activities in Guatemala and Honduras \nafter 1944. This would enable Sister Dianna and other victims of \ntorture to learn the truth about their cases.\n  We need to learn the truth, even if it is painful. By hiding behind a \nwall of secrecy, we are eroding the American people's confidence and \ntrust in their government. We undermine our foreign policy and \nintelligence agencies--and the important work they do--if we cover-up \ntheir past actions.\n  Some argue that the release of this information would ``compromise \nintelligence sources and methods.'' I disagree. If our sources were \npeople who attacked American citizens, we need to know it. If our \nmethods included complicity in torture, we need to know that too.\n  Sister Dianna Ortiz and other victims of torture are seeking to \nrebuild their lives. The least that we can do is to help them to learn \nthe truth about the tragic events that have changed their lives.\n  Mr. President: Our policies must reflect our values. If our efforts \nto promote democracy and human rights around the world are to be \nsuccessful, we must be honest and open about the tragic mistakes we \nhave made in the past.\n  I commend Senator Dodd for his leadership in calling for an honest \nand just accounting of America's history in Central America. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting his amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Ferris column and an article from \nthe National Catholic Reporter be printed in the Record at this time.\n\n                     Sister Dianna is Inspirational\n\n                            (By Paul Ferris)\n\n       Members of the Baltimore archdiocese should know that \n     Ursuline Sister Dianna Ortiz, since her ordeal, (reported in \n     CR July 2) has devoted all her energy to the task of helping \n     other torture survivors and has\n\n[[Page S9857]]\n\n     worked tirelessly for the cause of human rights for the \n     people of Guatemala and other countries where torture exists. \n     Sister Dianna has become a model of faith and courage to \n     countless religious and laity whom she has inspired.\n       Through the testimonies of Sister Dianna and members of \n     Coalition Missing, a group she co-founded comprised of \n     American citizens, Guatemalans living in the U.S. and their \n     families who suffered torture and murder in Guatemala, the \n     United States government felt compelled to investigate and \n     publicly disclose CIA and other intelligence agency abuses in \n     paying known human rights violators, referred to as ``dirty \n     assets,'' to spy for the U.S. As a result of the Intelligence \n     Oversight Board investigation, at least 100 dirty assets were \n     removed from the CIA's payroll and CIA station chiefs were \n     fired from their positions in Guatemala for not reporting the \n     extent of the crimes committed against the people of \n     Guatemala by these dirty assets. This Intelligence Oversight \n     Board (IOB) report recommended a number of reforms in the way \n     intelligence agencies operate in an effort to bring them into \n     line with American democratic values. The IOB also exposed \n     the ugly fact that, for at least nine years, torture was \n     being taught at the notorious School of the Americas in Fort \n     Benning, Ga.\n       Though Sister Dianna's testimony has been continually \n     challenged by the Guatemalan government, and by U.S. State \n     Department and Justice Department officials, the Human Rights \n     Commission of the Organization of American States, after a \n     thorough seven-year investigation, found Sister Dianna to be \n     an ``entirely credible witness,'' and has demanded the \n     apprehension and punishment of her abductors and their co-\n     conspirators, and restitution to Sister Dianna as much as \n     possible.\n       Sister Dianna has been able to accomplish all of this while \n     at the same time trying to heal from her own physical and \n     emotional torment associated with the after-effects of \n     torture. Her kidnapping and confinement included: multiple \n     gang-rapes; repeated beatings; intimidation and \n     interrogation; over 100 cigarette burns on her back; video \n     taping her captivity as a form of blackmail; and lowering her \n     in a pit where injured women, children and men writhed and \n     moaned and the dead decayed under swarms of rats. Finally, \n     her abductors held her hands and arms as she was physically \n     coerced into stabbing a woman with a machete.\n       Among a whole host of violated personal, civil and \n     religious rights cited by the Organization of American States \n     against the government of Guatemala in the case of Sister \n     Dianna, one that concerns every Catholic directly is the \n     denial of her right to missionary activity. The attack on \n     Sister Dianna, who was teaching Mayan children to read by \n     using the Bible as a text, is an attack on all Catholics and \n     Christians who, exercising their God-given and legal right to \n     religious freedom, seek to spread the Gospel of Jesus through \n     missionary activity in other lands.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Dianna Ortiz Joins Vigil for Torture Victims\n\n                           (By Arthur Jones)\n\n       Washington.--The heat index was 106 degrees as the small \n     group set up its table in Lafayette Park across the street \n     from the White House preparing for a June 26 dawn-to-dusk \n     candlelight vigil.\n       Among the people wearing the white ``Help Stop Torture'' T-\n     shirts was Ursuline Sr. Dianna Ortiz who, during \n     Congressional testimony two days earlier, broke down as she \n     recounted how she had become pregnant as a result of being \n     brutalized and raped by Guatemalan security forces and had \n     had an abortion.\n       The nearby White House was unoccupied--President Clinton \n     was in Beijing where, finally, he had decided to speak out on \n     China's human rights abuses.\n       The gathering in Lafayette Park--sponsored by the Torture \n     Abolition and Survivors Support Committee that was \n     culminating three days of Washington meetings and testimony--\n     had similar concerns. The Support Committee estimates the \n     United States is home to more than 400,000 torture survivors.\n       Before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus June 24, \n     torture victims from the 1980s and '90s described what they \n     underwent in locations ranging from Turkey to Nigeria, from \n     Iraq to the Philippines, from Columbia to Pakistan, from \n     Tibet to Guatemala (see accompanying story).\n       Ortiz told the caucus, ``For the last nine years I have \n     tried to stop running. I have tried to face the torturers \n     head on and demand answers, demand justice. Instead of \n     forgiving my torturers, I filed suit against the Guatemalan \n     government and called for an investigation.''\n       She said the Guatemala investigation ``led nowhere,'' that \n     her five-week vigil in front of the White House seeking \n     declassification of documents that could reveal the \n     identities of her torturers had failed; the U.S. government \n     investigations produced nothing; that Department of Justice \n     investigators accused her of lying; and that Guatemalan and \n     U.S. government officials, ``in public and private, said \n     I was a lesbian who had sneaked out for a tryst, [that] \n     the 111 cigarette burns on my back were the result of \n     kinky sex.''\n       Ortiz said that because she could no longer subject herself \n     to the ``retraumatization'' brought on by justice department \n     invesigators' questions and manner, the department had closed \n     her case.\n       One of the people who saw the Department of Justice report, \n     said Ortiz, was Thomas Strouck, U.S. ambassador to Guatemala \n     at the time of her 1989 abduction, ``who before any member of \n     the U.S. Embassy had interviewed me, said `Her story is not \n     accurate,' and told the State Department that my motives were \n     questionable.''\n       Strouck later discussed the report with a journalist, Ortiz \n     testified, ``who then called me. There are things in that \n     report I have kept secret, that I have been ashamed of--\n     things I did not tell DOJ investigators but that my friends \n     revealed as they were being interrogated--and I have lived \n     under tacit blackmail.''\n       ``Let me simply tell you,'' she told the panel, ``I got \n     pregnant as a result of the multiple gang rapes by my \n     torturers, and unable to carry within me what they had \n     engendered, what I could view only as a monster, the product \n     of the men who had raped me, I turned to someone for \n     assistance and destroyed that life.''\n       Ortiz was unable to continue, the rest of her testimony was \n     read for her: ``If I had to make the decision again, I \n     believe I would again decide as I did eight years ago. I had \n     little choice. My survival was so precarious at that time \n     that to have to grow within me what the torturers had left me \n     would have killed me. I tell you this simply so that I can \n     proceed with the truth.''\n       Ortiz has since filed a Freedom of Information Act request \n     for the Department of Justice report.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me make two quick points and perhaps \nclose this debate.\n  First of all, under U.S. law, families and victims of crime in the \nUnited States, Americans, have the ability to go through the State \nDepartment to get this kind of information. That provision was included \nin last year's intelligence bill.\n  Secondly, I made the point earlier we are not as concerned about \nAmerican citizens having the right to get information declassified as \nwe are foreign organizations. What I pointed out was there are two \nforeign organizations that are specifically defined in the bill as \nbeing permitted, then, to have access to this information and to \nrequire the departmental procedure which would result in the \ndeclassification or at least the consideration of declassification of \nthis information. That is what is unprecedented here. That is what \nwould be so astonishing.\n  Finally, the process here is not a simple, inexpensive process where \nthe CIA can inject and stop it. It is an interagency group, and the CIA \ncan be and, in fact, a majority of time where this has been used, my \nunderstanding is it has been overridden. There are private people on \nthe panel as well as representatives from other government agencies. As \na result, you are talking about an extraordinarily time-consuming and \nexpensive operation for people who are really charged with other \nresponsibilities.\n  With respect to the American citizens, I think we have that covered. \nWith respect to foreign powers and foreign groups, I don't think we \nwant to give them rights in requiring declassification of materials \nthat the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency is concerned does \nnot adequately protect our national security needs.\n  Again, I urge at the appropriate time that the motion to table be \nsupported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Connecticut has \nmade a very, very strong and a very good statement in support of his \namendment.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is one of the most knowledgeable people, \nif not the most knowledgeable Senator, on Central and Latin American \nmatters. He has traveled many times to the region, he speaks fluent \nSpanish, and he has been consistent in speaking up for the rights of \nAmerican citizens and of the Central American people.\n  I have often worried that because of our own complicity, either \nactive or accidental, we have allowed the coverup of some very serious \nmisdeeds in that part of the world.\n  After the murder of the Jesuits, I was very critical of the \ninvestigation of those heinous crimes. I was asked to go down so the \nSalvadoran authorities could show me how they were conducting an \ninvestigation to get the perpetrators. And I went to see the chief \ninvestigator, the prosecutor.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, a murder case is a relatively easy crime to \nprosecute. Any of us who has prosecuted murder cases knows that. You \nhave a dead\n\n[[Page S9858]]\n\nbody, you have certain physical evidence, and you put it together. It \nwas so obvious that the evidence of the murders of the Jesuits had been \ndestroyed, covered up, removed. Members of our own Government were well \naware of this and didn't want to blow the whistle. I did in a press \nconference, and I quickly left the country, I might say, because of \nthreats against me for doing it.\n  What the Senator from Connecticut proposes by this amendment is to \nprotect, among others, our own citizens. People like Sister Diana \nOrtiz, who have tried for years to find out what her own government \nknows about what was done to her, and possibly who was involved. There \nare other crimes that were covered up, including by U.S. officials. If \nmistakes were made or crimes committed in Central America we should \nknow about them. It is, after all, it is information in the possession \nof our own Government.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Connecticut protects information \nthat should be kept secret in the interests of national security. But \ntoo often, information that should not be kept secret has been \nwithheld, information which could shed light on atrocities and the fate \nof people who disappeared. That is wrong. I might ask this question of \nmy friend from Connecticut. Would it be safe to say that his amendment \nprotects our legitimate national security interests, while it seeks to \nobtain information about crimes that were committed that the American \npeople have every right to know about?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me respond to the Senator from Vermont. \nI thank him for his support on this. In this amendment, we took Public \nLaw 102-526, section VI, entitled ``Grounds for Postponement of Public \nDisclosure of Records.'' This is the so-called ``Kennedy \nassassination'' language. What I did is I took the exact language--all \nof the language, which provides the exemptions of where this \ninformation should not be provided, and I took the word \n``assassination'' and replaced it with the words ``human rights.'' Here \nis an example. Reading from the existing law:\n\n       Disclosure of assassination records and of particular \n     information to the public may be postponed subject to the \n     limitations of the act.\n\n  We write:\n\n       Disclosure of human rights records. 1. Threat of military \n     defense intelligence, conduct, foreign relations, and so \n     forth. Intelligence agents, intelligence sources, and other \n     matters currently related to the military defense.\n\n  All the way down this entire language, all we did is replace the \nwords ``human rights'' for ``assassinations'' when it comes to Honduras \nand Guatemala. We added an additional provision that is not in the \nKennedy assassination statute. In addition, the amendment provides that \n``a document may remain classified if its public disclosure would be \nexpected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source.'' So we \neven add to it here.\n  I say to my colleague from Vermont that we virtually stick to \nexisting law. We provide that if in fact there has been a rejection \nhere by the Agency, then a panel made up of representatives of the \nDepartment of Justice, the State Department, Central Intelligence \nAgency, and Department of Defense can review, over a 30-day period, \nthat request to determine whether or not the sustained declassification \nis warranted. If they conclude it is not, then it could be declassified \nso that we can get the information out. Other than that, we follow \nexactly the Kennedy assassination language, with the exception that we \nadd a provision that is not in the law.\n  It even goes further. I always thought it was not a matter of great \ndebate here about whether or not human rights--something we cherish, \nsomething we talk about all the time. My Lord, we have provided \nsanctions on countries all over the world that deprive people of basic \nhuman rights. Are we saying, in the case of Honduras and Guatemala \nwhere there are huge human rights violations, that we are not going to \nmake an effort to get to the bottom of this, where particularly \nAmerican citizens' rights were deprived, where they were brutalized? I \ndon't understand that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Well, Mr. President, I say to my friend from Connecticut, \nthat really is the point. In my years here, I have seen time and time \nagain a resolution or amendment to condemn this or that country that \nviolates human rights. They usually pass virtually unanimously. That is \nfine. We should stand up for human right wherever they occur. But we \nare now asking our own government for information about Americans whose \nhuman rights were violated, and we get pages and pages that are blacked \nout. That is unacceptable. We should at least be able to tell the \nfamilies of Americans who disappeared or who were murdered or tortured \nas much as we can about these crimes.\n  Frankly, we cannot credibly condemn other countries for their \nmisdeeds, and not be willing to find out what happened to our own \ncitizens because possibly, conceivably, somebody in our Government may \nhave broken the law. If they did we should know about it, and if the \ntruth comes out we can hold people accountable and deter others from \ncovering up crimes in the future. So I strongly support the amendment \nof the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there are three amendments that have \nbeen cleared on both sides.

Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto, en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3491, 3366, and 3535) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Only one amendment remains at the desk. It has been \nwithdrawn. That is amendment No. 3519. That will not be offered. After \nSenator Hatch has spoken, I will be making a motion to table the Dodd \namendment.\n  So I say to all Senators that is the last vote prior to final \npassage. We should have two votes--a vote on the motion to table the \nDodd amendment and then a vote on final passage--and we will be \nfinished with this bill.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be permitted to yield to Senator Dodd to make his final \nremarks, and then I will make my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3527\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to conclude my remarks here. The \nKennedy assassination language was a process for declassification. It \nwasn't necessarily through an application process that we are talking \nabout this amendment. There is a distinction in that regard.\n  Secondly, regardless of where a bona fide request comes from for \ndeclassification, if it is a bona fide request, whether it is made by a \nU.S. citizen or a non-U.S. citizen, there is nowhere I know of in there \nthat says somebody is precluded from making the request because they \nare a non-U.S. citizen, as long as we protect the legitimate source. I \npoint out that most of the other agencies effectively had no difficulty \nwith this. The reason we are requesting this amendment is because we \nhave had a problem with one or two agencies; where they have provided \ninformation, it is blank page after blank page, redacted page after \nredacted page.\n  Again, I think on the issue of human rights, certainly we have seen \nin cases where we wanted to get to the bottom of information involving \nU.S. citizens, that it is hard enough with some of these countries to \nget the cooperation in the country themselves to get information. It is \na rather ominous thought that a U.S. citizen, or others seeking to get \ninformation about why they were murdered or brutalized, that they would \nface the kind of false obstruction from their own country.\n  So, in the case of Honduras and Guatemala, we felt, particularly \nwhere these cases involved--particularly the case of Sister Ortiz--an \nAmerican nun who was raped and tortured in that country, that helping \nher provide some information to get to the bottom of her case here goes \nback to 1989--with all of the safeguards included specifically in this \namendment is a modest request, indeed, for us to be able to meet.\n  I hope when the appropriate motion is made and the yeas and nays are \nasked on this that my colleagues would support us in adopting this \namendment.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Utah for his graciousness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch and Mr. Leahy are located in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3501\n\n (Purpose: To state the sense of Congress regarding ballistic missile \n                      development by North Korea)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is one final amendment at the desk cleared on \nboth sides. I call up amendment No. 3501 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] for Mr. McCain, \n     for himself, and Mr. Murkowski, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3501.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. __. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) North Korea has been active in developing new \n     generations of medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic \n     missiles, including both the Nodong and Taepo Dong class \n     missiles.\n       (2) North Korea is not an adherent to the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime, actively cooperates with Iran and \n     Pakistan in ballistic missile programs, and has declared its \n     intention to continue to export ballistic missile technology.\n       (3) North Korea has shared technology involved in the Taepo \n     Dong I missile program with Iran, which is concurrently \n     developing the Shahab-3 intermediate-range ballistic missile.\n       (4) North Korea is developing the Taepo Dong II \n     intermediate-range ballistic missile, which is expected to \n     have sufficient range to put at risk United States \n     territories, forces, and allies throughout the Asia-Pacific \n     area.\n       (5) Multistage missiles like the Taepo Dong class missile \n     can ultimately be extended to intercontinental range.\n       (6) The bipartisan Commission to Assess the Ballistic \n     Missile Threat to the United States emphasized the need for \n     the United States intelligence community and United States \n     policy makers to review the methodology by which they assess \n     foreign missile programs in order to guard against surprise \n     developments with respect to such programs.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) North Korea should be forcefully condemned for its \n     August 31, 1998, firing of a Taepo Dong I intermediate-range \n     ballistic missile over the sovereign territory of another \n     country, specifically Japan, an event that demonstrated an \n     advanced capability for employing multistage missiles, which \n     are by nature capable of extended range, including \n     intercontinental range;\n       (2) the United States should reassess its cooperative space \n     launch programs with countries that continue to assist North \n     Korea and Iran in their ballistic missile and cruise missile \n     programs;\n       (3) any financial or technical assistance provided to North \n     Korea should take into account the continuing conduct by that \n     county of activities which destabilize the region, including \n     the missile firing referred to in paragraph (1), continued \n     submarine incursions into South Korea territorial waters, and \n     violations of the demilitarized zone separating North Korea \n     and South Korea;\n       (4) the recommendations of the Commission to Assess the \n     Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States should be \n     incorporated into the analytical processes of the United \n     States intelligence community as soon as possible; and\n       (5) the United States should accelerate cooperative theater \n     missile defense programs with Japan.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This has been approved by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3501) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3527\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Dodd amendment is the pending \namendment. Let me just say to my colleagues, if the motion to table the \nDodd amendment, which I will shortly make, is approved, then the next \nvote will be on final passage and we will be to the completion of this \nlegislation.\n  Senator Shelby has indicated if the motion to table is not approved, \nhe will have further observations to make about the Dodd amendment.\n  So Mr. President, at this time on behalf of the Senator from Alabama, \nSenator Shelby, and myself, I move to table the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9860]]\n\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider that vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add my name and \nmy distinguished colleague from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, as cosponsors of \namendment No. 3530 offered to S. 2334 by Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Global environment facility\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have a statement relating to an amendment \nI had intended to offer concerning the Global Environment Facility, \nwhich I have decided not to offer in the interest of finishing action \non this bill. There is strong, bipartisan support for the GEF and I \nhope we can find additional funds for it later in this session.\n  Mr. President, this bill contains $47 million to pay a portion of our \narrears to the Global Environment Facility. An amendment I had planned \nto offer would provide an additional $145 million, which would cover \nour outstanding arrears which currently total $192 million. \nUnfortunately, there is no money in the bill to pay our FY 1999 \ncontribution to the GEF.\n  The Balanced Budget Act provides for an automatic adjustment of the \ndiscretionary budget caps to accommodate these additional arrears, so \nmy amendment would not require an offset or any additional budget \nauthority.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to provide $47 million toward the \narrears we owe the GEF, we should provide the whole amount. There is no \nreason not to do it. That was one of the purposes of the Balanced \nBudget agreement.\n  It does not require additional budget authority. But it we miss this \nchance, we will make it virtually impossible to pay these arrears later \non when we no longer have the benefit of the automatic adjustment under \nthe Balanced Budget Act.\n  The GEF is the world's largest environmental organization. It has \nenjoyed bipartisan support in the Congress for years. It funds projects \nto protect biodiversity, stop ocean pollution, prevent ozone depletion, \nand promote energy conservation.\n  A few Members of the Congress have called the GEF a ``back-door'' \nfunding mechanism for the Kyoto Protocol. What is the evidence of that? \nThe GEF was established years before Kyoto was even conceived of. For \nyears, the GEF has been pushing the developing countries to do more to \nprevent global warming. Kyoto has not changed that. If anything, it has \nmade it even more relevant and timely.\n  The Resolution on Kyoto sponsored by Senator Byrd and Senator Hagel \nearlier this year calls on the developing countries to do more to \nprevent global warming.\n  That is one of the GEF's goals, and a reason why we should support \nit.\n  The GEF is not only good for the environment, it is good for U.S. \nbusiness. American contractors have won 30 percent of the GEF contracts \nawarded to donor countries. These contracts have primarily gone to \nAmerican companies involved in environmental engineering, energy \nefficiency, and renewable energy. The U.S. is the world's leader in \nthese areas, and our companies will reap the rewards as the GEF helps \nthe developing countries confront their exploding populations, huge \nenergy demands, and a legacy of ignoring the consequences of \nenvironmental pollution.\n  The GEF has funded over 500 projects in 119 countries. Each dollar \nthe U.S. contributes is matched by 5 dollars from other donors and 10 \ndollars from the developing countries themselves, private companies, \nand other international institutions. But without strong U.S. \nparticipation there is far less incentive for other countries to \ncontribute.\n  Mr. President, I am reluctant to call this free money, since no money \nis free. But this is about as free as any money we are going to see. My \namendment would not require one dime of additional budget authority for \nus to erase $192 million in past commitments to an organization that \ndeserves our strong support.\n  Mr. President, to expedite completion of this bill at this late hour, \nI have agreed to withhold offering my amendment. However, is is my \nfervent hope that we will revisit this issue, and that if additional \nbudget authority becomes available later this session that we use some \nof it to make a contribution to the GEF for FY 1999, and that we make \nthe cap adjustment provided for under the Balanced Budget Act to cover \nthe $192 million in arrears that would be made available under my \namendment. To do so would not affect any of the other funds in this \nbill, but it would fulfill our commitment to pay these arrears, and \nsupport the most important international organization devoted to \nprotecting the environment.\n\n\n                   Development Assistance for Africa\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of development \nassistance for Africa, which is included in the fiscal year 1999 \nForeign Operations appropriations bill.\n  For fiscal year 1999, the total funding for development assistance \nhas gone down once again. At the same time, there are still earmarks \nfor many programs in all regions in this bill. Given that there will be \nnecessary cuts throughout all of these accounts, Africa should not \nsuffer any more than other accounts simply because it lacks the \nearmarks that have been given to other regions of the world.\n  Development assistance for Africa used to be provided through a \nseparate account called the Development Fund for Africa (DFA), which \nwas created in the fiscal year 1988 appropriations bill to meet a broad \nrange of objectives specifically aimed at Africa, including rural and \nsustainable development, private sector development, maternal and child \nhealth needs, and educational improvement, particularly in the primary \ngrades. For a variety of reasons, the DFA has been dropped as a \nseparate funding account. Nevertheless, the goals and programs embodied \nin the DFA continue to be important in terms of our Africa program.\n  For many years, these goals were championed by our former colleagues \nand former Chairmen of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, Senators \nNancy Kassebaum-Baker and Paul Simon. As the current Ranking Member of \nthat subcommittee, I share their commitment to these goals. I have seen \nhow the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa are increasingly becoming \neven\n\n[[Page S9861]]\n\nmore relevant to United States interests, and our economic, political, \nhumanitarian, and security concerns.\n  Long-term development assistance to African nations--whether through \nbilateral or multilateral channels--directly complements U.S. foreign \npolicy goals and national security interests.\n  There are several examples of this complementary relationship.\n  First, we have an interest in a safe and healthy environment. The \nrapid spread of the Ebola virus demonstrated some of the areas of \nvulnerability on the African continent. Now, unfortunately, the rates \nof HIV and AIDS infections in Africa are the highest in the world, and \nthey are continuing to rise rapidly. As we have seen, viruses do not \nneed visas.\n  Second, we have an interest in expanding trade and investment ties \nwith the African continent. U.S. exports to Africa expanded by 22.7 \npercent in 1995--this is nearly twice the growth rate of total U.S. \nexports worldwide. Already U.S. exports to Africa equal 54 percent more \nthan our exports to the former Soviet Union. We export more to South \nAfrica alone than to all of Eastern Europe combined.\n  Third, we have an interest in democracy. More than half of African \nnations now can be considered democratic or have made substantial \nprogress toward democracy. Many of these nations also are moving toward \nfree-market economies.\n  Fourth, we have an interest in human resource development. Sub-\nSaharan Africa has the fastest growing and poorest population in the \nworld. A substantial percentage of Africa's population is under 18 \nyears of age. These children will soon grow to adulthood and I hope \nthere will be opportunities for them to lead productive and dignified \nlives, in which their basic human needs are met. At the same time, \nAfrica's infant and child mortality rates are 2 to 3 times higher than \nthose in Latin America or Asia.\n  Finally, we have an interest in security. It is unfortunate, but \nAfrica also is home to terrorist activity and to drug and arms \ntrafficking. As the recent bombings of our embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania, and the bombing of a crowded restaurant in South Africa have \npainfully demonstrated, Africa is not immune to the scourge of \nterrorism.\n  Mr. President, a stable African continent serves American interests. \nThe Development Fund for Africa was created to ensure a steady source \nof long-term development funds for Africa. Over the past decade, the \nDFA has contributed to substantial gains in health care, education, \nsmall business development, democracy, and stability. A sustained \nassistance program for Africa helps African nations to invest in \ndevelopment and not in crises. The types of challenges we face in \nAfrica today are very complex and require long-term solutions. And this \nrequires long-term investment.\n  As a result of DFA assistance, African farmers are growing more food, \nmore children are attending primary school, and more informal sector \nentrepreneurs have access to credit than was possible 10 years ago. And \nthe United States has played a key role in helping several African \ncountries experience dramatic drops in fertility through effective \nfamily planning and health care programs.\n  In sum, Mr. President, our assistance program represents a sound \ninvestment in our relationship with the continent of Africa that \nsignals our continued interest in remaining engaged with Africa. I hope \nthat during consideration of this bill in the Senate, in the House, and \nin conference, as well as during the United States Agency for \nInternational Development budgeting process, that we can maintain a \nsimilar proportion of the total development assistance appropriations \nas that requested by the President in the congressional presentation \ndocuments for foreign assistance.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as the Senate considers appropriations for \nforeign operations, I would like to recognize the efforts of two \norganizations headquartered in my home state of Washington. World \nVision Relief and Development (WVRD) and World Concern Development \nOrganization (WCDO) have made great strides in bringing hope to a \ntroubled world.\n  On countless occasions, World Vision has achieved its objective of \nlong-term transformation of human lives through effective \nimplementation of emergency relief, rehabilitation and sustainable \ndevelopment programs throughout the world. World Vision, which is \nlargely funded through the generosity of Americans, has operations in \napproximately 94 different countries. Of particular note is World \nVision's efforts on behalf of the world's children. Through tireless \nefforts in public health and nutrition, the organization has allowed \nchildren to survive.\n  In Sudan, World Vision has shown courageous long-term interest in the \ntragedy that continues to unfold there. Since operating in Sudan since \nthe early 1980s, World Vision has provided 4 therapeutic feeding \ncenters, brought medical supplies and services to the needy, and been \ncommitted to long-term agricultural development.\n  WCDO based in Seattle works in the areas of relief, rehabilitation \nand development to help the recipients in developing countries achieve \nself-sufficiency, economic independence, physical health and spiritual \npeace through integrated community development. WCDO fosters crop \nimprovement through new crops, cash crops and improved seed \ndemonstration projects. It has also raised world literacy rates, \ndeveloped communities, provided shelter for refugees, and given \nthousands the skills necessary to survive and grow. The world is a \nbetter place with WCDO in it.\n  I know the Senate will join me in saluting the care World Vision and \nWorld Concern have shown for those in desperate need of compassion and \na helping hand.\n  (At the request of Mr. Leahy, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have agreed to strike section 578 \nof the bill which contains a reporting requirement relating to arms \nsales. I have done so in response to a request by the chairman and \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  However, both Senator Helms and Senator Biden have agreed that they \nwill include a modified version of this reporting provision which has \nbeen negotiated and agreed upon by myself, Senator Helms, Senator \nBiden, and Senator McConnell in legislation that has been reported by \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and which is expected to be acted on by \nthe Senate later this month. If that legislation is not adopted by the \nSenate or the reporting provision is not included in whatever version \nof that legislation becomes law, Senator Helms, Senator Biden, and \nSenator McConnell have agreed to support its inclusion in the FY 1999 \nForeign Operations Conference Report, a Continuing Resolution, or \nwhatever other legislative vehicle is appropriate. My purpose in \nstriking section 578 is to give the Foreign Relations Committee an \nopportunity to include the modified reporting provision in its \nlegislation, but to ensure that if that fails it is included in a \nlegislative vehicle that becomes law.\n  Mr. HELMS. The senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I concur.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I concur.\n  (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering S. \n2334, the Foreign Operations and Export Financing Appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 1999.\n  The Senate bill provides $12.6 billion in budget authority and $4.9 \nbillion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of \nState, export and military assistance, bilateral and multilateral \neconomic assistance, and related agencies for fiscal year 1999.\n  When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $12.6 billion in budget \nauthority and $12.6 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1999.\n  The subcommittee is below its section 302(B) allocation for budget \nauthority and outlays.\n  Mr. President, I will ask that a table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend the committee for including \nfull funding for the IMF in this bill. The committee and Senator \nMcConnell's leadership on this issue as well as the sanctions task \nforce is a great contribution to this Congress and the American people.\n\n[[Page S9862]]\n\n  Liquidity levels are at historically low levels at the IMF and if we \nchoose not to fund our share of the increase, there will be no \nincreases from the other 181 members of the IMF. According to IMF \nbylaws, no U.S. participation would guarantee no world participation in \nthe increased funding.\n  The language in this bill and passed by the Senate in the 1998 \nsupplemental also addresses the reforms needed by the IMF, especially \naddressing the issues of greater transparency and stronger promotion of \nfree trade.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  I ask that the table to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  The table follows:\n\n           S. 2334, FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS, 1999 SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                   [Fiscal year 1999, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Defense  Nondefense   Crime  Mandatory    Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     12,554   ......        45     12,599\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     12,595   ......        45     12,640\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     12,600   ......        45     12,645\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     12,600   ......        45     12,645\n1998 level:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     13,215   ......        44     13,259\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     12,829   ......        44     12,873\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     14,079   ......        45     14,124\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     13,002   ......        45     13,047\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......  ..........  ......        45   ........\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......      7,695   ......        45   ........\n \n               SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......        -46   ......  .........       -46\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......         -5   ......  .........        -5\n1998 level:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......       -661   ......         1       -660\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......       -234   ......         1       -233\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     -1,525   ......  .........    -1,525\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......       -407   ......  .........      -407\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     12,554   ......  .........    12,554\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......      4,900   ......  .........     4,900\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I would like to commend the Committee on \nAppropriations for including language in its report on S. 2334, the \nForeign Operations Appropriations Bill for FY 1999, related to the \nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. In its discussion \nof funding for the International Fund for Agricultural Development \n(IFAD), the Committee notes its support for that organization's efforts \nto implement this important Convention. The United States was \ninstrumental in negotiation of this treaty, and has signed it, but the \nSenate has yet to exercise its advice and consent responsibilities on \nit.\n  Mr. President, desertification is a serious problem with which many \nof my colleagues may not be familiar. I fear the Convention may be \noverlooked because of this ignorance, but at great cost and with little \nreason.\n\n\n                     The Problem of Desertification\n\n  Desertification is the severe land degradation of arid and semi-arid \nregions, rendering such drylands unable to sustain crops or other \nvegetation. It is not the spread of existing deserts, but rather the \ndestruction of fertile soils, largely through human activity. In the \npast, drylands recovered easily following long droughts and dry \nperiods. Under modern conditions, however, they tend to lose their \nbiological and economic productivity quickly unless they are \nsustainably managed. Today drylands on every continent are being \ndegraded by over-cultivation, deforestation and poor irrigation \npractices. Excessive population pressure and unwise economic policies \nalso exacerbate the problem.\n  Over one-quarter of the Earth's land surface is endangered by \ndesertification, threatening the livelihoods of one billion people. In \nAfrica, 73 percent of drylands are moderately or severely desertified, \nand the proportion of drylands affected by desertification is \ncomparable. In addition, 40 percent of the land surface of the United \nStates, covering most of 17 western states, qualifies as affected \ndryland areas. The direct worldwide economic loss from desertification, \nmainly from decreased agricultural productivity, is estimated at $42 \nbillion per year, while the cost of actions needed to combat it is \nestimated at between $10-22 billion annually. The loss of annual income \nin areas immediately affected by desertification in the United States \nis an estimated $5 billion. It is clear that it is far more cost-\neffective to prevent desertification than to deal with its devastating \nconsequences.\n  To most Americans, the Dust Bowl of the 1930's is the most familiar \nexample of desertification and its consequences--massive hunger, \npoverty, and migration. Mr. President, desertification is far more than \nan environmental problem. It is connected to famine, malnutrition, \nstarvation, epidemics, poverty, economic and social instability and \nmass migration. Desertification contributes to water scarcity. In many \ncountries, inadequate water resources leads to increased political \ntension, often rendering desertification a security issue. Around the \nworld, desertification and water shortages lead to reduced crop \nproduction, hunger and mass migration which can spark turmoil and armed \nconflict over scarce food resources. These upheavals can result in \nheavy costs to the U.S. taxpayer in the form of extended humanitarian \nassistance or large immigration programs.\n  The Convention to Combat Desertification was called for at the U.N. \nConference on Environment and Development in Rio in 1992, when the \nseverity of the problem was recognized. At that time, several African \nnations argued that the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions did \nnot address their major environmental concern--desertification.\n  The United States has since been an active participant during the \nnegotiation and drafting process. The Convention entered into force in \n1996 and has been ratified by more than 120 countries. The President \nsubmitted the treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent in August \nof 1996, but no action has yet taken place. It is crucial that we \nconsider this treaty as soon as possible, prior to the Conference of \nthe Parties, due to take place in November.\n  Mr. President, this treaty is unlike the other environmental \nconventions brought before the Senate in recent years. It advocates a \nunique method that I believe will have efficient, effective outcomes. \nNot only is this the first international treaty to address directly the \nissue of poverty and land degradation in rural areas, but it also calls \nfor the participation of resource users in the development of \nsolutions. This is one of the most important facets of the convention; \nby stressing the need for concerted, cooperative action at all levels, \nstrategies to attack this problem becomes an amalgamation of expertise \nand experience. First-hand knowledge of the problem and an awareness of \nthe particularities means that programs will be specifically designed \nto meet the needs of a certain area. This method will also empower the \nresidents of countries--mostly developing countries--where \ndesertification is a particular problem, helping people to help \nthemselves.\n  The Convention calls upon affected countries to establish national \naction plans to combat the problem at local and regional levels, and \ncalls upon developed countries to channel existing bilateral and \nmultilateral funds to support these programs. These national action \nplans mean that countries will be active participants that will accept \nresponsibility without imposing some kind of universal solution on \ncountries that may have different needs.\n  Thus, the Convention aims to ensure that funding programs are better \ncoordinated, that funding is based on the needs of affected countries, \nthat donor countries can be sure their funds are well spent, and that \nrecipients obtain the maximum benefit from the sums available. No new \nfunding is required. Instead, the treaty establishes a Global Mechanism \nwhich can serve to mobilize and coordinate donor resources to combat \nthe problem of desertification.\n  The United States has a long history of managing its drylands. \nDesertification affected hundreds of thousands of Americans during the \nDustbowl years of the 1930s, when impoverished farmers had to abandon \ntheir exhausted land. Today, desertification in the United States has \nbeen associated with Western grazing and water management practices. \nAspects of the desertification process, such as soil erosion, present a \nserious threat to agricultural productivity. As a result of these \ndecades of experience, we have created a variety of programs and \ninstitutions to combat drought. The United States is considered to have \nthe premier technology and expertise in this area, and so our \nparticipation in the Convention to Combat\n\n[[Page S9863]]\n\nDesertification can really determine its success.\n  It is of course important to consider the implications of the treaty \nfor the United States. The Convention to Combat Desertification does \nnot require any land-use restrictions, legislation or regulations for \nU.S. implementation. The President has asserted that if the U.S. was to \nratify the treaty its obligations would be met by current law and on-\ngoing programs. Most importantly, the Convention does not call for \nincreased funding from the United States. This treaty operates on \nexisting levels of aid.\n  Mr. President, around the world desertification and water shortages \nlead to reduced crop production, hunger, and mass migration which can \nspark turmoil and armed conflict over scarce food resources. The \nConvention to Combat Desertification could lead to powerful preventive \naction that reduces dependence on U.S. foreign aid.\n  Mr. President, there are many reasons why it is in the U.S. national \ninterest to ratify the Convention to Combat Desertification.\n  First, expectations are high among the CCD nations that private \nsector business and NGOs will play a key role in coordinating and \nimplementing the provisions of the treaty. The U.S. agricultural \nindustry, our excellent university system, and strong network of NGOs \nhave much to offer their counterparts in developing countries in \ncombating desertification. The treaty provides opportunities for U.S. \nagribusiness to build positive relationships with developing country \ngovernments and to improve the policy environment for bilateral trade \nin their emerging markets. By providing the necessary institutional \nmechanisms, the CCD will facilitate the transfer of technology and \ninformation from U.S. business firms to the world's huge and expanding \ndrylands.\n  It is clear that ratifying the CCD creates a number of opportunities \nfor the U.S. private sector, including the export of American technical \nassistance and expertise in erosion control. Failure to ratify will \nplace American agribusiness at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis \nsimilar businesses in the 128 countries that have already ratified the \nCCD.\n  Second, being part of the CCD is critical to U.S. leadership in \npromoting democracy and sound stewardship of natural resources around \nthe world. If the Senate ratifies the Convention prior to adjournment \nthis year, the U.S. could play a major role in decisions affecting the \ntreaty's implementation this November.\n  Third, helping fight desertification abroad, and the poverty that \ngoes with it, benefits American exports and the U.S. trade balance. \nRising incomes in the agricultural sector of developing countries \ngenerate a higher demand for U.S. exports of seeds, fertilizer, agro-\nchemicals, farm and irrigation equipment as well as other U.S. produced \ngoods and services. By helping build markets in developing countries, \nwe gain greater access to them in the long run.\n  As desertification deepens poverty worldwide, it undercuts economic \ngrowth and triggers social instability in developing countries. This \nresults in more frequent and costly U.S. food programs, increased \nimmigration to the U.S. from land-degraded countries like Mexico, and \nreduced foreign markets for American businesses. The CCD has the \npotential to alleviate these problems, with no additional American \nforeign aid. It also stimulates business and leads to better trade \nenvironments.\n  Mr. President, this Convention is important to the leaders of many \nAfrican nations. In fact, it was presented as a priority of the African \nDiplomatic Corps prior to President Clinton's trip to Africa earlier \nthis year.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I have \nhad the opportunity to see first hand how valuable the provisions of \nthis Convention will be to the people of Africa. It is a mechanism by \nwhich the people of Africa will be assisted in preserving and \nprotecting their land, which is a vital element in Africa's fight to \nbecome self-sufficient. This convention is innovative because it \nrequires participation from all segments of the population, from the \nfarmers and herders who work the land, to local governments and \nenvironmental organizations, to those who affect environmental and \nagricultural policy at the national and regional levels. It works from \nthe bottom-up, incorporating the knowledge of those directly involved \nfor a more effective approach.\n  The consideration of this Convention will also refocus the Senate's \nattention on the plight of the African people. It is the perfect \nopportunity for the Senate to go on record in support of programs that \nare both vital to the African continent and consistent with United \nStates foreign, economic, and environmental policy. The Convention also \nfurthers the Administration's stated policy to build a new partnership \nwith Africa.\n  Mr. President, there has been virtually no formal opposition to the \nConvention to Combat Desertification. The same arguments used against \nU.S. participation in the United Nations or in other international \norganizations or against other environmental treaties--views I do not \nshare, but which nevertheless are argued here in this body--simply do \nnot apply to the CCD. There are no possible constraints on U.S. \nsovereignty or policies, but just the sort of benefits that I have \ndescribed.\n  This should be a non-controversial issue, and it is in our best \ninterest to deal with it as soon as possible. Swift ratification \nensures U.S. leadership and potential profit. I hope that the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, of which I am an active member, will \nact on this treaty in a timely manner.\n\n\n                              peace corps\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for 37 years now, the Peace Corps has been \npromoting international peace and friendship through the service abroad \nof American volunteers. More than 150,000 Americans from every \nbackground have served in the Peace Corps in 132 countries. Right now, \nmore than 6,500 peace Corps Volunteers are living and working alongside \nlocal people in 84 countries.\n  The Peace Corps is a model of citizen service on international scale \nand a model of American leadership in the world. In their engagement \nabroad, American Peace Corps Volunteers share and represent the culture \nand values of the American people, while living and working alongside \nlocal people, and speaking the local language. In doing so, they earn \nrespect and admiration for our country. This is a different type of \nAmerican Leadership and an important complement to our formal U.S. \nforeign policy.\n  From the day of its establishment, the Peace Corps has seen strong \nby-partisan support for its programs. I regret that this year the \nsubcommittee has not been able to fund the Peace Corps at the \nadministrations full request. However, I do understand the difficult \nbudgetary constraints facing the subcommittee this year.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. I too regret that we were limited in our ability to \nprovide funding. Unfortunately, the funding allotted to the 150 account \nis inadequate to meet all our foreign policy needs. I believe the \nmembers of the subcommittee made best efforts to fund all worthy \nprograms including the Peace Corps. There may be opportunities to \nreview some of these levels in conference.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his remarks. \nCertainly, I would hope that additional funds could be found to \nsupplement the FY 1999 Peace Corps budget if at all possible. As my \ncolleagues know, the Peace Corps is a very personal matter for me as I \nserved as a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Dominican Republic. This was a \nvery worthwhile experience for me personally.\n  I know that our colleague from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, also has very \npersonal feelings with respect to the Peace Corps having served as a \nPeace Corps Director before being elected to the Senate.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. Mr. President, \nPeace Corps volunteers are some of our best ambassadors to the world. \nThey represent the finest characteristics of the American people: a \nstrong work ethic, generosity of spirit, a commitment to service, and \nan approach to problems that is both optimistic and pragmatic. The \npeople-to-people nature of the Peace Corps, and its separation from the \nformal conduct of the foreign policy of the United States, has allowed \nVolunteers to establish a record\n\n[[Page S9864]]\n\nof service that is respected and recognized globally.\n  Furthermore, the Peace Corps is helping to prepare America's \nworkforce with overseas experience by training Volunteers to use skills \nthat are increasingly important to America's participation in the \ninternational economy. Volunteers worldwide learn more than 180 \nlanguages and dialects, and they receive extensive cross-cultural \ntraining that enables them to function effectively at a professional \nlevel in different cultural settings. Returned Volunteers often use \nthese skills and experiences to enhance careers in virtually every \nsector of our society--Congress, the Executive branch, the Foreign \nService, education, business, finance, industry, trade, health care, \nand social services.\n  The Peace Corps has emerged as a model of citizen service and of \npractical assistance to people in 132 developing countries, as my \ncolleague mentioned. I can certify that during my tenure as Director \nand since then, virtually every ambassador or other official I have met \nfrom countries with volunteers is an enthusiastic supporter of the \nPeace Corps. They view the Peace Corps as the most successful program \nof its kind. I think it is the right time to look to further expansion \nof the Peace Corps and I believe reaching a level of 10,000 volunteers \nis an appropriate goal. I appreciate the funding constraints the \nSenator from Vermont spoke of. I hope that more resources do become \navailable and at that time would look forward to working with my \ncolleagues from Connecticut, Vermont, and the Chairman to prepare the \nPeace Corps for extending its mission into the 21st Century.\n\n\n                              section 907\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, there is perhaps no greater foreign \npolicy priority in the post-cold-war world than assisting former \nCommunist countries in making the difficult transition to democracy. \nThe fall of the Soviet Union was not the final victory of the cold war. \nThat will come only when all of these former adversaries embrace \nliberty, free markets, and the rule of law. Recognizing this, the 102nd \nCongress in 1992, passed the Freedom Support Act. This bill \nacknowledged that we can help countries make the transition to \ndemocracy both with the carrot of economic aid and the stick of \nwithholding such assistance. It included a provision, Section 907, \nwhich mandated that with the exception of humanitarian aid, democracy-\nbuilding funds, and investment assistance, Azerbaijan will not receive \nany direct economic aid until it ceases the blockade of neighboring \nArmenia and the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.\n  However, since that historic moment in 1992, this provision of the \nFreedom Support Act has repeatedly come under fire for its scope and \nperceived effect on relations between the United States and Azerbaijan. \nOpponents of Section 907 have repeatedly sought the opportunity to \nweaken its restrictions, or eliminate them altogether, arguing that \nthey are no longer valid and have unfairly constrained U.S. investment \nin the Caspian Sea region. In response, I would argue that Section 907 \nis still necessary to safeguard the rights of the Armenian people.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Bill reaffirms our commitment to Section 907 of the \nFreedom Support Act. By doing so, this Congress reaffirms our \ncommitment to the peaceful resolution of international conflicts and to \nthe Armenian people themselves. The Azeri blockade of Armenia and \nNagorno-Karabakh is a direct result of the dispute between the two \ncountries over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the longest-running \nethnic conflict in the former USSR. The human cost to date has been \n35,000 lives and 1.4 million refugees.\n  The Azeri blockade has been particularly brutal for Armenia which \nrelies on its ties to the outside world for survival. It is a land-\nlocked country where only 17 percent of the land is arable. Due to the \nblockade, 80 percent of the Armenian population now live in poverty. \nHumanitarian assistance cannot get to Armenia, which is still trying to \nrebuild from the devastating earthquake of a decade ago, and Nagorno-\nKarabakh is dealing with a critical shortage of medical equipment. \nIndustrial recovery has been stalled as 90 percent of Armenia's energy \nsupply comes from abroad, and without its usual rail and transportation \nroutes, Armenia is forced to rely on chartered cargo flights from \nRussia and Ukraine, or insecure land connections through Georgia, one \nof the most unstable countries in the former Soviet Union.\n  Mr. President, the tragedy is that while life in Armenia is bleak, \nAzerbaijan has a bright future. It is estimated that Azerbaijan \ncontrols oil reserves of 40 billion barrels, and with it the potential \nto generate tremendous revenue. Section 907 will not cripple \nAzerbaijan. Indeed, since 1992, we have sent $130 million of \nhumanitarian aid to ensure that this does not happen. Instead, this \nprovision sends a powerful message to the Azeri government that in the \npost-Cold War era the United States will not tolerate the inhumane and \nbelligerent treatment of innocent people in Armenia, in the former \nUSSR, or anywhere the world over. We owe it to the Armenian people to \ncontinue this pressure on Azerbaijan to lift its blockade, and I am \nproud that this bill keeps Section 907 intact.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3516\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment offered by Senator Kennedy regarding the tragedy of Pan Am \nFlight 103. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the bombing over \nLockerbie, Scotland which killed 270 people. The memory of the 189 \nAmerican citizens on board that doomed flight has not faded with the \npassage of time, but those who want to see justice done have become \nincreasingly frustrated with the amount of time it has taken to try and \nbring the perpetrators to justice.\n  It now appears as if the indicated suspects, Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi \nand Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, may finally be tried for their crime. The \nUnited States-United Kingdom proposal urges Colonel Qaddafi to transfer \nthe suspects to the Netherlands to stand trial before a Scottish court, \nunder Scottish law, and by a panel of Scottish judges. However, I \nbelieve that it is critical for the United States to retain its \npressure on Colonel Qaddafi to comply with the will of the \ninternational community. Qaddafi must transfer these suspects to the \nNetherlands, but the United States must also continue to refuse to \nnegotiate with Qaddafi on this issue. Should Qaddafi fail to transfer \nthe suspects, it is critical that the United Nations prepare a strong \nresponse and impose a multilateral oil embargo against Libya. I \nwholeheartedly support the language of this amendment, and I am pleased \nto be a cosponsor.\n\n\n                   restrictions on imet for indonesia\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to comment on one provision \nof the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill that does not appear in \nthis year's bill, for fiscal year 1999, and that is the provision that \nwould impose certain restrictions for security assistance to Indonesia.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, since 1992, the Congress has \nimposed restrictions on the provision of International Military \nEducation and Training, known as IMET, to Indonesia, in response to the \ndespicable treatment by the Indonesian military in East Timor the \nprevious year, when more than 100 civilians were brutally massacred. In \nthe Foreign Operations bill that year, for FY 1993, the Congress cut \noff all IMET assistance for Indonesia.\n  A few years later, in the Foreign Operations Appropriation bill for \nfiscal year 1996, Congress authorized a limited form of IMET, known as \n``expanded IMET,'' meaning military training courses focused on the \nmanagement of defense resources, improvement in domestic systems of \nmilitary justice in accordance with internationally recognized human \nrights, and the principle of civilian control of the military. This was \nthe result of a compromise between those of my colleagues who support \nclose ties between the United States military and Indonesia, and those \nof us, myself included, who remained skeptical and opposed because of \ncontinuing human rights abuses in Indonesia.\n  In 1997, Indonesia withdrew completely from the program because it \nrecognized the continuing opposition from some of us in Congress to \nthese relations. President Suharto wanted to avoid what he knew would \nbe criticism over his military's treatment of East Timor, and he \ndecided that IMET, ultimately, was not worth it to him.\n\n[[Page S9865]]\n\n  This year, the Appropriations Committee has decided to remove the \nlimitations on IMET for Indonesia. I welcome the Committee's report \nlanguage urging the Defense Security Assistance Agency to consult with \nCongress regarding its plans for IMET training in Indonesia, \nparticularly given past human rights concerns. However, since such \nconsultation is not mandated, I would hope the DSAA will follow this \nproscription, and consult early and fully with the relevant \nappropriations and authorizing committees of both Houses of Congress.\n  Nevertheless, it is my strong view that 1998 is not the year to \nchange our policy with respect to IMET in Indonesia.\n  Congress wisely restricted IMET at a time when the Indonesian \nmilitary was clearly involved in myriad abuses. This year, Indonesia \nhas certainly undergone tremendous changes. We have seen the country \nsuffer through a quickly downsliding economy. We have seen student \ndemonstrations not thought possible in that country's restrictive \npolitical environment. And then, amazingly, we have seen the \nresignation of long-time authoritarian leader Suharto.\n  The country's new leader, President B.J. Habibie, has certainly taken \nsome steps that are encouraging. He has released some political \nprisoners, and allowed workers to form unions. He has pledged to hold \nparliamentary elections by May and presidential election by December \n1999. And, he has even broached the sensitive subject of East Timor, \nagreeing to hold talks on the region's status, and announcing a \ndrawdown of some troops.\n  But, in my view, these actions should still be considered mere \npreliminary steps. They are promising, but do not yet warrant a policy \nchange with respect to our military training.\n  Notably, Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, and \nother reliable sources in Dili, the capital of East Timor, believe the \nsituation in East Timor remains substantially unchanged. Asked if he \nsaw any concrete results after the UN action, the bishop said firmly, \n``Not yet.'' In early August, Belo stated, ``There is still \nintimidation and terror.''\n  In late July, there was a widely publicized announcement of \nIndonesian troop withdrawal from East Timor, with about 100 foreign \njournalists brought there for the occasion. The problem is that there \nis every indication that the drawdown may not actually have taken \nplace. Bishop Belo stated on August 20 that the troops were actually \nshifted to the western side of the island and later brought back to \nEast Timor in trucks. ``We must denounce this,'' Bishop Belo said at \nthe time. Other sources note that the army in East Timor's rural areas \ndoes not seem to act in the same spirit of reform that the leadership \nin Jakarta is professing.\n  With all the political changes taking place in Indonesia, generally, \nit remains critical that the country's government make strong efforts \nto demilitarize East Timor as quickly as possible, and establish a \nUnited Nations or other international presence to protect human rights. \nUntil such measures are in place, any claims of progress can have \nlittle credibility. There is a strong need to monitor closely \nconditions on the ground.\n  Given this unsure environment, and particularly the unclear role of \nthe military in the transition process, I believe restrictions on IMET \ntraining continue to be appropriate.\n  As a result, I am disappointed that this year's bill does not include \nthe restrictions that were first included in the Foreign Operations \nbill for fiscal year 1996, and continued every year since then. I \nbelieve removing these restrictions represents a radical step that I \nfear will send the wrong signal to the Indonesian Government.\n  It is, however, my understanding that the House version of this bill, \nwhich is still in committee, is likely to include these restrictions. \nIf this is the case, it is my sincere hope that the Senate conferees \nwill agree to accept the House version of these provisions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in going through the fiscal year 1999 \nforeign operations appropriations bill and accompanying report, I was \npleased by the apparent reduction in earmarks and other wasteful and \nunnecessary spending compared with past years. The fact that part of \nthe reason for this reduction is that programs traditionally funded in \nthe foreign operations bill have been shifted to other appropriations \nbills only mildly diminishes my enthusiasm for the progress that has \nbeen made on this bill.\n  Foreign aid programs, as all of us in Congress know, are enormously \nunpopular with the vast majority of the American populace. That only \none percent of the federal budget is allocated for foreign assistance \nand generally supports U.S. foreign policy objectives does not detract \nfrom the extreme disfavor with which the public views the notion of \ntheir tax dollars going to foreign countries. It has always been to \nCongress' credit that it passes foreign aid legislation every year \ndespite public opposition out of this recognition for the very \nimportant role aid programs play in facilitating economic growth and \nsocial stability in less developed nations.\n  While the bill before us includes fewer earmarks for the benefit of \nparochial or other favored programs, there are still too many. Some of \nthe examples of earmarks and other wasteful spending are annual \noccurrences. A particularly egregious case in point is the annual $3 \nmillion allocation for the International Fertilizer Development Center. \nAn annual provision in the foreign aid bill, it is highly questionable \nwhether the millions of dollars funneled to this program are warranted \nby its actual value to less developed countries or to the American \npublic. Some justification for this funding, as well as a sense of \nwhether it could and should be competitively awarded, would go a long \nway toward alleviating my concern about its continued inclusion in this \nbill.\n  The International Law Enforcement Academy for the Western Hemisphere \nin Roswell, New Mexico is the recipient in this bill of $5 million. \nThis is a classic earmark, matching an activity established and \ngeographically located for parochial reasons. That the bill mandates it \nreceive $5 million simply compounds the injury to the integrity of the \nfederal budget process represented by this project. Clearly, the \nconcept of fiscal responsibility remains alien to members of this body.\n  One area in which there has been no discernable improvement is \nearmarking for specific academic institutions, a practice that wastes \nmillions of dollars every year, either in clearly questionable programs \nor by failing to mandate competitive bidding processes. The \naccompanying list includes these projects, but a few in particular \nwarrant special mention. The International Integrated Pest Management \nTraining and Research Center at the University of Vermont probably does \nfine work in the field of pest management--a serious endeavor given the \nscale of damage to crops regularly inflicted through pest \ninfestations--but directing the Agency for International Development to \nprovide it $1 million without the benefit of a competitive process is \ntypically irresponsible.\n\n  The foreign operations appropriations bill also includes earmarks for \nthe University of Hawaii, University of Northern Iowa, George Mason \nUniversity, Utah State University, Montana State University, \nMississippi State University, and the aforementioned project at the \nUniversity of Vermont. Of these seven university earmarks, five are \nlocated in the states of members of the Appropriations Committee and a \nsixth is in the state of the Senate majority leader. You don't have to \nbe Hercule Poirot to be suspicious of this pattern. Israel being a \ndesert country and Hawaii being the quintessential tropical climate, it \nmakes perfect sense that they are corroborating on a project involving \ntropical plants and animals. I strongly encourage AID to look closely \nat the merits of this project before allocating scarce resources toward \nit.\n  Additional funds are expected to flow to universities through the \nCollaborative Research Support Projects (CRSPs) for such worthwhile \ncauses as cowpea, peanut, pond dynamics, and sorghum/millet development \nprograms. That the peanut industry enjoys considerable political \ninfluence is not news; that the Appropriations Committee wants to \nallocate funds for research on pond scum, however, is, as Monty Python \nused to say, ``something really different.''\n  Finally, S. 2334 continues the onerous practice of minimizing the \nvalue of foreign aid dollars through protectionist\n\n[[Page S9866]]\n\nprovisions. While the ``Buy America'' section of the bill is not \nmandatory, an appropriations bill automatically carries with it a \ncertain implicit authority. Declaring that, ``to the maximum extent \npossible, assistance provided under this Act should make full use of \nAmerican resources . . .'' is clearly intended to convey a certain \nmessage to pertinent federal agencies. The mandatory reporting \nrequirement imposed on these agencies included in this section of the \nbill can be expected to have precisely that effect.\n  Mr. President, the waste and noncompetitive allocations represented \nin the foreign operations appropriations bill is minuscule relative to \nthe billions literally wasted in the defense and transportation bills \non highly questionable programs. Given the disdain with which the \nAmerican public views foreign aid, however, the types of earmarks \nspecified in the accompanying list represent a serious diversion of \nscarce resources otherwise needed for truly worthy programs. I regret \nthat Congress feels compelled to continue to act without a sense of \nrestraint, but I have been around long enough to understand that my \nprotestations won't change the system. That I can at least illuminate \nthe problem will have to suffice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of objectionable programs be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n OBJECTIONABLE PROGRAMS IN THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS BILL \n                              FOR FY 1999\n\n                TITLE II--BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE\n\n                             [In millions]\n\nPrograms with funds earmarked:\n\n  American Schools and Hospitals abroad...........................$15.0\n    American University in Beirut\n    Lebanese American University\n    Hadassah Medical Organization\n    Feinberg Graduate School of the Weizmann Institute of Science in \n        Israel\n    Johns Hopkins University's Bologna and Nanjing Centers\n  U.S. Telecommunications Training Institute........................0.5\n  Mitch McConnell Conservation Fund.................................1.2\n  University Development Assistance Programs.......................12.5\n    Mississippi State University\n    Arab-American University of Jenin\n    University of Vermont\n    American University of Armenia ($10.0)\n    Montana State University\n  International Fertilizer Development Center.......................3.0\n  Microenterprise Poverty Programs................................145.0\n  Opportunities Industrialization Centers, International............0.4\n  Carelift International............................................3.0\n  International Fund for Agricultural Development...................2.5\n  International Law Enforcement Academy--Western Hemisphere.........5.0\nPrograms for which the committee recommends funding:\n\n  MasterCare International--encourages funding......................3.4\n  Center for Health and Population Research--encourages funding for \n    establishment of an endowment to supplement Center's annual budg1.5\n  Patrick J.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my thoughts on the \nbill currently pending before the Senate. In particular, I would like \nto comment on the inclusion of the $14.5 billion to replenish the \nInternational Monetary Fund's (IMF) capital base and the $3.5 billion \nfor the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB). I appreciate the responsible \naction taken by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee and the full Appropriations Committee in \nincluding these provisions in this bill.\n  The continuing international financial crisis poses too great of a \nthreat to the economic prosperity of the American people for Congress \nto delay action on funding the IMF. The economic disruptions in Asia \nare impacting U.S. export markets and having an adverse effect on the \nU.S. economy as a whole. In my home state of Nebraska--where 45% of all \nexports go to East Asia and support 56,000 jobs in agriculture, food \nprocessing, transportation, and manufacturing--people have already felt \nthe effects of the Asian crisis. The economic repercussions in the \nUnited States of a further spread of the Asian financial flu should not \nbe underestimated. For this reason, swift Congressional action is \nnecessary to restore confidence and hedge against future disruptions.\n  Aside from the economic consequences, I am deeply concerned this \ncrisis could affect our security interests. For anyone who doubts the \nnational security ramifications, all you have to do is to turn on the \ntelevision to see the effects of spreading instability. The political \nchaos in Russia that has resulted from their economic troubles \nthreatens not only Russia's free market reforms but the historic \ndemocratic achievements of the Russian people. The political and \neconomic collapse of Russia would favor elements intent on returning to \nthe days of dictatorship and central economic planning. Cooperation \nwith Russia would be replaced with conflict; our peace and security \nwould be threatened.\n  The Senate passed legislation earlier this year as a part of the FY98 \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that would have provided the \nfull $18 billion requested by the President for the IMF. However, \nfunding for the IMF became mired in non-related, political battles and \nwas not acted upon by the House of Representatives. The failure to act \nat that time was irresponsible. The failure to act now would be \ndisastrous.\n  Mr. President, while there is no guarantee that timely Congressional \naction on IMF funding could have helped avoid the current difficulties \nin Russia and Asia, we should not wait for economic instability to \nspread and to further jeopardize the economic health and safety of our \nnation. We must act now to restore confidence and promote economic \ngrowth in the United States and in the global economic system.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Global Environment Facility\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to direct my colleagues' \nattention to an issue that has not been given sufficient attention \nduring debate on this bill--funding for the Global Environment Facility \n(GEF). The legislation before us provides $47.5 million for the GEF, \nfar less than the Administration's request and $145 million short of \nthe amount necessary to cover our arrears to the GEF.\n  The GEF was created because the world's developed nations sought to \ninvolve the developing world in improving the global environment, but \nrealized that they lacked the resources and technology to make \nsignificant\n\n[[Page S9867]]\n\nprogress on their own. The GEF was designed to help these nations act \nin an environmentally responsible manner in areas where their actions \nwould have a broad environmental impact. For we all know that if we are \ngoing to make significant progress in solving the world's most pressing \nenvironmental problems, there will have to be a collective effort by \nmost of the world's nations.\n  In 1994, developed nations pledged $2 billion to the GEF, payable \nover four years. The U.S. portion of that replenishment was $430 \nmillion. To date, Congress has appropriated substantially less, and \ntotal arrears amount to $192.5 million. And now several donor countries \nare beginning to condition their own contributions on payment of our \npast due amounts. Without new funding, the GEF's ability to implement \nits programs will end in about six months.\n  Mr. President, the GEF has emerged as the principal international \nfunding mechanism for global environmental protection. The organization \nworks in four areas--biodiversity, energy, ozone protection, and \ninternational waters. Over 500 projects in 119 countries have been \nfunded under GEF's own unique approach. To obtain the most impact for \nits limited resources, the GEF generally does not fund entire projects. \nInstead it funds the difference between what it would cost a country to \ndo a project in the traditional manner without environmental \nsafeguards, and the cost of doing that same project in an \nenvironmentally responsible manner.\n  Mr. President, we are all becoming increasingly aware that our \nbiggest environmental problems will require global solutions. And these \nproblems will require financial commitments from many nations. The GEF \nis the only institution of its kind, and is pivotal to the success of \nthese efforts. While it is making strides in resolving some of these \nvery serious problems, it is being hobbled by America's failure to pay \nup. Donors are looking to the U.S. to resume its leadership, and \nbecause of the special provisions of the balanced budget act allowing \npayment of U.S. arrearages to international institutions, we now have \nan opportunity to do so. I urge the managers of this legislation to \nmake this issue a priority in conference with the other body and to \nseize the moment to make good on our debts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3506\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to share some of my reasons for \nvoting in favor of the Specter-Biden amendment that restored the \nComprehensive Test Ban ``prepcom'' funding. I strongly supported the \nSpecter-Biden amendment to restore the $28 million for the U.S. share \nof an international network to monitor nuclear weapons testing.\n  The international monitoring network will support the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty that bans all nuclear weapons explosive tests. This \ntreaty will help our nation's nuclear non-proliferation goals by \nhelping to stem the development of new nuclear weapons. The treaty, \nwhich awaits ratification in the U.S. Senate, has the support of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, former JCS Chairman General Colin Powell, and \nthe vast majority of the American public.\n  Not only would the nuclear testing monitoring network help the U.S. \nas we move toward a nuclear weapons ban, it would also prove useful to \nour national security even without a global testing ban. As I have \nstated repeatedly on the floor, I am a strong supporter of a nuclear \nweapons test ban or C-T-B-T. However, even my colleagues that have not \ndecided to support the treaty should support the international \nmonitoring system on its own merits. Why shouldn't we enhance our \nnation's and our allies ability to detect nuclear weapons tests? The \nnetwork would establish monitoring stations in places like the former \nSoviet Union, China, South Asia and Africa, greatly enhancing our \ncapability to detect nuclear tests.\n  The CTBT's monitoring system is not fully operational. Nevertheless, \neven in its current and incomplete form, the system provided timely \ndata on events at the respective nuclear test sites. Through the CTBT \nPrepcom, we will add monitoring stations in Pakistan, China, \nKazakhstan, Diego Garcia, and elsewhere.\n  We saw the benefits of international monitoring in the seismic event \nin the Kara Sea off of Russia. Six international monitoring stations \ndetected this event on August 16, 1996 in the Kara Sea near the Russian \ntest site. The data from these stations allowed our intelligence \ncommunity to conclude that the event was not nuclear, not associated \nwith Novaya Zemlya activities, but rather, was an earthquake 130 \nkilometers southeast of the Novaya Zemlya test site.\n  In another recent example, the seismic stations in the CTBT Prepcom \nalmost immediately detected the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests, \nenabling the U.S. to identify the location and yield of the tests with \nhigh accuracy. This is clearly a success for the emerging CTBT \ndetection system.\n  Some may ask why the U.S. should fund an international system? Why \ncan't we just go it alone. A key answer is money. The U.S. paying for \nonly 25% of the cost is better than footing the bill for the whole \nsystem. For example, the Air Force originally planned on paying for the \nentire cost of monitoring stations in Kazakhstan and South Korea. \nInstead, we will only pay for 25% of the costs of these stations.\n  In summary, I think there are many good reasons to support a nuclear \nweapons test ban. However, even if one has not yet decided to support \nthe treaty, the funding of an international monitoring system is \nreasonable on its own and I am gratified to see that the majority of my \nSenate colleagues voted in favor of the Specter-Biden amendment.\n\n\n               amendments nos. 3536 through 3538, en bloc\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. There are several manager amendments at the desk, and I \nask they be considered and agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The International Telecommunication Union, an agency of \n     the United Nations, is currently developing recommendations \n     for world standards for the next generation of wireless \n     telecommunications services based on the concept of a \n     ``family'' of standards.\n       (2) On June 30, 1998, the Department of State submitted \n     four proposed standards to the ITU for consideration in the \n     development of those recommendations.\n       (3) Adoption of an open and inclusive set of multiple \n     standards, including all four submitted by the Department of \n     State, would enable existing systems to operate with the next \n     generation of wireless standards.\n       (4) It is critical to the interests of the United States \n     that existing systems be given this ability.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Communications Commission and appropriate executive branch \n     agencies take all appropriate actions to promote development, \n     by the ITU, of recommendations for digital wireless \n     telecommunications services based on a family of open and \n     inclusive multiple standards, including all four standards \n     submitted by the Department of State, so as to allow \n     operation of existing systems with the next generation of \n     wireless standards.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to address a very serious \nproblem facing U.S. telecommunications service and equipment suppliers. \nThe International Telecommunications Union is currently considering the \nimplementation of a family of world standards for the next generation \nof digital wireless communications. These ITU standards will have a \nsignificant impact on the ability of American telecommunications \nequipment and service suppliers to compete in the competitive world \ntelecommunications market. European nations, working through the \nEuropean Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), proposed a \nstandard to the ITU based on Global System for Mobile Communication \n(GSM), the only digital standard permitted by law in Europe. The ETSI \nproposal is not compatible with American developed CDMA technology and \nif adopted by the ITU it could have the affect of shutting U.S. CDMA \nmanufacturers out of the world market and rendering such investments \nobsolete. In light of the EU's decision to only submit a GSM standard \nto the ITU it is important that the United States take steps to ensure \nthat American developed technology is not left behind.\n  The sense of the Senate I offered today with Senator Lott, sends a \nstrong message that the Federal Communications Commission and other \nappropriate executive branch agencies should take all appropriate \nactions to promote U.S. technology in this ITU proceeding. At the \nconclusion of the World Trade Organization Basic Telecommunications \nAgreement, the Administration assured Congress that the \ntelecommunications markets of America's largest trading partners would \nbe open to U.S. companies. However, the European Union is considering a \ntechnical standard for itself that could lock U.S. manufacturers out of \nthe European market. A similar result in the ITU would be devastating. \nI am pleased today that the Senate has sent a clear statement to U.S. \nnegotiators that the pending ITU standards must not reflect a narrow \nand harmful standard that locks American wireless technology out of \nworld markets. Instead, U.S. negotiators should promote a family of \nstandards that are compatible with U.S. technologies and safeguard \nAmerican interests.\n  The ITU is now on notice that whatever standards it may adopt next, \nsuch standards must be harmonized or compatible with each other.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3538\n\n       On page 38, line 22, delete $69,000,000 and insert in lieu \n     thereof $75,000,000.\n       On page 7, line 21, delete $1,890,000,000 and insert in \n     lieu thereof $1,904,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3536, 3537, and 3538) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Indiana wants to \nmodify an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3526, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, there is a technical correction needed, \nwhich has been accepted on both sides. I therefore ask unanimous \nconsent that lines 3 through 16 of the previously adopted amendment No. \n3526 appear on line 24 after the word ``activities.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, finally, let me thank Senator Leahy for \nhis cooperation and friendship as we put this bill together. In \naddition to thanking my friend and colleague, Senator Leahy, I also \nwant to express my appreciation to Tim Rieser, Cara Thanassi, and J.P. \nDowd of Senator Leahy's staff, and Steven Cortese and Jennifer \nChartrand of the full committee, and Billy Piper, Shannon Bishop on my \nstaff, and my long time foreign policy advisor, Robin Cleveland, as \nwell as Senator Stevens. Thanks to all of these people for their \nparticipation in the development of this legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my good friend from Kentucky for all his help and \nfor helping to protect the interests of Members on both sides of the \naisle. He has been a pleasure to work with. As always, he was very ably \nassisted by Robin Cleveland, who has done a tremendous job, and \nJennifer Chartrand and Billy Piper, who have also worked so hard on \nthis. I have had Tim Rieser, Cara Thanassi, and J.P Dowd on my staff. \nTim has been with me for many years, as has J.P. Dowd. This is Cara's \nfirst year working on the Foreign Operations bill and she has been a \ngreat help.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3539\n\n (Purpose: To provide sound management of and support for U.S. Refugee \n                             resettlement)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for Mr. Abraham, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3539.\n       On page 30, line 7, strike the final period and insert a \n     semicolon, and insert the following: ``Provided further, That \n     amounts appropriated under this heading for fiscal year 1999, \n     and amounts previously appropriated\n\n[[Page S9869]]\n\n     under such heading for fiscal year 1998, shall remain \n     available until expended.''\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what does the language mean, so that I can \nunderstand it?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would be happy to elaborate on the \nlegislation. The amendment's purpose is as follows: Each year in our \nrefugee resettlement programs, we have considerable costs associated \nwith that. We appropriate moneys for those. In a typical year, we \nalways have trouble at the end of the year with respect to remaining \nfunds that need to be spent. If there is remaining money at the end of \na year, it will be carried forward to use in the next fiscal year for \nthose purposes.\n  Mr. BYRD. For those purposes again?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Refugee resettlement purposes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3539) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe that completes all of the \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the managers of the bill desire a rollcall?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nCoverdell), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), and the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Mr. Murkowski), are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``nay.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), \nthe Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. \nInouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the last several weeks leading up to the \nend of a Congress are always a pressure packed time and a challenging \ntime for all Members of this body. This fall, of course, is no \nexception. Given the legislative challenges we face, I would prefer \nthat the Judiciary Committee's and the Senate's efforts stay focused \nexclusively on completing remaining legislative and appropriations \nitems. Unfortunately, the Attorney General of the United States, Janet \nReno, has diverted our attention from those issues we would all prefer \nto be working on because of her continued refusal to do what the law \ncompels her: request the appointment of an independent counsel to \nconduct the investigation of the fundraising activities surrounding the \n1996 reelection campaign. I thank my ranking member on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for being willing to meet with me \nand Attorney General Reno and others for almost 3 hours this morning \nand into the afternoon.\n  We met along with top officials and staff of the Justice Department, \nincluding Deputy Attorney General Holder, Criminal Division Director \nJames Robinson, Former Task Force head Charles LaBella, FBI Task Force \nlead agent James DeSarno, Public Integrity head Lee Radek, along with \nHouse Judiciary Chairman Hyde, House Government Reform and Oversight \nChairman Burton, and Ranking Member Waxman, having invited the Ranking \nMember John Conyers as well who could not attend the meeting, regarding \nthe campaign finance investigation and the application of the \nindependent counsel statute to this widespread and dangerous scandal.\n  I had requested this meeting in late July after the existence of the \nso-called LaBella memorandum had come to light. In that memo, Mr. \nLaBella, her handpicked lead investigator with the most extensive \nknowledge of the facts of this scandal, concluded that the facts and \nlaw dictated that a broad independent counsel be appointed to \ninvestigate campaign finance abuses by the 1996 Clinton/Gore reelection \ncampaign, the Clinton administration, and the Democratic National \nCommittee. This memo came several months after a similar written \nconclusion made by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nLouis Freeh.\n  Under federal law, the Attorney General must apply to the special \ndivision of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for appointment \nof an independent counsel whenever, after completion of a preliminary \ninvestigation, she finds that a conflict of interest exists or when she \nfinds specific and credible information that a high-ranking official \nincluded in a specific category of individuals within the executive \nbranch may have violated federal law. The appointment of an independent \ncounsel is a serious matter and one which the Attorney General should \nonly initiate when necessary.\n  Yet, more than one and a half years ago, all ten Republicans on the \nJudiciary Committee felt the time had come to request such an \nappointment. We sent a letter to the Attorney General, as we are \nauthorized to do by the independent counsel statute, requesting that \nshe make an application for an independent counsel and demonstrating \nthe evidence which requires such an application concerning the campaign \nfinance scandal.\n  I must confess, as I did then, to a degree of frustration with the \nIndependent Counsel Act. Did I appreciate having to send our letter? \nCertainly not.\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\n Do I believe that changes need to be made to the Independent Counsel \nAct? Yes. Yet, the Independent Counsel Act is the law of the land and, \nnotwithstanding its relative flaws, we on the Judiciary Committee and \neven a stubborn Attorney General have an obligation to abide by it. \nThat issue was the primary focus of today's meeting.\n  In addition, the Department and my House colleagues asked me to \nbroaden the focus of today's meeting to include a review of the LaBella \nmemorandum. I agreed to this additional focus in order to work toward a \nreasonable resolution of the ongoing contempt dispute between Attorney \nGeneral Reno and the House Committee on Governmental Reform and \nOversight concerning the Attorney General's refusal to produce this \ndocument.\n  I had hoped that today's meeting might allay my concerns that the \nAttorney General is flouting both the independent counsel law and the \nCongress in its legitimate oversight function. Unfortunately, only some \nof my concerns were addressed satisfactorily.\n  On the contempt issue, I believe that Chairman Burton generally \nconcluded that today's review of the partially-redacted memoranda is a \nsolid first step towards a reasonable resolution of the dispute. It is \nclear that we will need to have followup discussions with the \nDepartment as to some of the redactions, but it appears that the \ncontempt crisis possibly may be averted. I congratulate Chairman \nBurton, Ranking Member Waxman, Chairman Hyde, and the Attorney General \nfor striving towards an accommodation, and I am pleased that our \nmeeting had this positive outcome.\n  We are not yet there, and it is a decision that only the House can \nmake. But I have to say I think we made a very important first step, \nhopefully the final step, and towards a positive outcome here.\n  I should point out, however, that approximately 60-70% of the LaBella \nmemo was redacted on the alleged grounds that it discussed material \nprotected under Rule 6(e), and nobody should conclude that the Attorney \nGeneral has made a complete disclosure to the Congress.\n  However, on the larger and more significant issue of the appointment \nof an independent counsel, I cannot announce similar progress. After \nreviewing redacted versions of the memos prepared by Mr. LaBella and \nDirector Freeh, it is clear that both gentlemen have advanced strong, \nconvincing arguments in support of a broad-based independent counsel. \nImportantly, when I asked the Attorney General and her top advisors why \nthose recommendations have, thus far, been rejected, the answers I \nreceived were vague, insufficient, or unconvincing.\n  I have urged Attorney General Reno to appoint a broad-based \nindependent counsel for campaign finance for well over a year. In fact, \nthese events have gone on for well over 2 years. I have written the \nAttorney General numerous times to demonstrate how she is misapplying \nand misunderstanding the independent counsel law. The law allows her to \nappoint an independent counsel if she has information that a crime \nmay--that is the pivotal word, ``may''--have been committed, but she \nhas read the law as requiring that the evidence shows without a doubt \nthat a crime has been committed. This standard is way too high. By \nsetting up these legal standards, she basically has required that a \nsmoking gun walk in the doors of Justice Department before she will do \nanything.\n  I believe she is reexamining that issue. She has promised us to \nreexamine it. She has promised to look into this one final time, and I \nhope with all my heart she is doing so in good faith, and I will give \nher the benefit of the doubt that she is.\n  But, as has been widely reported, numerous individual investigations \nare being handled by the task force. We found out again today that is \ntrue. The LaBella memorandum talked in terms of literally dozens of \nindependent investigations in which he was involved. Yet, the task \nforce has reportedly never conducted an investigation or inquiry into \nthe entire campaign finance matter in order to determine if there \nexists specific and credible information warranting the triggering of \nthe independent counsel statute. Indeed, as has been reported, the task \nforce has been utilizing a higher threshold of evidence when evaluating \nallegations that may implicate the Independent Counsel Act or White \nHouse personnel.\n  It has been argued that this different legal standard being applied \nto the campaign finance investigation has had the result of keeping the \ninvestigation of White House personnel out of the reach of the \nIndependent Counsel Act. Today's briefing failed to respond to or put \nto rest any of these longstanding charges.\n  I have admired the courage of FBI Director Freeh and lead \ninvestigator LaBella in discussing, within applicable rules, their \nviews on these important issues. They made it clear that the \nindependent counsel is required under the law, that there are no legal \narguments for the Attorney General to hide behind. Director Freeh \nstated that covered White House persons are at the heart of the \ninvestigation. Investigator LaBella said there was a core group of \nindividuals at the White House and the Clinton campaign involved in \nillegal fundraising. That should be the end of the argument.\n  I was also struck by Mr. LaBella's comments that the public only \nknows one percent of what's out there. That scares me because I thought \nwe have heard a lot about abuses by the DNC and how foreign money \ncorrupted our system. His remark shows just how much we need an \nindependent counsel.\n  Now some may attempt to defend the Attorney General by noting that \nshe has initiated two 90-day reviews of potential perjury by the Vice-\nPresident and former White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes. \nThe political machine surrounding the Attorney General may have \nconvinced her to take the two limited actions she has initiated to \nrelieve the political heat. These two 90-day reviews completely avoid \nthe substance of the real allegations. This is not to minimize the \nsignificance of perjury allegations, but her actions thus far miss the \nlarger issues.\n  Any independent counsel must be given authority to delve into the \nmost important questions surrounding or involving the scandal. As the \nNew York Times concluded, a limited appointment would be a ``scam to \navoid getting at the more serious questions of whether the Clinton \ncampaign bartered Presidential audiences or policy decisions for \ncontributions. A narrowly focussed inquiry could miss the towering \nproblem of how so much illegal foreign money, possibly including \nChinese government contributions, got into Democratic accounts.'' This \nis the New York Times.\n  We read today how FBI Director Freeh and Lead Investigator LaBella \nhave recommended an appointment with a wide scope, and the Attorney \nGeneral should not and cannot ignore their wise counsel any longer. As \na unnamed senior government source told the Wall Street Journal: ``We \nshowed [the Attorney General] significant threads of evidence that went \nright into the White House and to the upper levels of the DNC.'' Yet \nthe Attorney General, thus far, has refused to act.\n  Moreover, the time for 30-day or 90-day reviews has passed: we need \naction. The campaign finance violations we are discussing happened 2 \nand 3 years ago. While the independent counsel statute allows for 30 \nand 90 day review periods, it does not require it. When the FBI \nDirector and the lead investigator lay out the evidence showing that a \nbroad independent counsel is necessary, the review periods are not \nwarranted.\n  I must also take issue with the Attorney General's assertions that \nthe current investigation is not a failure because it has secured a \nlimited number of indictments. Let's remember that the ongoing campaign \nfinance investigation has only indicted the most conspicuous people who \nmade illegal donations to the DNC or the Clinton/Gore campaign. It has \nmade no headway in finding out who in the administration or DNC knew \nabout or solicited these illegal donations. Until it does so, the \ninvestigation is a failure, and in the eyes of many a sham.\n  Rather than make pronouncements concerning what the Congress should \nor must do in response to the Attorney General's continued \nmisinterpretation of the law, I feel it is prudent to meet with those \nof my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who joined with me in \nrequesting that she apply for the appointment of an independent counsel \nmore than a year ago.\n\n[[Page S9871]]\n\n  I also want to pay particular tribute and respect to my ranking \nminority member, Senator Leahy, who sat through all this today, has \ncooperated through all this, has tried to get to the bottom of this \nwith us, and who may have a different view from me but nevertheless has \nworked in a bipartisan way to try to resolve these matters, a way that \nI intend to continue to work. And I don't think anybody can accuse me \nof not bending over backwards for the Attorney General through all \nthese months and years.\n  In closing, let me quote the New York Times, which, I believe, \ncaptured the situation perfectly: ``Ms. Reno keeps celebrating her \nstubbornness as if it were some sort of national asset or a \nconstitutional principle that had legal standing. It is neither. It is \na quirk of mind or personality that has blinded her to the clear \nmeaning of the statute requiring attorneys general to recuse themselves \nwhen they are sunk to the axle in conflict of interest.'' That is \nstrong language. I wish it had not had to be issued by the New York \nTimes. But to many it seems to be accurate.\n  Strong will is a character trait I admire. Certainly I admire the \nAttorney General in many ways. But adherence to one's personal opinion \nat the expense of the law cannot be ignored, particularly when it is \nthe Attorney General. Her refusal to appoint an independent counsel in \naccordance with the law should be of great concern to both Republicans \nand Democrats and to the American people for whom she is obligated and \nsworn to enforce the law. Notwithstanding the recent announcements, \nthis matter has now passed the point of reasonableness, and I am no \nlonger willing to give the Attorney General the benefit of the doubt: \nit is now beyond dispute that she is not living up to her duty to \nenforce the law.\n  I am hopeful that within a short period of time she will enforce the \nlaw, or I will have more to say on this matter. I have bent over \nbackwards to try to be accommodating to her and accommodating to the \nJustice Department, but as we all know, it is now becoming an \nembarrassment to the Justice Department. There are a few down there who \nare backing her decisions and an awful lot of people including the \nNation's top investigator, Louis Freeh, his chief investigator, James \nV. Desarno of the FBI, and the chief prosecutor and investigator, \nCharles LaBella, who have no axe to grind but all of whom have said it \nis time to get this behind us, to get an independent counsel, to stop \nany claims of conflict of interest, and to implement the law that is so \nclear on its face so that we can get to the bottom of these problems \nand do so in a way that does not involve the President's appointee \ninvestigating the very people who appointed her including the \nPresident.\n  I hope nobody has any legal problems in this matter, but it has to be \nresolved in the eyes of the American people and certainly has to be \nresolved in the eyes of the Judiciary Committee or at least those who \nhave requested that she request the appointment of an independent \ncounsel, and it is time to get this behind us.\n  Again, I thank all of those who were in the meeting this morning--\nspecifically, my colleague Senator Leahy, my dear colleagues over in \nthe House, Chairman Hyde who chairs the Judiciary Committee and has \ntremendous burdens on his shoulders right now, and also Congressmen \nBurton and Waxman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first off, I thank my friend, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Utah, for his kind remarks. We have \ntried to work very closely together on this. It is something that is \nnot a happy chore for either one of us. The meeting we had today was \nnearly 3 hours, as I recall. He and I went off and had lunch afterward \nand discussed it. I think it accomplished a great deal. He and his \ncounterpart in the House, Chairman Hyde, did a service for the Congress \nand for the country by patiently working out what I believe could have \nbeen a very difficult situation with the House Government Reform and \nOversight Committee contempt resolution against the Attorney General. \nHe has helped all people, Republicans and Democrats, and I commend the \nSenator from Utah for that.\n  The Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General and all the \nothers who have been listed by the Senator from Utah, as I said, spent \nnearly 3 hours together today. The Attorney General explained, as she \nhas in the past in public hearings, her reasons for not appointing an \nindependent counsel to take over the ongoing Department investigation \nof allegations of wrongdoing in the 1996 Presidential election. She \nalso provided us on a confidential basis internal Department memoranda \nin this matter.\n  Without going into what is in those memoranda, I mention the fact \nthat she made them available for our review because it is \nunprecedented. And I, for one, appreciate the way the Attorney General \nhas tried to keep Congress, in its oversight capacity, informed.\n  This is a serious matter. Whether or not the Attorney General should \nappoint an independent counsel has diverted the attention of a number \nof committees, both here in the Senate and the House, and a number of \nMembers. It is a difficult thing because there are grand jury rules \nthat have to be followed, there are secrecy rules that have to be \nfollowed, and there are internal procedures that have to be followed \nthat sometimes may not allow for an instant response between the time a \nquestion is asked and the evening news.\n  The Attorney General has referred matters to independent counsels at \nleast 10 times, if you count both the requests she has made for \nappointments of new independent counsels or expansions of the \njurisdictions of those independent counsels already operating. So she \ndoes not shy away from exercising her discretion under the independent \ncounsel statute.\n  I do not want to see us get involved in some kind of intense second-\nguessing and arm-twisting of the Attorney General when she has shown \nshe is willing to trigger an independent counsel statute, as she has \ndone 10 times already. This goes for when she has declined to do so as \nwell. So whether one agrees or disagrees with the Attorney General's \ndecision on appointing independent counsels, or decisions not to \nappoint independent counsels--and one can agree or disagree--but what \nwe as Senators want to be careful about, what we must be careful about, \nis not to politicize what is already becoming an overly politicized \nprocess. The meeting this morning was designed to bring down the \ndecibel level. I do not want to be in a position to increase it.\n  I give the Attorney General credit for playing it straight with \nMembers of Congress in both parties; for always being available and \nwilling to explain her reasons to the extent she can without \njeopardizing ongoing investigations or violating grand jury secrecy \nrules.\n  I have been here with five administrations and dealt with Attorneys \nGeneral through all of them. There are some things that they cannot \nshare with us and have to wait on, either because of grand jury rules \nor ongoing investigations, before they can discuss them.\n  This Attorney General is not going to be pushed around by anybody in \nCongress. I would be concerned if she allowed herself to be pushed \naround. We have had discussions about internal debates that have taken \nplace within the Department of Justice and the FBI on whether in this \nor that or in another instance an independent counsel should be \nappointed. I would certainly hope there would be an internal debate. \nThese are very, very serious matters. If we had a Department of Justice \nor an FBI where internally, on every single issue, everybody walked in \nlockstep, my question would be what have they missed?\n  I never remember prosecuting a case of any seriousness or complexity \nwhen I was a prosecutor, but with the police or the investigators or \nother members of my office having some internal debate. ``Are we \nbringing the right charge? Are we bringing enough charges? Are we \nbringing too strong a charge? Should we withhold charges?'' And nothing \nI ever had to deal with began to reach the significance of what the \nAttorney General is dealing with.\n  So will there be internal debate? Of course there will be. Should \nthere be internal debate? Of course there should be. But under the law, \nat some point the buck stops on her desk, and she has to make that \ndecision. Once she has\n\n[[Page S9872]]\n\nmade that decision, fine. If we disagree, let us say so. But understand \nthat she has to make it.\n  Prosecutors have enormous power. The trust and the confidence of the \nAmerican people in our justice system would evaporate if this Attorney \nGeneral or any Attorney General allowed politics to dictate decisions \nlike these. I don't think she is doing that. I believe, this is \nconfirmed by listening to even some in the Department of Justice who \nhave disagreed with her decisions. They have all said, unanimously, \nthat they understand she is looking at this very, very honestly. She \nhas made her decisions very directly and very honestly.\n  People from both the FBI and within the Department of Justice, when \nasked specifically, ``Was anybody put off limits? Was any part of the \ninvestigation put off limits?'', they said unanimously nothing was put \noff limits. They were not told to put anybody or any transaction or any \nactivity off limits.\n  So I think we will see more on this as days go on. I think the \nmeeting this morning was a valuable one and I commend my friend from \nUtah for having the meeting. Many aspects of this we agree on. Some \naspects we may disagree on. But I state to my friend from Utah he has \nbeen fair and open with us on this. If we have disagreements, they are \nhonest disagreements. But he and I will continue to work closely on \nthis because in the end what we want to see, whatever these questions \nare, is that we have them resolved fairly. And I think we agree on \nthat. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if I can take just another minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, you know, by some counts--some can count as \nmany as nine requests for preliminary reviews in this matter. We are \nnow almost 2 to 3 years down the line. The evidence is growing cold. \nThe witnesses are absenting the country. We have evidence that cannot \nbe found. And we had investigators telling us today that while one part \nof the Justice Department is going this way, another part of the \nDepartment is going another way, they weren't meeting, and that they \nwere not able to put these threads of evidence together because of the \ntype of restrictions and limitations that were placed on them.\n  It is true that they said that they could investigate anybody, but \nthus far it seems as though the White House and the DNC leadership, the \npeople who would have known who committed crimes were off limits or at \nleast have not been fully examined. That is one reason why Mr. LaBella, \nMr. Freeh, and Mr. Desarno--top people in this Government--have \nsuggested that we should have an independent counsel.\n  I think the Attorney General has to make a decision here one way or \nthe other. If she makes a decision to just have a limited, narrowly \nappointed independent counsel or counsels under these circumstances, \nthen I have to say that is going to be a catastrophic event.\n  I am hopeful that she will do the right thing within a very limited \nperiod of time. She does not have to use the 90 days that she has \nrequested. She has had years now to make determinations in these \nmatters, and she ought to make them, and she ought to make them one way \nor the other--to her praise or condemnation. I personally believe that \nshe will, within a short period of time. I pray with all my heart that \nshe will, because I like her personally, and I don't feel good about \nstanding up and disagreeing with her. I would like to have a good \nrelationship with her and would naturally like her to be a great \nAttorney General. But she has to face these problems and she has to \nface that statute and she can no longer ignore it. Even if she does not \nagree with the mandatory part of that statute, which appears to be the \ncase, although she is willing to relook at it, she has to agree that \nthere is a whopping conflict of interest here, both an actual conflict \nand an appearance of a conflict, which necessitates the requests for \nthe appointment of a broad-based independent counsel in these matters \nto get this finally behind us. And I hope that we can do that.\n  I apologize to my colleague from Kentucky for interrupting this \ndebate, but this is important to do. I apologize to him at this time \nand I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9869-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9872-S9877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-6509.

A bill to support programs of grants to States to address \nthe assistive technology needs of individuals with disabilities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                    ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, ten years ago Congress passed the \nTechnology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act, \nreferred to as the ``Tech Act''. My friend, Senator Harkin, was the \nprincipal sponsor in the Senate. I was the principal sponsor in the \nHouse. Both Houses of Congress worked together and passed the same \nlegislation on the same day. Once again, Senator Harkin  and I, with \nour colleague Senator Bond, joined forces to draft the Assistive \nTechnology Act of 1998 (ATA), which we are introducing today with the \nco-sponsorship of Senators Kennedy, Frist, Collins, McConnell, Reed, \nand Kerry. Once again, we are working toward expeditious consideration \nof legislation that promotes access to assistive technology for \nindividuals with disabilities. With the assistance of our colleagues in \nthe Senate and the other body, I am confident that the ATA will become \nlaw. The ATA authorizes funding for assistive technology activities for \nfiscal years 1999 through 2004.\n  The ATA builds on the success of its predecessor, the Tech Act. The \nTech Act sunsets September 30, 1998. This will result in the \ntermination of federal assistance to nine states for promoting access \nto assistive technology for individuals with disabilities, and place \nthe remainder of the states in jeopardy of diminished or no funding \nduring or after fiscal year 1999.\n  Through the ATA the Senate has the opportunity to reaffirm the \nfederal role of promoting access to assistive technology devices and \nservices for individuals with disabilities. The bill allows States \nflexibility in responding to the assistive technology needs of their \ncitizens with disabilities, and does not disrupt the ongoing work of \nthe 50 State assistive technology programs funded under the Tech Act.\n  These programs make a difference. Access to assistive technology for \nan individual with a disability means independence, ability to work or \nattend school, and the opportunity to participate in community life. \nLack of access to assistive technology means dependence and isolation.\n  In my State of Vermont, Lynne Cleveland is the project director for \nour Tech Project. Lynne testified before the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee on April 29, 1998 on the impact of the Vermont Tech Project \non the lives of Vermonters with disabilities. For example, one of the \nmany things the Vermont Tech Project supports is a rehabilitation \nengineering technician program, the only one in the nation, at Vermont \nTechnical College. Graduates of the program work for schools, non-\nprofit agencies, state agencies, and vendors helping others make \nappropriate, cost-effective decisions regarding assistive technology \nfor individuals with disabilities and educating others about the need \nfor and value of the individual with a disability having a central role \nin such decisions.\n  The Vermont Tech Project touches and changes the lives of individual \nVermonters of all ages and walks of life. For Bill, a man in his mid-\nthirties who suffered a stroke, the Tech Project helped secure \nassistive technology that enabled him to obtain employment designing \nweb pages. Equally important to Bill is that assistive technology \nenables him to talk again with his children. For Ray, who lost his \nvision in mid-life, acquiring assistive technology has allowed him to \ncontinue as a snowplow dispatcher for the State of Vermont. For Ty, a \nteenager born with a visual impairment, access to assistive technology \nmeans she can pursue her goal of becoming a lawyer. For Annie, a first \ngrader with Downs Syndrome, having assistive technology means that she \ncan use the computer in a regular education classroom, learning and \nplaying games with her classmates. For Lillian, a senior citizen, \naccess to and training on a closed circuit television, enables her to \nstay in her home rather than living in a nursing home. The Vermont Tech \nProject has touched each of these individuals by working with others to \nchange policies, improve coordination, pool resources, and educate \npeople about the benefits of assistive technology.\n\n[[Page S9878]]\n\n  Across the U.S., state assistive technology programs have brought \nabout a wide range of improvements in the last decade. State assistive \ntechnology programs have contributed to changes in state laws, improved \ncoordination among state agencies and between the public and private \nsector, all of which have expanded access to assistive technology. \nThese programs have increased public awareness of the value of \nassistive technology, have educated individuals with disabilities about \nhow to select and purchase appropriate assistive technology, and \nexpanded the number of individuals in schools, the workplace, and other \nsettings of community life that can provide assistance in selecting, \nsecuring, and using assistive technology.\n  The ATA allows this important work to continue. Title I of the bill \nsupports states in sustaining and strengthening their capacity to \naddress the assistive technology needs of individuals with \ndisabilities; title II brings focus to the federal investment in \ntechnology that could benefit individuals with disabilities; and title \nIII supports micro-loan programs to provide assistance to individuals \nwho desire to purchase assistive technology devices or assistive \ntechnology services. The legislation also draws attention to and \npromotes consideration of the principles of universal design in the \ndesign of future technology and using the power of the INTERNET to \nbring best practices related to assistive technology to anyone's \nkeyboard.\n  In title I the ATA streamlines and clarifies the expectations, \nincluding expectations related to accountability, associated with \ncontinuing federal support for state assistive technology programs. It \ntargets specific, proven activities, as priorities, referred to as \n``mandatory activities''. All state grantees must set measurable goals \nin connection to their use of ATA funds, and both the goals and the \napproach to measuring the goals must be based on input from a state's \ncitizens with disabilities.\n  If a state has received fewer than 10 years of federal funding under \nthe Tech Act for its assistive technology program, title I of the ATA \nallows a state, which submits a supplement (a continuity grant) to its \ncurrent Tech Act grant for federal funds, to use ATA funds for \nmandatory activities: a public awareness program, interagency \ncoordination, technical assistance and training, and outreach. Such a \nstate also may use ATA funds for optional grant activities: alternative \nstate-financed systems for assistive technology devices and assistive \ntechnology services, technology demonstrations, distribution of \ninformation about how to finance assistive technology devices and \nassistive technology services, and operation of a technology-related \ninformation system, or participation in interstate activities or \npublic-private partnerships pertaining to assistive technology.\n\n  If a state has had 10 years of funding for its assistive technology \nprogram through the Tech Act, the state may submit an application for a \nnoncompetitive challenge grant under the ATA. Grant funds must be spent \non specific activities--interagency coordination, an assistive \ntechnology information system, a public awareness program, technical \nassistance and training, and outreach activities.\n  In fiscal years 2000 through 2004, if funding for title I exceeds a \ncertain level, states operating under challenge grants may apply for \nadditional ATA funding, provided through competitive millennium grants. \nThese grants are to focus on specific state or local level capacity \nbuilding activities related to access to technology for individuals \nwith disabilities.\n  Title I of the ATA also authorizes funding for protection and \nadvocacy systems in each state to assist individuals with disabilities \nto access assistive technology devices and assistive technology \nservices, and funding for a technical assistance program, including the \nNational Public Internet Site, and specifies administrative procedures \nwith regard to monitoring of entities funded under title I of the ATA.\n  Title II of the ATA authorizes national activities, including \nincreased coordination and communication among federal agencies with \nregard to addressing the assistive technology needs of individuals with \ndisabilities. Title III of the Act authorizes a broad range of \nalternative financing mechanisms to assist individuals with the \npurchasing of assistive technology through micro-loans.\n  Providing access to assistive technology for individuals with \ndisabilities was a simple promise in 1988. Today it is much, much more. \nThe ATA represents the bridge to the next century for individuals with \ndisabilities. Across that bridge lies increased independence, realized \npotential, new partnerships, unimagined challenges, and unlimited \nopportunities.\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I support the Assistive Technology \nAct of 1998. This Act will enable States and the Federal Government to \nbuild on their work under the Technology-Related Assistance for \nIndividuals with Disabilities Act of 1988, or Tech Act, which sunsets \nthis year, and to establish new directions in assistive technology \npolicy for the 21st Century.\n  In 1988, I was proud to be the chief Senate sponsor of the Tech Act, \nand was very fortunate to work with then-Representative Jeffords, who \nwas the chief House sponsor. In developing this new Act, I have been \nfortunate to work with Senator Jeffords again, and also with Senator \nBond, whose commitment and leadership have been invaluable.\n  The issue of assistive technology is deeply important to me. My \nbrother Frank is deaf. Assistive technology is part of our \nrelationship. Frank and I talk all the time, using a TDD; we watch \ntelevision together using a closed-caption decoder. My nephew Kelly was \ninjured in the Navy and is a quadriplegic. But he lives independently, \nin large part because of assistive technology. For example, Kelly is \nable to drive his van by using a wheelchair lift and hand controls.\n  But assistive technology doesn't just work for people with \ndisabilities. We hear all the time that defense research often has \neveryday applications. The same is true of assistive technology \nresearch. I saw a television commercial recently, advertising voice-\nactivated software for business executives. Well, that technology was \noriginally development for people whose disability kept them from using \na keyboard. And if you've ever watched the closed-captioned news in a \nnoisy restaurant or so you didn't wake up your husband or wife, you've \nused assistive technology. The more assistive technology we develop, \nthe more all of us will benefit from it.\n  Under the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, States will be able to \ncontinue the consumer-responsive programs of technology-related \nassistance for people with disabilities they have developed over the \npast ten years.\n  The Act will help States establish and strengthen systems to inform \npeople with disabilities what their assistive technology options are, \nso they can take advantage of them. It will enable States to help \nschools and employers accommodate assistive technology users, so they \ncan live independently, and get an education and a job. And the Act \nwill create a one-stop Internet site where consumers, family members, \nassistive technology professionals, and anyone else who's interested \ncan access all the information there is about assistive technology.\n  The Act also recognizes that the Federal government must work more \nefficiently, and with the private sector, if we are going to make \nassistive technology more accessible. It requires federal agencies and \noffices that conduct assistive technology research to work more closely \ntogether, to take advantage of each other's abilities and information \nand to better utilize federal resources. It enables the Federal \ngovernment to increase its research, and to make grants to outside \nresearchers, for assistive technology and universal design. It offers \nhelp to small businesses to research, develop, and bring assistive \ntechnology to the market. And the Act enables the Federal government to \nwork with the information technology industry, to increase the \nindustry's voluntary participation in efforts to make information \ntechnology more accessible to people with disabilities.\n\n  Finally, the Act will help States establish, or expand, loan programs \nfor people with disabilities or their representatives to access to meet \ntheir assistive technology needs.\n  I have often said that disability is a natural part of the human \nexperience, that in no way diminishes the right of individuals to live \nindependently,\n\n[[Page S9879]]\n\nenjoy self-determination, pursue meaningful careers and enjoy full \ninclusion in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational \nmainstream of American society. Assistive technology enables people \nwith disabilities to exercise that right.\n  There have been amazing changes in technology since we wrote the Tech \nAct, ten years ago. Technology can do more for more people than ever \nbefore--and that trend is going to continue. But that also means the \nconsequences are greater than ever if we don't make assistive \ntechnology, information technology, and our society generally, more \naccessible, because the more technology can do, the further people with \ndisabilities will fall behind if they can't use it.\n  Mr. President, this Act enjoys broad support in the disability \ncommunity and the assistive technology community, and is endorsed by \nthe National Governors Association. I hope my colleagues will join \nSenators Jeffords, Bond, and me, and our other cosponsors, in \nsupporting this worthwhile Act.\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today with my colleagues Senator \nJeffords and Senator Harkin I introduce the Assistive Technology Act of \n1998. This important piece of legislation will provide technical \nassistance to the more than 50 million citizens in the United States \nwith disabilities.\n  The Tech Act, passed in 1988, has proven time and again its \ninvaluable assistance in helping persons with disabilities acquire \nassistive technology that improves their functional capability and \nquality of life. This technical assistance allows students to learn \nbetter in school, adults to acquire jobs, and seniors to live more \nindependently. I have seen the success of the State Tech Act projects \nfirst hand in my home State of Missouri. It is estimated that 750,000 \nMissourians of all ages live with a disabling condition. Ms. Diane \nGolden, of the Missouri Assistive Technology Project, informed me that \nMissouri's state office handled 4,000 direct cases this past year, not \nincluding thousands of calls regarding information and referrals.\n  Mr. President, Missourians know the impact of the State Tech Act \nProjects.\n  Wanda, an elder Kansas City woman lost most of her hearing late in \nlife. For three years, she lived without the ability to talk with \nfriends or to call her doctor in an emergency. Wanda's inability to use \nthe telephone, in addition to other age related issues, was threatening \nher ability to continue living in her own home.\n  Missouri Tech Act Project staff worked with Wanda to identify an \nadaptive telephone that would allow her to continue to live \nindependently. The cost of the device was prohibitive for this woman \nand no public funding source was available. Nevertheless, Project staff \nlocated a private funding source for the adaptive telephone and as a \nresult Wanda has been able to continue to live independently.\n  Realizing that thousands of individuals throughout the state were \nfacing the same need for adaptive telephone equipment, the Project \ndeveloped a statewide telecommunication equipment distribution program \nthat provides Missourians, with all types of disabilities, adaptive \ntelephone equipment. The program has been operational for a year and \nhas provided more than one million dollars of adaptive telephone \nequipment to thousands of Missourians.\n  Another Missourian, Mary, an 8-year-old young girl, who is non-vocal, \nneeded an augmentative communication device that would allow her to \ncommunicate at home and school. Medicaid had approved purchasing the \ndevice just before its conversion from a fee-based system to a managed \ncare system. The new managed care plan was unfamiliar with augmentative \ncommunication devices and the family was having no success in securing \nthe device. Project staff worked with the managed care provider to \nexplain the importance and cost-effectiveness of augmentative \ncommunication devices and as a result, secured funding for Mary's \ndevice.\n\n  Understanding that most, if not all, of the managed care plans under \ncontract with Medicaid would be unfamiliar with augmentative \ncommunication devices and other types of assistive technology, Project \nstaff worked with the Missouri Medicaid plans to educate them about the \nimportance, cost-effectiveness, and coverage of assistive technology. \nAs a result, numerous plans routinely approve assistive technology. As \na result, numerous plans routinely approve assistive technology devices \nand many call the Project for assistance when they receive requests for \nassistive devices of which they are unfamiliar.\n  These examples are just a small sampling of the successes of the \nMissouri Technology Assistance Project. Some other accomplishments of \nthe Project include development of an educational technology access \ninformational packet that the Department of Education distributed to \nmore than 17,000 schools nationally; passage of a sales tax exemption \nfor the purchase of assistive technology in Missouri; establishment of \na short-term equipment loan program; development and distribution of a \nConsumer Guide to Missouri Assistive Device Lemon Laws; and \nestablishment of a web page with postings of equipment for their \nrecycling program.\n  Missouri's success is one example of the many accomplishments of \nother State Tech Act Projects since the inception of the Tech Act in \n1988. The Assistive Technology Act of 1988 will guarantee that states \ncontinue to serve the disabled community, their families, friends, \nteachers, and employers.\n  The bill we are introducing also provides improvements to the current \nState Tech Act Projects. Some notable improvements include better \ncoordination and information sharing; Microloan programs to help \nassistive technology end users in obtaining assistive devices; \nincentive grants to assure better accountability of all programs; and \nincreased small business investment in assistive and universally \ndesigned technology research and development. These improvements and \nnew initiatives strengthen the work currently done by the State Tech \nAct Projects, encourage improvements to current programs and are \nforward looking in the acquisition, development, and service delivery \nof assistive technology.\n  State Tech Act Projects provide vital technology related services to \nindividuals with disabilities. The initiatives of these important \nprograms ensure the availability of technology to people with \ndisabilities that make living independently a reality. The Assistive \nTechnology Act of 1998 strengthens and maintains a program that works \nfor a constituency that would otherwise be denied the exciting \nopportunities that technology affords.\n  Mr. President I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House to \npass this legislation expediently so that technological assistance can \ncontinue to be available for our nation's disabled.\n  Let me conclude by thanking my distinguished colleagues Senator \nJeffords and Senator Harkin and their staff for their hard work on this \nimportant piece of legislation. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators \nJeffords and Harkin and myself, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord, a letter of support for the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 \nfrom the United Cerebral Palsy Association.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           United Cerebral Palsy Associations,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 2, 1998.\n       Dear Senators Jeffords, bond, and Harkin: On behalf of \n     Untied Cerebral Palsy Association (UCPA) and our 151 \n     affiliates, we strongly endorse the Assistive Technology Act \n     of 1998. We applaud your interest in overcoming barriers to, \n     funding for, and access to assistive technology devices and \n     services for individuals with disabilities of all ages. This \n     access provides the gateway to not only education and \n     employment but also other activities of daily living for the \n     approximately 54 million individuals with disabilities in \n     this country.\n       Through our national technical assistance efforts, UCPA has \n     been able to assist thousands of people by providing \n     information, training and technical assistance to individuals \n     with disabilities, family members, and those who work with \n     individuals with disabilities. However, a great number of \n     individuals do not have access to assistive technology that \n     would improve their quality of life. This legislation will \n     further the goal of universal access.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Peter Keiser,\n                      Chair, Community Services Committee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 2433. A bill to protect consumers and financial institutions by \npreventing personal financial information\n\n[[Page S9880]]\n\nfrom being obtained from financial institutions under false pretenses; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                   financial information privacy act\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important pro-\nconsumer legislation to protect the privacy of confidential financial \ninformation for every American. The Financial Information Privacy Act \nwill make it a federal crime to obtain or attempt to obtain private \nconsumer information from our nation's financial institutions through \nthe use of false, fictitious or fraudulent statements.\n  Mr. President, the exploitation of personal information by \nunscrupulous ``information brokers'' and individuals attempting to pry \ninto the private financial affairs of others is an issue of vital \nconcern to every American.\n  A flourishing industry of ``information brokers'' has emerged as \ndetailed in hearings held just last month by the House Banking \nCommittee. These individuals use deceptive practices, such as lying \nabout their identity on the phone, in order to obtain personal customer \ninformation for resale. Armed with personal information such as bank \naccount balances, account numbers and transaction activity, this \ninformation can be used to build a profile of a consumer which can be \nbought and sold in the marketplace. Advances in technology have enabled \ninformation brokers to inexpensively create enormous databases of \nindividual profiles and use the Internet to market their information \nworldwide.\n  Mr. President, these same techniques are used by criminals to obtain \ninformation to create fraudulent credit applications that can quickly \ndestroy a victims credit worthiness and require months of effort to \nclear up. The problem is growing exponentially. One of the leading \ncredit reporting services reports that since 1992, the number of \nfinancial fraud cases where individuals have pretended to be another \nperson has risen from 32,000 to more than 500,000 in 1997. I believe \nthe evidence is clear that inadequate financial privacy laws are a \nsignificant factor in this rise. Americans demand and rightfully expect \nthe privacy of personal financial information.\n  While existing laws do provide protection against unfair and \ndeceptive practices, there is no federal law that expressly prohibits \nacquiring personal customer account information under false pretenses. \nBanking groups and federal regulatory agencies have all testified that \nthis legislation would be an important tool to protect consumers from \nthe invasive practices of information brokers. Passage of this measure \nwill make it clear that Congress will not tolerate this invasion of \nprivacy and will do whatever is necessary to insure that the private \nfinancial information of our citizens remains private.\n  Mr. President, in closing I want to comment Chairman Leach for his \nquick action in the House to move this measure forward. Working \ntogether with our House colleagues, we have an opportunity to greatly \nstrengthen the privacy laws that safeguard the personal financial \ninformation of every American. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis vital legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2433\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 1 of title 9, United States Code, to \nprovide for greater fairness in the arbitration process relating to a \nmotor vehicle franchise contracts; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n   motor vehicle franchise contract arbitration fairness act of 1998\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am joined by my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, in introducing the Motor Vehicle Franchise \nContract Arbitration Fairness Act of 1998.\n  As the Senate's leading advocate of ADR or alternative dispute \nresolution, I have attempted to facilitate the use of ADR in a number \nof ways. In the last Congress, we enacted my legislation to make \npermanent the use of ADR with and among our federal agencies. This \nyear, we are attempting to enact legislation authorizing federal court-\nannexed ADR.\n  A small percentage of ADR cases involves the use of binding \narbitration. In dealing with arbitration, I have tried to emphasize the \nuse of voluntary, rather than mandatory arbitration. Both parties must \nagree to voluntary arbitration, whereas mandatory arbitration can be \nforced upon a party, as in the case of some contractual arrangements. \nThe authorization and use of mandatory arbitration has to be carefully \nconsidered since the right to trial may be limited or even forfeited.\n  One such arrangement can be found in some contracts between \nautomobile or truck dealers and manufacturers. In these contracts, \ndealers are given a ``take it or leave it'' clause that forces them to \nagree to binding arbitration. There is no real bargaining. If the \ndealer wants the contract, he or she has to agree to the mandatory \narbitration clause.\n\n[[Page S9882]]\n\n  A number of states have enacted laws to prevent these types of unfair \ncontracts. But, even though these clauses may violate a number of state \nlaws, the Fourth Circuit overturned a lower court and ruled that these \nstate laws conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925, and are \ntherefore preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \nSo much for states' rights.\n  Historically, Congress has questioned whether arbitration agreements \nshould allow a stronger party to a contract to force a weaker party to \nforfeit rights to a court as a condition of entering a contract. But, \nit's been unclear as to what exactly the federal law allows. I believe \nit's now time to do more than just question these unfair \n``agreements''.\n  The legislation Senator Feingold and I are introducing today would \nhelp remedy this current unfortunate situation by allowing only \nvoluntary arbitration clauses between dealers and manufacturers. The \nbill would continue to recognize arbitration as a valuable alternative \nto litigation as long as both parties voluntarily agree to it. We want \nto preserve arbitration as an effective alternative to litigation, but \nwe want to ensure that it's a fair alternative.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Feingold and myself in trying to \naddress these unfair franchise contracts.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, the Motor Vehicle \nFranchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 1998.\n  While alternative dispute resolution such as arbitration can serve a \nuseful purpose in resolving disputes between parties, I am extremely \nconcerned with the increasing trend of stronger parties to a contract \nforcing weaker parties to waive their rights and to arbitrate disputes. \nEarlier this Congress, I introduced S. 63, the Civil Rights Procedures \nAct, to amend certain civil rights statutes to prevent the involuntary \napplication of arbitration to claims that arise from unlawful \nemployment discrimination and sexual harassment.\n  It has come to my attention that the automobile and truck \nmanufacturers, which present dealers with ``take it or leave it'' \ncontracts, are increasingly including mandatory, binding arbitration \nclauses as a condition of entering into or keeping an auto or truck \nfranchise. This practice forces dealers to submit their disputes with \nmanufacturers to involuntary arbitration. As a result, dealers are \nrequired to waive access to judicial or administrative forums, \nsubstantive contract rights, and statutorily provided protection. In \nshort, this practice clearly violates the dealers fundamental due \nprocess rights and runs directly counter to basic principles of \nfairness.\n  Historically and currently, franchise agreements for auto and truck \ndealerships are nonnegotiable with the manufacturer; the dealer accepts \nthe terms offered by the manufacturer or they lose the dealership; \nplain and simple. Dealers, therefore, have been forced to rely on the \nstates to pass laws designed to minimize the manufacturers' greater \nbargaining power and to safeguard their rights. The first such state \nautomobile statute was enacted in my home state of Wisconsin in 1937. \nSince then all states, except Alaska, have enacted substantive law to \nbalance the enormous bargaining power enjoyed by manufacturers over \ndealers and to safeguard small business dealers from unfair automobile \nand truck manufacturer practices.\n  In addition, the majority of states have created their own \nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms and forums which specialize \nin auto and truck industry disputes. These administrative forums are \ninexpensive, efficient, and unbiased. For example, in Wisconsin \nmandatory mediation is required before the start of an administrative \nhearing or court action. Arbitration is also optional if both parties \nagree. These state dispute resolution forums, with years of experience \nand precedent, are greatly responsible for the small number of \nmanufacturer/dealer lawsuits.\n  Unfortunately, when mandatory binding arbitration is included in \ndealer agreements, state laws and forums established to resolve auto \ndealer and manufacturer disputes are essentially null and void. Under \nthe Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) arbitrators are not required to apply \nfederal or state law. The stronger party--in this case the auto or \ntruck manufacturer--can, therefore, use mandatory arbitration to \ncircumvent the state laws which were specifically enacted to regulate \nthe dealer/manufacturer relationship. Not only is the circumvention of \nthese laws inequitable, it also eliminates the deterrent to prohibited \nacts that these state laws provide.\n  Besides losing the protection of state law and the ability to use \nstate forums, there are other numerous reasons why a dealer may not \nwant to agree to binding arbitration. Arbitration lacks some of the \nimportant safeguards and due process offered by administrative \nprocedures and the judicial system. For example: (1) arbitration lacks \nthe formal court supervised discovery process oftentimes necessary to \nlearn facts and gain documents; (2) an arbitrator need not follow the \nrules of evidence; (3) arbitrators generally have no obligation to \nprovide factual or legal discussion of their decision in a written \nopinion; and (4) arbitration often does not allow for judicial review.\n  The most troubling problem with this sort of mandatory, binding \narbitration may be the absence of judicial review. Take for instance a \ndispute over a dealership termination. To that dealer--that small \nbusiness person--this decision is of paramount importance. Even under \nthis scenario, the dealer would not have recourse to substantive \njudicial review of the arbitrators' ruling. Let me be very clear on \nthis point; in most circumstances a dealer cannot appeal an arbitration \naward even if the arbitration panel disregarded state law which likely \nwould have produced a different result.\n  This problem is growing. The use of mandatory binding arbitration is \nincreasing in many industries, but nowhere is it growing more steadily \nthan the auto/truck industry. Currently 11 auto and truck manufacturers \nrequire some form of such arbitration in their dealer franchise \ncontracts.\n  In recognition of this problem, many states enacted laws to prohibit \nthe inclusion of mandatory, binding arbitration clauses in certain \nagreements. The Supreme Court, however, held in Southland Corp. v. \nKeating, 104 S. Ct. 852 (1984), that the FAA by implication preempts \nthese state laws. The Southland Corp. decision has, in effect, \nnullified many state arbitration laws that were designed to protect \nweaker parties in unequal bargaining positions from involuntarily \nacquiescing--often without other meaningful options--to these \nmandatory, binding arbitration clauses.\n  The legislative history indicates that Congress never intended that \nthe FAA be a tool that the stronger party to a contract could use to \nforce the weaker party into binding arbitration. Congress certainly did \nnot intend the FAA to be a weapon used to coerce parties into \nrelinquishing important protections and rights that would have been \nafforded them by the judicial system. Unfortunately, this is precisely \nthe current situation.\n  Although contract law is generally the province of the states, the \nSupreme Court's decision in Southland Corp. has in effect made any \nstate action on this issue moot. I, therefore, along with Senator \nGrassley, am introducing this bill today to ensure that auto and truck \ndealers are not coerced into waiving their rights. Our bill, the Motor \nVehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 1998 would \nsimply allow each party to an auto or truck franchise contract to \nvoluntarily agree to arbitration; mandatory, binding arbitration would \nbe prohibited. The bill would not proscribe arbitration, however. On \nthe contrary, our measure would encourage arbitration by making it a \nfair choice that both parties to such a franchise contract willing and \nknowingly select. In short, this bill would ensure that the decision to \narbitrate is voluntary and that the rights and remedies provided for by \nour judicial system are not mandatorily waived.\n  Today if a small business person wants to obtain or keep her or his \nauto or truck franchise, she or he may only be able to do so by \nrelinquishing her or his statutory rights and foreclosing the \nopportunity to use the courts or administrative forums. Mr. President, \nI cannot not say this more strongly--this is unacceptable; this is \nwrong. I,\n\n[[Page S9883]]\n\ntherefore, urge my colleagues to join with Senator Grassley and me to \nput an end to the invidious practice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 2435. A bill to permit the denial of airport access to certain air \ncarriers; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            airport protection from forced scheduled service\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto address a problem facing small reliever airports that do not accept \nscheduled service operations. Centennial Airport is a small reliever \nairport near Denver, Colorado, where operations consist primarily of \nsmall private chartered and business planes. A unique situation exists \nat Centennial Airport involving certain charter services and a loophole \nin the Federal regulations governing scheduled flights.\n  Centennial Airport is not certificated for scheduled flight service. \nIn fact, the Airport Authority, with strong local backing, has banned \nscheduled service at Centennial. According to Federal law, the Federal \nAviation Administration cannot force any airport to become \ncertificated. The airport is not equipped with a terminal, baggage \nsystem, or passenger security. Furthermore, Denver International \nAirport is less than 25 miles from Centennial, and has the capacity to \nhandle additional scheduled service operations.\n  A situation arose more than three years ago when a company called \nCentennial Express Airlines, Inc., began charter service at Centennial, \nbut immediately announced that the airline's service would continue as \nscheduled service. The Airport Authority sued and the County District \nCourt ordered the flights stopped. In April of this year the Colorado \nSupreme Court ruled in favor of Centennial Airport Authority's ban. The \nCourt cited the safe operation of the airport as a priority, and upheld \nthe airport's discretion to prohibit scheduled passenger service.\n  While this decision protected the airport's right to refuse scheduled \nservice, a similar situation recently arose with another company, \nColorado Connection Executive Air Services, and the result has been \ndetrimental for Centennial airport.\n  In 1997, Colorado Connection proposed to start public charter \npassenger service pursuant to a regular and public schedule. Colorado \nConnection, which is entirely owned by Air One Charter, tried using a \ncombination of Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation \nAdministration exemptions to offer scheduled service under Federal \nregulations, because the company that books the flights does not own \nthe aircraft and the schedule is not officially published in the \nairline guide. The use of two different corporate names allowed Air One \nCharter to fly the scheduled passenger service under Colorado \nConnection without subjecting the airline to FAA scheduled service \nregulations. Air One Charter indicated intent to market 6-12 daily \nflights to various Colorado cities and to contract baggage services for \ntheir flights.\n  The Centennial Airport Authority unanimously voted to deny airport \naccess to Colorado Connection's scheduled service. The vote took place \nin April 1998 and a month later the FAA initiated a part 16 \ninvestigation. The FAA claims that the Airport Authority's move to deny \nservice is unjustly discriminatory. Last week the FAA issued a decision \nto pull Federal funding for Centennial Airport if the ban on scheduled \nservice is not lifted. This decision is in direct conflict with the \nColorado Supreme Court's ruling on the issue. It is the result of a \nloophole in a law that was not intended to force small airports to take \non the responsibility and burden of supporting scheduled service.\n  Immediately following the announcement of the FAA's decision, the \nowner of Centennial Express was reported by the Denver Post to have \nplans to begin scheduled flights from Centennial Airport.\n  I am proposing legislation to rectify this situation and uphold the \nauthority of airports like Centennial to ban all scheduled service if \nthey choose to do so. This bill would allow a general aviation airport \nto deny access to a part 380 public charter operator that operates as a \nscheduled service, and clarifies that such action would not be in \nviolation of requirements for federal airport aid. This will not \nrequire any airport to do anything, and it will not allow an airport to \ndiscriminate against one scheduled service operator and not another.\n  This amendment is nearly identical to language that the House \nCommerce Committee has included in its FAA Reauthorization Act. It \nwould prohibit the FAA from charging discrimination if an airport \nchooses to deny access to scheduled service operators. It will only \napply to reliever airports that are not certificated under Part 139 to \nhandle scheduled service and airports within 35 miles of a large hub \nairport.\n  I am not aware specifically of any other reliever airports existing \noutside of Colorado that have an interest in this legislation, however, \nI hope that my colleagues see the importance of protecting the right of \nsmall airports and surrounding communities to refuse all scheduled \nservice operations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Res. 270\n\n       Whereas a strike by the Air Line Pilots Association, the \n     union of the pilots of Northwest Airlines, has led to a \n     severe disruption in air service;\n       Whereas such a strike could result in the loss of \n     employment by tens of thousands of individuals in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas such a strike affects approximately 11 percent of \n     the domestic airline traffic in the United States;\n       Whereas such a strike would cause more than 44,000 \n     Northwest Airlines employees to be idle;\n       Whereas such a strike could affect--\n       (1) the livelihood of thousands of other workers employed \n     in airline and airport supply industries; and\n       (2) commerce relating to tourism, logistics, and business \n     requiring travel;\n       Whereas such a strike could cause substantial adverse \n     economic effects in communities of the United States; and\n       Whereas because nearly 20 percent of the air traffic of \n     Northwest Airlines is in foreign air commerce (as that term \n     is defined in section 40102 of title 49, United States Code), \n     a strike could have an adverse effect with respect to--\n       (1) the expansion of the market of United States goods and \n     services in foreign countries; and\n       (2) the trading partners of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S9885]]\n\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should work in conjunction with the \n     National Mediation Board to facilitate a resolution of the \n     labor dispute between the Air Line Pilots Association and \n     Northwest Airlines; and\n       (2) the President should--\n       (A) immediately after the enactment of this resolution, \n     encourage the settlement of the issues that are the subject \n     of the labor dispute through the use of the services of the \n     National Mediation Board established under section 4 of the \n     Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 154) or an agreement by the \n     parties to the dispute to arbitrate the issues that are the \n     subject of the labor dispute through the National Mediation \n     Board; and\n       (B) if necessary, establish a board under section 10 of the \n     Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 160) to serve as an emergency \n     board to investigate the matter relating to the labor dispute \n     and to make a report to the President in the manner \n     prescribed in that section.\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to go \non record and ask the President to use all of the powers available to \nhim to end the Northwest Airlines strike.\n  As many of my colleagues are already aware, Northwest Airlines Pilots \nhave been on strike since the 29th of August. At this time there are no \ntalks between pilots and management. Additionally, the management of \nNorthwest Airlines insists that they have made their ``final'' offer.\n  Northwest Airlines loses a minimum of $27 million a day in lost \nrevenue. Additional costs are incurred from placing booked passengers \non other airlines. The first ten days of the strike are expected to \ncost the U.S. economy over $700 million. Further, Northwest is \ntemporarily laying off as many as 30,000 workers by the end of this \nweek.\n  Northwest and Northwest Airlink have 552 departures in Tennessee. \nThis is nearly half of Tennessee's air service. Every major city in \nTennessee is affected by the Northwest Airlines strike: Jackson, \nTennessee has lost 100 percent of its service, Memphis has lost 77 \npercent, and Knoxville 11 percent. The strike left over 9,000 \npassengers stranded in Tennessee. Approximately 46 percent of stranded \ntravelers will be unable to find travel on other airlines.\n  The numbers of people stranded and the money lost are so large that \nthey have become mere abstractions. Behind the numbers and figures \nexist struggling small businesses, air travelers experiencing \nridiculous inconveniences, and real economic loss. All of these people \nare innocent bystanders held hostage by a dispute that they have \nnothing to do with.\n  For all of the reasons I have outlined, I am submitting a resolution \ntoday that asks the President of the United States to act immediately \nto bring this strike to a quick conclusion. If necessary, the President \nshould not hesitate to create a Presidential Emergency Board to resolve \nthe dispute between the Air Line Pilots Association and Northwest \nAirlines. Too many people have already suffered as a result of this \nstrike.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor, thank, and \nremember the men and women who fought so bravely to protect our \nfreedoms during World War II. As my colleagues know, it was 53 years \nago today that Japan officially surrendered to the Allies, prompting \nPresident Truman's declaration of September 2nd as Victory-Over-Japan \nDay, or V-J Day.\n  That monumental declaration marked the end of the most immense and \ndevastating war the world has ever seen--a war that shaped not only the \ncourse of history but also the lives of the many brave Americans who, \nthrough their service in the U.S. military, fought to restore freedom \nto lands halfway around the world.\n  These young Americans were thrust into a situation best described by \nGeneral William Sherman when he said, quite simply, that war is hell. \nIt is safe to say they experienced horrors and fear most of us cannot \nbegin to comprehend.\n  To gain some understanding of the realities of war and of the heroism \nexhibited during World War II, let me take you back to December 7, \n1941. The place was Pearl Harbor. George Albert Enloe, a young Navy \nflyer from Anoka, Minnesota, had just two days earlier turned 26 years \nold. Before that day he had never really known the realities of war. \nHere is part of the diary entry he made on that Sunday describing the \nsurprise Japanese attack:\n\n       I can, and will always, remember the bullets that sprayed \n     past me as I ducked into the hanger. Ensign Fox and Ensign \n     Willis were right behind me. Fox was killed; Willis got \n     through with a bullet through his head. The bullets came \n     through the hanger as though it was made of paper . . . I \n     understood then what it means to be ``under fire.'' Before, \n     these were just words. But I found myself actually there. I \n     was scared. I forced myself to stay. We kept shooting.\n\n  Enloe survived that day and went on to serve for five more years in \nthe military. In that short period, he became one of the most decorated \ncombat pilots in the entire Navy and just last month, the City of Anoka \ndedicated a park in his honor.\n  Unfortunately, as years pass and our nation enjoys one of its \ngreatest periods of prosperity, too many Americans, especially young \nAmericans, are unaware of the sacrifices made and the lessons taught to \nus by the likes of George Enloe.\n  In Winona, Minnesota, for example, a young man was recently found \nguilty of vandalizing flagpoles at a veterans park. What makes this act \neven more disheartening is that, according to the corrections agent who \nhandled the case, the teen ``did not really know what a veteran was.''\n  Thankfully, the judge understood the importance of educating this \nyoung man on the sacrifices made by those who have served our nation's \nmilitary. The sentence handed down by the judge required the teen to \nsee and then write a report on the movie ``Saving Private Ryan.''\n  At a time when the movies and TV are saturated with senseless \nviolence, this film exposes Americans to a bleakly realistic portrait \nof war--a war in which large numbers of Americans fought heroically in \nthe worst conditions imaginable and often died horrible deaths in a \nbattle against oppression. ``Saving Private Ryan'' is a violent film, \njust as war is violent. It is a disturbing film, as it ought to be.\n  I hope that young vandal walked out of the theater with some sense of \nwhat a veteran truly is. I hope ``Saving Private Ryan'' will help to \nraise that awareness in all Americans. During this time of relative \npeace, we cannot turn a blind eye to the sacrifices of the past. We \nmust remember that our ability to speak freely, choose a place of \nworship, and pursue the American dream were protected by every man, \nevery woman who served in World War II. Above all, we must never take \nfor granted what our veterans have taught us, the lesson that is \nchiseled into the stone of the Korean War Veterans Memorial in \nWashington, DC--``Freedom Is Not Free.''\n  On the anniversary of the official end of World War II, I encourage \nAmericans to take time today to thank and remember our veterans. \nWhether they are a neighbor, a friend, or a grandparent, ask about \ntheir experiences during that turbulent time. Through their sacrifices, \nfreedom and prosperity have flourished. Tell them they are appreciated.\n  Mr. President, I have taken a few moments to try to put into \nperspective the magnitude of the sacrifices made by our young soldiers \nduring World War II. I know that my words are wholly inadequate in \nreflecting the experiences of those brave men and women. Perhaps \nunderstanding ultimately lies not in words, but in actions--the actions \nof every veteran who swore an oath to defend our sacred freedom from \n``all enemies, foreign and domestic.''\n  We are duty-bound to pass on those experiences to future generations \nof Americans, to ensure they know the stories, sacrifices, pain, and \nultimate triumph of World War II. For their sake and for the sake of \nthis nation, we must never let another young American forget what a \nveteran is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9888-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9888-S9889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TRUTH IN BUDGETING\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there has been quite a bit of \ndiscussion in Washington recently about the need to tell the truth. \nWell, I have always believed people should tell the truth--in private \nand in public. That is why I have long opposed the biggest lie, the \nbiggest fraud in this town--the so-called federal budget surplus. The \ntruth is there is no surplus. We continue to borrow money from federal \ntrust funds--mainly Social Security--to mask the budget deficit. \nMeanwhile, the national debt skyrockets.\n  I rise today, Mr. President, to draw the Senate's attention to an \neditorial which appeared in the Sunday, August 30, 1998 edition of the \nSpartanburg Herald-Journal, published in Spartanburg, SC. This \neditorial points out the fraudulent nature of the budget surplus and \ncriticizes Congress and the President for failing to tell the American \npeople the truth about the budget. I quote the Herald-Journal: ``The \ntruth can be seen in the national debt. That debt is continuing to grow \nand will keep growing over the next few years. Your budget is not \nbalanced if you continue to go deeper and deeper into debt each year.''\n  The editorial goes on to argue that our priority should be to balance \nthe budget honestly and begin to reduce our national debt, rather than \ngive in to the near-term appeal of further tax cuts--no matter how much \nmerit the individual cuts may have. Mr. President, I have been beating \nthis drum for years now. For the past two years, for example, I have \noffered budget resolutions to urge we stay the course to balance the \nbudget and begin to reduce the debt.\n  In fact, I support many of the proposed tax cuts. I have consistently \nsupported making health insurance costs for the self-employed 100 \npercent deductible, and I have voted to eliminate the marriage penalty \nthree times in this year alone. But each time I have also voted to pay \nfor these tax cuts, so that we stay on course to balance the budget. \nThis should be our top priority. Only by reducing the national debt \nwill we be able to whittle away at our whopping $363 billion in annual \ninterest costs.\n  I have been trying for years to get the media to expose this fraud \nWashington perpetrates on the American people. Yet many in the media--\npeople entrusted to report the truth--continue to report a surplus. I \nam glad to see that at least one newspaper in my home state of South \nCarolina has seen through this smoke screen. Mr. President, I ask that \nthe entire editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n          [From the Spartanburg Herald-Journal, Aug. 30, 1998]\n\n                         Right Cuts, Wrong Time\n\n\nsome lawmakers are proposing a set of worthy tax cuts at the wrong time\n\n       Some Republicans in the U.S. House have devised a worthy \n     package of $78 billion in tax cuts. But this year is not the \n     time to cut taxes.\n       Despite the rhetoric coming from Washington, there is no \n     budget surplus to spend--not on tax cuts, not on education, \n     not even on Social Security.\n       Leaders of both parties in Congress and at the White House \n     are claiming that they have balanced the budget. But they \n     make their claim by not counting the money they are borrowing \n     from federal trust funds, including Social Security.\n       The truth can be seen in the national debt. That debt is \n     continuing to grow and will\n\n[[Page S9889]]\n\n     keep growing over the next few years. Your budget is not \n     balanced if you continue to go deeper and deeper into debt \n     each year.\n       Reducing that debt should be Congress' top priority. \n     Leaders in Washington have already wasted years of a boom \n     economy in which they could have been paying down the debt. \n     They should not waste any more time. They will not even be \n     able to claim a balanced budget if an economic downturn \n     upsets their budget forecasts.\n       That's why the GOP tax cut plans should be rejected along \n     with President Clinton's spending plans.\n       The tax cuts offered by House Republicans are even-handed \n     worthwhile cuts.\n       The plan would raise the standard deduction for married \n     couples to eliminate the marriage penalty some couples incur \n     when they combine their incomes filing jointly.\n       Under the GOP plan, self-employed taxpayers and employees \n     who have to pay for their own health insurance could deduct \n     100 percent of that cost.\n       House Republicans also would let senior citizens earn more \n     money before they start losing Social Security benefits. And \n     they would restore tax credits for businesses for research \n     and development. These would be beneficial tax cuts. But they \n     shouldn't be the highest priority in this budget year.\n       Tax cut advocates will point out that citizens pay too much \n     in taxes, that the government takes too big a bite out of its \n     citizens' incomes. And they are correct. The government is \n     too big and it takes too much of our money to support it.\n       But long-term concerns demand paying down the national debt \n     first. If that debt isn't reduced soon, the chance for real \n     and lasting tax cuts will be postponed for decades.\n       It is tempting in an election year to push for tax cuts. \n     But politicians should not push for short-term political \n     gains and taxpayers should not push for short-term financial \n     gains.\n       Our national interest and our future demands that we reduce \n     the national debt before increasing spending or reducing \n     taxes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9888-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RELIEF FOR SMALL BANKS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support \nof S. 2346, legislation which seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to expand S corporation eligibility for small banks. Expanding \nS corporation eligibility will greatly benefit small banks and, in this \nperiod of increased competition, help them as they strive to compete \nwith credit unions and megabanks.\n  At present, most banks are classified as C corporations, which \nsubjects them to the double taxation of profits. Earnings at banks \nclassified as C corporations are taxed first at corporate level and, \nafter earnings on stockholders shares are distributed, again by \nshareholders. Converting to an S corporation is an attractive option \nfor small banks because it eliminates the corporate level income tax \nand allows greater earnings, often between 30 and 40 percent, to be \npassed on to shareholders.\n  Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code was first enacted in 1958 \nto reduce the tax burden on small business corporations. Since then, \nthe Subchapter S provisions have been modified several times, most \nrecently in 1982 and 1996. The changes most recently instituted reflect \nRepublican efforts to relieve the tax burden on small businesses.\n  The relatively low number of small banks which have made the \nconversion, however, indicate that Congress needs to take additional \nsteps to liberalize the requirements for conversion to Subchapter S. \nMany bankers tell me that the excessive regulatory burden placed on our \nbanks often makes conversion to an S corporation an onerous process and \ndiscourages small banks from making the change. This must change.\n  This legislation will amend current law to help facilitate the \nconversion to an S corporation. Among the reforms is an increase in the \nnumber of S corporation eligible shareholders from 75 to 150; the \nability of S corporation shares to be held as Individual Retirement \nAccounts (IRAs); the provision that any stock that bank directors must \nhold under banking regulations shall not be a disqualifying second \nclass of stock; and permission for banks to deduct bad debt charge offs \nover the same number of years that the accumulated bad debt reserve \nmust be recaptured.\n  These provisions, and others included in the legislation, will allow \nmore banks to convert to S corporations. The result will be more \nefficient, more competitive small banks. And the consumer will be the \nultimate beneficiary. I applaud Senator Allard for introducing this \nlegislation. I believe it is a positive step that will help maintain a \nbalanced playing field among the financial service industries and I \nurge the Senate Finance Committee to act on it quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9889-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM FOSTER AND THE MARCHING 100\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as we approach a new century, I \nrecognize one of the giants of the 20th century: Dr. William Foster, \nChairman of the Music Department and Director of Bands at Florida A \nUniversity in Tallahassee, Florida.\n  After enriching the lives of thousands of students, and entertaining \nmillions around the globe via superlative performances of The Marching \n100 band, Dr. Foster is retiring. A special tribute will be held \nhonoring him in Tallahassee on September 4, 1998.\n  Dr. Foster's service to Florida A University and the field of music \nspans half a century. His genius was in melding the varied sounds of \nmusical instruments--along with unique choreography--into one of the \nmost celebrated and sought-after marching bands in the world.\n  With each performance, The Marching 100 band proves the axiom that \nmusic is an international language. And its director, Dr. Foster, is \nmusic's Ambassador at Large, lifting the spirits of all who heard the \nglorious sounds of this talented group and saw the high-stepping moves \nthat set this band apart from all others.\n  Mr. President, this is the time of year that we send our children and \ngrandchildren back to school to begin another academic year. As a \nnation, we focus on the vital role of education.\n  Dr. Foster personifies the finest attributes of an educator. He \npassed on knowledge to thousands, he built teamwork and instilled \ndiscipline, and he had fun along the way.\n  The educational leadership of Dr. Foster is one of the reasons why \nFlorida A University is ranked among America's leading institutions \nof higher learning. Last year, Florida A University was cited as \n``College of the Year'' by editors of TIME magazine and The Princeton \nReview.\n  Mr. President, I have been honored to visit Florida A University on \nmany occasions. I have experienced the spirit on campus, in the \nclassrooms and among the greater Florida A University family of \nalumni, faculty, administrators, and students.\n  And, I have experienced the special joy of watching and listening to \nThe Marching 100 under the direction of Dr. Foster. I call on my \ncolleagues in the Senate--and all those who love music--to join me in \nthis tribute to an outstanding American, a gifted educator and band \ndirector without peer: Dr. William Foster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9889-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9889-S9890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JUDGE PATRICK T.

Sheedy, who retired last month in Milwaukee after 19 years \nas a Circuit Court Judge and eight years as Chief Judge for Milwaukee's \nDistrict 1.\n  Pat Sheedy exemplifies everything that we hope to see in a judge in \nAmerica. He possesses a brilliant legal mind, a compassionate attitude, \nand the wit to see the humor in almost every situation.\n  I am proud to say that Judge Sheedy is a complete product of our \ngreat state of Wisconsin. He was born in Green Bay and received his \nundergraduate and his law degree at Marquette University in Milwaukee.\n  In addition to serving 27 years on the bench, Judge Sheedy served his \ncolleagues in a variety of capacities, including as past President of \nthe Wisconsin Bar Association.

CONVENTION TO COMBAT \n                            DESERTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to direct my colleagues' \nattention to report language accompanying this legislation supporting \nU.S. ratification of an important treaty--the U.N. Convention to Combat \nDesertification, also known as the ``Drylands'' Convention.\n  The term desertification is often mis-associated with the expansion \nof deserts. Rather, it is the loss of soil fertility in dryland \nagricultural areas. Most of the world's basic food crops are grown in \ndryland areas. Poverty, population pressure and unwise government \npolicies often drive farmers to use unsustainable farming practices on \nmarginal lands just to survive. Over time, desertification deepens \npoverty. It undercuts economic growth and triggers social instability \nin poor countries lacking resources to combat it.\n  The American Dust Bowl of the 1930's is a prime example of \ndesertification. The hunger, poverty and migration spawned by the Dust \nBowl left an indelible mark on our national psyche. In 1939, John \nSteinbeck depicted the tragedy so well in his great American novel, The \nGrapes of Wrath:\n\n       And then the dispossessed were drawn west--from Kansas, \n     Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico; from Nevada and Arkansas, \n     families, tribes, dusted out, tractored out. Car-loads, \n     caravans, homeless and hungry; twenty thousand and fifty \n     thousand and a hundred thousand and two hundred thousand. \n     They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless--\n     restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do--to lift to \n     push, to pull, to pick, to cut--anything, any burden to bear, \n     for food. The kids are hungry. We got no place to live. Like \n     ants scurrying for work, for food, and most of all for land.\n\n  Every student of U.S. history studies the economic and social impact \nof the Dust Bowl. U.S. history textbooks feature photos similar to \nthese behind me.\n  Our national response to this disaster was a successful community-\nbased soil and water conservation effort that is still fighting the \nthreat of desertification in areas of the American West today. While we \nhave grappled with this problem and won, the rest of the world is not \nso fortunate. Imagine our own Dust Bowl if we did not have the \ntechnological know-how or the economic resources to deal with it?\n  The risk of new dust bowls is increasing at an accelerating rate in \nover ninety developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. \nBillions of tons of topsoil are washed or blown away every year.\n  The U.S. is feeling the fallout from desertification abroad. \nThousands migrate over our borders from land-degraded countries such as \nMexico. We spend millions on humanitarian aid for drought-affected \ncountries in Africa. Desertification leads to even more costly and \nfrequent food aid programs. Dwindling land and water resources \nfrequently ignite regional conflict. Desertification abroad will also \ncontinue to pose risks to our environmental health and contribute to \nthe loss of plant and animal species which may hold the keys to future \nsources of food and medicine.\n  To address the problem, in 1994, the United States participated in \nnegotiating the Drylands Convention. By the time negotiations began, \ndeveloped nations were weary of carrying huge loads in support of \nenvironmental treaties. U.S. negotiators insisted that no new \nresponsibilities be placed on our government. The result is that this \ntreaty is the first of its kind.\n  It does not establish a big, new U.N. program. No army of U.N. \nemployees will be deployed to fight desertification. The treaty uses a \nbottom-up approach where the solutions are devised and then carried out \nby people at the local community level. National action plans required \nof all donee states by the treaty will add greater cohesion and \ncoordination to existing efforts.\n  The treaty's financial mechanism is unique as well. No new U.S. \nforeign aid funding is required under the Convention. The U.S. \ncurrently contributes roughly $30 million per year to fight \ndesertification. So why do we need the treaty? Because it gives U.S. \nforeign aid dollars ``more bang for the buck.'' Existing U.S. foreign \naid resources would be used more efficiently by better matching of \ndonors with areas of need through the establishment of a Global \nMechanism. It does NOT impose any international mandates on U.S. \nfunding.\n\n[[Page S9891]]\n\n  But more importantly, the Convention would be good for U.S. business. \nIt would increase opportunities for American agribusiness to export \ntechnology and expertise to developing countries affected by \ndesertification through networks established by the treaty. Clearly, \nthere is no bar to marketing these outside the framework of the \nConvention. But working within the Convention offers distinct \nadvantages. It establishes networks like the Science and Technology \nCommittee, the Roster of Independent Experts, donor coordination groups \nand partnerships with local community organizations. If the U.S. is not \na party to the Convention, U.S. businesses and consultants will be \nbarred from these lists.\n  Helping to fight desertification and poverty abroad is good for U.S. \nexports and the U.S. trade balance. Rising incomes in the agricultural \nsector of developing countries generate a higher demand for U.S. \nexports of seeds, fertilizer, agro-chemicals, farm and irrigation \nequipment as well as other U.S.-produced goods and services.\n  The United States signed the Drylands Convention in 1994. It has been \napproved by all the Organization of Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD) members except the U.S. and Japan. And Japan is \nexpected to ratify it soon. If the U.S. does not ratify by November \n1998, we will not have a voice in establishing the detailed mechanism \nthat is at the heart of the Convention. If we want this treaty to work \nfor us, then we must have a seat at the table in two months.\n  Ratification of the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification is a \nwin-win for the United States. We must not let this opportunity slip \naway from us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/02/senate-section/article/S9890-5", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9891-S9894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INDEPENDENT COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe statements made earlier today by Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy \nrelating to an independent counsel because there is a specific course \nof action which can be taken to break the impasse, in my legal \njudgment, and that is with an action for mandamus in the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia to compel Attorney General \nReno to appoint an independent counsel.\n  There is no doubt about the serious allegations and scandals in \ncampaign financing. The Governmental Affairs Committee on which I serve \nconducted extensive hearings last year which showed beyond any doubt \nirregularities of a most important sort, and some even involving \ncontributions coming from foreign sources traceable to the Government \nof China. In the face of this overwhelming evidence, the Attorney \nGeneral has declined to appoint an independent counsel.\n  The remedy is present for a mandamus action, which would be directed \non two legal lines. One is where Attorney General Reno has failed to \ncarry out a mandatory duty, where the independent counsel statute says \nthat she shall act on covered persons, and an alternative legal \napproach where there is an abuse of a discretionary duty where there is \na conflict of interest, and there is both an actual and an apparent \nconflict of interest. Importantly, Attorney General Reno, when \nquestioned during her confirmation hearing, was a great advocate of an \nindependent counsel on precisely the kind of circumstances which are \npresented here.\n  The mandamus action was pursued on three individual occasions, and \nthe United States District Court for the District of Columbia did order \nmandamus. All three of those cases were reversed for reasons which are \nnot applicable here, where there was lack of standing which was \ndelineated in extensive discussions in the court of appeals on two of \nthose cases. But those three cases by district court judges did confirm \nthe legal approach which I am advocating here today, and which is \nencompassed in an extensive lawsuit, which has been prepared against \nAttorney General Reno, calling for a mandamus action.\n  In two of the cases they were reversed because of lack of standing, \nand that is a legal issue which poses a hurdle which I believe can be \novercome by action by a majority of the majority of the Judiciary \nCommittee of either the House of Representatives or the U.S. Senate. \nThe independent counsel statute gives a majority of the majority of \neach Judiciary Committee unique positioning to have the requisite \nstanding to require an answer by the Attorney General on a statement of \nfacts and a request that independent counsel be appointed. That does \nnot mean conclusively that there would be standing for a mandamus \naction, but it is a very strong argument in support of that standing. \nAnd, in two of the cases where the court of appeals reversed an order \nfor independent counsel to be appointed, the special standing of \nCongress and the special standing of the Judiciary Committee was noted. \nIn one of the cases, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nreferred to congressional oversight, which this would be, and in \nanother case the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia referred \nto the special positioning, which the Judiciary Committee had.\n  There is another issue, laying all the cards on the table face up, as \nto separation of powers, on matters which were raised in the decision \nby the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Morrison v. \nOlson, upholding the constitutionality of the independent counsel \nstatute. Some of the language of the Supreme Court there has been \ncited, from time to time, as raising a hurdle for this kind of a \nlawsuit. But I would point out that, on two of the issues which were \nraised by the Supreme Court of the United States, the legal argument \nruns in favor of this kind of an action.\n  The Supreme Court there referred to a provision of the statute which \nsaid that there could be ``no judicial review of an action by the \nAttorney General appointing independent counsel.'' But the negative \nimplication there is that review would be possible where the Attorney \nGeneral declines to appoint an independent counsel. There is also a \nprovision in the statute which says that there may be no judicial \nreview by the special three-judge panel where the Attorney General \ndecides not to appoint an independent counsel, and again, by negative \nimplication, there can be review by the United States District Court \nfor the District of Columbia. The three-judge panel is a special panel \ncreated to make the actual appointment of an independent counsel.\n  Mr. President, in outlining these legal hurdles, there is no doubt \nthat there are problems here. But, in my legal judgment, each of these \nhurdles and any other can be surmounted. And certainly, where there is \nsuch a pressing reason to move because of what has happened here on a \ncompelling factual basis, I strongly believe that this effort ought to \nbe made and that it can be made by a majority of the majority on the \nJudiciary Committee of the Senate or a majority of the majority in the \nHouse. And perhaps it would be appropriate for both the House and the \nSenate to join together as parties plaintiff to solidify and enforce \nthe standing issue and the importance of this action.\n  My views are not those which I express lightly. They did not arise in \nthe course of the last few days or the last few weeks. My initial \nconcerns were expressed in a Judiciary oversight hearing back on April \n30 of 1997, when Attorney General Reno appeared before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and was questioned extensively by a number of \nMembers, including myself. At that time I pressed Attorney General Reno \non some of the so-called issue advertisements which were really, by any \nlegal interpretation, express advocacy.\n  Now, if they are express advocacy, and if there is coordination with \nthe Republican National Committee or the Democratic National Committee, \nthen they violate the law; they violate the Federal election law. And, \nin articulating this concern, on a number of occasions I have said that \nthere is fault on both sides, both by the Republican National Committee \nand the Democratic National Committee. But the activities by the \nDemocratic National Committee stand on a different level because of the \nactive participation by President Clinton himself in micromanaging the \ncampaign and in working on these commercials. We know that from the \ntestimony, statements of Mr. Leon Panetta, Chief of Staff of President \nClinton, and from the statements of Mr. Dick Morris, who was the \nPresident's principal adviser on these campaign matters.\n\n[[Page S9892]]\n\n  This is illustrative of what these commercials had to say. This \nappeared on advertising:\n  Head Start, student loans, toxic cleanup, extra police, anti-drug \nprograms--Dole-Gingrich wanted them cut. Now, they're safe, protected \nin the 1996 budget because the president stood firm. Dole-Gingrich--\ndeadlock, gridlock, shutdowns. The president's plan--finish the job, \nbalance the budget, reform welfare, cut taxes, protect Medicare. \nPresident Clinton gets it done. Meet our challenge, protect our values.\n  Under no stretch of the imagination could that kind of advertisement \nbe classified as articulating an issue only contrasted with \narticulating advocacy for the President's campaign.\n  I asked Attorney General Reno about that specifically on April 30 of \n1997. Her response to me was that based on a memorandum of \nunderstanding with the Federal Election Commission, it was up to the \nFederal Election Commission.\n  On the next day, May 1, 1997, I wrote to Attorney General Reno with a \nlong list of specific advertisements which were conclusively advocacy \nads which, when designated and designed and worked on by the President \nhimself, would constitute a violation of the law.\n  On June 17, I received a reply from Attorney General Reno and then \nfrom the Federal Election Commission saying that the Attorney General \nwas saying it was up to the Federal Election Commission and the Federal \nElection Commission said that they would give advisory opinions. That \nis something for the future but not something that had already been \ndone.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter of May 1, 1997, \nthe reply from the Attorney General, and the letter from the Federal \nElection Commission be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I returned to this issue with Attorney \nGeneral Reno when she came in for an oversight hearing on July 15 of \nthis year and confronted Attorney General Reno with the very basic fact \nthat the Federal election law, with criminal provisions, is the \nresponsibility of the Department of Justice to enforce and the \nresponsibility of the chief enforcement officer, the Attorney General, \nto enforce, so that by no stretch of the imagination would it be \nplausible for the Attorney General to say that it was a matter for the \nFederal Election Commission. Notwithstanding that, the Attorney General \ncontinued to articulate this argument that it was a matter for the \nFederal Election Commission, which I submit, and I say this \nrespectfully, is spurious and facetious on its face. How can it be a \nmatter for the Federal Election Commission when it is a criminal law, \ncriminal sanction which is the responsibility of the Attorney General \nand the Department of Justice? This was a very, very material matter.\n  Mr. President, I think it is relevant at this point to display a \ncouple of charts, one of which is on the issue of covered persons. \nReferring to the coordination of advocacy advertisements, President \nClinton made a statement on December 7 of 1995 at a Democratic National \nCommittee lunch, which is really more than a smoking gun, it is a \nfiring gun, that is on these advertisements. This is the President's \nvoice on tape:\n\n       Now we have come way back. . . . But one of the reasons has \n     been. . .we have been running these ads, about a million \n     dollars a week. . . . So I cannot overstate to you the impact \n     that these paid ads have had in the areas where they've run. \n     Now we're doing better in the whole country. . . . [I]n areas \n     where we've shown these ads we are basically doing ten to \n     fifteen points better than in areas where we are not showing \n     them. . . .\n\n  The chart shows Leon Panetta confirmed that President Clinton helped \ndirect expenditures of $35 million in DNC ads, and Dick Morris \nconfirmed that President Clinton micromanaged the TV ad campaign.\n  This chart was presented during the Judiciary Committee hearing. In \naddition, the instance of the covered persons where a Mr. Warren \nMeddoff on October 22, 1996, personally handed President Clinton a \nbusiness card with a written message suggesting a $5 million \ncontribution.\n  Two days later on October 24 and again on October 26, deputy chief of \nstaff Harold Ickes solicited Mr. Meddoff, including a call from Air \nForce One.\n  On October 29 and 30, Mr. Ickes called Mr. Meddoff and asked for an \nimmediate contribution of $1.5 million within 24 hours.\n  There are two other instances depicted on this chart, and this chart \nonly covers a very limited amount of information which was disclosed in \nthe hearings of the Governmental Affairs Committee. One of them was a \ncoffee which was held in the Oval Office. The President had received a \nmemorandum from the Democratic National Committee which bore the \nPresident's writing, so we know that it was actually seen by the \nPresident.\n  This memorandum identified five individuals who, according to the \nmemo, would be good for a contribution of $100,000 each. They were \naccorded a coffee in the White House. On May 1, there was this coffee \nin the Oval Office. Within the course of the week, four of the \nindividuals contributed $100,000 each. That is not in the living \nquarters. That is not in any way, shape or form justifiable.\n  When I asked Attorney General Reno about this specifically--and bear \nin mind that at Judiciary Committee hearings, we have a very limited \namount of time. It is not like a speech on the Senate floor where there \nis unlimited debate. Attorney General Reno said to me, when I asked her \nif this did not constitute where four people came in--bear with me. Let \nme read the specific information as to the question I put to the \nAttorney General, whether this wasn't specific and credible evidence \nwhich would satisfy the test of the independent counsel statute.\n  At page 193 of the record:\n\n       Attorney General Reno: I will be happy to review it with \n     the task force and get back to you, Senator.\n       Senator Specter. Well, OK. I would ask you to review the \n     balance of it. We will provide you with more of the specific \n     and credible evidence, but don't you have a judgment today, \n     Madam Attorney General?\n       Attorney General Reno: I will review it with the task \n     force.\n\n  The other specific bit of evidence was a June 18, 1996, coffee. In \nthe presence of President Clinton, John Huang solicited the attendees \nsaying:\n\n       Elections cost money, lots and lots of money, and I am sure \n     that every person in this room will want to support the re-\n     election of President Clinton.\n\n  This language is important because it was stated in the presence of \nthe President in the White House. We know that from the testimony of a \nformer official in the National Security Council who was sitting on one \nside of the President, a greater distance from the individual who made \nthe statement and the comment was heard.\n  Again, when confronted with this specifically, the Attorney General \ndeclined to give an opinion but said she would get back to me.\n  That was on July 15 of this year. And more than 45 days have passed, \nand we still do not have the information.\n  Very briefly--I will not belabor the point--this was another chart \npresented at Judiciary Committee hearings which shows the alternative \napproach on the legal issue, and that is, conflict of interest, where \nyou have Johnny Chung, who contributed some $366,000 to the Democratic \nNational Committee, you have the connection with the President, Vice \nPresident, and Mr. Glicken. You have a connection with President \nClinton and Pauline Kanchanalak, the connection between President \nClinton and John Huang, the connection between Vice President Gore and \nMaria Hsia, the connection between President Clinton and Charlie Trie.\n  In all of these matters there is a conflict of interest where these \nindividuals have been indicted. All except for Mr. Huang, there is the \ndelicate matter of plea bargaining and a matter where there ought to be \nindependent counsel not being directed by the Attorney General, who is \nthe appointee of the President.\n  As outlined in some detail earlier by Senator Hatch--and I will not \ngo over that ground--this evidence has been so compelling that FBI \nDirector Louis Freeh has taken the public position that independent \ncounsel ought to be appointed, not an easy thing to do for the FBI \nDirector, who is a subordinate of the Attorney General. But the FBI \nDirector made that statement.\n  Then you have the legal judgment of Mr. Charles LaBella, who is the \nchief prosecutor, also to the effect that independent counsel ought to \nbe appointed.\n\n[[Page S9893]]\n\n Then when Mr. LaBella was expected to be appointed as U.S. Attorney \nfor the Southern District of California, he was skipped over--a \nquestion which needs to be answered in terms of whether his candid \napproach, disagreeing with the Attorney General of the United States, \nwas a causal factor in his being passed over.\n  Mr. President, what I have outlined here is a very, very brief \nstatement of very, very compelling evidence of irregularities in \ncampaign finance. And when you deal with the issue of how Federal \nelections for the Presidency, for the Senate, and the House of \nRepresentatives are financed, that goes right to the core of our \ndemocratic institutions.\n  There is an enormous amount of skepticism in America today with the \nway we have political activities. I just finished, during the course of \nAugust, some 12 to 15 town meetings. In every meeting I was asked about \ncampaign finance reform. And there was obvious cynicism by my \nconstituents and really disgust with the way the system is run. And I \nwas asked whether there would be campaign finance reform.\n  On a number of occasions it was noted that the House of \nRepresentatives had taken the bull by the horns and had passed campaign \nfinance reform. And when asked whether it would be done in the Senate, \nI candidly said it was highly doubtful that 8 additional Senators could \nbe found to join the 52 of us who have voted for cloture in order to \nhave campaign finance reform.\n  If independent counsel were appointed and we got to the bottom of \nthese issues--and many, many more--I think there would be a tidal wave \nof public insistence on campaign finance reform which is very necessary \nfor the integrity of the electoral process.\n  When Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, speaks \nat great length about his frustration in what the Attorney General has \nnot done, that is a frustration I think shared by most of Americans. \nCertainly it is a frustration which I share, and I think is shared by \nmost of the members of the Judiciary Committee and most of the Members \nof the Congress of the United States.\n  In preparing this complaint in mandamus, we have a course of action \nwhich has a realistic chance of success. Is it a guarantee? No. There \nare many lawsuits which are filed, litigation, matters which are \ninitiated which are not absolute guarantees. But when you have very, \nvery compelling factual circumstances, as you do here, it is my legal \njudgment that the hurdles which have to be overcome can be overcome. \nAnd certainly it is an alternative which ought to be tried. It is my \nhope that the Attorney General will respond and appoint independent \ncounsel. When she has, again, taken steps to have an additional \ninvestigation for 90 days, it is not totally insufficient, but it is a \nsharp indication that she has no intention to go to the core problems, \nsome of which I have outlined here today.\n  When she activates a 90-day period of an investigation of Vice \nPresident Gore on the telephone calls, that is really a red herring, an \neffort to show some action which is totally--totally--insufficient. \nWhen she activates, as she did the day before yesterday, a 90-day \nperiod on Deputy Chief of Staff Ickes on a very limited phase, that \nagain is totally insufficient.\n  What is necessary is to pick up the broad range of investigative \nleads identified by to the Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, Louis Freeh, and the broad range of leads identified by \nthe chief counsel on the matter, Charles LaBella, to proceed. And if \nthe Attorney General does not proceed, then it is my strong \nrecommendation that the Judiciary Committee, a majority of the \nmajority, take the bull by the horns and move to take action to compel \nthe appointment of independent counsel through a mandamus act.\n  The draft copy of the complaint of mandamus--may I add that this is \nnot carved in stone, that we are actively working to update it and to \nimprove the complaint of mandamus, will outline the legal bases and is \nan outline of the evidentiary base for such an action.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1997.\n     Hon.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I have received your letter of May 1, \n     1997, asking that I offer you my legal opinion as to whether \n     the text of certain television commercials constitutes \n     ``express advocacy'' within the meaning of regulations of the \n     Federal Election Commission (``FEC''). For the reasons set \n     forth below, I have referred your request to the FEC for its \n     consideration and response.\n       Under the Federal Election Campaign Act, the FEC has \n     statutory authority to ``administer, seek to obtain \n     compliance with, and formulate policy with respect to'' FECA, \n     and exclusive jurisdiction with respect to civil enforcement \n     of FECA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437c(b)(1), See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437d(e) \n     (FEC civil action is ``exclusive civil remedy'' for enforcing \n     FECA). The FEC has the power to issue rules and advisory \n     opinions interpreting the provisions of FECA. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 437f, 438. The FEC may penalize violations of FECA \n     administratively or through bringing civil actions. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 437g. In short, ``Congress has vested the Commission \n     with `primary and substantial responsibility for \n     administering and enforcing the Act.' '' FEC v. Democratic \n     Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U.S. 27, 37 (1981), quoting \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 109 (1976).\n       The legal opinion that you seek is one that is particularly \n     within the competence of the FEC, and not one which has \n     historically been made by the Department of Justice. \n     Determining whether these advertisements constitute ``express \n     advocacy'' under the FEC's rules will require consideration \n     not only of their content but also of the timing and \n     circumstances under which they were distributed. The FEC has \n     considerably more experience than the Department in making \n     such evaluations. Moreover, your request involves \n     interpretation of a rule promulgated by the\n\n[[Page S9894]]\n\n     FEC itself. Indeed, it is the standard practice of the \n     Department to defer to the FEC in interpreting its \n     regulations.\n       There is particular reason to defer to the expertise of the \n     FEC in this matter, because the issue is not as clear-cut as \n     you suggest. In FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign \n     Comm., 839 F. Supp. 1448 (D. Colo. 1993), rev'd on other \n     grounds,  59 F.3d 1015 (10th Cir. 1995), vacated, 116 S.Ct. \n     2309 (1996), the United States District Court held that the \n     following advertisement, run in Colorado by the state \n     Republican Federal Campaign Committee, did not constitute \n     ``express advocacy'':\n       ``Here in Colorado we're used to politicians who let you \n     know where they stand, and I though we could count on Tim \n     Wirth to do the same. But the last few weeks have been a real \n     eye-opener. I just saw some ads where Tim Wirth said he's for \n     a strong defense and a balanced budget. But according to his \n     record, Tim Wirth voted against every new weapon system in \n     the last five years. And he voted against the balanced budget \n     amendment.\n       ``Tim Wirth has a right to run for the Senate, but he \n     doesn't have a right to change the facts.''\n       839 F. Supp. at 1451, 1455-56. The court held that the \n     ``express advocacy'' test requires that an advertisement ``in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a \n     candidate.'' Id. at 1456. The Court of Appeals reversed the \n     District Court on other grounds, holding that ``express \n     advocacy'' was not the appropriate test, and the Supreme \n     Court did not reach the issue.\n       Furthermore, a pending matter before the Supreme Court may \n     assist in the legal resolution of some of these issues; the \n     Soliciter General has recently filed a petition for \n     certiorari on behalf of the FEC in the case of Federal \n     Election Commission v. Maine Right to Life Committee, Inc., \n     No. 96-1818, filed May 15, 1997. I have enclosed a copy of \n     the petition for your information. It discusses at some \n     length the current state of the law with respect to the \n     definition and application of the ``express advocacy'' \n     standard in the course of petitioning the Court to review the \n     restrictive definition of the standard adopted by the lower \n     courts in that case.\n       It appears, therefore, that the proper legal status of \n     these advertisements under the regulations issued by the FEC \n     is a question that is most appropriate for initial review by \n     the FEC.\n       Accordingly, I have referred your letter to the FEC for its \n     consideration. Thank you for your inquiry on this important \n     matter, and do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any \n     further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Janet Reno.\n                                  ____\n\n         Office of the Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Department \n           of Justice,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1997.\n     Hon. John Warren McGarry,\n     Chairman, Federal Election Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Enclosed for the attention and whatever \n     further reply the Federal Election Commission (FEC) finds to \n     be appropriate is a copy of an exchange of correspondence \n     between the Attorney General and Senator Arlen Specter of \n     Pennsylvania concerning the application of the Commission's \n     rules governing issue advocacy by political parties to a \n     specific advertisement. The Department of Justice regards the \n     subject matter of this inquiry as properly within the primary \n     jurisdiction of the FEC.\n       If we can assist the Commission in any way in this matter, \n     please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mark M. Richard,\n     Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Federal Election Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1997.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Your letter of May 1, 1997 to \n     Attorney General Reno has been referred by the Department of \n     Justice to the Federal Election Commission. Your letter asks \n     for a legal opinion on whether the text of certain \n     advertisements constitutes ``issue advocacy'' or ``express \n     advocacy''.\n       As the Attorney General's June 19, 1997 letter to you \n     correctly notes, the Federal Election Commission has \n     statutory authority to ``administer, seek to obtain \n     compliance with, and formulate policy with respect to'' the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act (``FECA''). 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 437c(b)(1). The Commission's policymaking authority \n     includes the power to issue rules and advisory opinions \n     interpreting the FECA and Commission regulations. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 437f and 438.\n       Your May 1 letter notes that the Commission has promulgated \n     a regulatory definition of ``express advocacy'' at 11 CFR \n     100.22. While the Commission may issue advisory opinions \n     interpreting the application of that provision, the FECA \n     places certain limitations on the scope of the Commission's \n     advisory opinion authority. Specifically, the FEC may render \n     an opinion only with respect to a specific transaction or \n     activity which the requesting person plans to undertake in \n     the future. See 2 U.S.C. 437f(a) and 11 CFR 112.1(b). Thus, \n     the opinion which you seek regarding the text of certain \n     advertisements does not qualify for advisory opinion \n     treatment, since the ads appears to be ones previously aired \n     and do not appear to be communications that you intend to air \n     in the future. Moreover, ``[n]o opinion of an advisory nature \n     may be issued by the Commission or any of its employees \n     except in accordance with the provisions of [section 437f].'' \n     2 U.S.C. Sec. 437f(b).\n       While the FECA's confidentiality provision precludes the \n     Commission from making public any information relating to a \n     pending enforcement matter, I note that past activity such as \n     the advertisements you describe may be the subject of \n     compliance action. If you believe that the advertisements in \n     question involve a violation of the FECA, you may file a \n     complaint with the Commission pursuant to 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 437g(a) noting who paid for the ads and any additional \n     information in your possession that would assist the \n     Commission's inquiry. The requirements for filing a complaint \n     are more fully described in the enclosed brochure.\n       I hope that this information proves helpful to your \n     inquiry. Please feel free to contact my office or the Office \n     of General Counsel if you need further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              John Warren McGarry,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.
