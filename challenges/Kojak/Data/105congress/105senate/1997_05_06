The blaring sounds of \na noisy society bombard our ears and agitate our souls. The television \nset is seldom turned off. We turn on our car radio at the same time we \nturn the ignition key. Music is piped into everywhere we go, from the \ngrocery to the gym. On the streets, horns blare, tires screech, and \ntempers flare. Meanwhile, people around us talk constantly trying to \nfind out what they want to say in the welter of words. It's so easy to \nlose the art of being quiet.\n  Even in this quiet moment, our minds are racing, our nervous systems \nare on red alert and we're like sprinters waiting for the starter's gun \nto go off. Calm us down, Lord, so we can work creatively today.\n  Lord, we hear Your voice saying, ``Peace, be still.'' We want the \nmiracle of that stillness and accept it as Your gift. We breathe out \nthe tension and breathe in the breath of Your spirit. In this time of \nprayer speak to us the whisper of Your love and assurance, grace, and \nguidance. Get us ready for a day in which we can be still inside while \nliving in a noisy world. In the name of our Lord and Saviour. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S3977-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last Friday, the President and the \ncongressional leadership announced that they had reached an agreement \nto balance the budget. I support the goal of balancing the budget by \n2002, and I commend the President's emphasis on improving education, \nexpanding health coverage for uninsured children, and extending the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund.\n  But as the administration and the congressional leadership continue \nto negotiate the specific provisions of the agreement, and as more \ninformation about the agreement becomes available, a number of \nquestions arise about the agreement.\n  First, what is the distribution of the benefits in the tax package \nover the first 5 years? The new and expanded tax breaks in the \nagreement raise the most troubling questions in this regard. The only \nbeneficiaries of the agreement's reductions in the estate tax are the \ntop 1 percent of households. Three-quarters of the benefits of the \ncapital gains provisions will go to households with incomes in excess \nof $100,000. According to one tax expert, as much as 40 percent of the \nbenefits of the tax cuts will go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers.\n  We know that the wealthy will receive large tax breaks under this \nagreement. It is fair to ask, how much, if any, of the major sacrifices \nunder this budget are the wealthy being asked to share? Are the wealthy \ncorporations being asked to give up any of the massive subsidies they \nreceive under the current spending and tax laws? I urge the \nadministration and the congressional leadership to make a detailed \nanalysis of the proposed tax cuts available as soon as possible, so \nthat Congress and the country can judge their fairness.\n  Second, what is the distribution of benefits in the tax package in \nthe second 5 years? Because the capital gains tax break initially \ngenerates revenues as wealthy investors sell their assets to take \nadvantage of the lower tax rate, an accurate assessment of its cost and \nfairness must examine a longer period of time.\n  According to an analysis of the Senate Republican leadership's tax \nproposals introduced this January conducted by the Center on Budget and \nPolicy\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\nPriorities, the Republican capital gains tax cut cost $33 billion in \nthe first 5 years, and then nearly tripled to $96 billion in the second \n5 years. And their estate tax provisions, which cost $18 billion in the \nfirst 5 years, ballooned to $48 billion in the second 5 years. We must \ndo all that we can to ensure that Congress does not repeat the mistake \nof the excessive 1981 tax cuts that led to the massive Reagan-Bush \nbudget deficits.\n  Third, what spending cuts will pay for these increased tax cuts in \nthe second 5 years? If the cost of the tax cuts in years 6 through 10 \nfar exceeds the cost in years 1 through 5, will Congress face the \nimpossible choice of making severe and unacceptable reductions in \nsocial programs, or doing nothing and acquiescing in a new round of \ndeficits as far as the eye can see?\n  Fourth, what are the even longer-term costs of the tax breaks? By one \nestimate, the net cost of the tax breaks will reach $45 billion a year \nby the 10th year. Projecting those rates into the second 10 years--\nyears 2008 through 2017--the cost of these tax breaks could exceed half \na trillion dollars for that period.\n  The great danger is that these pressures on the deficit will explode \nexactly at the same time that the country faces the severe budget \npressures caused by the retirement of the baby boom generation. We \nalready know that we face intense long-run problems with Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. The last thing that we should do in \nthe current budget agreement is to make those long-run problems worse.\n  Fifth, can the country realistically accept the increasingly tight \ncaps on domestic investments even in the first 5 years? President \nClinton correctly resisted deeper cuts sought by Republicans. But the \nagreement slashes domestic investments by at least $60 billion below \nthe level needed to maintain the current level of services. That is \nroughly a 10-percent cut in real terms. Discretionary spending has \nremained relatively flat since 1991, and is already at its lowest level \nas a share of the economy in 60 years. These dramatic cuts will mean \nless for vital investments in areas such as research and development \nfunded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science \nFoundation, less for crime prevention and police officers on the \nstreet, less for repair and upgrading of our Nation's highways and \nbridges, less for education, health and safety, and the environment.\n\n  Can the country afford to continue to shortchange the key public \ninvestments needed to keep our economy strong into the next century? It \nis only through investment that the Nation can sustain needed economic \ngrowth. Using the definition of public investment accepted by the \nGeneral Accounting Office--including education and training, public \ninfrastructure, and civilian research and development--public \ninvestment accounted for 2.5 percent of the economy under President \nReagan. Today, it has fallen to 1.7 percent of the economy. How much \nlower is Congress prepared to see it go?\n  Sixth, what is the distribution of domestic discretionary spending \ncuts under this agreement? After protecting high-priority spending \nitems, the agreement will force deeper cuts in the unprotected areas. \nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that 34 percent of the \ncuts in nondefense discretionary spending in the last Congress came \nfrom programs for those with the lowest incomes, such as programs for \nfuel oil assistance, child care, senior nutrition and meals for senior \nshut-ins, vaccinations for children, school lunches, drug abuse \nprevention, and Head Start. Programs for low-income Americans have \nalready borne a disproportionate burden of deficit reduction. They \nshould not have to bear an unfair burden under this agreement.\n  Seventh, will defense spending be able to live within this agreement? \nThe Secretary of Defense is conducting a quadrennial defense review of \nstrategy, force structure, and modernization needs. Is the spending \nanticipated in this agreement sufficient to meet the commitments that \nthe Department feels are essential? If the defense spending levels in \nthe agreement are not adequate to meet future security needs, how can \nwe ensure that defense increases are offset by reductions in the tax \nbreaks, and not by further reductions in needed domestic investments?\n  Before we adopt this agreement as a budget resolution, we must do our \nbest to obtain serious answers to these serious questions. Fairness is \na fundamental issue. It will be fundamentally unfair if a handful of \nsuper-wealthy Americans benefit lavishly from this agreement, while \nmillions of average Americans and their families take it on the chin. A \nfairly balanced budget is achievable. But a budget that fails to \nbalance the Nation's basic needs will not be worth the paper on which \nit is printed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nspeak for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to thank the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts for raising very profound, important questions about this \nbudget agreement. I came to the floor of the Senate yesterday, and I \nsaid that I really believed that there is a quiet crisis in our Nation \nwhen we don't make the kind of investments in providing opportunities \nfor all the children in our country and that I find this budget to be \nwoefully inadequate when it comes to such a question.\n  Mr. President, an agreement is fine, but the question is: At what \ncost? We don't want to leave a whole class of citizens behind. Mr. \nPresident, as I look at this budget, I have two questions, and the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts raised these questions in a very \neloquent and important way.\n  The first question: If, in fact, we are going to have these tax cuts, \nwhich, as we look over the first 10 years and beyond, accelerate and \nyou have cuts in the capital gains tax and estate tax \ndisproportionately flowing to the top 1 or 2 percent, then cuts in \nprograms that are important to vulnerable citizens--nutrition, \neducation, housing, you name it--really are harsh. This represents no \nstandard of fairness to have tax benefits disproportionately benefiting \nthe wealthy and at the same time eliminating opportunities for some of \nour most vulnerable citizens, especially children.\n  Second, Mr. President, I said yesterday that I really worry about the \nsymbolic politics--and I speak only for myself here. I said it \nyesterday, and I say it one more time, I speak more to my own \ncolleagues in the Democratic Party.\n  It is going to become very difficult for us to be talking about the \nearly years, childhood development, the importance of investing in \nchildren, and the fact that for one out of every four children under \nthe age of 3 and 4 in America, and for one out of every two children of \ncolor in America, it is going to be impossible to talk about our \nschools and the physical infrastructure when we have a budget that does \nnot invest in these children. We don't have one cent invested now in \nthe physical infrastructure in our schools. Rotting schools don't send \nchildren a very positive message about themselves.\n  We know--the medical evidence is compelling--that we have to do so \nmuch more on the nutrition front, on the health care front, on the \nchild care front, on the intellectual development front if all of our \nchildren in our Nation are going to be prepared for school, much less \nprepared for life. And there is precious little by way of investment in \nchildren and in educational opportunities for these children in \nAmerica.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise to just simply say to my colleagues that it \nis going to become very difficult for Democrats or, for that matter, \nall of us in the House and in the Senate to say that we are for \nchildren, that we are for opportunities, that we believe in our \nnational values and the quality of opportunity when we do not make the \ninvestment.\n  Mr. President, this is a budget without a soul. This is a budget \nwithout a soul. This is a budget that leaves too many Americans behind. \nThis is a budget that will further intensify the profound problem of \ntwo Americas. We should have one America. We should have one America \nwhere all of our citizens--and let's start with our children and \ngrandchildren--each and every one of them have the opportunity to reach \ntheir full potential. This budget\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\ndoesn't make an investment in these children. This budget doesn't \nprovide these children with these opportunities, and for the sake of \ntax cuts that in the main go to wealthy people, I don't see the \nstandard of fairness. And I don't see the soul of this budget. I think \nwe are making a terrible mistake.\n  So, Mr. President, as much as I respect colleagues--I see my good \nfriend, Senator Domenici, on the floor--my work will be to try to raise \nthe bar, have amendments, and improve this piece of legislation so \nthat, as a matter of fact, we have a budget that represents an \ninvestment in the future. When I talk about an investment in the \nfuture, I talk about an investment in children. That includes poor \nchildren in America. I do not want to leave them behind.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S3977-6", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3979-S3981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum).

Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I would be prepared to discuss the amendments that Senator Wellstone \nhas shown to the committee. We are awaiting the arrival of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia. But I believe that it would \nbe in order, if the Senator wishes, to lay down the amendment and \ndiscuss the one pertaining to low-income home energy assistance.

Mr. President, I am going to lay this amendment aside \nand get to an amendment we may agree on. But I want to briefly mention \nthe first two amendments that I have discussed with my colleagues.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Please.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have only seen two of the Senator's \namendments. We would like an opportunity to review them, if he would be \nso kind.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to. This is an amendment that has \nto do with brand name drugs for adults. I was going to simply offer it, \nlay it aside, and then go to the energy assistance amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that is agreeable with the managers of \nthe bill. I would like to have it laid aside and not be the pending \namendment, if the Senator wishes. But we don't want to see a roadblock \nand have to get consent to move on to the other amendments.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to do that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be laid \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 58\n\n (Purpose: to make certain funds available, under the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Act of 1981, to victims of flooding and other natural \n                               disasters)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I send an amendment to the desk\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Wellstone) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 58.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n       Sec. 326. The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall--\n       (1) make available under section 2604(g) of the Low-Income \n     Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8623(g)), \n     $45,000,000 in assistance described in such Act to victims of \n     flooding and other natural disasters in Minnesota, North \n     Dakota, and South Dakota, for fiscal year 1997; and\n       (2) make the assistance available from funds appropriated \n     to carry out such Act prior to the date of enactment of this \n     section.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, say to my \ncolleague from Alaska that I hope we will be able to eventually \nnegotiate this out. We have been in contact with the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to find out exactly what the need is in other \nStates and see how we can make the best use of low-income energy \nassistance money to help people who have been the victims of floods.\n  So I thought, that while I know that my colleague is willing to \nperhaps take this, that I might start by explaining this amendment, \nunless my colleague has remarks which he wants to make at the moment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it would be my \nposition that, if the Senator would delete the references to specific \nStates, we would have no objection to the amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that the money is available and this would earmark $45 \nmillion for assistance under section 2604(g) of the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Act. But there are other disaster areas that are \ncovered by this bill. We see no reason why there should not be similar \nassistance in those areas.\n  There are some disasters from 1996 and some from the spring of 1997 \ncovered by this bill. They are all within the assistance for fiscal \nyear 1997. Being limited to the assistance that is in this bill for \n1997, we would have no objection if it is not earmarked to specific \nStates.\n  I don't know the extent of assistance that would be available outside \nof the three States mentioned, but I do believe there are circumstances \nthat would warrant them because of the type of flooding that took place \nin the fall of 1996.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, perhaps I will \nthen lay out the rationale for this. The reason I hesitate is that \nperhaps we might need, in the agreement, to work on another number. In \nother words, the $45 million was based upon the very best advice that I \nreceived from Governors of our States about what we needed. It may be \nthat we are going to talk about other States as well, which I am \npleased to do, however, I just want to have some understanding of what \nthe need is and whether or not this is enough funding. Altogether I \nthink there is a contingency fund of\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\nover $200 million that Health and Human Services has in the LIHEAP \nprogram.\n  So, if my colleague would not mind, I would like to explain why I \nhave offered this amendment. First of all, I very much appreciate the \noffer from the Senator from Alaska.\n  I also want to say at the very beginning that both Senator Stevens \nand Senator Byrd have--I want people in Minnesota to know this--really \nleft no stone unturned when it comes to this effort to get the \nassistance to people. I thank them.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield further, Mr. President?\n  The Senator's amendment mandates the Secretary to make this available \nfrom the moneys that the Senator has mentioned. The Secretary has \ncurrent authority to do it. It is discretionary. The effect of his \namendment is to mandate that, of the moneys that are there, at least \n$45 million shall be available immediately for the disaster victims. I \nbelieve that the fund itself is for general population assistance for \nLIHEAP projects. If the Senator will take out the reference to the \nspecific States, what it means is that the $45 million is reserved for \nthe purposes he seeks and, if there is additional money in there, for \nothers. But we think this reserving money ought to be for victims of \nall disasters covered by the bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I again appreciate the Senator from \nAlaska and his wisdom on this matter. The Senator is quite correct.\n  A little bit of background about this: We have been working very hard \nwith the administration over the last month to get them to release this \ncontingency funding. I talked with the Office of Management and Budget \nand others about releasing some of this funding to the State of \nMinnesota. Under the best of all circumstances, you want to keep this \ncontingency fund intact because you may need it for the summer cooling \nassistance. We don't normally think about that. But not too many \nsummers ago we were faced with a tragic situation in our country where \npeople actually died from the heat. I understand the need to keep some \nof that money in the contingency fund. It just so happens that this \nflooding and the extent of this devastation is unprecedented, and we \nare trying to take some of this fund to deal with an emergency--indeed, \nthe emergency that confronts people in our States.\n\n  Let me, first of all, explain the reason for this amendment. This \nmoney is in a contingency fund to provide assistance to people who \nreally need that assistance, who are really faced with an emergency \nsituation, and that is the case in Minnesota and the Dakotas. But what \nwe are faced with in Minnesota is the situation where many people are \nnow going back to their homes and they are trying to rebuild their \nlives. This money, which can be delivered expeditiously and will help \npeople repair their furnaces so that they can begin the process of \nrebuilding their lives by cleaning up and moving back into their homes.\n  If I could get both Senators' attention, if I could get the attention \nof the Senator from Alaska, I want to say to the Senator from Alaska \nand to the Senator from West Virginia that we will accept the very \ngenerous offer. We have now made some calls and this is fine with us.\n  Maybe I could summarize this amendment and we will be done with it, \nif that is OK.\n  Mr. President, in Minnesota alone, we have estimates of around $30 \nmillion to help people with their emergency energy needs. Once this \namendment is accepted, and it will be and hopefully be part of this \ndisaster relief bill, we are in a position, out in Minnesota, to \ndeliver this assistance to people within a couple of weeks. We are \ntalking about, roughly speaking, in Minnesota alone, about 16,000 \nhouseholds which will be eligible for this assistance.\n  So, I say to my distinguished colleague from Alaska, and I say to my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia as well: Thank you. I want \nthis assistance to help people in, not just three States, but other \nStates as well. It sounds like this additional funding will really make \na difference. It sounds like a small amount. I thank my colleagues, all \nof my colleagues, because, while it may sound like a small amount, \ngiven the context of the overall disaster relief bill, this will be a \nhuge help. I have been receiving a lot of calls from State officials \nand from families in Minnesota saying: Look, we are going home. We are \ntrying to rebuild our homes, trying to rebuild our lives. If you could \nget just a little bit of assistance to us to repair our furnaces, for \nexample, this would make all the difference in the world.\n  I say to Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, you have helped make all \nthe difference in the world for some families in Minnesota. I thank you \nand I am very pleased to have this amendment accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as Senator Wellstone has indicated, the \neffect of this amendment will be to dedicate a portion of the moneys \nthat are available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nmake LIHEAP-type assistance available to victims of flooding and other \nnatural disasters covered by the bill. It is moneys that are there and \ncould be made available. This mandates making it available.\n  We believe under the circumstances that that is a proper thing to do. \nFor this side, I am willing to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask Senator Byrd if he is willing to accept the \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, if the Senator will yield, I am happy to associate \nmyself with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask the Senator modify his amendment in accordance \nwith our agreement by deleting the references to the States. Has he \ndone that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alaska, I \nwill so modify it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment at this time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As modified, it then reads ``natural disasters for the \nfiscal year 1997,'' is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 58), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n       Sec. 326. The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall--\n       (1) make available under section 2604(g) of the Low-Income \n     Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8623(g)), \n     $45,000,000 in assistance described in such Act to victims of \n     flooding and other natural disasters for the fiscal year \n     1997; and\n       (2) make the assistance available from funds appropriated \n     to carry out such Act prior to the date of enactment of this \n     section.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am prepared to accept the amendment of the Senator and \nask for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 58), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator wish to proceed to other amendments?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am ready, but in deference to both Senators, they \nhad wanted me to lay aside the extension of the drug patent?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 60\n\n (Purpose: To make a technical amendment to language in the manager's \n                               amendment)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Department of Transportation has \nprovide us a technical correction to some language that is in the \nnonemergency title of the bill. The correction in no way changes the \nscope or intent of our committee action and it has been cleared, now, \non both sides. I offer it, to bring about the technical correction that \nhas been sought by the administration through the Department of \nTransportation.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 60.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On line 1, page 37 of the bill, after the colon, strike all \n     through ``1997'' on line 15 of page 37, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``Provided further, That notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, such additional authority shall be \n     distributed to ensure that States receive amounts that they \n     would have received had the Highway Trust Fund fiscal year \n     1994 income statement not been understated prior to the \n     revision on December 24, 1996; and that notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, an amount of obligational authority \n     in addition to the amount distributed above, shall be made \n     available by this Act and shall be distributed to assure that \n     States receive obligational authority that they would have \n     received had the Highway Trust Fund fiscal year 1995 income \n     statement not been revised on December 24, 1996:\n       Provided further, That such additional authority shall be \n     distributed to ensure that no State shall receive an amount \n     in fiscal year 1997 that is less than the amount a State \n     received in fiscal year 1996''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for immediate consideration of the \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this side is in agreement with the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska with reference to this amendment. We \nare willing to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 60) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, does the Senator from Minnesota wish to \nproceed now?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am ready to speak about the bill, the \ndisaster relief bill, and how important it is to Minnesota. I am \nwaiting on the amendment for Senator Hollings.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator wishes to address the bill \nin any way, it is his privilege.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I will, just for a \nminute, suggest the absence of a quorum, and then I will be right back \non the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, obviously, with the budget deal completed \nover the weekend, Members are trying now to look at the facts. What I \nwould like to do in these 10 minutes is turn and look at the facts.\n  I know to many people in America, it may seem too good to be true to \nbelieve that we could give the President the largest increase in social \nspending that we have seen in America since the 1960's, in his own \nwords, that we could give Republicans a tax cut and that we could give \nthe American people a balanced budget all at the same time.\n  If all that seems too good to be true, it is for a simple reason: It \nis too good to be true. Let me begin by simply running through the \nbudget very quickly.\n  Because the economy has been growing, this year we had an easier task \nof balancing the budget than we have had before. In fact, we only \nneeded about $330 billion of deficit reduction in order to balance the \nbudget. Let me outline how the budget agreement achieves that $330 \nbillion of deficit reduction.\n  As many of you know, on Thursday night, at the very point where the \nbudget agreement had reached an impasse, the budgeting arm of Congress, \nthe Congressional Budget Office, miraculously discovered a revenue \nwindfall where they reestimated, again, the rate of growth in the \neconomy and the amount of taxes taken from the economy and, in the \nprocess, produced a revenue windfall that lowered the deficit by $225 \nbillion. That one assumption of stronger economic growth provides 68 \npercent of the deficit reduction required to balance the budget.\n  The budget negotiators assumed a lower inflation rate which reduced \nthe deficit by $15 billion, another 5 percent of the required deficit \nreduction. They assumed by balancing the budget, the economy will be \nstronger still, and we will get a balanced budget dividend with \nstronger economic growth, and they assumed that economic growth would \nprovide $77 billion of additional deficit reduction, another 23 \npercent. In the final analysis, the deficit reduction in this budget \ncan be divided in the following way: 96 cents out of every dollar of \ndeficit reduction is simply assumed; 4 cents out of every dollar, $14 \nbillion out of $330 billion comes from a change in public policy.\n  So why is the budget balanced in this budget? It is balanced because \nthe negotiators assumed that it is balanced. Only $14 billion of the \n$330 billion of required deficit reduction comes from policy change.\n  What is very much real about the budget is discretionary spending. \nWhen the Speaker said this budget is the fulfillment of the Contract \nWith America, I think if you go back and look at the 1996 budget that \nwas passed by Congress, which embodied the Contract With America, you \nwill see that over the 5 years of this current budget negotiation it \nspent $216 billion less on social spending than the budget deal that \nhas just been completed. The budget we adopted last year spent $193 \nbillion less on nondefense discretionary spending. The President's \nbudget from last year spent $79 billion less on nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. And finally, if you take the President's budget \nas scored by CBO, with the across-the-board cuts in the last year, this \nbudget agreement actually gives the President $5 billion more than he \nasked for in his own budget with the CBO adjustment and the automatic \ncut mechanism in the end.\n  In addition to this massive increase in discretionary spending, the \nbudget entails a whole group of entitlements. It expands Medicaid in \ntwo different ways; it overturns welfare reform from last year and \nreinstitutes welfare benefits for illegal immigrants; it expands food \nstamps and, together with mandatory and entitlement programs, it spends \nroughly another $35 billion.\n\n  Then the major savings claimed in the budget is in Medicare, but \nvirtually all these savings come from lowering reimbursement to doctors \nand hospitals, because what the negotiators did is they not only picked \nthe number of $115 billion, but they committed to the Clinton policy. \nThe only problem is that on a dozen occasions in the last 30 years, we \nhave assumed a lower reimbursement rate for doctors and hospitals under \nMedicare, and each and every time this policy has not worked because \nthe doctors and the hospitals have found ways around it. But we take \nevery penny of that $115 billion of claimed Medicare savings and spend \nit on new entitlements and on new social programs.\n  Finally, we come to the tax cut which is funded by odds-and-ends, \ndogs-and-cats savings and by spectrum auction. This is selling the \nright to use spectrum. I remind my colleagues that the Appropriations \nCommittee last year assumed $2.9 billion of spectrum broadcast auction \nto fund spending. When that auction actually occurred, it raised only \n$13.6 million, or, in other words, we got $1 for every $200 of spectrum \nauction we assumed last year.\n  But let me talk about the tax cut. We, in the budget, have an $85 \nbillion net tax cut. Any tax cut beyond that we have to raise other \ntaxes to pay for it. About $5 billion of that is offset by the lower \nCPI assumed in the budget\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\nand its impact on taxes, and that gets the net real tax cut down to \nabout $80 billion. We commit in the budget to fund the President's \neducation priorities which takes another $35 billion, though it is \nunclear at this point whether this was a 5-year commitment or 10 years. \nSo we are now down to a $45 billion net tax cut.\n  I remind my colleagues that the full Republican tax cut cost $188 \nbillion. In fact, a $500 tax credit per child cost $105 billion over 5 \nyears. Capital gains, the way it is scored by the budgeting arm of the \nCongress, cost $33 billion. Our death and estate tax relief cost $18 \nbillion, and our IRA expansion cost $32 billion. The point is, if you \nread the newspaper, it is as if we got an agreement to cut capital \ngains taxes, to reform death taxes and give a $500 tax credit. The \nreality is the net tax cut available will not pay for a third of that \npolicy. What we are going to end up with, invariably, is a $500 tax \ncredit but excluding middle-income Americans from the tax cut. I don't \nknow how you are going to end up fitting the rest of these items into \nthat limited space.\n  Finally, let me conclude by saying, well, what about the question, Is \nthis deal worse than nothing? Let me give you two reasons why I believe \nit is and why I am going to oppose it.\n  No. 1, it assumes a balanced budget and, in the process, convinces \nAmerica that we have really done something about the deficit when we \nhave not. I am very concerned that that is going to take pressure off \nCongress to control spending. We are seeing in this budget agreement \nitself the largest increase in social spending since the 1960's, and I \nam afraid that by convincing people we have balanced the budget when, \nin fact, we just assume it is balanced, that that is going to open the \nfloodgates for spending.\n  No. 2, and of at least equal importance, in Medicare, we reduce \nreimbursement for doctors and hospitals. We take the fastest-growing \npart of Medicare, home health care, and transfer it out of the Medicare \ntrust fund, something we Republicans denounced as a fraud only 2 or 3 \nmonths ago. By doing these things, we now claim that we have saved \nMedicare for a decade.\n  I am concerned that this is going to trample on the emerging \nbipartisan consensus to do something to save Medicare. I am concerned \nthat we are going to let 2 or 3 years pass where we believe we have \ndone something about Medicare, or at least claim we have, when, in \nfact, Medicare, when you look at the payment for hospitals and doctors, \nwill be a $1.6 trillion drain on the Federal budget in the next 10 \nyears. I am afraid that by claiming we have done things we have not \ndone--balance the budget, save Medicare--that we are going to undercut \nthose real efforts. Those are efforts that desperately need to be \nundertaken.\n\n  Obviously, many people will have many different views on this \nsubject. I am a firm believer in the Jefferson adage that good people \nwith the same facts are going to disagree. But I wanted my colleagues \nto understand that I am not here this morning speaking with passion \nabout some priority I have that is not contained in the budget. What I \nam trying to do is to, basically, get people to understand that we \nassume the budget is balanced, we don't institute any policy to balance \nit; that we are granting a massive increase in spending for social \nprograms that someday will have to be paid for; we are creating new \nentitlement benefits; and we are continuing to talk as if we are going \nto have this massive tax cut when we have only $45 billion net \navailable to pay for it. Trying to get $188 billion of tax cuts into a \n$45 billion allowable space is going to be very, very difficult and, in \nthe end, a lot of people are going to be disappointed.\n  Let me, again, thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee for giving me an opportunity to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Durbin has asked for time to \nspeak on the budget. I ask unanimous consent that he be permitted to \nspeak for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Chairman Stevens for \nyielding this time in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S3981-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3982-S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AGREEMENT ON BALANCING THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has only been a few weeks since this \nChamber was the platform and the focus for a debate on amending the \nConstitution of the United States. Members of this Senate came to the \nfloor, mainly Republican but some Democrats, and argued it was \npolitically impossible for the leaders in this country to reach an \nagreement on a balanced budget absent an amendment to the Constitution \nwhich would require it, which would involve the Federal judiciary, \nwhich would have added language to the Constitution, binding language \non future Congresses. And yet here we stand today, just a few weeks \nlater, many of us in favor of, some opposed, but speaking to an \nagreement to balance the budget. Did it take a constitutional \namendment? Of course not, it took leadership, leadership from both \npolitical parties.\n  I voted against that balanced budget amendment. I said then, as I say \nnow, you do not need to amend the Constitution to meet your \nconstitutional responsibility, and my responsibility is to make certain \nthat we live within our means while our economy moves forward. And I am \nhappy today that we can stand and discuss this balanced budget absent a \nconstitutional amendment.\n\n  I want to acknowledge on the floor my colleague, Senator Byrd, of \nWest Virginia. If you were to list his accolades, I think the one he \nwould be proudest of is his role as guardian of the Constitution. He \ncarries that Constitution in his pocket every day. He believes in it to \nhis core that it embodies what America is all about. He does not take \nconstitutional amendments very lightly, and he has effectively argued \nagainst the balanced budget amendment and others over the years.\n  Senator Byrd, this balanced budget agreement is a tribute to your \ntenacity and your commitment to the Constitution. History has proven \nyou right again. A constitutional amendment was unnecessary. It took \nthe will to bring about this agreement. And today we are debating such \nan agreement without a constitutional amendment.\n  On behalf of myself and those who really are grateful for the \ncontribution you have made on behalf of the Constitution, I just want \nto acknowledge that today.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois for his more than gracious, more than charitable comments. I \nvery much appreciate them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. You are certainly welcome.\n  How did we come to this day? Make no mistake, if the American economy \nwere struggling, if we faced high unemployment, slow economic growth, \nfew housing starts, businesses failing, trade accounts in the red, we \nwould not be standing here with any kind of an agreement to balance the \nbudget. But that is not the case.\n  What propels us into this debate is the good condition of the \nAmerican economy. Yesterday, the Dow Jones index broke a record, I \nbelieve. I cannot keep up with it. Up and down, up and down, but it has \ngenerally been up. We have seen the lowest unemployment figures in two \ndecades. We have seen jobs created. People are building homes and \nstarting businesses. America is moving forward. We feel good about it.\n  How did we get here? Is this just a matter of good luck? I think it \nis more than that. I think it goes back to an action taken by Congress \nin 1993, and not a popular one, I might add, when the President stood \nup and said, ``I think we can move toward a balanced budget and keep \nthe economy moving forward, and I want the support of Congress to do \nit.'' I was a Member of the House at that time. I joined the President, \nand I might tell you it was a partisan decision--not one single \nRepublican vote in support of the President's plan, and yet we passed \nit. In the Senate it only passed when Vice President Gore cast the \ntiebreaking vote to enact the President's budget. We are lucky that he \ndid because with that plan in 1993, we set the stage for this\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\ndebate to bring the budget into balance. We set the stage for economic \nexpansion, which is creating more revenues, so that we can sit down and \ntalk about tax cuts and more money being spent on education and \nenvironmental protection. Absent the President's leadership, absent the \nDemocrats in Congress standing behind him, this day might never have \ncome. And yet it has. And we can be proud of it.\n  So let us talk about this agreement for a moment. Is this an \nagreement I would have written? No. I would have changed a lot of \nprovisions here. It is a compromise. It is a bipartisan compromise. \nThere are things which many Republicans are proud of which I would not \nhave included. There are things which were not included but I think \nshould have been. But make no mistake, this is a good agreement. It is \ngood for this country. It is a good bipartisan compromise. It is one \nwhich not only reaches a balanced budget but says we are going to do it \nin a responsible way.\n  First, under the Republican Contract With America, which Speaker \nGingrich and many Republican Senators supported, we were to cut out of \nMedicare $270 billion over 7 years--a massive cutback in Medicare. They \nsaid it was necessary; you had to do it. And if you did not do it, \nMedicare was in peril. The American people knew better.\n  That $270 billion went way beyond what was necessary to strengthen \nMedicare. It created funds for a tax cut for wealthy people. And that \nwas not fair. The President stood up and said, ``I won't agree to it.'' \nWhen he threatened that veto, that particular proposal did not go \nforward. Where are we today?\n  The bipartisan compromise talks about a $115 billion cut over 5 years \nin Medicare and a guarantee to the American people that, for 10 years, \nMedicare will be solvent and strong. We have kept our word to the \nseniors in this country and those about to be seniors. They can rest \nassured that Medicare will be there. That is good. That is part of this \nagreement.\n  Medicaid. Medicaid is not just health insurance for poor people; it \nis health insurance for destitute elderly in nursing homes. That is \nwhere half the money in Medicaid goes. The elderly person in a nursing \nhome who has spent down and has not a single thing left on Earth turns \nto Medicaid to keep them alive.\n  The Republican proposal originally to cut Medicaid was $160 billion \nover 7 years. We said it was too much. The President said it was too \nmuch. In this agreement it is down to $15 billion. We have brought it \ndown to a manageable amount, one that will not endanger the health and \nsecurity of the disadvantaged and elderly.\n\n  Education. My colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, got up a few \nminutes ago and talked about all this massive Federal spending. Well, \nlet me tell you, America, families that get up every morning and wonder \nwhether they can pay for their kids' college education expenses, this \nbudget agreement will be a helping hand. We are going to allow you for \nthe first time to deduct college education expenses on your income tax. \nOh, it is still going to be expensive, but you are going to get a \nhelping hand for the first time.\n  And, students, listen up. Get good grades, go to school, and there is \na scholarship in here for you that will pay for most community colleges \nand some colleges and universities. Too good to be true? No. It is a \ncommitment by the President that is embodied in this budget agreement \nthat is good for this country.\n  Visit a couple with a new baby a couple days after the baby is born, \nand they are home and you go to visit them. You say, ``What a beautiful \nlittle baby. Looks just like his dad,'' or ``looks just like his mom. \nIs she sleeping at night? How is she taking her bottle?'' And then, \nafter a few minutes, ``Have you thought about how you're going to pay \nfor her college education?''\n  It is something we all think about. Next to our home mortgage, for \nmost families in this country, this is what you worry about. ``How am I \never going to put this money together?'' This bill will help. It will \nnot pay the whole thing, but it is going to help. It is responsive to \nthe real needs that American families feel.\n  Middle-class tax relief. Not only when it comes to education to help \nworking families pay for college and training expenses, but a child tax \ncredit of $500 per child. What does it mean? Well, my daughter and her \nhusband have a little baby boy, our grandson. We are so proud of him. \nHe is going to be a year old in a few weeks.\n  My wife and I did not think much about this when we raised our kids, \nbut my daughter and my son-in-law talk about day care. ``Dad, what are \nwe going to do about day care? It's expensive. We don't want to put \nAlex anywhere that isn't safe, quality day care. How are we going to \npay for it?'' They are lucky. They have two jobs, two incomes in their \nfamily. Some other families struggle with the same decision with fewer \nresources.\n  This child tax credit in here means a helping hand, $500 per child \nper year. It will not cover the cost of day care, but it will help. And \nshouldn't we help? Shouldn't we help working families? That is what \nthis is all about.\n  We are finally responding to the real issues that real people talk \nabout. I do not believe real American families sit around the family \nroom and say, ``What about campaign finance reform? What's going on \nwith the latest investigation in Washington?'' They do sit around and \ntalk about paying for college, paying for day care. This budget \nagreement will address it.\n  The battle is not finished. There is another one before us. I hope we \nenact this budget agreement. Then we will address a tax bill. I think \nyou are going to see some real differences in philosophy between \nDemocrats and Republicans about whether the tax savings in that bill go \nto working families or wealthy people. I think they should go to \nworking families.\n  I think we ought to, for example, give 100 percent deductibility of \nhealth insurance premiums for all self-employed people. All family \nfarmers, all small businesses, those who are self-employed, should have \nthe same benefits of hospitalization insurance deduction as the \ncorporations do.\n  So, for American families, this agreement is a step forward. The \nPresident's leadership, a bipartisan compromise, has us on the road to \na balanced budget in a responsible way.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts.)

Mr. President, I would like to talk about our efforts \nto eliminate problem disbursements at the Department of Defense [DOD].\n  Problem disbursements are payments that were not matched with \nobligations before the bills were paid.\n  As we have learned in recent years, the failure to follow this very \nelementary internal control procedure leaves the Pentagon's financial \naccounts vulnerable to theft and abuse.\n  It leads to underpayments, overpayments, erroneous payments, and even \nfraudulent payments.\n  It leads to overdisbursed accounts.\n  That is when payments exceed available appropriations.\n  When that happens, you have a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act. \nThat is a felony.\n  Right now, Mr. President, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service \n[DFAS] Center at Columbus, OH, has about 2,700 contracts that are \noverdisbursed.\n  Those contracts have negative cash balances of $900 million-plus.\n  In a nutshell, the Pentagon's financial books are in a shambles.\n  Mr. President, that's not the Senator from Iowa talking.\n  That's coming straight from the horse's mouth--the DOD inspector \ngeneral [IG] and the General Accounting Office [GAO].\n  That's what their audit reports say. They say: DOD's books are in \nsuch a mess that they can't be audited--as required by law--the Chief \nFinancial Officers Act of 1990.\n  When the auditors can't conduct an audit, they issue a ``disclamer of \nopinion.''\n  Well, guess what?\n  DOD gets one disclaimer after another--year after year. It's a \ndisgrace.\n  One way to clean up the books is to start matching disbursements with \nobligations before payments are made.\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\n  This is the stuff that's taught in basic accounting course 101 in \ncollege. It's square one, I know, but it's the right place to start.\n  And that's what the Senate has been telling DOD to do since 1994.\n  For 3 years now, we have been telling DOD to get on the stick and fix \nthe problem.\n  This was done with the leadership and support of my friend from \nAlaska Senator Stevens, and my friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye.\n  I thought we were really making progress--until I saw the new GAO \nreport.\n  That's a May 1997 report. It says DOD is underestimating the dollar \nvalue of problem-disbursements by at least $25 billion.\n  DOD says it's an $18 billion problem.\n  That means we're really staring at a $50 billion problem--or worse.\n  Why would DOD grossly underestimate the problem like this, Mr. \nPresident?\n  We're looking at a classic bureaucratic trick. Blowing smoke to \nconceal the problem: Redefining the problem to make it look smaller.\n  This makes the Senate think the problem is getting fixed.\n  They want the Senate to ease up on the pressure. That's the goal, Mr. \nPresident, reduce the pressure.\n  Unfortunately, with problem disbursements at the $45 to $50 billion \nlevel, we right about where we started in 1994.\n  So this is no time to ease up on the pressure.\n  The unwanted pressure is being generated by our legislative \ninitiatives.\n  We have gradually turned up the pressure in three successive \nappropriations bills as follows:\n  Fiscal year 1995 act--section 8137.\n  Fiscal year 1996 act--section 8102.\n  Fiscal year 1997 act--section 8106.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthose sections of the law.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nPUBLIC LAW 103-335--SEPT. 30, 1994\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n       Sec. 8137.

Mr. President, under the law, DOD was required to start \nmaking the matches on checks over $5 million, and then gradually \nratchet the thresholds down to zero.\n  At the $5-million level, DOD is really just scratching the surface.\n  DFAS/Columbus is where it happens.\n  DFAS/Columbus writes fewer than 1,800 checks per year that are $5 \nmillion or more. So what's the big deal? Matchups on 1,800 checks \nshould be a piece of cake.\n  But when it came time to start phase 2 and lower the threshold to the \n$1 million checks, DOD balked.\n  DOD said ``No''--even though it makes fewer than 11,250 payments over \n$1 million annually. DOD asked for more time.\n  Making the matchups on 11,250 checks ought to be Mickey Mouse stuff. \nBanks routinely do 500,000 to 1 million each day.\n  Mr. President, for 11,250 DOD checks versus up to 1 million checks \nfor U.S. banks and DOD can't do it.\n  Why can't the Pentagon do it--with all its technological know-how?\n  Mr. President, I can't help but think that, maybe, the Pentagon \nbureaucrats don't want to clean up the books.\n  They like the mess. That way no one knows what is really going on, \nincluding them, and no one gets in trouble.\n  Well, thanks to the committee's determined leadership last year, our \nlegislative reform effort is back on track. We regained some momentum.\n  DOD must now make matchups on all checks over $3 million, starting \nnext month--June 30.\n  At the same time, DOD is supposed to be developing a detailed plan \nfor moving first to the $1-million mark, and then on down to zero.\n  The IG is reviewing that plan right now and should be submitting an \nassessment to the committee soon.\n  After we study this report, we should be in a position to decide on \nhow to proceed in the fiscal year 1998 bill.\n  I would like to mention one disturbing new development.\n  I was recently provided with evidence--DOD documents--that clearly \nindicates that DOD is not on board 100 percent with our effort.\n  This material pertains to program payments made at the DFAS/Columbus \nCenter. It shows that DOD is using several random-allocation procedures \nfor matching payments with appropriated moneys.\n  This procedure subverts the appropriations process and is guaranteed \nto create more unmatched disbursements--big time--along with a host of \nother legal problems.\n  I will have more to say on this later, once I have all the facts.\n  This new information tells me that we will need to apply more \npressure to get the job done. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am fully aware that my colleague from \nMinnesota has made a motion to strike----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a moment for a housekeeping \nmatter?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Certainly.\n\n\n             unanimous-consent agreement--amendment no. 54\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 \ntoday there be 5 minutes of debate equally divided between Senator \nGrams and the ranking member, and at the expiration or yielding back of \nthe time, the Senate proceed to vote on the Grams amendment. That would \nmake the rollcall vote at approximately 2:20 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  May I inquire, is there any indication between you and Senator \nWellstone that we might have some timeframe on this?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will check and inform the chairman.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bill Pratt, \na fellow assigned to Senator Daschle, be given floor privileges during \nthe consideration of S. 672.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, momentarily, while we see what may or \nmay not be worked out with respect to the particular amendment----\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, may I ask consideration of my colleague to \ninterrupt for a procedural question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have a number of technical amendments and \nthings that I will need to insert, and I will need a brief time period \nsometime between now and lunch. I wondered if the distinguished \ncolleague from South Carolina would indicate if there is a time when I \nmay do that.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will be very brief.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S3983-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3985-S3986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SHAM BALANCING ACT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as some say, ``Eureka, I have found an \nhonest man.'' Well, here, I have found an honest journalist. I don't \nknow who wrote the editorial in USA Today on yesterday, but it is \nentitled ``Sham Balancing Act Hides True Scope of the Deficit.''\n  It is not my intent to come out and immediately take the so-called \nbalanced budget plan and trash it. It moves in the right direction. But \nI want to be constant and persistent until we finally have not just the \nUSA Today realize it has been a sham balancing act, but I want everyone \nto realize that it is in the law. Section 13301, signed by President \nBush on November 5, 1990, says that thou shalt not in this Government \nuse Social Security trust funds in any report of a so-called unified \nbudget or unified deficit. It is the most fraudulent use of the word \nunified because, to the lay person, unified suggests it is net. In \nother words, the Government spends money and it also receives receipts \nor receives money. And the inference is, with unified budgets and \ndeficits, that is the real net or true balance or true deficit. Totally \nfalse.\n  The truth of the matter is that we have been engaged in a sham now \nfor several years respecting the use of trust funds. Right to the \npoint, Mr. President, what we have is a list of these trust funds here \nthat have been consumed and spent, not just borrowed. I have the March \nfigures. As of the end of March--this is the most updated figure--\nSocial Security will be owed $582 billion; Medicare, HI, $122 billion; \nSMI, $31 billion, for a total of $153 billion in Medicare.\n  Military retirees the land around, you should know they are spending \nyour money, which has been set aside under the law for your retirement. \nThat particular fund is $129 billion shy because of this deceit. \nCivilian retirement--all civil servants within the sound of my voice, \nremember, the civil service retirement trust fund has now been spent to \nthe tune of $395 billion. Unemployment compensation that the small \nemployer in America pays in regularly, as well as the large ones, that \nis shy some $51 billion, that particular savings amount. The highway \ntrust fund--we borrowed that money, too, but not for highways. If \nanybody says a bridge is down, like in my backyard where we have been \ntrying to get a river bridge that has been declared unsafe for 20 years \nnow, that money is already spent to the tune of $22 billion. We can \nbuild a river bridge in each of the 50 States with the highway money \nused to obscure the size of the deficit, the debt, and the interest \ncost on that national debt. Airports and airways, $6 billion; railroad \nretirement, $18 billion; $63 billion in the Federal finance bank and \nthe other particular trust funds, for a total of how much? $1.419 \ntrillion. Now, we owe $1.419 trillion.\n\n  I have the updated figure just for Social Security as it relates to \nthis particular editorial. I ask unanimous consent that this editorial \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, May 5, 1997]\n\n           Sham Balancing Act Hides True Scope of the Deficit\n\n       Over exuberance isn't just a disease of the stock market. \n     Just consider the expansive praise surrounding last week's \n     budget deal between the White House and GOP congressional \n     leaders.\n       ``This balanced-budget plan is in balance with our values. \n     It will help prepare our people for a new century,'' \n     President Clinton declared of the five-year outline.\n       House Speaker Newt Gingrich was even more effusive: ``We \n     spent four months (with) people saying, `What are you going \n     to do? * * * Well, my answer is balance the budget, cut \n     taxes, reform entitlements.''\n       Not quite.\n       The deal, with $350 billion in spending reductions over \n     five years, is a modest step forward. But it is more a \n     product of good fortune than hard work.\n       The end of the Cold War has trimmed tens of billions from \n     defense needs. And a high-employment, low-inflation economy \n     has provided a $45 billion-a-year windfall in revenues.\n       Those factors alone have cut the budget balancers' work by \n     about a third.\n       But good fortune takes second place to the budget tricks \n     Clinton and Congress have performed and the blind eye they've \n     given entitlement problems.\n       The fact is that the balanced budget in 2002 won't be \n     balanced. Clinton and Congress avoided dealing with $450 \n     billion worth of overspending over the next five years by \n     simply counting surpluses borrowed from Social Security and \n     other federal trust funds as income. In 2002, they rely on \n     $100 billion borrowed from Social Security and other trust \n     funds that year.\n       Worse, Clinton and Congress put off meaningful entitlement \n     reform. The $23 billion a year in Medicare savings they \n     agreed to will keep its trust fund solvent only until 2008--\n     the year 76 million baby boomers begin flooding into \n     retirement. Ignored totally was Social Security's need for an \n     infusion of an extra $60 billion a year, starting now, to \n     keep it viable.\n       Instead, Clinton and Congress passed out tax goodies that \n     will sap $20 billion worth of revenue a year, with much of \n     the benefit going to the rich.\n       The budget deal has its high points. It will trim the \n     health-care bureaucracy and promote greater use of managed \n     care. It cuts back some wasteful corporate welfare even as it \n     invests more in a healthy start for kids that could provide \n     savings later.\n       But tax giveaways promise to balloon the deficit when good \n     economic times end, and lack of entitlement reform means the \n     toughest budget work lies ahead.\n       Last week's deal thus earns some polite applause but no \n     standing ovation.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is another $456 billion that will be \nspent. So as of the year 2002, we look around at Social Security and \neverybody is saying, wait a minute, the baby boomers are going to come \nin 15 years, and the baby boomers will be in a foot race trying to get \nahead of us politicians because we are way ahead of them spending this \nmoney. We will owe, in the year 2002, in excess of a trillion dollars. \nThat is why this chart has been brought forward. Last year, when we \nsaid the annual deficit was $107 billion, the truth of the matter is, \nit was $261 billion. We borrowed, in order to make it $107 billion, or \nwe spent from the various savings funds here at the Federal level, $154 \nbillion. Why not borrow another $107 billion and call it balanced? That \nis the gamesmanship that is going on.\n  I went home over the weekend and they found $225 billion over at CBO. \nI have heard that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were \ninformed of this revenue before the Democratic negotiators were. They \nwent back and forth with respect to OMB and CBO while knowing this \nextra money was available. You can see the gamesmanship involved. But \nthe hard-core fact is\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\nthat they have projected, up until now, $360 billion in interest costs \non the national debt. That is, while we are debating, we are increasing \nspending a billion dollars a day for absolutely nothing and adding it \nto the national debt. So that by the end of the 2002, the debt will \nexceed $6 trillion, and the interest costs on that will be in excess of \n$500 billion.\n  So what will occur is, at the end of this particular budget that we \nare all talking about as balanced, domestic spending, which is cut from \ncurrent policy, defense, which is cut from current policy, will be \nexceeded by the interest costs on the national debt. The whole time we \nare going through this charade, they said ``sham balancing act'' in \nthis particular editorial, they totally ignore section 13301 of the \nBudget Act and ignore the reality that we will have spent in excess of \n$2 trillion in trust funds when we get through.\n  Mr. President, what we really have is a disaster on our hands. While \nwe are talking about waiting for the baby boomers 15 years out, Social \nSecurity is paid for. The taxes are there. We have a surplus, \nsupposedly, of $581 billion. But that $581 billion is not in the desk \ndrawer; it is a little old IOU. We have a surplus in Medicare right \nthis minute, which they are talking about going broke; in Medicare we \nhave a $153 billion surplus. That is paid for. But they are all talking \nabout deficits. Why? Because we are spending it and using this \nsubterfuge of a unified budget, a unified deficit. Until we sober up \nfrom that, Mr. President, we are going down, down, down, adding to the \ndebt each year, adding then to the interest cost each year, and then \nadding to the automatic spending, the spending on automatic pilot at a \nbillion dollars a day. That is spending for absolutely nothing.\n  If we had been responsible--interest payments were only $75 billion \nwhen President Reagan came to town; we have added over $285 billion in \ninterest spending; that $285 billion is what all of the particular \nnegotiating since January has been about--we could have taken defense, \nresearch, technology, education, the environment, and all of these \nparticular needs.\n  Point: We are spending the trust fund money up here in Washington. We \nare telling the people we are not spending it. ``It is unified. Don't \nworry about it.'' And we are taking their savings fund and running away \nwith it. And whoever is going to be around here on the bridge to the \nnext century, remember. It is not going to be a bridge. We are going \nright straight over the cliff.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S3985-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3986-S3988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I extend my sincere thanks to the \ndistinguished colleague and fellow Budget Committee Member from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. President, as we begin the discussions today about the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations measure, I thought it would be very \nimportant to touch on some of the important issues in this bill that \nreflect the spending items in the budget of the VA-HUD Independent \nAgency Subcommittee on which I serve.\n  The full committee appropriations recommendation includes for the \nemergency supplemental $3.5 billion for disaster relief for the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, or FEMA. In the committee report we have \nrecommended $2.5 billion more than the President's request of $979 \nmillion. The amount recommended represents FEMA's current estimate of \nwhat is needed to meet the requirements of all disasters currently on \nthe books, and those disasters projected to occur in the balance of \nfiscal year 1997.\n  Approximately $1.1 billion of the funds provided are for disasters \nprojected to occur based on the 5-year historical average cost of \ndisaster relief.\n  The funds recommended, coupled with the $2 billion currently \navailable in FEMA's disaster relief fund, would enable FEMA to meet \nfully all of the fiscal year 1997 and prior year commitments. Certainly \nour hearts go out to the people of North Dakota, South Dakota, \nMinnesota, and other areas stricken by disasters this year. I join with \nothers in commending FEMA for the work that it has done to respond \nquickly to disasters. For those of us who live in States which have \nbeen struck by disasters, we sincerely appreciate the dedicated men and \nwomen of FEMA and their ability to respond quickly to those needs.\n  Having said that, I must notify my colleagues that FEMA's disaster \nrelief expenditures are out of control. The subcommittee has been \npaying the price time and time again for FEMA's largess. It is as if we \nhad a tanker truck that arrived to put out the fire. It puts out the \nfire but it leaves all of the valves open. So the water continues to \nspill out even after the fire is done, and that is what we are funding. \nWe are filling up a tanker truck that still has the valves open. I \ncommend the people for getting the truck there when the fire starts. \nBut we need to get a handle on how much continues to run out after the \nfire is put out.\n  In the past 2 years, including this legislation before us today, we \nhave cut almost $12 billion from other VA-HUD programs--principally \nlow-income housing--to pay for FEMA disaster relief. Yet we have \nlearned that these funds have gone to rebuild stadiums, golf courses, \nyacht harbors, and to replace fully, without any State cost share--\npartially damaged university hospitals, such as over $400 million in \nFederal repair costs by FEMA for the UCLA hospital because of the \nNorthridge earthquake. Let me make that point again. Mr. President, we \nhave spent $400 million in Federal repair costs for the UCLA hospital, \na very important facility, a revenue-generating facility, and one \nwhich, frankly, has a lot more reserves than the U.S. Government.\n  In the past 2 years, hundreds of millions of dollars have paid for \nsnow removal. There has not been a Federal disaster declaration for \nsnow removal since 1979. I think there is little accountability in the \nprogram, and entirely too much discretion to waste taxpayers' dollars.\n\n  I also point out to my colleagues that we wouldn't need a \nsupplemental for FEMA today if in 1996 the President's Chief of Staff \nhad not recommended a $1 billion rescission from FEMA during the \nnegotiations on the final bill last year. We knew these funds would be \nneeded, but instead, following the administration's recommendation, \nCongress rescinded these funds to pay for administration priorities in \nother areas.\n  Moreover, equally disturbing is that to offset these FEMA costs, as \nwell as an additional $100 million requested by the President for CDBG, \ncommunity development block grant emergency funding, the bill would \nrescind over $4 billion from the programs and activities within the \njurisdiction of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee, including $3.65 \nbillion from unobligated HUD section 8 contract reserves.\n  The rescission of $3.65 billion in unobligated section 8 contract \nreserves places the renewal of section 8 contracts for fiscal year 1998 \nin jeopardy. As the people at HUD know full well, the cost of section 8 \ncontracts will skyrocket over the next few years. In particular, the \nVA-HUD fiscal year 1997 Appropriations Act appropriated $3.6 billion to \ncover the cost of renewing expiring section 8 contracts for fiscal year \n1997. The costs of renewing all section 8 contracts for fiscal year \n1998, one year later, a total of $1.7 million expiring contracts, many \nof which are for the elderly and disabled, will require an \nappropriations of some $10.2 billion in budget authority for fiscal \nyear 1998. The cost of expiring section 8 contracts rises to $11.9 \nbillion in fiscal year 1999, $13.7 billion in fiscal year 2000; $15.l \nbillion in fiscal year 2001, and $16.4 billion in fiscal year 2002.\n  Just to go back, in the current year we had to find budget authority \nfor $3.6 billion. For the coming year, $10.2 billion, almost a \nthreefold increase, going up to $11.9 billion, up to $13.7 billion, up \nto $15.1 billion, up to $16.4 billion.\n  My colleagues will have a right to ask. Are we paying out that much \nmore because we have that many new section 8 contracts? The answer is \nno. The answer is no. The answer is that in the past we have provided \nmultiyear contracts for the section 8 program, 20-year contracts, and \nthey built in all of the budget authority--the commitment to spend--in \nprior years. Because of the\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nbudgetary constraints, we have been shortening those. I think the \ndirection from the Budget Committee is they want to get those down to 1 \nyear. That means that we have to pick up the budget authority--the \noverall obligation to spend the money--in each appropriations cycle.\n  We have begun these ongoing programs that have built up. We have been \nspending the money on the programs. But the budget authority was \nappropriated in prior years. All that budget authority has expired. So \nwe get almost a threefold increase in the budget authority required \nfrom the current year to that required for the next year just to keep \nthe same people in the same section 8 houses.\n  We have done a great deal through this subcommittee working with the \nauthorizing committee to reform HUD. Just recently HUD announced that \nthey were carrying forward a demonstration program to deal with some \nvery significant problems in excess subsidies for multifamily houses--\nthe market-to-market portfolio reengineering process. We are doing all \nof that. But just to maintain our commitments requires new authority.\n  I am very pleased that the budget agreement recognizes--the President \nand the leaders of Congress recognize--that additional budget authority \nand some outlays have to go into section 8. But given all of that, we \nare looking at these tremendous increases in the section 8 requirements \neach year in the budget.\n  Yet, suddenly HUD, abruptly on April 17, found that it had $5.8 \nbillion in unobligated and excess section 8 contract reserves. I think \nthat is a rather cynical act. They know that we are going to have to \nspend all of this money. Yet, they offered up the budget authority that \nwas in there already appropriated for them to fund FEMA obligations. \nWhen I met with Secretary Cuomo and his staff on March 12, they told me \nthere was probably less than $1 billion in section 8 reserves on hand. \nThe previous year, then Chief of Staff, Mr. Katz, testified that HUD \nestimated in fiscal year 1996 there was only about less than $.5 \nbillion in excess section 8 contracts reserves.\n  Nevertheless, on April 17 of this year, in the middle of supplemental \nappropriations, HUD wakes up and finds not only $3.5 billion in excess \nunobligated section 8 reserves but it indicates that it will revise its \nsection 8 contract reserve requirements so that there is in excess of \n$5.8 billion in unobligated reserves. It is a big jump from $460 \nmillion to $5.8 billion. That is a big problem, and, once again, it \nfocuses our intention on the questions about management of HUD, an \nagency which the General Accounting Office has in the past designated \nas a troubled agency, the only department in the U.S. Government to \nhave that dubious distinction.\n  The bottom line is that I still have little confidence in HUD's \nability to estimate the amount of excess section 8 contract reserves, \nor its ability to manage the programs.\n\n  I do know, however, that there is a vital need to fund the section 8 \nprogram next year; that 1.7 million families are depending upon the \nrenewal of section 8 contracts to preserve affordable and decent \nhousing, and many of these are elderly and disabled. For that reason, \nthe supplemental appropriations we are proposing would require HUD to \nrecapture all excess unobligated section 8 reserves and preserve these \nfunds in an account to help this committee fund the section 8 contract \nrenewals next year. That, I think, is critical, Mr. President.\n  I honestly do not know how much section 8 assistance is unobligated \nin section 8 contract reserves, and, unfortunately, I don't believe HUD \nknows. I know that some PHA's, public housing authorities, have section \n8 contract reserves and some don't. Mostly, I find it difficult to \nbelieve that HUD has audited 3,400 PHA's between March 12 and April 17 \nto determine, all of a sudden, that there was some $5.8 billion in \nexcess reserves.\n  I have been a defender of HUD and a defender of the role of the \nFederal Government as a provider of housing and community development \nassistance. Yet, my support has been justified on the belief that the \ndepartment is capable of reform and is capable of providing a \nmeaningful contribution to housing and the community development needs \nof the Nation.\n  I will not belabor these issues today other than to say that we are \nconfident that HUD has been shaken once again. We hope that the \nsecretary and his new management team, with the assistance he is \nbringing in from the outside, will be able to implement a fiscal \nmanagement system which will avoid these surprises and give the agency \nand the Congress some idea of how much is out there, what the \nobligations are, and how much we have built up.\n  I believe strongly that Federal commitment to section 8 housing must \nbe preserved. Renewing these section 8 contracts is an existing \ncommitment to low-income families in need of affordable, safe, secure \nhousing. But HUD has to be reformed. We cannot find surprises of found \nmoney as Congress takes on the serious task of reforming the budget.\n  Mr. President, I said that we would have some technical amendments \nthat we will offer before the 2:30 deadline. Those are currently being \nreviewed at the staff level. In consultation, we may be able to get an \nagreement on them. So I will not offer those at this moment. But we \nwill submit those amendments as soon as they are ready, and prior to \nthe 2:30 deadline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I express my thanks to my distinguished colleague from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 57\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I think the pending business is an \namendment by our distinguished colleague from Minnesota, Senator \nWellstone, to strike an amendment that was included in the markup of \nthe urgent supplemental at the Appropriations Committee level. I had \nthis included. I think others had it, too. But in my particular \ninstance, it was at the request of a constituent, Hoffman-La Roche, an \neminent drug manufacturer, in the city of Florence. They are \nconstructing a facility there now. We are very proud to have them. They \nare very responsible folks.\n  This particular issue was dealt with in full debate on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate last year by the distinguished Senator from Utah, who \ndealt with the matter of copyright and patent legislation as the \nchairman of our Judiciary Committee. What really occurred--it is sort \nof complicated, but what really occurred is there are two different \nrulings with respect to the longevity of a particular patent. Under the \nregular law, a patent is granted for 17 years from the date of the \nissuance of the patent. In the early 1980's, all patents in existence \nat that time were granted 2 extra years as recognition that the \napproval process was resulting in much shorter usable life for the \npatented drugs. In this case the approval process took 11 years. Along \ncame the GATT agreement. Trying to conform to the global competition \nand the global rule of 20-year patents, we passed a law which allowed a \ncompany to choose to operate under the current U.S. system or to \noperate a patent for 20 years from the date of the filing of the \npatent. The courts interpreted these two laws in a way that denied \nHoffman-La Roche this choice. I, as well as many Members of the Senate \nincluding the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, know \nthis ruling to be in contravention to the intent of the laws in \nquestion and this amendment simply sought to right this wrong.\n  The drug in question is Toradol. It is a remarkable drug. Of course, \nit is the pain killing drug with which you can retain total \nconsciousness, and it was administered to the President with his \nparticular knee operation. The patent is to expire on May 16, 1997. As \nyou can guess, the generic drug folks are interested whenever a patent \nexpires, and my intention was to address the generic drug problem. Many \na time the generic drug folks, along with consumer organizations, will \ncome and say, ``Oh, we can get it much cheaper.'' On that particular \npoint, there is no question. The question is to not only make profits, \nbut make enough for other reinvestments to make another miracle drug. \nSo, while I have worked and defended the generic movement in our \ncountry, from time to time on close study you can see that the \nmanufacturer himself has a cause and a case and it ought to be \ndefended. That was the intent in this particular amendment.\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\n  Right to the point, everybody wants to either vote or dispose and \nmove along with the underlying disaster supplemental measure rather \nthan this one particular manufacturer and this one particular drug. \nUnder the circumstances here on the floor, I have not been able to talk \nin caucus or to my colleagues about it. The fact is, I was told, when I \ncame in this morning, it was being worked out.\n  Specifically, while we had taken care, I understand, of the drug \nadministered orally with the generic drug folks and consumer groups \nthat called with respect to it, the drug taken intravenously had not \nbeen cleared with the generic groups. While we have gone to great \nlengths to solve all the problems with and get this amendment cleared, \nwe have not been able to do so. It was my hope that we could get the \nbest of both worlds and provide a remedy for a company hurt by a \nmisinterpretation of the law and also get generic competition onto the \nmarket faster than it would have without this amendment. That, I \nthought, was being worked out this morning, but I understand, now, the \nSenator from Minnesota has not agreed to that.\n  I will be prepared, under the circumstance here, to withdraw that \namendment and not cause the colleagues to vote. But I do not think, \ntechnically or parliamentarily, you can withdraw a section of a bill. \nSo I will be glad to go along with the Senator from Minnesota on a \nvoice vote and vote along with him at this particular time, to see if \nwe cannot get this straightened out.\n  The staff, floor and all, have been anxious. They are trying to move \nthis particular bill. I know Senator Stevens has been very anxious to \ndo it. I appreciated being included in the Appropriations Committee \nversion. I still think it is with absolute merit. But, under the \ncircumstance, now I am prepared to go along with the motion of the \nSenator from Minnesota to strike and we will come back in at the \nappropriate time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 67\n\n(Purpose: To make technical and clarifying changes to title II, chapter \n                             1 of the bill)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment to make \ntechnical and clarifying changes to title II, chapter 1 of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 67.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 9, line 25, strike ``, to remain available until \n     expended'' after ``ters,'' and insert ``, to remain available \n     until expended'' after ``$18,000,000''.\n       On page 11, line 25, after ``disasters'' insert ``subject \n     to a Presidential or Secretarial declaration''.\n       On page 11, strike all between the word ``similar'' on line \n     25 and the word ``to'' on line 26.\n       On page 12, line 4, strike ``the eligibility'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``gross income and payment limitations''.\n       On page 13, line 13, strike ``cropland'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``agricultural land''.\n       On page 13, line 13, strike ``cropland'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``agricultural land''.\n       On page 16, line 2, strike ``$3,000,000,'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$6,500,000''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment, as stated, makes \ntechnical and clarifying changes to the agriculture title to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. The changes have been approved by the \nranking Democrat on the committee, Mr. Bumpers, and the amendment has \nbeen cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 67) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nMinnesota is reserved 2 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we are going to be voting in a few minutes \non the Grams-Johnson amendment that will help complement disaster \nrelief efforts currently underway now in my home State of Minnesota, as \nwell as North and South Dakota, by making it easier for farmers, \nhomeowners, small businesses and local governments to help rebuild from \nthe devastation that has been brought on by the floods.\n  Our amendment, simply put, will permit Federal regulators to provide \ntemporary and targeted modifications to current banking regulations. It \nwill permit homeowners, farmers, and small businesses to have faster \naccess to a larger pool of credit. It will also help banks and credit \nunions to reopen their doors faster to serve their communities.\n  Also, Mr. President, the Grams-Johnson amendment is supported by the \nTreasury Department, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, \nand also the National Credit Union Administration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from NCUA in \nsupport of the amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             National Credit Union\n\n\n                                               Administration,\n\n                                      Alexandria, VA, May 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: Thank you for the opportunity to review \n     the Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act of 1997 (S. \n     652). I want to applaud you and Senator Tim Johnson for \n     introducing this disaster relief legislation and NCUA \n     supports its quick passage.\n       The legislation is similar to bills passed by Congress in \n     1992 (P.L. 102-485) and 1993 (P.L. 103-76) to address the \n     devastation wrought by natural disasters and make credit more \n     easily available to farmers, homeowners and others through \n     temporary exceptions in the Truth in Lending Act and \n     Expedited Funds Availability Act, among others. Just last \n     Friday, the NCUA Board took action to waive the requirement \n     that natural person credit unions and corporate credit unions \n     establish reserves on total loans of up to $50 million that \n     will be made to members in disaster areas. We believe this \n     policy change will enable credit unions to make loans at well \n     below market rate.\n       The NCUA Board's recent action and already announced policy \n     of postponing scheduled examinations, encouraging loans with \n     special terms as well as reduced documentation and \n     guaranteeing lines of credit through the National Credit \n     Union Share Insurance Fund and the Central Liquidity \n     Facility, dovetails your legislative efforts and hopefully \n     will provide a measure of relief to credit unions and their \n     members in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota affected \n     by the catastrophic flooding. Thank you again for the \n     opportunity to comment on S. 652.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Norman E. D'Amours,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the Grams-Johnson amendment has the\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\nsupport of the Senate Banking Committee chairman and ranking member.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator D'Amato, Senator Daschle, and \nSenator Bond be added as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, when I served in the House of \nRepresentatives, I authored similar legislation back in 1993 during the \nMississippi River flooding. My legislation then received bipartisan \nsupport. It was signed into law by President Clinton as part of the \nsupplemental appropriations bill for disaster relief. Since this \nlegislation worked well to help those flooded communities rebuild in \n1993, I urge my colleagues to support it today.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Grams and Senator Johnson. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor.\n   Mr. President, the Congress is moving swiftly to provide emergency \nassistance to the victims of the winter flooding in Minnesota, and \nNorth and South Dakota. The Supplemental is an appropriate and \ncompassionate response by the administration and the Congress to the \nsuffering of our fellow citizens.\n  Mr. President, this amendment addresses some of the important \nregulatory steps that can be taken to expedite overall efforts by \ncommunities, families, homeowners, farmers, and small businesses to \nrecover from the devastation of the floods. This amendment would \nauthorize the Federal financial regulators to make temporary exceptions \nto various Federal laws in order to maximize the availability of credit \nin these flood afflicted areas and expedite its delivery. The amendment \nwill complement measures already instituted by some of the regulators \nto deal with financial stress in the flooded area. For example, the \nFederal Reserve Board has indicated that it may be appropriate for \nlenders to ease credit terms and restructure debts in certain cases. It \nis similar to legislation approved by Congress in 1992 and 1993.\n   Mr. President, I commend Senator Grams and Senator Johnson for \ndeveloping this amendment and urge support for this helpful addition to \noverall flood relief efforts.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have previously been \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Minnesota has 25 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 57\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we have an agreement on the floor. Let \nme thank especially Senator Hollings from South Carolina for his \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, I want to give a little bit of context for this \namendment because I think it is important for people to know what has \nhappened and what had to happen. This is about Toradol, which is \nmanufactured by the Hoffman-La Roche Co.\n  By the way, I would like to thank the company. We had a very good \ndiscussion in my office yesterday with my staff. I appreciate their \ncoming by. I understand exactly what they have been trying to do.\n  Also, Mr. President, I want to make it clear that this went through \nthe process. This was an effort that many people thought was a worthy \none. So this is not a bashing on my part at all.\n  Mr. President, the problem is as follows: This drug is an anti-\ninflammatory drug; very important. It can be taken orally, or it can be \ninjected--very important--dealing with, for example, postoperative \npain. It is a very important medication for pain reduction. About two-\nthirds to 80 percent of the market was in the injectable form.\n  The effort in this supplemental appropriations bill was to go ahead \nwith a 14-month patent extension, which would have been for 14 months \nof market exclusivity for Toradol, this one drug. That means there \nwould have been only one drug available; no alternatives. There is \nevery reason to believe that, as a matter of fact, there is a generic \nalternative which would have been the same kind of assistance for \npeople but at much less cost.\n  Mr. President, when we were making some projections about this, we \nfelt that, on the basis of looking at the data, this would have been \nabout a $350 million cost for consumers. I felt as a Senator that the \none party that was left out of the negotiations was the consumer. I \ncould say with a twinkle in my eye, in many ways I have always tried to \nbe a Senator that pushes hard on the consumer end. While I think the \ncompany--I want to make this clear--Hoffman-La Roche Company has made \nsome important arguments about the delays in getting drug approval, \nabout some of the problems it had with GATT, and all of the rest, the \nfact of the matter is--this was my perspective, and this is the \nconsumers' perspective--a 14-month patent extension would have been \nmaybe $50 million to $60 million--maybe it was the injectable part, \ntwo-thirds of that--in additional cost passed on to consumers. I think \nwe ought to be doing our very best to make sure that we get this kind \nof medication to consumers in the most cost-effective way possible.\n  So, Mr. President, I think the only unfortunate part was--not the \nprocess; I think people worked hard, and they worked in good faith--but \nI don't think there was the representation for the consumers.\n  This amendment knocks out this patent extension. Senator Hollings \njoins me in this amendment. We agreed. I believe that Senators on both \nsides of the aisle are now comfortable with this agreement. This \namendment knocks out that patent extension. I think this is the right \nthing to do for consumers.\n\n  This was an amendment that I offered for consumers in Minnesota and \nconsumers in the country. I am very pleased that now, after some \nnegotiation and discussion, we have agreement on this on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I understand the position of the pharmaceutical companies in this \nparticular case. Again, I appreciate their work. But ultimately I think \nmy job is to represent not so much the pharmaceutical companies but the \nconsumers. On this point, I think there was divergent interest. I \nwanted to come down on the side of consumers. I am really pleased that \nSenator Hollings and other Senators have joined in this effort.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor. We can go further. I \nthink we can proceed.\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I apologize to the Chair. I had a discussion about \nfurther proceedings.\n  Which amendment did the Senator call up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 57 by the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Thank you, very much.\n  I now have a copy of it. It is my understanding that the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is not going to object to this at this time. I will not \noppose the amendment either. But I do want to say that, as a result of \nthe amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, there have been a \nseries of pharmaceutical groups that contacted us concerning the \ninequities of the long delay in the processing of Federal permits for \nthe pharmaceuticals in this country. I believe this is a matter that \nshould be taken care of in the legislative proposal, but, if it is not, \nwe will address it further this year in the Appropriations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The amendment (No. 57) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am informed that 110 amendments have been filed to \nthis bill. We have assigned task forces from the staffs of the various \nsubcommittees to review those amendments.\n  Mr. President, we will notify Members if we find amendments we would \nobject to. But I ask all Members to notify us when they would like to \ncall up their amendments. It is the leadership's hope that this bill \nwill be finished by tomorrow evening. Obviously, with 110 amendments, \nit is going to be a long night. But I would appreciate it if we could \nhave some idea of when those amendments would be called up. I am \nhopeful they will be called up soon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 143\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for dredging and snagging and clearing of the \n  Truckee and San Joaquin Rivers and the dredging of shoaling on the \n                              Chena River)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the clerk to lay before the Senate \namendment No. 143.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Reid, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 143.\n       On page 18, line 15, following ``fund:'' insert the \n     following: ``Provided, That the Secretary of the Army is \n     directed to use from available balances of the funds \n     appropriated herein to perform such emergency dredging and \n     snagging and clearing of the Truckee River, Nevada, and the \n     San Joaquin River channel, California, as the Secretary \n     determines to be necessary as the result of the January 1997 \n     flooding in Nevada and California; and dredging of shoaling \n     which has occurred downstream from the federal Chena River \n     Flood Control Facility:''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a direct use of funds that are \nalready available. There is no budgetary impact on it. It deals with \nissues that the corps has informed us it needs authority for in three \nStates. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have no objection on the Democratic \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Nevada.\n  The amendment (No. 143) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to state that this amendment is by \nthe Senator from Nevada that I called up. So it is not my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will be corrected to show that the \namendment just agreed to was offered by the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move that that motion be laid on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mr. \n     Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 171.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 50, strike line 15 and all that follows \n     through page 51 and insert the following:\n       The policy issued on February 19, 1997, by the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service implementing emergency \n     provisions of the Endangered Species Act and applying to 46 \n     California counties that were declared Federal disaster areas \n     shall apply to all counties nationwide heretofore or \n     hereafter declared Federal disaster areas at any time during \n     1997 and shall apply to repair activities on flood control \n     facilities in response to an imminent threat to human lives \n     and property and shall remain in effect until the Assistant \n     Secretary of the Army for Civil Works determines that 100 \n     percent of emergency repairs have been completed, but shall \n     not remain in effect later than December 31, 1998.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I seek to inquire whether the Senator would be willing \nto enter into a time agreement on his motion to strike?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I would. The ranking member of the committee wishes to \nspeak. Other than that, I had no requests for time.\n  What does the manager of the bill suggest?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am sure there are others interested in speaking. We \nhave 110 amendments pending, so I will try to seek a time agreement on \neach amendment. I will defer this for a few moments until others \ninvolved are here. I would like to enter into a time agreement to vote \non this amendment no later than 5:30, if possible.\n  Mr. REID. I will begin debate, I say to the distinguished chairman of \nthe full committee, and while I am doing this, you will have the \nCloakroom call to see how much time the ranking member and others wish \nto speak.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we will contact Members to talk about \nthat.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

Who seeks recognition?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 171\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the quorum call, and others matters \nthat have taken place in the last few minutes, I have had the \nopportunity to speak in some detail with the chairman of the \nEnvironmental and Public Works Committee. He indicates to me that in \nthe last little while serious negotiations have been undertaken with \nthe administration and others interested in this problem that is now \nbefore the Senate. As a result of that, the chairman of the committee \nfeels that this matter can be resolved. That being the case, I will at \nthis time indicate to the manager of the bill that I am not going to \nproceed further. I will leave my amendment pending with the \nanticipation that we can work something out. I hope so.\n  I also say to my friend that we will probably need an hour and a half \non this side if, in fact, we can't resolve this matter. But we can \nworry about that at some later time. That being the case, unless the \nmanager has something else----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret that we can't seem to get much \ngoing here. The administration now has the Endangered Species Act \namendment under review, the amendment pertaining to the sense of the \nSenate is under review, and the amendment pertaining to S. 2477 is \nunder review. I would like to find out what is going on down there in \nthat three-ring circus so we might get this bill going. I understand \nthe Senator wants an hour and a half, but we will have a cloture motion \ntomorrow, apparently. It will be this Senator's recommendation, if we \ncan't get this bill going, let's go out and then come back tomorrow and \nvote cloture. I was told I am trying to hold up this bill. I was told \nthat last week. We have been on the floor here for 2 days. I am \nperfectly willing to go ahead with amendments--amendments even to \nstrike provisions we put in the bill. We are not holding up this bill.\n  If we need a cloture motion to limit all debate, then I say the \nSenate should vote cloture tomorrow and do that. I am not addressing \nthis to my good friend from Nevada. I understand what he is doing. \nThere is a substantial possibility that it may be worked out with the \nadministration. But I am not sure the administration has the urgency we \nseem to want to have for this bill. Mr. President, my recommendation to \nthe leader is that if we don't get going here this afternoon, let's go \nout at 5 o'clock and come back tomorrow and get cloture. Then I know \namendments will be voted on in orderly sequence. If we don't get \ncloture, we will understand, and the people from the disaster area will \nunderstand who wants the bill and who doesn't. I am very disturbed \nabout this delay, as a matter of fact.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Alaska, that is why \nI am here. I wanted to move this thing along. Nevada is one of the 22 \nStates that benefits from this legislation. We had a very serious \nproblem around the first of the year with flooding. So I acknowledge \nthe seriousness of this.\n  I say to my friend from Alaska, if there were a cloture motion filed, \nI would vote to invoke cloture. I think that we do have to move this \nthing along, and that is the reason I am here. But with my having \nspoken to the chairman of the full committee, I think it is appropriate \nthat I give him every opportunity he can to see if something can be \nworked out.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield, I meant no inference to the \nSenator from Nevada. He has been most cooperative. We just adopted his \namendment by a voice vote because he was so cooperative in working out \nthe terms of that amendment. I am sure we can go forward with his \npresentation now. But, clearly, without regard to the two of us on the \nfloor now, the delays are taking place off the floor. I think it is \ntime that we get the word out that we are just not going to sit around \nall day waiting for people to come to the floor. We still have the \nprerogative of going to third reading and cutting off all amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could respond, I haven't managed nearly \nthe number of bills that my friend from Alaska has, but I have managed \nsome bills, being a member of the Appropriations Committee and in other \nresponsibilities I have had. I acknowledge that there are very few \nthings in life more frustrating than being here, having a lot of work \nto do, and nobody shows up here. So I understand the feelings of the \nmanager of this bill, the chairman of the full Appropriations \nCommittee. This is important legislation. If we can't resolve this \nendangered species matter, let's bring it up, vote on it and get on to \nsomething else.\n  Having said that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my colleague on the Appropriations \nCommittee, the Senator from Nevada, was on the floor just a few moments \nago to discuss a provision on an amendment that the chairman and other \nmembers of the committee helped me place in this supplemental \nappropriations that really is a critical issue when it comes to dealing \nwith flooded areas and flood victims, and the rebuilding of structures \nas it relates to floods along many of the rivers of our country.\n  What we are finding out in Idaho is that, in certain instances, it is \nvery difficult to rebuild the levy to once again provide that critical \nbarrier between the human species and his or her property and an \nendangered species, in this instance because agencies simply can't \nagree. And, as a result, we go into these extended periods of \nconsultation when the flood waters may be rising again, and the dike or \nthe levy simply doesn't get built because there is not the opportunity, \nvis-a-vis the Endangered Species Act, to act immediately and quickly \nand responsibly to deal with these issues. We have found that in Idaho.\n  I think the folks in North Dakota and the folks along the Ohio are \ngoing to be finding that out very quickly now as the flood waters \nrecede and they begin to look at rebuilding along the rivers and making \nsome of the corrections necessary, and doing so in a quick and timely \nfashion, in this instance potentially preparing for an additional \nrunoff. That has happened in Idaho because we have had early floods in \nthe first week of January. Several of my counties were subject to the \n100-year flood. My hometown of Midvale was under 4 feet of water. Those \ncommunities and the Federal agencies responded very quickly to build \nback those levies immediately, and were able to do so in almost all \ninstances. But in St. Mary's, ID, where a flood occurred in 1996 in the \nwinter in February, here we had actual construction of a levy stopped \nby the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service because they said that EPA and \nthe community failed to respond to the Endangered Species Act.\n  It is also interesting that in the delta area of California, Senators \nfrom California asked the Assistant Secretary of Interior to waive \ncertain provisions so that citizens in that area could respond \nimmediately, and, of course, that was done. The frustration often comes \nthen when the agencies then step in after the fact and require very, \nvery expensive and extremely costly mitigation. For example, in the \narea of St. Mary's, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is suggesting \nmaybe $100,000 worth of mitigation, maybe 30-plus additional acres of \nhabitat needing to be replaced, even though in all instances there \nappeared to be adequate habitat in the area.\n  My provision in this bill, that the Senator from Nevada speaks of and \nis attempting to strike, covers only natural disasters and threats to \npublic safety that occurred in 1996 and 1997. It eliminates the lengthy \nand unnecessary delay to flood control efforts. It is designed to allow \nFederal agencies and local communities to respond to human safety, to \nprotect human life and to protect private property, and to protect \nthose as the first line of defense in a flood and in the aftermath of a \nflood.\n  Eligible flood control projects are not required to consult prior to \nemergency efforts. In other words, the Senator from Nevada was \nreferring to a\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\nprovision that the House committee put in which said that, if it were a \ndeclared disaster--what I am suggesting is that, if the water is rising \nat an unprecedented rate and the local community and the flood control \ndistrict think they needed to add another foot to the top of the levy, \nthey can do so because it is an impending emergency. Right now it is \nimpossible to do that, if by doing so they might damage habitat, or \nsomething that a Federal agency would declare to be a threatened \nhabitat, or I should say a habitat that was threatened--obviously, an \nendangered species. What we are talking about is the ability to respond \nquickly. That is why this provision that I am talking about is in the \nbill.\n  My colleague, Senator Kempthorne, has for the last good number of \nyears worked overtime to try to produce a responsive reauthorization of \nthe Endangered Species Act. He continues to do that. We are consulting \nnow on adjustments and changes in this provision in the supplemental. \nMy staff has met with John Chafee's staff and Senator Kempthorne's \nstaff to try to work out these differences so that we can have this \nkind of timely response. It is critically necessary.\n  I cannot believe that the Senate of the United States would not say \nthat human life and private property at a time of impending emergency \nor at the time of the declaration of emergency should not be protected \nand responded to in a timely fashion, and not to have to worry about an \nagency coming in afterwards, and saying, ``Well, now you are going to \nhave to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate.'' \nCommunities will respond. They will want to assure that that habitat is \nsound. But, first and foremost, they ought to have the right that they \nhave always had in this country to protect themselves and their \nproperty. I don't care. The area in North Dakota ought to have that \nright. They ought not have to call Washington, DC, and the Fish and \nWildlife Service, and say, ``What may we do? We have private property \nand homes to protect, and we are going to ask you to spend 48 hours a \nweek deciding what we may or may not do.'' That kind of time does not \nhappen in an emergency environment.\n\n  I would also look at eligible flood control projects and allow them \nto perform restructuring and operation and maintenance directly related \nto the natural disasters or an imminent safety threat. That is what we \nare talking about here.\n  I will work, as we have. We spent yesterday and most of today with \nthe chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and the \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Kempthorne, my colleague, to see if we \ncan resolve this issue in the best interests. Certainly, I want to work \nwith the Senator from Nevada on this issue to resolve it. But we are \nnot going to create loopholes, nor are we going to let Federal agencies \nstand in the way of timely response to the private citizens and their \nneed for protection of their person and their property. That is clearly \nthe intent of the provision that is within the supplemental at this \ntime. I cannot accept changes in that unless they have as their initial \npremise that very kind of thing. We just do not need to get at the \nbusiness of a lengthy process here. That comes and always will come at \na time when we can approach it much differently than the declared \nemergency, or the impending emergency that comes with the crisis.\n  We have so hamstrung the citizens of our country by laws that simply \ndisallow them the right to protect themselves and to respond in a \ntimely way. It is amazing to me--that very incident, in my opinion, \nthat happened in the north end of my State in the last couple of \nmonths, as we knew we were headed into a runoff season of the year when \nthat river and those dikes needed to be completed and, yet, we really \nsaw a ho-hum attitude on the part of the agencies and a shutdown of \noperations that resulted in the dike not being prepared in a timely \nway.\n  That is the intent. Mr. President, we are working to resolve this \nissue. I hope we can do so. But for the time being, the language that \nis in the bill is important language and it meets the need that many in \nthe House wanted, and that, obviously, many in the Senate believe are \nnecessary also.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 56, As Modified\n\n (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of Defense to enter into a lease \nof property for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service at Lexington \n                Blue Grass Station, Lexington, Kentucky)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, yesterday we adopted an amendment that \nwas presented by the Senators from Kentucky, Senators Ford and \nMcConnell.\n  Last evening that amendment was reviewed by the Department of \nDefense, and they have asked for one very technical correction. We have \nan understanding with them. It has been agreed to on both sides.\n  I send the modified amendment to the desk, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order to present this amendment to be a \nsubstitute for the amendment that was adopted yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Ford and Mr. \n     McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered 56, as modified.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 9, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 108. AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSE TO ENTER INTO \n                   LEASE OF BUILDING NO. 1, LEXINGTON BLUE GRASS \n                   STATION, LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of Defense may enter into an agreement \n     for the lease of Building No. 1, Lexington Blue Grass \n     Station, Lexington, Kentucky, and any real property \n     associated with the building, for purposes of the use of the \n     building by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. The \n     agreement shall meet the requirements of this section.\n       (b) Terms.--(1) The agreement under this section shall \n     provide for a lease term of not to exceed 50 years, but may \n     provide for one or more options to renew or extend the term \n     of the lease.\n       (2) The agreement shall include a provision specifying \n     that, if the Secretary ceases to require the leased building \n     for purposes of the use of the building by the Defense \n     Finance and Accounting Service before the expiration of the \n     term of the lease (including any extension or renewal of the \n     term under an opinion provided for in paragraph (1)), the \n     remainder of the lease term may, upon the approval of the \n     lessor of the building, be satisfied by the Secretary or \n     another department or agency of the Federal Government \n     (including a military department) for another purpose similar \n     to such purpose.\n       (c) Consideration.--(1) The agreement under this section \n     may not require rental payments by the United States under \n     the lease under the agreement.\n       (2) The Secretary or other lessee, if any, under subsection \n     (b)(2) shall be responsible under the agreement for payment \n     of any utilities associated with the lease of the building \n     covered by the agreement and for maintenance and repair of \n     the building.\n       (d) Improvement.--The agreement under this section may \n     provide for the improvement of the building covered by the \n     agreement by the Secretary or other lessee, if any, under \n     subsection (b)(2).\n       (e) Limitation on Certain Activities.--The Secretary may \n     not pay the costs of any utilities, maintenance and repair, \n     or improvements under this lease under this section in any \n     fiscal year unless funds are appropriated or otherwise made \n     available for the Department of Defense for such payment in \n     such fiscal year.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this really deletes a provision, as I \nsaid, ``notwithstanding any other provision of law.'' It was \ntechnically not necessary, and the department did not wish that to be \npermanent law.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 56), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I have another amendment. It is a \ntechnical correction to the 1997 Veterans Administration and Housing \nand Urban Development appropriations bill as it relates to EPA State \nand tribal assistance grant account.\n  The language in this amendment ensures that should the EPA be \nrequired to take over a State environmental program grant, funds \notherwise provided to the State would be available to EPA for \nadministering the program.\n  This language represents no change in policy or procedure, and is \ndeemed by the committee to be a technical amendment to existing law. It \nis an amendment presented in behalf of the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Mr. Bond.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] for Mr. Bond, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 173.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The funds appropriated in Public Law 104-204 to the \n     Environmental Protection Agency under the State and Tribal \n     Assistance Grants Account for grants to states and federally \n     recognized tribes for multi-media or single media pollution \n     prevention, control and abatement and related activities, \n     $674,207,000, may also be used for the direct implementation \n     by the Federal government of a program required by law in the \n     absence of an acceptable State or tribal program.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 173) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I have another amendment which I shall \nsend to the desk. It authorizes the EPA to make grants from funds \npreviously appropriated for an EPA lab in Bay City, MI, all but 11 of \nwhich were rescinded in 1995, to the city of Bay City for environmental \nremediation after all claims are settled from the funds that are \navailable.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] for Mr. Bond, for \n     himself, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Abraham, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 174.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In Title III, Chapter 10, add the following new section.\n       Sec.   . After the period for filing claims pursuant to the \n     Uniform Relocation Act is closed, and from amounts previously \n     appropriated for the Center for Ecology Research and Training \n     (CERT), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall \n     obligate the maximum amount of funds necessary to settle all \n     outstanding CERT-related claims against it. To the extent \n     that unobligated balances remain from such amounts previously \n     appropriated, EPA is authorized beginning in fiscal year 1997 \n     to make grants of such funds to the City of Bay City, \n     Michigan, for the purpose of EPA-approved environmental \n     remediation and rehabilitation of publicly owned real \n     property included in the boundaries of the CERT project.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a technical amendment but does \nmake available to the city of Bay City for environmental remediation \nthe funds remaining available in the grant that was previously made.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Levin to \nintroduce an amendment which will help close the door on the canceled \nCenter for Ecology Research and Training [CERT], and end a difficult \nchapter for the city of Bay City, MI.\n  In the late 1980's, the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] was \nworking to develop a new laboratory to study land and marine \necosystems. After much consideration, Bay City, MI, was ultimately \nchosen as the location for this facility, and Congress appropriated \nover $100 million for the center's construction.\n  EPA, however, moved slowly on the CERT construction. After 5 years, \nonly a small portion of the appropriated funds had been spent. Thus, \nCERT was still a long way from realization and became an easy target \nwhen the fiscal year 1996 rescission was considered. After considerable \ncongressional debate, the project was canceled and almost all the \nremaining funds were rescinded.\n  Today, approximately $5.2 million of the already appropriated funds \nremain. These moneys are set aside for the EPA to settle CERT-related \nclaims. In addition, as part of the arrangement to settle claims, EPA \nverbally agreed to direct the moneys remaining after all claims have \nbeen settled to the city of Bay City in the form of environmental \ngrants. At present, however, there is no language which directs EPA to \ncarry out this pledge, and if EPA is not given explicit direction, it \nwill likely reprogram the funds. This language is needed, therefore, to \ninstruct the EPA as to how the remaining funds will be spent.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Levin and me will permit Bay City to \nclean and restore the area to a level acceptable to the Michigan \nDepartment of Environmental Quality. Mr. President, this legislation is \nvery important to Bay City. The loss of CERT was a great blow to the \ncity. Bay City needs to heal the wound that is this promised but \nunfinished facility. It is my hope that this legislation will bring \nclosure to this unfortunate affair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 174) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider and I move the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, those were amendments that were \npreviously filed in the 110 that were filed for cloture. We have \ncleared those. We will clear amendments as they are brought to us if \nthey are technical in nature, but those should be deleted from the \namendments eligible for consideration after cloture.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I stated before that if we did not have a \nsubstantive amendment before the Senate before 5 o'clock, we would go \ninto a period for morning business. After consultation with the leader, \nI announce that we will go into a period of morning business in just a \nfew minutes. It will be the intention of the leadership to have a \ncloture vote at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow. We will proceed to see how we can \nmove forward with this bill at that time.\n  It will be the policy of the leadership, and I support this policy, \nto not wait any longer for these amendments. There are too many side \nconferences going on, Mr. President, and there is no reason to wait all \nnight for the possibility that we may have an amendment cleared for \naction this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S3991-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3993-S3994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

ERNEST TOMASI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this year, the Sunday Rutland \nHerald and Sunday Times Argus had an article about a fellow Montpelier \nneighbor, Dr. Ernest Tomasi. Dr. Tomasi was named the distinguished \ncitizen of the year by the Montpelier Rotary Club.\n  Madam President, I have known Dr. Tomasi my whole life. And my \nparents knew him even before I did. He is a remarkable man, and \nprobably one of the last examples of a country doctor, even though he \nhas always practiced in our capital city.\n  Dr. Tomasi, a man very proud of his Italian heritage, as was my late \nmother, was one who would make sure that everybody who needed a \nphysician received that physician's care.\n  So many times people would come to him telling him that they could \nnot afford a doctor's care but needed a doctor's care. They always got \nit. It would be remarkable if somebody were able to tally up all the \npeople of central Vermont who were cared for by him but never received \na bill because they could not pay for it.\n  I also think of the number of times as a youngster seeing him going \nout making house calls, and then even in later years, even after I \nbecame a U.S. Senator, seeing Dr. Tomasi with his battered bag heading \noff for house calls.\n  It was my privilege to see him in 1994, when he went back for the \n50th anniversary of D-Day. He had landed on Normandy as a young medic \nand, as he said, was one of the only ones who went ashore without guns. \nHe also tells some pretty horrific stories of what happened to the \npeople who were landing. It was a mark of his bravery that even though \nhe earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and a \nPresidential Citation, this was never a part of his conversation, and \nonly reluctantly did he go back for the 50th anniversary.\n  My wife and I had a chance to talk with him on different occasions \nwhile he was there. He was one of the brave, brave people President \nClinton and General Shalikashvili and others referred to at that \ncelebration.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the article ``Longtime \nDoctor Named Rotary's Citizen Of Year'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Longtime Doctor Named Rotary's Citizen of Year\n\n                           (By Art Edelstein)\n\n       Dr. Ernest Tomasi's medical office on Barre Street could \n     well be the setting for a Norman Rockwell painting: The suite \n     of rooms does not sparkle in medicinal white, there are no \n     secretaries behind glass partitions, and the examining tables \n     are from a bygone era.\n       But Tomasi can be forgiven the lack of high technology. Now \n     semi-retired, he has practiced medicine locally for 50 years, \n     delivering at least 1,000 babies. Along the way, he raised \n     six of his own children, treated many patients without taking \n     a fee and contributed to innumerable volunteer efforts.\n       His career has not gone unnoticed. Earlier this month, \n     Tomasi received the Montpelier Rotary Club's Distinguished \n     Citizen of the Year award for his many years of service to \n     the community.\n       Tomasi, who turns 83 at the end of February, is a cheery \n     man who doesn't boast about his formidable medical career and \n     his years in the armed services.\n       ``I think the fact that he has continued to practice \n     medicine and is an old-style doctor interested in his \n     patients first made him a great candidate,'' said Rotary \n     President Roderic Sherman. ``He is an outstanding example of \n     good deeds.''\n       ``He has been providing services to anyone needing medical \n     help for 50 years,'' said David Pinkham, who chaired the \n     selection committee. ``Dr. Tomasi provides services for \n     barter, or free. He is an example of somebody doing something \n     for others.''\n       A Montpelier native, Tomasi graduated from St. Michael's \n     high school on Barre Street, and from the University of \n     Vermont medical school in 1942. After interning for a year in \n     Waterbury, Conn., where he met his wife, he joined the U.S. \n     Army.\n       Tomasi doesn't like to talk much about his role as a member \n     of the D-Day invasion force that landed on the Normandy coast \n     of France on June 6, 1944. He said his team of medics were \n     brave men. ``They were the only ones who went ashore without \n     guns,'' he said.\n       Tomasi earned the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart \n     and the Presidential Citation.\n       Tomasi travelled back to France to celebrate the 50th \n     anniversary of D-Day in 1994. The trip, paid for by his \n     colleagues at the Central Vermont Hospital, brought back \n     painful memories of his war years. ``It was so horrible. I \n     saw a lot of soldiers die,'' he said.\n       ``I didn't want to go back to Omaha Beach; there were too \n     many bad memories.''\n       But there were some better memories of his tour of duty in \n     Europe that he can smile about. In 1944, after the Allies \n     began defeating the Germans, Tomasi and his unit liberated \n     the first town on the German border near the Elbe River. \n     There he delivered a baby girl. Years later he received a \n     letter from that child when she became an adult.\n       ``He doesn't talk much, especially about his trip to Europe \n     in 1994,'' said his wife of 50 years, Barbara Tomasi. ``He \n     landed and all these boys around him were killed. Going back \n     to the beach and cemetery were emotional.''\n       While the war was an unpleasant experience, Tomasi did not \n     shirk his responsibilities to his fellow veterans. He has \n     been an active member of the American Legion and Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars and has served as the Post doctor for 30 years.\n       After the war, Tomasi returned to Montpelier to practice \n     medicine. He has witnessed many changes in the medical \n     profession in his half-century of practice.\n       ``It's all changing too fast,'' he said. ``I wish I could \n     live long enough to see how it comes out.''\n       A surgeon, he no longer performs operations but continues \n     to assist in them.\n       Tomasi began scaling back on his practice in 1994. Before \n     then, his wife said, he kept a grueling schedule.\n       ``He would work from 8 in the morning until 11 or midnight \n     with a supper break,'' she said. ``He did this until three \n     years ago when he cut back on patients. He still makes \n     occasional house calls.''\n       Adera White, a friend and former nurse, said Tomasi is a \n     special doctor.\n       ``Through medicine, he's done much. He would treat people \n     and not get paid; for years he never sent bills to any of his \n     patients,'' she said. ``Whoever felt they could pay, paid \n     him. He wasn't in it for the money, that's for sure.''\n       While Tomasi said he is thinking about retiring from \n     medicine, his wife doubts he will quit his life's work.\n       ``This is the only thing he has; he is devoted to his \n     patients,'' she said. ``He loves sports, but never had any \n     hobbies. * * * I don't think he will ever retire.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S3994-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3994-S3995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO WALTER ``PEANUT'' KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Walter ``Peanut'' Kennedy, the late Speaker \nof the House of Representatives came from the district of Chelsea, VT. \nThey used a version of Vermont's old mountain rule. In a local form, \nmountain rule came from the town's unwritten agreement that State \nrepresentatives alternate between the sides of the mountain that \ndivided the town at every biennial election. It was about as good a \nreason for term limits as many I have heard argued on this floor in \nrecent years.\n  It followed the real mountain rule in Vermont which alternated \nGovernors from one side of the Green Mountains to the other side. Madam \nPresident, the Governor would come from the eastern side of the \nmountains in one election cycle and then from the western side in the \nnext. Of course, they were all Republicans so it worked out very well \nthroughout those years.\n  Since the town was overwhelmingly Republican and the candidate from \neither side of the mountain could not hope to succeed under any other \nparty preference--the tradition more or less held until reapportionment \nof the legislature along the one man-one vote decision of the U.S. \nSupreme Court changed the nature of Vermont's system forever.\n  I preface my remarks today with this brief history so that you can \nappreciate the background from which this rough hewn, shrewd, humorous, \nand eminently fair gentleman rose to become a legislator, Speaker of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\nHouse, and his party's candidate for Governor in 1974.\n  With Peanut Kennedy's passing, we close the book on a period in \nVermont when character, common sense, and honesty were alone sufficient \nto insure personal triumph and political success.\n  Peanut sold used cars--and they weren't all good cars. He would tell \nhis customers--especially enthusiastic young farm boys who were making \ntheir first major purchase with hard earned money--to look beyond the \nflashy chrome and white wall tires. If necessary, he would further curb \ntheir enthusiasm by suggesting the vehicle had an estimated lifespan of \nthe distance to the grocery store a half mile down the road.\n  Those were cars he kept on the lot only to have the pleasure of \nselling them to folks like you and me who could afford a lesson in the \nperils of used car negotiations.\n  ``You don't want this car,'' he would finally tell a local customer \nand move him toward another part of the lot.\n  Peanut, rising to the chairmanship of the House Highway Committee, \nthen Speaker and finally rewarded as his party's gubernatorial \ncandidate, was rarely addressed as Walter. He retained his earthy sense \nof humor and Yankee mannerisms, offensive to the few--loved by the \nmany. He was an antecedent of political correctness--fixed in his ways, \ncolorful in his language, and prone to startle constituents, \nlegislators, Governors and lobbyists with the frankness of his \nresponses.\n  He hated ad hoc committees which he said were merely ways for \npolitical leaders to transfer decision malting responsibility to \nanother body.\n  ``Ad hoc,'' he once challenged a leader of his own party on the House \nfloor, ``Sounds like someone clearing his throat.''\n  He once publicly described a Governor, who was concerned over a \nprolonged and politically debilitating debate over enacting his \nproposal for a sales tax as ``nervous as a whore in church,'' over the \nprospects of passing his legislation. Kennedy never doubted the tax \nwould be enacted, once the talking was over and the nervous legislators \nregained their courage to an unpopular, but necessary broad based tax \nto finance State government programs.\n  He was never a man to go off the record, he was never a man to go \nagainst his word.\n  When he ran for Governor in 1974 he traveled through southern Vermont \nextensively for the first time in years and became aware of the change \ntaking place as a result of a revolution in transportation systems--\nmany of which he had helped put in motion himself from Montpelier.\n  I think it was the first time he realized that Vermont was changing \nso dramatically from the community or farms and small, self-governing \ncommunities that settled problems at town meetings and pot luck \nsuppers.\n  ``It's not Vermont anymore,'' he told friends. The visit seemed to \ninhibit his candidacy and he failed to give Vermont a spirited campaign \nagainst a popular incumbent.\n  I traveled with Peanut Kennedy when he ran for Governor in 1974, and \nis probably an indication of the bipartisan nature of the man. Even \nthough he was running for Governor on the Republican ticket, I for the \nSenate on the Democratic ticket, we would have occasions just because \nwe wanted to be in each other's company that we would ride together \nfrom one function to another.\n  He had his big old black Imperial. I would hop in the car with him. \nSomebody would drive my car along behind. And I would be laughing so \nhard by the time I would get to the next place, I could barely remember \nmy own lines as he would tell one story after another.\n  At home, with his wife Sylvia, he was a very private man and devoted \nhusband. Vermonters shared his grief over the tragic death of his son \nin a fire. After the election in 1973, Kennedy returned to his business \nand quietly retired from the political arena which had taken him so \nfar. But the State had changed and Peanut's beliefs and principles were \ntoo deeply ingrained.\n  Out State has lost a great public servant, and to those of us \nfortunate enough to have known him a great friend as well.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

I just want to express my appreciation to those \nthat are sponsoring this resolution. It is a bipartisan resolution. \nSenator Coverdell has been the lead Republican on this issue. Madam \nPresident, he is the lead sponsor on this because in his State there is \na very courageous man, a man named Jerry Weyrauch. Jerry is leading a \nnational effort in this country to draw attention to this issue. He is \ndoing it after having gone through the trauma of losing his daughter by \nsuicide.\n  Suicide is something that affects many people. As indicated, 31,000 \npeople a year kill themselves in this country. In my Senate office here \nin Washington, about 2 months ago, during a period of 4 weeks, three of \nmy employees had relatives that killed themselves. One was an 11-year-\nold boy that hanged himself.\n  Suicide is something we have learned can be avoided. I became vocal \nabout suicide after having participated in a hearing before the Senate \nAging Committee last year. Mike Wallace, a person those of us in \nGovernment hate to get a call from, appeared before our Aging \nCommittee. The hearing was on senior depression. Mike Wallace, in my \nopinion, Madam President, showed a lot of courage when he came before \nour\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\ncommittee and acknowledged--this very articulate TV personality \nappeared before our committee with a lot of humility--there were times \nin his life when he felt like he wanted to die, he was so depressed. \nThe message he gave our committee was that there was no reason for him \nto feel this way. With a little bit of counseling and some medication, \nhis life was changed.\n  It was at that hearing that I said to myself, and I indicated \npublicly, that it was time I acknowledged the fact that my father \nkilled himself. It was something our family was embarrassed about, \nmaybe even a little ashamed about. But with Mike Wallace talking the \nway he did, I thought it was something I should be more vocal about, \nand try to prevent others from going through the trauma that my family \nwent through.\n  So, at that hearing, I said to the now Secretary of Defense, then \nChairman Cohen, that I thought it would be a good idea if we held a \nhearing on senior suicide. We did. It was a remarkable hearing. We \nlearned it is a problem. We learned, of course, with that hearing \ncentering on senior suicide, what a tremendous problem it is across \nthis country, especially in Nevada. Nevada leads the Nation in suicide \nand is twice--two times--the average for senior suicide. Nevada has a \nreal problem.\n  We came to learn in that hearing that suicide cuts across all ages, \nit cuts across all economic lines, all social and economic boundaries. \nMore people die from suicide in the United States than from homicide. \nThat says a lot because there are tens of thousands of people, about \n24,000 people a year in this country, who are murdered.\n  On an average day in this country, almost 2,000 adults attempt \nsuicide. For young people, ages 15 to 24, suicide is the third leading \ncause of death, only behind unintentional injury and homicide. In 1992, \nmore teenagers and young adults died from suicide than died from \ncancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, \ninfluenza, and chronic lung disease combined. We can take all of the \npeople age 15 to 24 who died from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth \ndefects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and lung disease, and they do \nnot equal the number of young people that killed themselves. Suicide is \nthe eighth leading cause of death in the United States.\n\n  One of the things we have learned in these hearings, Madam President, \nis we do not know the cause of suicide. Why are the 10 leading States \nin the Nation all Western States? We do not know why. We need to know \nwhy. Why do males commit suicide, at rates and numbers for suicides, \nfour times more than females?\n  Elderly adults have rates of suicide more than 50 percent higher than \nthe Nation as a whole. We also know that seniors are much more adept at \nkilling themselves. We know a youngster is not very good. About every 1 \nin 200 who attempts suicide is able to be successful; yet, 1 in 4 \nseniors are successful. Suicide is preventable.\n  As I indicated, we learned from the Mike Wallace hearing that a \nlittle bit of counseling and a little bit of medication is all that is \nneeded. Most suicidal persons desperately want to live; they are just \nunable to see alternatives to their problems. Understanding and \nidentifying the risk factors for this phenomenon and evaluating \npotential suicide prevention interventions must become a public health \npriority. So we must do something about this preventable public health \ntragedy. It is irresponsible and insensitive to allow victims and \nfamilies to suffer in silence or to nationally hide our heads in the \nsand.\n\n  Those of us who have had experience with suicide wonder, is there \nmore we could have done? Why did he do it? Why did she do it? But I \nthink the important thing is to recognize the progress that has been \nmade. It wasn't long ago, Madam President, that someone that committed \nsuicide could not be buried in a public cemetery. They simply would not \nallow it. There were many religious boundaries that the family of \nsomeone that committed suicide could not go beyond. Things are changing \nfor the better. They will become better, and this resolution is really \nan outstanding step in that direction.\n  I have acknowledged Senator Coverdell and I appreciate his support, \nalong with the two Senators from Louisiana, Breaux and Landrieu, \nSenator Murray, and Senator Wellstone, those who have cosponsored this \nlegislation. The lead person in the House of Representatives is John \nLewis from Georgia. I am grateful to him for taking the lead in this.\n  But the most important thing we can do is not be insensitive. Again, \nit is irresponsible and insensitive to allow families and victims to \nsuffer in silence or to nationally hide our heads in the sand and \npretend it doesn't exist. We have to acknowledge the problem and we \nneed to take the critical first step in doing something about it.\n  Today the Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network--the organization Jerry \nWeyrauch formulated, sponsored and pushed--delivered over 20,000 signed \npetitions from 47 States calling for the action that was accomplished \nhere today. It is time to lift the veil of secrecy and begin the effort \nto heal the wounds and take the steps to prevent unnecessary loss of \nlife. It is time to continue the effort for mental health parity and to \nensure that all those who need assistance get the assistance they need, \nwithout stigma.\n  The resolution I offered today, I hope, will be the first step in \nfocusing awareness on the need for suicide prevention and addressing \nthe need for a national strategy. No life should be lost when there is \nan opportunity to prevent its loss.\n  Not one of the nearly 31,000 lives lost to suicide annually is \ninsignificant. These are the children, parents, grandparents, brothers, \nsisters, friends, coworkers, and neighbors of each and every one of us. \nThere are some things, I repeat, that we don't know. We have multiple \nsuicides in families--families that appear to be the normal families. \nWe have fathers committing suicide and sons committing suicide. We need \nto know more about this. Few of us can say we don't know someone who \nhas been touched personally by this tragedy.\n  In addition to this legislation, I am going to continue to offer \nlegislation which will be vital in taking necessary steps by calling \nfor the establishment of injury control research centers, which will \ndeal exclusively with the subject of suicide. We need a focal point \nwhere we can develop expertise on suicide, both of seniors and of \nchildren, and share this expertise with others interested in getting \ninvolved.\n  I also intend to ask the National Institutes of Health to conduct \nresearch into the treatment of clinical depression and suicide \ngenerally.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to Members on both sides of the \naisle for supporting this resolution. It will be, I believe, the first \nstep in acknowledging suicide as a national problem.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement from the \nAmerican Association of Suicidology and the American Psychological \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                            American Psychological Association\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of over 150,000 members and \n     affiliates of the American Psychological Association (APA), I \n     am writing to express support and appreciation to you and \n     Senators Murray, Wellstone and Coverdell for the introduction \n     of a Senate resolution recognizing suicide as a national \n     problem.\n       The APA shares your concern that suicide rates among the \n     elderly, adolescents, and young adults have increased \n     dramatically in recent years. Since the 1950s, suicide rates \n     among youth have nearly tripled. Between 1980 and 1990, the \n     suicide rate increased by 30% in the 10 to 19 year-old age \n     group. For older Americans over 65, the suicide rate \n     increased nine percent between 1980 and 1992. Elderly \n     Americans make up about 13 percent of the country's \n     population, but account for about 20 percent of all suicides.\n       Although the reasons for this sharp increase are unclear, \n     depression, living longer with chronic illness, and \n     increasing social isolation of the elderly may play a role in \n     the growing numbers of elderly Americans who take their own \n     lives. In addition, alcohol abuse and substance abuse can \n     dramatically raise the suicide risk, especially among youth. \n     Alcohol and drugs, separately or in combination, are potent \n     disinhibiting agents that foster impulsive and dangerous \n     acts.\n       As the suicide rate can clearly be reduced and as mental \n     and behavioral disorders which lead to suicide are \n     increasingly treatable, the APA strongly supports the \n     resolution and recommends funding for additional\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\n     research, demonstration, evaluation, and intervention \n     projects to reduce the rate of youth and elderly suicide.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                     Raymond D. Fowler, Ph.D.,\n\n                                      Executive Vice President and\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                          American Association of Suicidology,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, 5 May, 1997.\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: I am writing on behalf of the American \n     Association of Suicidology in support of your thoughtful, \n     timely, and compassionate resolution recognizing suicide as a \n     national problem and suicide prevention a national priority.\n       For too long we in America have suffered from the imported \n     burden of stigmatizing both those who are suicidal and those \n     affected by suicidal deaths. Suicides are often wrongly \n     considered to be volitional deaths; this in spite of the fact \n     that they are motivated by mental disorders and irrational \n     thinking. Until we better educate our population to what we \n     know about suicide and make a more concerted effort to \n     prevent these tragic, premature, and often preventable \n     deaths, we will continue to needlessly devastate thousands of \n     newly bereaved family members, friends, and colleagues \n     annually. Moreover, we can seriously impact the associated \n     cost and burden of suicide to the American economy which is \n     estimated to run into the tens of billions of dollars each \n     year.\n       The operative word here is needless. We need not suffer \n     these losses. We can make a difference.\n       Your resolution has long been needed and represents the \n     type of initiative Congress can make for the public health of \n     our nation. We applaud your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Alan L. Berman, Ph.D.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S3995-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a valued \nmember of the Vermont community, and a true friend, John W. ``Jack'' \nBarry, who passed away last Sunday at the age of 70. I had the pleasure \nof working with Jack for over 20 years as he hosted numerous radio and \ntelevision shows in Vermont. He was a consummate professional with an \namazing knack for the interview. When I was on the other side of Jack's \nmike, I felt as though we were just chatting--kind of catching up on \nwhat I'd been up to in Washington. I wouldn't want to give any of my \ncolleagues the impression that Jack didn't ask the tough questions \nbecause he did. He asked many of them but he passed no judgment on the \nanswers.\n  Although some would say that Jack began his illustrious career in \n1948 as a radio show host at WJOY in Burlington, it actually started at \nthe age of 4 when ``Little Jackie Barry'' performed recitations for his \nhometown radio station, WDEV of Waterbury. Over the years Jack worked \nfor numerous radio stations in Vermont and around the Nation, and \nserved for 2 years as Press Secretary for U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy. \nIn the early 1970's he joined the State's public television station to \nmoderate a wide array of programs to include, ``Vermont this Week'', \n``Vermont Report'' and ``Call the Governor''. During the last 3 years, \nJack served in public office as a State senator from Chittenden County.\n  Among his many honors, Jack was named Vermont's Sportscaster of the \nYear in 1972, elected to the Vermont Association of Broadcasters' Hall \nof Fame, selected as the Rutland Herald's Vermonter of the Year in 1991 \nand 1995, as well as being chosen to receive the Vermont Association of \nBroadcasting Award in 1981.\n  True to his nature, Jack took the time to give back to the community \nby serving as a board member and trustee of several organizations to \ninclude the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, the Vermont Special \nOlympics, the United Way and the national board of the American Heart \nAssociation among many others.\n  I extend my most sincere condolences to his wife Bunny, his three \ndaughters; Kathy Yagley, Maureen Ravely, and Bridget Barry Caswell as \nwell as the entire Barry family. Jack had the deepest feelings for \nVermont and its people. He was always respectful of others and their \ndiffering beliefs. It didn't matter whether they were the frequent \ncallers on his radio show or constituents from Chittenden County, he \ncalled them by name, heard them out and genuinely thanked them for \nexpressing their views.\n  Jack Barry exemplified what we should all strive to achieve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S3997-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S3997-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY CAUSED BY THE LAPSE OF THE EXPORT \n     ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1979--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 33\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 204 of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)) and section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report on the national emergency declared by Executive Order \n12924 of August 19, 1994, to deal with the threat to the national \nsecurity, foreign policy, and economy of the United States caused by \nthe lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nprogram of providing information and education to the public on the \nprevention and treatment of eating disorders; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n       THE EATING DISORDERS INFORMATION AND EDUCATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Eating Disorders \nInformation and Education Act of 1997. This legislation would establish \na program, as part of the Public Health Service Act, to provide \ninformation and education to the public on the prevention and treatment \nof eating disorders. Eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia \nnervosa, and binge eating disorders. Further, my bill would provide for \nthe operation of toll-free telephone communications to provide \ninformation to the public on eating disorders. Such communications \nshall be available on a 24-hour, 7-day basis.\n  Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and compulsive overeating are all \nserious emotional problems that can have life-threatening consequences. \nAn eating disorder refers to a set of distorted eating habits, weight \nmanagement practices, and attitudes about weight and body shape. \nFurther, it is these distorted eating related attitudes and behaviors \nthat result in loss of self-control, obsession, anxiety, guilt, and \nother forms of misery, alienation from self and others, and \nphysiological imbalances which are potentially life threatening.\n  Anorexia nervosa is an intense and irrational fear of body fat and \nweight gain, a determination to become thinner and thinner, and a \nmisperception of body weight and shape to the extent that the person \nmay feel or see themselves as fat, even when emaciation is clear to \nothers. These psychological characteristics contribute to drastic \nweight loss and defiant refusal to maintain a healthy weight for height \nand age. Food, calories, weight, and weight management dominate the \nperson's life.\n  Bulimia nervosa is characterized by self-perpetuating and self-\ndefeating cycles of binge eating and purging. During a binge, the \nperson consumes a large amount of food in a rapid, automatic, and \nhelpless fashion. This may anesthetize hunger, anger, and other \nfeelings, but it eventually creates physical discomfort and anxiety \nabout weight gain. Thus, the person purges the food eaten, usually by \ninducing vomiting and by resorting to some combination of restrictive \ndieting, excessive exercising, laxatives, and diuretics.\n  Eating disorders arise from a combination of longstanding \npsychological, interpersonal, and social conditions. Feelings of \ninadequacy, depression, anxiety, and loneliness, as well as troubled \nfamily and personal relationships may contribute to the development of \nan eating disorder. Our culture, with its unrelenting idealization of \nthinness and the perfect body, is often a contributing factor. Once \nstarted, eating disorders become self-perpetuating.\n  The Federal Government has taken a role in research into eating \ndisorders. The National Institutes of Health [NIH] is sponsoring \nresearch to determine the causes of anorexia, the best methods of \ntreatment, and ways to identify who might have a high risk of \ndeveloping the disorder. Further, NIH, through its Division of \nResearcher Resources, supports 10 general clinical research centers \nthroughout the country\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\nin which anorexia research is underway.\n  Researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health are studying \nthe biological aspects and changes in brain chemistry which may control \nappetite. Although psychological or environmental factors may \nprecipitate the onset of the illness, the study indicates that it may \nbe prolonged by starvation-induced changes in body processes.\n  Althouth research into eating disorders is established and \ncontinuing, we need to provide help for those already trapped in the \ncycle of an eating disorder. That is why I offer my legislation today, \nto provide a resource to people who need help.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 698. A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nauthorize the Secretary of Energy, by lease or otherwise, to store in \nunderutilized strategic petroleum reserve facilities petroleum products \nowned by foreign governments or their representatives, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           the strategic petroleum reserve replenishment act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, today I am introducing the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve Replenishment Act, a bill to purchase oil for the \nstrategic petroleum reserve using revenue obtained from leasing SPR \nstorage capacity. Senators Bingaman and Landrieu join me in sponsoring \nthis measure.\n\n  The strategic petroleum reserve is the cornerstone of U.S. energy \nsecurity. During an oil emergency, the SPR is America's insurance \npolicy against oil price shocks and economic disruption.\n  However, our insurance policy is not providing the level of coverage \nwe need. Because of declining U.S. oil production our dependence on \nimports is dangerously high, and the situation will grow worse in the \ncoming decade. According to the Energy Information Administration, U.S. \ndependence on oil imports will rise from the current level of 50 \npercent to 60 percent in the year 2010. As oil imports increase, the \nstrategic petroleum reserve will provide less and less energy security.\n  The logical response should be to stockpile more oil. Yet, exactly \nthe opposite is occurring. Some $315 million in revenue from the \nOperation Desert Storm drawdown was diverted to pay operating expenses \nrather than purchase replacement oil. Annual purchases of crude for the \nSPR have been halted, and we have begun to sell oil from the reserve as \na deficit reduction measure. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997, the \nDepartment of Energy sold $450 million barrels of oil for this purpose. \nCongress and the administration share the blame for the sale of these \nstrategic assets.\n\n  The most alarming development of all, however, was last week's \nannouncement by the Department of Energy that it is seeking public \ncomment on the future of the strategic petroleum reserve. The first \nquestion on the DOE comment notice was ``Should the United States \ncontinue to maintain the SPR?'' That's like asking whether the Titanic \nshould carry life boats. The strategic petroleum reserve provides an \nessential umbrella of energy security and the importance of this asset \nwill increase as we become more dependent on oil imports.\n  Like many Federal programs, the strategic petroleum reserve has \nbecome a victim of the balanced budget process. Congress and the \nadministration are unable to muster the political will, or the scarce \nFederal dollars, to maintain or expand our emergency reserve.\n  My colleagues and I on the Energy Committee have proposed a modest \ninitiative to purchase new oil for the reserve. The bill we have \nintroduced today would finance the purchase of oil for the SPR using \nrevenue obtained from the lease of excess SPR storage capacity.\n  With its current inventory, the SPR has more than 100 million barrels \nof available, but unused storage. A number of foreign governments have \nexpressed interest in storing oil in the U.S. reserve to meet \nInternational Energy Agency responsibilities. Storing oil in our gulf \ncoast facility would be far less expensive for these countries than \nconstructing new storage capacity. The cost of constructing new \ncapacity exceeds $15 per barrel, whereas the annual operating cost at \nSPR facilities is less than 50 cents per barrel. All of the revenue \ngenerated from such leases would be dedicated to the purchase of crude \noil for the U.S. reserve.\n  During consideration of last year's reconciliation bill, the Senate \nadopted a proposal I offered that was nearly identical to the \nlegislation I have introduced today. The Clinton administration has a \nmixed response to this proposal. They support legislation giving DOE \nthe authority to lease idle SPR capacity to foreign governments, but \nthey have reservations about dedicating leasing revenue for the \npurchase of new oil.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is an essential first step \ntoward a more rational energy security policy. As the Senate Energy \nCommittee considers the reauthorization of the strategic petroleum \nreserve, I will work with my colleagues on the committee to ensure that \nthis measure is included as an amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 698\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     Replenishment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LEASE OF EXCESS STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE CAPACITY.\n\n       Part B of title I of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 6231 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 168. UNDERUTILIZED FACILITIES.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 649(b) of the \n     Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7259(b)) and \n     any other provision of this title, the Secretary, by lease or \n     otherwise, for any term and under such other conditions as \n     the Secretary considers necessary, may store in an \n     underutilized Strategic Petroleum Reserve facility a \n     petroleum product owned by a foreign government or its \n     representative.\n       ``(b) Exclusion From Reserve; Export.--A petroleum product \n     stored under subsection (a)--\n       ``(1) is not part of the Reserve;\n       ``(2) is not subject to part C; and\n       ``(3) may be exported from the United States.\n       ``(c) Use of Funds.--Funds resulting from the leasing or \n     other use of a Reserve facility under subsection (a) shall be \n     available to the Secretary, without further appropriation, \n     for the purchase of petroleum products for the Reserve.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 699. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on Diiodomethly-p-\ntolylsulfone; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               temporary duty-free treatment legislation\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that \nwould temporarily suspend, through the year 2000, the rate of duty \napplicable to imports of Diiodomenthyl-p-tolylsulfone, commonly \nreferred to as ``DMTS.'' Commercially, DMTS is known by the brand name \nAMICAL 48. It is a fungicide/mildewcide that is used in caulks, \nadhesives, plastics, textiles, and for other purposes. The preservative \nis of indisputable benefit to a host of industries engaged in the \nproduction, storage, and use of products subject to microbial \ndegradation.\n  The current rate of duty on DMTS is 10.7 percent ad valorem. Under \nthe Uruguay Round, this rate is scheduled to decrease by 0.6 percent \nper year until 2004, when it will reach and remain at 6.5 percent. The \nproposed legislation would provide for duty-free treatment of imports \nof DMTS from the date of enactment through the last day of the year \n2000, and it is estimated that if this legislation is enacted, the \nreduction in duty collection will be a de minimis amount of about \n$250,000 to $350,000 per year.\n  Furthermore, because there is no substitute domestic product \ncurrently benefiting from the present rate of duty on DMTS, no adverse \nimpact on the domestic preservatives industry is anticipated. It may \nalso be that such a temporary suspension in the rate of duty will \nresult in savings being passed along to the consumers of AMICAL 48. I \ntherefore urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 700. A bill to provide States with greater flexibility in setting \nprovider\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\nreimbursement rates under the Medicaid Program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n           legislation to repeal certain medicaid provisions\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nrepeal the provider reimbursement requirements of the Boren amendment. \nThis bill will provide States with greater flexibility in setting \nprovider reimbursement rates under the Medicaid Program.\n  Under current law, States may set Medicaid payment rates at whatever \nlevel they choose for home and community-based services, but they must \nmeet a minimum standard for nursing home and hospital reimbursement. \nThis standard is prescribed by the Boren amendment, which requires that \nproviders be reimbursed under rates the State ``finds and makes \nassurances satisfactory to the Secretary are reasonable and adequate to \nmeet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically \noperated facilities in order to provide care and services in conformity \nwith applicable State and Federal laws, regulations and quality and \nsafety standards.''\n  Although the law was designed to relax previous standards and \nincrease flexibility, unfortunately the opposite has resulted. The use \nof vague and undefined terms in the amendment created \nproblems, compounded by the Federal Government's decision not to issue \nregulations defining these terms. To add further confusion, the law, \nwhile requiring reimbursement rates to be ``determined in accordance \nwith methods and standards developed by the State,'' also requires the \nFederal Government to be satisfied with the State-determined rates. \nImplementing this requirement means State Medicaid plans must include \nboth State processes for determining rates and the rates themselves, \nwhich are then subject to approval by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices.\n\n  Moreover, beyond this federally imposed regulatory nightmare we've \ncreated for the States, many States, including Texas, have had to deal \nwith substantial litigation resulting from the vagueness of the \nstatutory language and lack of regulatory definitions. Some courts have \nviewed the Boren amendment as a cost-based payment standard in which \nall cost incurred by the providers must be reimbursed. In these \ninstances, States may be liable for significant sums to cover the \nretroactive rate increases ordered by the court for the group of \nproviders involved in the suit, even if their rate schedule was \napproved by the Federal Government. In some cases, the additional \npayments made as a result of a court-ordered retroactive rate increase \nare not eligible for cost-sharing from the Federal Government.\n  For example, in 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \nfound that the State of Louisiana Medicaid agency's findings on \n``reasonable and adequate'' compensation for hospitals were inadequate, \ndespite HCFA's approval of the State plan. In New York, the State's \n``minimum utilization adjustment'' decreased reimbursement for \npsychiatric hospitals that operated at less than 75 percent capacity as \na means to encourage ``efficiency and economy.'' In another New York \ncase, however, despite recognizing the many strong policy reasons \nbehind the adjustments, the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York determined the State did not meet the procedural \nrequirements of the Boren amendment. The decision not only has resulted \nin unjustified reimbursement increases for under-used facilities, but \nhas also tied up the State in continuing litigation over retroactive \ndamages.\n  Returning to the States the flexibility to negotiate Medicaid \nreimbursement rates would allow them to avoid or mitigate large \nincreases in spending because of such suits, and follow the example of \nprivate-sector purchasers of health care services by selectively \ncontracting with hospitals and nursing homes on a competitive basis. \nCalifornia's Selective Provider Contracting Program [SPCP] is a good \nexample of the economic benefits of this type of program. Because of \nrapid increases in inpatient hospital costs and a budget shortfall, \nCalifornia passed legislation in 1982 allowing its Medicaid Program \n[Medi-Cal] to negotiate contracts with providers. SPCP contains the \noverall expenditures for hospital services reimbursed by the Med-Cal \nProgram and assures adequate access to quality services for \nbeneficiaries through a competitive, rather than a regulatory process. \nThe process saves California an estimated $300 million per year. \nIllinois had a similar program for several years and saved an estimated \n$100 million annually, but it was discontinued following a change in \nadministrations and a switch to a different system of reimbursement. \nThe average Medicaid cost per day in Illinois has since risen \nsubstantially.\n  Both California and Illinois officials have been pleased with the \nhigh quality of care under this type of system. In addition to relying \non strict regulations already in place for hospitals, both States \nindependently audit hospitals for quality of care. Illinois contracted \nfor a 2-year period, which meant that hospitals had to compete often to \nwin contracts while maintaining quality standards.\n  Mr. President, programs such as those in California and Illinois \nexemplify the efficiency and innovation offered within our Federal \nsystem. It is time to give other States free rein to experiment with \nsimilar programs, thus creating a more cost-effective and higher \nquality Medicaid system for their beneficiaries. I hope all my \ncolleagues will join me in cosponsoring this legislation to take a \nsignificant step in the direction of true Medicaid reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Helms, Mr. D'Amato, \n        and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 701. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide protections for Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in Medicare \nmanaged care plans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n           the medicare patient choice and access act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer bipartisan \nlegislation to provide Medicare beneficiaries with the necessary tools \nand protections they need to choose the right health plan under the \nMedicare program for their individual health care needs. The bill I am \nintroducing today, with my Democratic colleague, Senator Conrad, whom I \nhave had the pleasure to work with on many issues, is entitled the \nMedicare Patient Choice and Access Act of 1997. I am also joined by my \nRepublican colleagues, Senator D'Amato and Senator Helms, and my \nDemocratic colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. Similar legislation \nhas been introduced in the House by Representatives Coburn and Brown. \nRepresentative Coburn's bill currently has 91 cosponsors and has strong \nbipartisan support.\n  The bill I am sponsoring accomplishes a number of important \nobjectives for Medicare beneficiaries and for the success of the \nMedicare program. We often talk about providing more choices of health \nplans for Medicare recipients, but we rarely discuss what they need to \nmake the right choice. As Congress examines ways to encourage more \noptions for Medicare beneficiaries through the growth of managed care, \nit is critical that there is a trusting relationship between Medicare \nenrollees and their health plans. Medicare is a Federal program. \nTherefore, it is our job to ensure that health plans participating in \nthe Medicare program provide quality care to our Nation's elderly. \nMedicare recipients look to Congress to hold health plans accountable. \nThe legislation I am introducing will encourage plans to compete based \non the quality of care they provide and will give beneficiaries the \nnecessary information they need make an informed choice.\n  The bill includes the following provisions: Provides beneficiaries \nwith standardized consumer-friendly charts to compare health plans in \ntheir area (information such as disenrollment rates and appeals denied \nand reversed by plans are included in these charts); ensures that \nbeneficiaries will receive fair treatment when health plans deny care \nby establishing a uniform and timely appeals process for managed care \nplans participating in Medicare; creates an atmosphere of trust between \nbeneficiaries and their providers by prohibiting the use of gag clauses \nwhich restrict communications between providers and their patients; \nprovides beneficiaries with the assurance that their health care \nprovider\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\nwill refer to specialists, when medically necessary, by expanding \nMedicare's restriction on the use of financial incentives in managed \ncare to include not just physicians but all providers; given patients, \nespecially those individuals who require specialized care, the \nassurance they will be able to see a specialist, as medically \nnecessary, when they are enrolled in a managed care plan; and offers \nbeneficiaries more choices by guaranteeing they will have the option, \nat the time of enrollment, to select a plan with coverage for out-of-\nnetwork services (point-of-service plans are the fastest growing health \nplans in the private sector).\n\n  Many of the provisions in this bill are supported by research \nconducted by the General Accounting Office [GAO] and the Institute of \nMedicine [IOM]. In the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I \nchair, we recently held a hearing on the importance of detailed health \nplan information in holding health plans accountable and improving the \nquality of care delivered. We heard from large health care purchasers \nsuch as the California Public Employees Retirement System [CalPERS] and \nXerox Corp. on ways Congress could improve the Medicare program by \nproviding comparative, standardized, information on participating \nhealth plans. We heard from the GAO and the IOM about ways the Health \nCare Financing Administration could be more cost-efficient by requiring \nthat health plans standardize their information. These witnesses \nhighlighted the costliness of high disenrollment rates among health \nplans and how rates are significantly reduced when beneficiaries are \ngiven accurate and detailed comparative information on available health \nplans.\n  Most importantly, we heard from a recent Medicare beneficiary and a \nrepresentative of a Medicare Insurance Counseling Assistance program on \nthe lack of reliable, comparative information under the current \nMedicare program. The consistent theme from all these witnesses was the \nimportance of trust between Medicare beneficiaries and their health \nplans. This trust in the program does not exist today, particularly in \nareas experiencing a rapid growth in managed care. However, by enacting \nthe bill I am offering today which includes several incremental changes \nto the Medicare program, Congress can help to establish trust and \nrebuild confidence among our Nation's seniors in the Medicare program.\n  Many of the provisions in this bill are strengthening current law or \nproviding beneficiaries protection in statute in addition to \nregulation. I believe it is the responsibility of Congress and \nadministration to ensure that our Nation's elderly are getting quality, \ncost-effective care under the Medicare program. I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to join me and Senator Conrad in cosponsoring \nthis very important bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a summary and full text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 701\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Patient Choice and \n     Access Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There should be no unreasonable barriers or impediments \n     to the ability of individuals enrolled in health care plans \n     to obtain appropriate specialized medical services.\n       (2) The patient's first point of contact in a health care \n     plan must be encouraged to make all appropriate medical \n     referrals and should not be constrained financially from \n     making such referrals.\n       (3) Some health care plans may impede timely access to \n     specialty care.\n       (4) Some contracts between health care plans and providers \n     may contain provisions which impede the provider in informing \n     the patient of the full range of treatment options.\n       (5) Patients cannot make appropriate health care decisions \n     without access to all relevant information relating to those \n     decisions.\n       (6) Restrictions on the ability of health care providers to \n     provide full disclosure of all relevant information to \n     patients making health care decisions violate the principles \n     of informed consent and the ethical standards of the health \n     care professions.

There is growing concern, however, that as \n     more and more beneficiaries (currently 4.9 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries with enrollment growth averaging 30% annually) \n     enroll in managed care greater protections must be in place \n     to ensure quality and access to care for seniors.\n       The bill would require the following:\n       Comparative Health Plan Information: Expands the consumer \n     information that health plans must provide to beneficiaries \n     under current law. Provides beneficiaries with standardized \n     consumer-friendly charts to compare health plans. Requires \n     the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to include \n     disenrollment data, which will contribute to greater \n     competition among health plans. HCFA currently collects this \n     data, but does not distribute it to beneficiaries.\n       Expedited Appeals Process: Provides an expedited appeals \n     procedure, consistent with new regulations, and a 30 day \n     resolution for grievances and appeals of health plan \n     enrollees. Preserves current law allowing beneficiaries to \n     appeal to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services.\n       Prohibition of Gag Clauses: Prohibits gag rules, using the \n     managed care industry's definition of ``medical \n     communication.'' This is an expansion of HCFA's current \n     regulation banning the use of gag clauses regarding treatment \n     options.\n       Expansion of Restrictions on Financial Incentives: Expands \n     the current Federal law which places certain restrictions on \n     the use of financial incentives to manage care from applying \n     to physicians only to covering all providers.\n       Point-of-Service Option: Expands choice of health plans by \n     guaranteeing enrollees the option of choosing a point-of-\n     service plan at the time they enroll in a Medicare managed \n     care plan.\n       Timely and Appropriate Access to Specialists: Gives \n     enrollees the assurance they will be able to see a specialist \n     in-network, as medically necessary. Current law requires that \n     managed care health plans provide access to the full range of \n     Medicare health care services. The bill expands and \n     strengthens this provision.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I certainly am not alone in having strong \nfeelings that the senior citizens of America must not be deprived of \ntheir right to choose their own doctors.\n  Senator Grassley's Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act of 1997, \nwhich I'm cosponsoring today, ensures choice, access, and quality care \nfor senior citizens by guaranteeing enrollees the option of choosing a \npoint-of-service plan at the time they enroll in a Medicare HMO.\n  Five years ago, I had a close but fortunate encounter with some \nremarkable medical doctors in my home town of Raleigh. My heart surgery \nand the very effective subsequent rehabilitation made it clear that I \nhad been cared for by some of the most capable people in the medical \nprofession.\n  I was free to choose the surgeon who performed the operation. Senior \ncitizens enrolled in Medicare should have the same choice, and the bill \nI'm co-sponsoring today will enable senior citizens who join HMO's to \npreserve their right to choose their doctor.\n  America's senior citizens depend on the health care coverage provided \nby the Medicare system, and those of us in Congress have a duty to make \nsure they will not be forced to give up their right to choose their \ndoctors.\n  Mr. President, the Health Care Financing Administration--which, of \ncourse, administers Medicare--is now the largest purchaser of managed \ncare in the Nation, accounting for about 18 million Americans. As of \nFebruary 1997, 5 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in \nmanaged care plans. This represents a 108-percent increase in managed \ncare enrollment since 1993. Increased migration of the elderly into \nhealth maintenance organizations, and other types of managed care \nplans, will surely lower the costs of operating the vast Medicare \nsystem. And citizens who belong to a Medicare-supported HMO may \nincrease their benefits for prescription drugs, eyeglasses, and hearing \naids coverage not available through fee-for-service plans.\n  Without some moderating legislation, however, senior citizens could \nvery well find themselves locked into coverage that limits them to \nservices provided by HMO-affiliated doctors, other professionals and \nhospitals. No longer would senior citizens have the freedom to choose \ntheir own doctor.\n  Mr. President, consider, if you will, the predicament of a patient \nwho requires heart surgery, and whose HMO will not approve the \ncardiologist with whom the senior has built up a longstanding \nrelationship. Should that patient be required to wait for a year's time \nto change to a plan that will cover the cardiologist whom the patient \nknows and trusts?\n  We must provide a safety valve to protect seniors who find themselves \nin that position. A point-of-service option\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\nwould enable patients to see physicians and specialists inside and \noutside the managed care network. If senior citizens are satisfied with \nthe care they receive within the network, they will feel no need to \nchoose outside doctors and specialists. Without such options, however, \nthese senior citizens will be locked into a rigid system which may, or \nmay not, give them the health care they need from people they most \ntrust to provide it.\n\n  Mr. President, most Americans, whether their health is insured by \nprivate firms or by Medicare, enjoy their freedom to decide which \nmedical professional will provide their care and treatment. According \nto polls I have seen, patients are willing to pay a little more for the \nability to go out of network to be assured of seeing the doctors of \ntheir choice. As many as 70 percent of Americans over 50 years old \ndeclared in one poll that they would be unwilling to join a Medicare \nmanaged plan that denied them the freedom to choose their own \nphysicians.\n  Building a point-of-service option into all health plans under \nMedicare will not interfere with the plan's ability to contain cost, \nnor will it limit their efforts to encourage providers and patients to \nuse their health care resources wisely. It simply will ensure that \nhealth plans put the patient first.\n  The CBO indicated that a built-in point-of-service feature would not \nincrease the cost of Medicare. In testimony before the Senate Budget \nCommittee, CBO stated that:\n\n       the point of service option would permit Medicare enrollees \n     to go to providers outside the HMO's panel when they wanted \n     to, and yet it need not increase the benefit cost to HMO's or \n     to Medicare * * *\n\n  The Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act also includes patient \nprotections and provisions ensuring Medicare participants' timely \naccess to specialists and provides an expedited appeals process which \nrequires patient grievances to be resolved within 30 days. Lastly, this \nbill expands the consumer information which must be provided to \nbeneficiaries to help patients compare health plans. Unfortunately, \nalthough the Health Care Financing Administration collect vast amounts \nof data, virtually none of it is currently accessible to consumers.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge Senators to support the Medicare Patient \nChoice and Access Act, which will provide senior citizens with real \npatient protections and real choice in health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 702. A bill to amend the Individuals With Disabilities Education \nAct to clarify that a State is not required to provide special \neducation and related services to a person with a disability who is \nconvicted of a felony and incarcerated in a secure correctional \nfacility with adult offenders; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n          special education for violent criminals legislation\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to ensure \nthat children across the country will not lose special education funds \nprovided by the Individual With Disabilities Education Act or IDEA. My \nlegislation will fix a loophole in IDEA that threatens to cut off \nspecial education funding to children in California and as many as 24 \nother States.\n  IDEA guarantees all children a ``free and appropriate public \neducation.'' Unfortunately, the Department of Education has interpreted \nthis requirement with a bizarre twist. It has insisted that ``all \nchildren'' includes those felons who, because of the particularly \nviolent nature of their crimes, are serving time in adult State \nprisons. The Department of Education has even insisted California \nprovide special education classes to two murderers on death row. If \nCalifornia refuses to comply, it stands to loss all Federal funding for \nspecial education--over $330 million, which helps educate close to \n600,000 children.\n  I believe California is correct to protest these guidelines.\n  To hold special education children hostage to juvenile murderers and \nrapists in the State's adult prison system is unconscionable. The $5 to \n$20 million it would cost to provide specialized classes for these \nviolent felons would clearly be better spent on law-abiding citizens.\n  My colleagues should be aware that California is not alone in this \npredicament. Twenty-four other states have been cited for noncompliance \nwith IDEA's prison mandate, and they may lose Federal special education \naid if they fail to change their policies.\n  My bill would amend IDEA to clarify that those juveniles sent to \nadult prisons because of the violent nature of their crimes would not \nbe subject to the IDEA special education requirement. Young adults \nhoused in juvenile detention facilities will not be affected in any \nway.\n  This bill will not prohibit or hinder in any way a State's ability to \nprovide special education to adult prisoners. It will only remove the \nFederal mandate requiring States to provide special education to \njuveniles remanded to adult prisons. Deciding which rehabilitation \nprograms to provide to State prisoners properly rests with lawmakers in \neach State. States such as California should not have to fear the loss \nof critical Federal aid because they prefer to allocate scarce \nresources to educate noncriminals.\n  Mr. President, this is a commonsense proposal, and I hope the Senate \nwill act on it expeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record. I ask unanimous consent that a newspaper article on this \nsubject also be printed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 702\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

And, to pressure the \n     state to do so, the U.S. Department of Education is \n     threatening to withhold $332 million that now goes to pay for \n     the same services for public schoolchildren.\n       The issue arises from an Education Department \n     interpretation of the 1975 law that requires schools to \n     ensure that students with physical, emotional and learning \n     disabilities receive a ``free, appropriate public education'' \n     in return for federal aid.\n       The law does not specifically require that prisoners \n     receive such services. Indeed, many other states do not \n     provide them. Neither does the federal prison system.\n       Yet, because California extends services such as tutoring \n     and vocational and speech therapy to juveniles until they \n     turn 22, the federal government says prisoners up to that age \n     cannot be discriminated against--even if they are behind bars \n     for crimes including murder and rape or awaiting execution.\n       Privately, federal education officials acknowledge that \n     withholding money from programs for schoolchildren to \n     pressure the state would be highly unpopular and that they \n     would be reluctant to go through with it.\n       Nonetheless, federal officials have continued to press the \n     state to comply.\n       The Wilson administration has resisted the order, saying \n     that screening inmates and creating an individualized plan \n     for serving each of them would pose daunting logistic, \n     financial, security and legal problems. State officials have \n     been lobbying Congress to change the law.\n       In testimony before a congressional committee looking into \n     the issue, Gregory W. Harding, the Department of Corrections \n     chief deputy director, questioned the ``appropriateness and \n     wisdom of expending precious resources'' on individuals who \n     have ``committed felonious and, in many instances, heinous \n     crimes.''\n       Harding also warned that inmates or their parents ``would \n     merely use this process to make unreasonable demands or to \n     bring frivolous lawsuits against staff.''\n       The state prisons house roughly 10,000 inmates between the \n     ages of 16 and 21. No one\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\n     knows for sure how many of those prisoners might have \n     disabilities qualifying them for special education. Estimates \n     have ranged between 10% and 25%. Cost estimates also range \n     widely, from $5 million to $20 million annually.\n       Those numbers pale next to the $3.4 billion spent annually \n     in California to provide special education for 590,000 \n     students.\n       But the possibility of shifting any money to prisoners \n     rankles educators because the federal government requires the \n     states to provide special education to disabled children, \n     but has never come close to providing its full share of \n     the programs' cost. The law originally said the federal \n     government could cover up to 40% of the cost of special \n     education, but Washington has never put up more than 12% \n     of the money and has now dropped its share to roughly 8%--\n     draining money from local school district budgets.\n       ``Our position is that we don't want to see any public \n     education dollar--state or federal--be siphoned off to \n     provide special education service .  .  . to youth in \n     prison,'' said Lou Barela, a special education administrator \n     in Solano County who has testified on the issue on behalf of \n     a statewide administrators group.\n       Barela said it would be more expensive to provide services \n     in prisons than in schools because of security risks. She \n     said the state already has a huge shortage of trained special \n     education teachers, and it will be even more difficult to \n     find ones willing to work in prisons.\n       It is not uncommon for federal officials to threaten to \n     withhold special education funding in order to get a state or \n     a local school district to comply with a ruling. In 1994, the \n     Los Angeles Unified School District was threatened with the \n     loss of its special education funding if it did not revamp \n     its procedures for assessing students' needs in a timely \n     fashion. In the end, no money was withheld.\n       Federal education officials have scheduled a public hearing \n     for next month in Sacramento to discuss when the state will \n     begin to provide the services. That hearing will also \n     consider a compliance agreement under which the state would \n     have as long as three years to change its program.\n       The issue of providing special education services to \n     inmates is one of many that have complicated action to extend \n     the life of the landmark 1975 law, now known as the \n     Individuals With Disabilities Act.\n       Last fall, after working on the reauthorization bill for \n     two years, Congress adjourned without taking action. Among \n     the other issues stalling the bill were questions about how \n     federal money for the program is distributed and how students \n     served by the program can be disciplined.\n       Representatives of both parties in the Senate and House and \n     from the Clinton administration are in the middle of \n     negotiations on the reauthorization bill and are expected to \n     come up with a compromise in the next few weeks. In an effort \n     to keep those negotiations on track, the parties, including \n     those from the Department of Education, have agreed not to \n     talk about whether they are making progress.\n       Repubican Rep. Frank Riggs of Windsor heads one of the \n     subcommittees dealing with the reauthorization and has vowed \n     in the past to change the law to exempt California from the \n     order to serve prisoners.\n       ``It is utterly unfair to take precious special education \n     dollars away from students in the public schools to give \n     those dollars to muggers, murderers and rapists,'' said Beau \n     Phillips, Riggs' spokesman.\n       ``For the U.S. Department of Education to threaten the \n     special ed grant for the entire state of California because \n     the state won't provide special education to 19- and 22-year-\n     old killers is insane.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 703. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe deductibility of expenses by a taxpayer in connection with the \nbusiness use of the home; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      HOME OFFICE TAX LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nfully restore the home office tax deduction. This legislation is \nnecessary because a recent Supreme Court decision and subsequent IRS \nregulations have made it impossible for many small business \nentrepreneurs to use the home office tax deduction.\n  During my service in the House of Representatives I introduced this \nlegislation in both the 103d and 104th Congresses. We made great \nprogress in the 104th, and even included a full home office tax \ndeduction in the Contract With America tax legislation. Unfortunately, \nthat tax legislation was vetoed.\n  However, by the end of the last Congress we were able to reach \nagreement with the President on a number of small business tax changes, \nand among them was a restoration of the tax deduction for home space \nused for the storage of product samples. This year we should finish the \njob and restore the full home office tax deduction.\n  Increasingly, it is the little guy who gets squeezed by the tax \nsystem. While large corporations can rent space and deduct office and \nvirtually all other expenses, many taxpayers who work out of their home \nare no longer able to deduct their office expenses.\n  Traditionally, the Tax Code has permitted individuals who operate \nbusinesses within their homes to deduct a portion of the expenses \nrelated to that home. However, over the past 20 years Congress, the \ncourts, and the IRS have reduced the scope and usefulness of the \ndeduction.\n  The most serious blow came in 1993 when the Supreme Court's ruling in \nthe Soliman decision effectively eliminated the home office deduction \nfor most taxpayers. Under the Supreme Court's new interpretation of \n``principal place of business'' a taxpayer who maintains a home office, \nbut also performs important business related work outside the home is \nnot likely to pass IRS scrutiny.\n  This change effectively denies the deduction to taxpayers who work \nout of their home but also spend time on the road. Those impacted \ninclude sales representatives, caterers, teachers, computer repairers, \ndoctors, veterinarians, house painters, consultants, personal trainers, \nand many more. Even though these taxpayers may have no office other \nthan their home, the work they perform will often deny them a \ndeduction.\n  According to the IRS, 1.6 million taxpayers claimed a home office tax \ndeduction in 1991. While not all of these taxpayers were affected by \nthe Court's decision, many were. Clearly, any taxpayers who operate a \nbusiness out of their home must review their tax situation.\n  There are many reasons why a broad home office tax deduction is \nimportant. The deduction is pro-family. It helps taxpayers pursue \ncareers that enable them to spend more time with their children. The \ndeduction helps cut down on commuting and saves energy. The deduction \nrecognizes the advances of technology--computer and telecommunciations \nadvances mean that more and more individuals will be able to work for \nthemselves and maintain a home office.\n\n  The deduction is a boost to women and minorities who are increasingly \nstarting their own businesses. In fact, over 32 percent of all \nproprietorships are now owned by women entrepreneurs, and Commerce \nDepartment data reveal that 55 percent of these women business owners \noperate their firms from their home. In addition, there are now well \nover 1 million minority-owned small businesses and a good number of \nthese are operated out of the home.\n  Finally, the home office tax deduction helps our economy. It benefits \nsmall businesses and entrepeneurs who develop new ideas, and create \njobs. Many of America's most important businesses originated out of a \nhome.\n  Small business is increasingly the engine which drives our economy. \nWith large firms downsizing, entrepeneurs must pick up the slack. The \nimportance of this trend is demonstrated by the job shift that occurred \nduring the slow recovery from the most recent recession. During the \nperiod of October 1991 to September 1992 large businesses cut 400,000 \njobs while small business created 178,000 new jobs. During the boom \nyears of the 1980's, the vast majority of the 20 million new jobs \ncreated were in the small business sector.\n  It is critical that recent assaults on the home office tax deduction \nbe reversed. That is why I plan to work hard to see that this change in \nlaw is enacted as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 704. A bill to amend the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act of 1974 with respect to the separate detention and \nconfinement of juveniles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                   the juvenile jail improvement act\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Juvenile Jail \nImprovement Act of 1997.\n  We face a growing and frightening tide of juvenile violence. And that \ntide is threatening to swamp our rural sheriffs. It is increasingly \ncommon for\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\nrural sheriffs to face a terrible dilemma every time they arrest a \njuvenile--they either have to release a potentially violent juvenile on \nthe street to await trial or they have to spend invaluable time and \nmanpower chauffeuring the juvenile around their State to an appropriate \ndetention facility. Either way, the current system makes little sense \nand needs to be changed.\n  Let me explain how this dilemma works. In most rural communities, the \nonly jail available is built exclusively for adults. There are no \nspecial juvenile facilities. But sometimes, the community can create a \nseparate portion of the jail for juveniles. However, under current law, \na juvenile picked up for criminal activity can only be held in a \nseparate portion of an adult facility for up to 24 hours. After that, \nthe juvenile must be transported--often across hundreds of miles--to a \nseparate juvenile detention facility, often to be returned to the very \nsame jail 2 or 3 days later for a court date. This system often leaves \nrural law enforcement criss-crossing the State with a single juvenile--\nand results in massive expenses for law enforcement with little benefit \nfor juveniles, who spend endless hours in a squad car. Such a process \ndoes not serve anyone's interests.\n  And that is not all that rural sheriffs face. Even qualifying for the \n24-hour exception can be a nightmare. That's because juveniles can be \nkept in adult jails only under a very stringent set of rules. Keeping \njuveniles in an adult jail is known as collocation. It can only be done \nif there is strict sight and sound separation between the adults and \nthe juveniles as well as completely separate staff. For many small \ncommunities, making these physical and staff changes to their jails is \nprohibitively expensive.\n  So sheriffs faced with diverting officers to drive around the State \nin search of a detention facility may choose to let the juvenile go \nfree while awaiting trial. This prospect should frighten anyone who is \naware of the growing trend in juvenile violence.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that is designed to cure this \nproblem. My legislative solution is simple, straightforward and \neffective. It extends from 24 to 72 hours the time during which rural \nlaw enforcement may collocate juvenile offenders in an adult facility, \nas long as juveniles remain separated from adults. It also relaxes the \nrequirements for acceptable collocation. After taking a hard look at \nhow collocation rules have worked--and in what ways they have failed--\nthis legislation comes to a reasonable compromise.\n  Mr. President, one of our most important goals in assuring that any \nchanges to these rules do not sacrifice the safety and welfare of \narrested juveniles. In addition to the growing fear about juvenile \nviolence, we have witnessed a growing anger and frustration at \njuveniles. This frustration should not lead us to forget the painful \nlessons we learned many years ago about abusive and dangerous treatment \nof delinquent children. Twenty years ago, we learned about kids who \nwere thrown in jail where they were victimized and abused by adult \nprisoners; or where, without proper supervision, they committed \nsuicide; or, where, guarded by people who only had experience with \nadult prisoners, they were disciplined savagely. When we give into the \ntemptation to throw juveniles in jail and teach them a tough lesson, we \nare often ill rewarded. So even as we loosen these collocation \nrequirements, we must bear in mind that the juvenile justice system \nstill has its principle goal rehabilitation not harsh retribution.\n  My conversations with administrators, sheriffs, and juvenile court \njudges have led me to conclude that we must bring greater flexibility--\nand less red-tape--to the Juvenile Justice Act. It is my hope that this \nlegislation--which offers greater flexibility while retaining important \nprotections regarding the separation of juveniles from adults--will \nmeet with strong support from the Senate. Thank you.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 705. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to establish \nstatutory rules for the conversion of television broadcast station from \nanalog to digital transmission consistent with the Federal \nCommunications Commission's fifth order and report, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                 the digital television conversion act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Digital \nTelevision Conversion Act. This legislation codifies the rules and \npolicies recently adopted by the Federal Communications Commission to \ngovern the transition of the over-the-air television system from analog \nto digital broadcasting.\n  Mr. President, every American has a stake in the speedy and \nsuccessful implementation of new digital broadcasting technology. Those \nof us who like to watch TV will benefit from crisper, larger video, CD-\nquality audio, and more channels of video programming choices. Even \nbetter, those of us who would prefer to interact with TV will find that \nthe convergence of digital television and computer technology will make \nexciting new interactive video service offerings possible. The economy \nwill benefit from the new jobs created by manufacturing new digital \ntelevision receivers. The television broadcasting industry stands on \nthe threshold of a transformation that will assure that over-the-air \nbroadcasting isn't relegated to the slow lane on the digital \ninformation superhighway.\n  To enable this all to happen, the $100 billion television industry \nwill be given extra channels of broadcast spectrum valued at up to $70 \nbillion for free. In return, each television licensee will only be \nrequired to incur the cost of installing digital broadcasting \nequipment--a cost, I assure you, far below the estimated value of the \nnew digital spectrum each broadcaster will be given--and, when the \ntransition is complete, return the analog channels they now occupy, to \nbe auctioned for other uses.\n  The new and improved services that will come from digitial \ntelevision, plus whatever revenue is derived from auctioning the analog \nchannels, is what the American people will get from the television \nindustry in return. It is therefore absolutely imperative, Mr. \nPresident, to guarantee that this transition to digital takes place as \nquickly as conditions will reasonably allow. Put another way, Mr. \nPresident, it is incumbent upon us to make sure, on behalf of the \nAmerican people, that the television industry actually crosses the \ndigital threshold upon which it now stands.\n  And that is the reason I am introducing this legislation today. For \nthe rules recently adopted by the Federal Communications Commission do \nnot establish firm timetables and deadlines to govern the television \nindustry's critically important digital conversion. For example, \nalthough the FCC set out target dates for television stations in each \nmarket to convert to digital, this conversion schedule is not binding \non more than 90 percent of all television stations, and the Commission \nhas not adopted any way to verify licensee's compliance with the \nnonbinding conversion schedule. Likewise, there is no rule requiring \nthat television licensees return their current analog channels by any \ngiven date so they can be auctioned.\n\n  Given the tremendous promise that digital broadcasting holds for \ntelevision licensees, why not simply rely on broadcasters to \nvoluntarily implement a rapid transition out of their own best \ninterests? The answer, Mr. President, is that different licensees may \nsee their own best interests in different ways.\n  Some may see their own best interests served by delaying the \nconversion to avoid the added expenditure, at least until a majority of \nother stations take the plunge. This could produce a classic ``chicken-\nand-egg'' problem, especially in smaller markets: Local stations wait \nto convert until the cost comes down and until local viewers buy \ndigital sets or converter boxes--but the cost won't come down and \nconsumers won't buy digital sets or converter boxes because local \nstations aren't broadcasting in digital. It would be unfortunate that \nviewers in smaller markets, who probably stand to benefit the most from \nthe diverse array of new services that digital broadcasting can \nprovide, are most likely to fall victim to these perverse incentives.\n  And of course, Mr. President, there is that element of self-interest \nthat any broadcaster, regardless of market size, might have: the \nperfectly understandable interest in retaining both the old\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\nanalog and the new digital channel for as long as possible. But this, \nof course, would doubly enrich television licensees, who would already \nhave been given their digital channel for free. It would also delay the \nability to use the returned analog channels for different \ntelecommunications services from which the public would benefit. \nMoreover, any delay in returning the analog channels would also affect \nthe revenues realized from auctioning them. This has now become an \nespecially important consideration with the bipartisan agreement \nbetween Congress and the White House to balance the budget by the year \n2002: Revenues from the auction of these channels have been scored and \nincluded in the estimates on which this bipartisan budget agreement is \nbased.\n  To be sure, many station licensees are apparently eager to get on \nwith the job of conversion, although they sometimes foresee practical \ndifficulties beyond their control getting in the way. In recognition of \nthese potential problems, this legislation also codifies the FCC's \nstandard for waiving the conversion schedule on a case-by-case basis. \nAnd in codifying the FCC's nonbinding analog channel giveback dates, \nthe bill also recognizes the special circumstances faced by \nnoncommercial broadcasters, and codifies the more liberal analog \nchannel giveback target dates the FCC provided for these licensees.\n  Nor am I concerned, Mr. President, that some markets could lose over-\nthe-air television if analog channel reversion deadlines are codified \nbut, for some unforeseen reason, digital broadcasting does not take \nhold. Codifying the digital conversion timetables will assure that as \nmany stations as possibly can convert to digital, will. And it is \nsimply preposterous to think that, even if digital broadcasting somehow \nfails to take hold during the next 9 years notwithstanding this bill's \nlegislative impetus for it to do so, further legislation extending the \ndate for the give back of the analog channels would not swiftly be \nenacted.\n  In sum, Mr. President, those televisions broadcasters who are willing \nand eager to convert to digital will not be hurt in any way by \ncodifying the deadlines and the waiver standard. It is only those \nlicensees who, for whatever reason, might be less than anxious to make \nthe transition who will have their feet held to the fire. Is this fair? \nYou bet it is. We cannot be lax in our duty to guarantee, to the \ngreatest extent we can, that consumers enjoy both the \ntelecommunications benefits of digital television and the economic \nbenefits of the analog channels' auction revenues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 706. A bill to amend the Individuals With Disabilities Education \nAct to permit the use of long-term disciplinary measures against \nstudents who are children with disabilities, to provide for a \nlimitation on the provision of educational services to children with \ndisabilities who engage in behaviors that are unrelated to their \ndisabilities, and to require educational entities to include in the \neducational records of students who are children without disabilities \ndocumentation with regard to disciplinary measures taken against such \nstudents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n              the school security improvement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing the School Security \nImprovement Act of 1997. This legislation will make some needed reforms \nto the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA]. The goal of \nthis act is to preserve the rights of students with disabilities while \ngranting local school districts more flexibility to discipline violent \nand disruptive students. This legislation also focuses on reducing \nlitigation and unnecessary attorneys' fees.\n  Last week, I traveled through my home State of Missouri to discuss \nthis measure with school district superintendents, principals, school \nboard members, special education directors, and parents. The top two \nconcerns mentioned, without exception, were safety and discipline of \nall students in the public school system. The rising incidences of \nschool violence and current inflexible Federal mandates have made IDEA \nreform a high priority issue for educators and parents around the \ncountry. Current law prohibits removal of a disabled child from the \nclassroom for more than 10 days--even if he or she becomes violent, \ncommits a crime, or threatens other children--unless permission is \ngranted by a parent. IDEA has created a separate category of students \nthat are not bound by the rules of conduct required of their students, \neven when their behavior is not related to their disability.\n  My primary concern is creating a safe learning environment for all \nchildren. In attempting to provide good education services to disabled \nstudents, which I fully support, we have unfortunately created a \nsituation where some kids can hide behind their disability in \ndisplaying some outrageous behavior. For instance, I know a case where \na young man who sold drugs at school was still in the classroom a year \nlater, even though his crime was not related to his disability. What \ndoes that say to other kids, particularly when for them the same crime \nwould bring an automatic 1-year expulsion? In another horrendous case, \na student stabbed a classmate with scissors and was back in the \nclassroom in just 10 days.\n  The School Security Improvement Act of 1997 will eliminate the double \nstandard that currently exists between special education and general \neducation children. All students, disabled or not, should receive the \nsame discipline for the same behavior. I believe this is appropriate \nwhen the behavior of the child is not related to their disability. \nChildren must learn that there are consequences for violating the \nrules. Good education demands discipline and standards of conduct.\n  In an effort to ensure that the students, teachers, and school \nemployees remain safe within the educational environment, this bill \nrequires schools to include in the records of a child with a disability \na statement of disciplinary action taken against the student and allows \nintrastate and interstate transfer of records from one district to \nanother. The records issue has been brought to the forefront because of \nseveral instances when disabled students have caused serious problems \nand school officials were unaware that the student had a record of \nsimilar activities in other schools.\n  I believe that all students with disabilities need and deserve access \nto educational services to meet their individual needs. However, in \nthose occasional circumstances when a student becomes so violent or \ndangerous, and their behavior significantly disrupts the educational \nprocess and they become a danger to themselves or others, or create an \nenvironment in which learning cannot occur, then the rights of others \nin the school to have a safe and effective learning environment must \ntake precedence.\n  The School Security Improvement Act of 1997 will enable school \nadministrators, those who are closest to the problem, to remove \ndangerous students with disabilities who pose a threat to the safety of \nothers from the classroom and make temporary alternative placements to \nensure the safety of all students until a more appropriate placement is \ndetermined. When these students are able to behave appropriately, they \nwill be returned to the classroom.\n  The current IDEA provision requiring local school districts to \nreimburse attorneys' fees incurred by parents who elect to initiate \nlitigation has had the predictable result of encouraging such \nlitigation and of driving up special education costs. The dispute-\nresolution procedures has become extremely adversarial and costly. \nStudies have found that the amount of special education litigation has \ndramatically increased in recent years. Sadly, some parent attorneys \nseem encouraged to use due process, as a fishing expedition or to \nthreaten districts with protracted litigation over non-issues as a \ntactic to force school districts to comply with parental demands.\n  This practice only serves to reduce district funds available to meet \nthe needs of students with disabilities. Clearly, we need reasonable \nreforms to the dispute-resolution process to ensure that scarce \neducational funds are used for educational services for our children.\n  I firmly believe that children with disabilities must be guaranteed a \nfree appropriate education. Yet no school district should have to cut \nservices to any student so it can pay attorneys'\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\nfees. But, because of the explosion of litigation in this area, \neducational services for all students are being endangered.\n  Under the School Security Improvement Act of 1997, local school \ndistricts will be permitted to provide alternative educational \nplacement for children who threaten the safety of others. For some \nchildren, it is absolutely appropriate to swiftly and permanently \nremove them from the regular classroom setting. The law should not \nprohibit local school officials from acting on their own authority to \ndiscipline dangerous and unruly students.\n  The School Security Improvement Act will give local school districts \nthe authority and flexibility to ensure that the students and the \npersonnel are provided educational and working environments that are \nsafe and orderly.\n  Mr. President, when the Federal Government enacted IDEA, it promised \nto fund 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure. \nToday, the Federal Government funds only 7 percent. My bill contains a \nprovision expressing a sense of the Senate that the Federal portion of \neducating students with disabilities should be fully funded. In recent \nyears, costly regulations have dramatically increased, placing a \ntremendous strain on local school districts. The time and money spent \non Federal mandates must be reduced, so that more time and resources \ncan be spent in the classroom on school children. This money will help \nstudents by easing the financial burden on local school districts.\n  I know the feelings run high on this issue. We have a difficult job \nwhen it comes to balancing the needs of those with special needs with \nour responsibility to educate all children in the classroom, free of \nviolence and disruption. I look forward to the upcoming reauthorization \nof IDEA and working with my colleagues in this effort to come up with a \ncommonsense approach to improve our Nation's schools.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 707. A bill to prohibit the public carrying of a handgun, with \nappropriate exceptions for law enforcement officials and others; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             THE CONCEALED WEAPONS PROHIBITION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nthe Concealed Weapons Prohibition Act of 1997, that would prohibit \nindividuals from publicly carrying a handgun.\n  The bill includes exceptions for certain people authorized to carry \nhandguns under State law, such as law enforcement personnel and duly \nauthorized security officers. States also could provide exemptions in \nindividual cases, based on credible evidence of compelling \ncircumstances warranting an exemption, such as a woman being stalked by \nsomeone who is threatening her. A simple claim of concern about \ngeneralized risks would not be sufficient to warrant an exemption; \nthere would have to be a specified, credible threat.\n  Mr. President, common sense tells us that there are more than enough \ndangerous weapons on America's streets. Yet, incredibly, some seem to \nthink that there should be more. These people want to turn our States \nand cities into a modern version of the old wild west, where everyone \ncarries a gun on his or her hip, taking the law into their own hands. \nThis is a foolhardy and dangerous trend.\n  Mr. President, this country is already drowning in a sea of gun \nviolence. Every 2 minutes, someone in the United States is shot. Every \n14 minutes, someone dies from a gunshot wound. In 1994 alone, over 15 \nthousand people in our country were killed by handguns. Compare that to \ncountries like Canada, where 90 people were killed by handguns that \nyear, or Great Britain, which had 68 handgun fatalities.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nestimate that by the year 2003, gunfire will have surpassed auto \naccidents as the leading cause of injury-related deaths in the United \nStates. In fact, this is already the case in seven States.\n  Mr. President, given the severity of our Nation's gun violence \nproblem, we need to be looking for ways to reduce the number of guns on \nour streets. Yet, instead, many States recently have enacted laws to do \nthe opposite, by making it easier for people to carry concealed \nweapons.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, concealed weapons make people less, not \nmore, secure. In fact, there is near-unanimous agreement among law \nenforcement groups that concealed weapons laws are bad policy. These \ngroups understand that when more people carry weapons on the streets, \nmore routine conflicts escalate into deadly violence.\n  Mr. President, every day people get into everything from traffic \naccidents to domestic disputes. Maybe these arguments lead to yelling, \nor even fisticuffs. But if people are carrying guns, those conflicts \nare much more likely to end in a shooting, and death.\n  Concealed weapons laws also are likely to make criminals more \nviolent. Think about it, Mr. President. If a criminal thinks that you \nmight be carrying a concealed weapon, common sense tells you that he is \nmuch more likely to simply shoot first, and ask questions later.\n  Mr. President, another dangerous side-effect of having private \ncitizens carry concealed weapons is the impact these unseen guns will \nhave on law enforcement officers. Police officers would become \nreluctant to conduct even routine traffic stops if they knew that large \nnumbers of citizens could be carrying concealed weapons.\n  You do not need to take my word for this, Mr. President. Just ask the \nmen and women in law enforcement. In fact, the Police Executive \nResearch Forum did just that. In their 1996 survey, they found that 92 \npercent of their membership opposed legislation allowing private \ncitizens to carry concealed weapons. The most cited reason for this \nopposition was public safety.\n\n  Mr. President, the police of this country understand that the public \ncarrying of handguns increases the likelihood of gun violence. Also, \nconcealed weapons increase the chances that incompetent or careless \nhandgun users will accidently injure or kill innocent bystanders. \nUnfortunately, States increasingly are allowing individuals to carry \nconcealed weapons with little or no training in the operation of \nfirearms. This means that many incompetent people are putting the \npublic at risk from stray bullets.\n  Mr. President, although the regulation of concealed weapons has been \nleft to States, it is time for Congress to step in to protect the \npublic. All Americans have a right to be free from the dangers posed by \nthe carrying of concealed handguns, regardless of their State of \nresidence. And Americans should be able to travel across State lines \nfor business, to visit their families, or for any other purpose, \nwithout having to worry about concealed weapons.\n  Congress has the constitutional authority to provide this protection, \nMr. President, and there is a strong Federal interest in ensuring the \nsafety of our citizens. Beyond the human costs of gun violence, crimes \ncommitted with handguns impose a substantial burden on interstate \ncommerce and lead to a reduction in productivity and profitability for \nbusinesses around the Nation whose workers, suppliers, and customers \nare adversely affected by gun violence. Moreover, to ensure its \ncoverage under the Constitution's commerce clause, my bill applies only \nto handguns that have been transported in interstate or foreign \ncommerce, or that have parts or components that have been transported \nin interstate or foreign commerce. This clearly distinguishes the \nlegislation from the gun free school zone statute that was struck down \nin the Supreme Court's Lopez case.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that more guns equals more death. \nThis legislation will help in our struggle to reduce the number of guns \non our streets, and help prevent our society from becoming even more \nviolent and dangerous.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 707\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \na national minimum penalty for an individual who operates a motor \nvehicle while under the influence of alcohol; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n    THE DEADLY DRIVER REDUCTION AND MATTHEW P. HAMMELL MEMORIAL ACT\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Deadly \nDriver and Matthew P. Hammell Memorial Act, which would establish \nnational minimum penalties for alcohol-related motor vehicle \nviolations. It is a companion to S. 412, the Safe and Sober Streets \nAct, which I introduced last month along with Senator Mike DeWine of \nOhio, a bill intended to make .08 blood alcohol content the national \nstandard for impaired driving. I am proud to sponsor this legislation \nand when it is adopted, many lives will be saved.\n  However, Mr. President, we can also reduce fatalities and serious \ninjury caused by drunk driving by having tougher penalties. Driving \nwhile intoxicated, or DWI, is one of the most prevalent crimes in this \ncountry. In 1992, more people were arrested for DWI--1.6 million--than \nfor any other reported criminal activity including larceny or theft, or \nfor drug abuse violations. By even reasonable standards this could be \nconsidered a kind of epidemic. And we need to start treating this \nepidemic.\n  A shocking number of DWI convictions are repeat offenders. When the \nNational Highway Traffic and Safety Administration studied this issue, \nit found that about one-third of all drivers arrested or convicted of \nDWI each year are repeat DWI offenders. One study in California \ndemonstrated the extent of this problem over the long term. It found \nthat 44 percent of all drivers convicted of DWI in California in 1980 \nwere convicted again of DWI within the next 10 years.\n  In my State of New Jersey, the problem is exacerbated by the fact \nthat DWI offenses are treated as traffic violations as opposed to \ncrimes. Unfortunately, Mr. President, too many people share this view \nof drinking and driving, with the result being that those who are \ncharged with DWI often drink and drive again. While in New Jersey new \nlaws and programs have been implemented to address the drunk-driving \nproblem, and DWI arrests and convictions have declined, the problem of \nrepeat offenders persists. Between 1994 and 1995 the number of two-time \noffenders actually increased from 4,495 in 1994 to 4,731 in 1995.\n\n  The danger of these repeat offenders is illustrated by the fact that \ndrivers with prior DWI convictions are overrepresented in fatal \ncrashes. These drivers have a 4.1 times greater risk of being in a \nfatal crash, as do intoxicated drivers without a prior DWI, and the \nrisk of a particular driver being involved in a fatal crash increases \nwith each DWI arrest.\n  Mr. President, it is time that we take this problem of repeat \noffenders seriously. The first time a driver is convicted of DWI, he or \nshe must understand the severity of the crime which has been committed. \nIf a person continues to ignore the law, and continues to drink and \ndrive, the courts need to treat that person with the full force of the \nlaw, both to punish that person, and to protect the public at large.\n  That is why I am introducing the Deadly Driver Reduction and Matthew \nP. Hammell Memorial Act. This bill requires States to adopt mandatory \nminimum sentences for DWI offenders within 3 years or otherwise lose a \nportion of their Federal highway funding. The sentencing requirements \nare as follows: For a first-time conviction of a person operating a \nmotor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, their license is \nrevoked for 6 months. A second conviction requires a 1-year suspension, \nand a third conviction for the crime of driving while impaired by \nalcohol results in the permanent revocation of that person's license.\n  If a State fails to adopt these minimum sentences by October 1, 2000, \n5 percent of that State's Federal highway funds will be withheld. If a \nState fails to adopt these minimum sentences after another year, that \nState would then lose 10 percent of its allocated Federal highway \nfunds.\n  Mr. President, sanctions work. In too many States, and in too many \ncourts in this country, drunk driving is not taken seriously enough. We \nwant to make sure that those who disobey the law by drinking and \ndriving both understand the severity of their offense and are prevented \nfrom driving if they continue to break the law. These mandatory minimum \npenalties will meet these challenges.\n\n  When we talk about drunk driving, too often we talk about it in \nstatistical terms. But there are real people attached to those \nstatistics. In the spring of 1995, a young man, from Tuckerton, NJ, \nfull of goodness and potential, was struck down by a drunk driver while \nhe and his friend were in-line skating. Matthew Hammell was \nexceptional. All those who knew him talk about being touched by his \nkindness and caring. Like so many American boys, at one point he \ndreamed of being a baseball player, but as he matured he knew he wanted \nto be a missionary. His dream became living a life of helping others. \nBut this dream, this young man, was taken away from all of us much too \nearly when Robert Hyer, drunk and driving, struck Matthew with his car \nwhile passing another vehicle. Robert Hyer should not have been on the \nroad. Not only was he drunk, but he had a history of driving drunk. \nBefore this fateful incident, Hyer had been charged with DWI six times, \nthough he was convicted only twice. Hyer lost his license in New Jersey \nin 1984, but somehow he obtained a North Carolina license just 2 years \nlater. He was a habitual offender who kept bucking the system. A system \nwhich kept letting him go. A system which, in the end, was too late in \nresponding.\n  Mr. President, it may be too late for Matthew Hammell, and all of the \nother Matthew Hammells whose spirits are taken from us too early, but \nit is now that we must become serious about drinking and driving. So, \nin his honor, and in the memory of all of our loved ones who do not get \nto achieve their potential due to the actions of drunk drivers, we have \nnamed this bill the Deadly Driver Reduction and Matthew P. Hammell \nMemorial Act. While I will be the first to admit that this bill is not \nenough, at least it is a start. Let us\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\nwork together now so that such memorial acts are unnecessary in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 708\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

During the Asiatic Fleet's existence from 1910 \nto 1942, the fleet was an instrumental component of American national \nsecurity and diplomacy.\n  The U.S. Asiatic Fleet, the successor to the old Asiatic Station and \nprecursor to today's 7th Fleet, maintained an important presence \nthroughout Southeast Asian waters. Initially operating between coastal \nChina and the Philippines, the fleet's activities expanded to include \noperations in Russian waters and the straits and narrows encompassing \nMalaysia and Indonesia.\n  In these critical regions, the fleet's men and women supported \nAmerican security interests and the safety of citizens abroad during \ncivil wars and international conflicts. During one of the greatest \nnatural disasters, the Yangtze flood of 1931, which killed 150,000 \npeople, the fleet rendered aide and assistance to Americans and \nChinese. Through these actions, the fleet demonstrated the commitment \nof the United States to an important area of the world during a dynamic \nperiod in history.\n  During the last years of Asiatic Fleet operations, sailors and \nmarines courageously distinguished themselves by defending against the \ntidal wave of Japanese aggression. Facing the modern Japanese armada \nwere the fleet's 3 cruisers, 13 WWI-vintage destroyers, 29 submarines \nand a handful of gunboats and patrol aircraft. Against overwhelming \nodds, the fleet defended the Philippines until the evacuation was \nordered and fought the continued expansion of the Japanese throughout \nthe South Pacific. Many of those defenders were captured or killed in \nthese heroic battles.\n  It is important that we pause to remember the valor and spirit of \nthese dedicated servicemen. For that reason, I am introducing a \nresolution which will designate March 1, 1998, the 56th anniversary of \nthe sinking of the Asiatic Fleet's flagship, the U.S.S. Houston, by \nJapanese Imperial Forces, as ``United States Navy Asiatic Fleet \nMemorial Day.'' I invite my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

RESOLUTION 83--RECOGNIZING SUICIDE AS A NATIONAL PROBLEM\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Coverdell) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources:\n\n                               S. Res. 83\n\n       Whereas suicide, the ninth leading cause of all deaths in \n     the United States and the third such cause for young persons \n     ages 15 through 24, claims over 31,000 lives annually, more \n     than homicide;\n       Whereas suicide attempts, estimated to exceed 750,000 \n     annually, adversely impact the lives of millions of family \n     members;\n       Whereas suicide completions annually cause over 200,000 \n     family members to grieve over and mourn a tragic suicide \n     death for the first time, thus creating a population of over \n     4,000,000 such mourners in the United States;\n       Whereas the suicide completion rate per 100,000 persons has \n     remained relatively stable over the past 40 years for the \n     general population, and that rate has nearly tripled for \n     young persons;\n       Whereas that suicide completion rate is highest for adults \n     over 65;\n       Whereas the stigma associated with mental illness works \n     against suicide prevention by keeping persons at risk of \n     completing suicide from seeking lifesaving help;\n       Whereas the stigma associated with suicide deaths seriously \n     inhibits surviving family members from regaining meaningful \n     lives;\n       Whereas suicide deaths impose a huge unrecognized and \n     unmeasured economic burden on the United States in terms of \n     potential years of life lost, medical costs incurred, and \n     work time lost by mourners;\n       Whereas suicide is a complex, multifaceted biological, \n     sociological, psychological, and societal problem;\n       Whereas even though many suicides are currently \n     preventable, there is still a need for the development of \n     more effective suicide prevention programs;\n       Whereas suicide prevention opportunities continue to \n     increase due to advances in clinical research, in mental \n     disorder treatments, and in basic neuroscience, and due to \n     the development of community-based initiatives that await \n     evaluation; and\n       Whereas suicide prevention efforts should be encouraged to \n     the maximum extent possible: Now, therefore, be it\n           Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes suicide as a national problem and declares \n     suicide prevention to be a national priority;\n       (2) acknowledges that no single suicide prevention program \n     or effort will be appropriate for all populations or \n     communities;\n       (3) encourages initiatives dedicated to--\n       (A) preventing suicide;\n       (B) responding to people at risk for suicide and people who \n     have attempted suicide;\n       (C) promoting safe and effective treatment for persons at \n     risk for suicidal behavior;\n       (D) supporting people who have lost someone to suicide; and\n       (E) developing an effective national strategy for the \n     prevention of suicide; and\n       (4) encourages the development, and the promotion of \n     accessibility and affordability, of mental health services, \n     to enable all persons at risk for suicide to obtain the \n     services, without fear of any stigma.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to submit a Senate \nresolution which I hope will raise national awareness to the problem of \nsuicide and one that recognizes suicide as a national public health \nproblem needing attention.\n  I am pleased to have as cosponsors of this resolution Senators \nMurray, Wellstone, and Coverdell. Their courage and leadership on this \nissue is appreciated.\n  Currently there are nearly 31,000 suicides annually in the United \nStates--83 suicides per day; or 1 suicide every 17 minutes--with 12 of \nevery 100,000 Americans taking their own lives.\n  Suicide cuts across all age, economic, social, and ethnic boundaries.\n  More people die from suicide than from homicide in the United States.\n  On an average day in this country, an estimated 1,900 adults attempt \nsuicide.\n  It is estimated that there are 750,000 suicide attempts annually.\n  In 1994, the latest year for which we have statistical data, the 10 \nhighest suicide rates, averaging twice those of the mid-Atlantic \nregion, were found in States within the intermountain region of the \nwest.\n  Unfortunately, my State of Nevada leads the Nation in this public \nhealth tragedy.\n  Mr. President, suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the \nUnited States.\n  Males commit suicide at rates and numbers of suicides three to four \ntimes those of females.\n  Firearms are currently the most often utilized method of suicide by \nessentially all groups--that is males, females, young, old, white, \nnonwhite--and the rates are increasing.\n  Suicide rates have traditionally decreased in times of wars and \nincreased in times of economic crises.\n  Rates of suicide are highest among the older adult population above \n65. Last year I was pleased to call for a Senate Special Committee on \nAging hearing which addressed this issue.\n\n  Elderly adults have rates of suicide more than 50 percent higher than \nthe Nation as a whole and the young--15 to 24.\n  Youth--15 to 24 years of age--suicide rates increased more than 200 \npercent from the 1950's to the late 1970's. Following the late 1970's \nthe rates for youth have remained stable or slightly lower, although \ncurrent rates are also approximately 200 percent higher than in the \n1950's.\n  For young people 15 to 24 years old, suicide is the third leading \ncause of death, behind unintentional injury and homicide. In 1992 more \nteenagers and young adults died from suicide than died from cancer, \nheart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia and influenza, \nand chronic lung disease combined.\n  The risk for suicide among young people is greater among young white \nmales; however, from 1980 through 1992, suicide rates increased most \nrapidly among young black males. Although suicide among children is a \nrare event, the dramatic increase in the rate among persons 10 to 14 \nyears of age underscores the urgent need for intensifying efforts to \nprevent suicide among persons in this age group.\n  Although there are no official statistics on attempted suicide, it is \ngenerally estimated that there are at least 8 to 20 attempts for each \ndeath by suicide.\n  Risk of attempted suicide is greatest among females and the young. \nFemales have generally been found to make 3 to 4 times as many attempts \nas males. Estimate of the ratio of young attempted suicides to suicidal \ndeaths have generally ranged between 100 to 1 and 200 to 1.\n  Mental health diagnoses are generally associated with higher risk of \nsuicide. Groups/diagnoses at particular risk are the depressed, \nschizophrenics, alcoholics, and those with panic disorder.\n  Feelings of hopelessness--that is ``there are no solutions to my \nproblem''--are found to be more predictive of suicide risk than \ndiagnoses of depression per se.\n  The socially isolated are generally found to be at high risk for \nsuicide.\n  The vast majority of those who are suicidal display clues and warning \nsigns.\n  It is estimated that at least 4.0 million Americans today are \nsurvivors of a loved one's suicide.\n  Mr. President, suicide is preventable. Most suicidal persons \ndesperately want to live. They are just unable to see alternatives to \ntheir problems.\n  Understanding and identifying the risk factors for this phenomenon \nand evaluating potential suicide prevention interventions must become a \npublic health priority.\n  Most suicidal persons give definite warnings of their suicidal \nintentions, but others are either unaware of the significance of these \nwarnings or do not know how to respond to them.\n  We can and must do something about this preventable public health \ntragedy. It is irresponsible and insensitive to allow families and \nvictims to suffer in silence or to nationally hide our heads in the \nsand.\n  By acknowledging the problem, we take the critical first step to \ndoing something about it.\n  This week in Washington one such survivor, Mr. Jerry Weyrauch, who \nlost his 34-year-old physician daughter to suicide, is taking his \npersonal loss and turning it into an opportunity for all Americans.\n  He has formed a group called the Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network \n[SPAN] which calls for a national suicide prevention strategy. While in \nWashington his group will deliver over 20,000 signed petitions from 47 \nStates to Members of Congress calling for action.\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\n  His efforts are a classic American story of how one person with a \ncause can make a difference. I am pleased to see democracy work in such \na commendable manner. This is indeed how our Government was set up to \nwork and I am pleased to support his efforts, and those of SPAN, on \nbehalf of so many Americans.\n  It is time to lift the veil of secrecy and begin the effort to heal \nthe wounds and take the steps to prevent unnecessary loss of life.\n  It is time to continue the effort for mental health parity and ensure \nall who need assistance, get the assistance they need, without stigma.\n  The resolution I submit today with my colleagues I hope will be the \nfirst step in focussing awareness on the need for suicide prevention \nand addressing the need for a national strategy. No life should be lost \nwhen there is an opportunity to prevent its loss.\n\n  Not one of the nearly 31,000 lives lost to suicide annually is \ninsignificant. These are the children, parents, grandparents, brothers, \nsisters, friends, coworkers, and neighbors of each and every one of us.\n  Few of us can say we do not know someone who has been personally \ntouched by this tragedy.\n  I lost my father to suicide many years ago. I also know of several \nothers who have just recently experienced the loss of a loved one to \nsuicide.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to submit this resolution today and hope \nmy colleagues will join me in taking the first step to making a \ndifference in this very preventable public health tragedy.\n  I intend to offer legislation this session which will be vital in \ntaking a necessary first step by calling for the establishment of \ninjury control research centers which will deal exclusively with the \nsubject of suicide. We need a focal point where we can develop \nexpertise on suicide and share this expertise with others interested in \ngetting involved.\n  I am pleased to lend my voice to this worthy cause and I am very \nhappy to have Senator's Murray, Wellstone, and Coverdell joining me in \nthis effort.\n  I would also like to thank Jerry Weyrauch from SPAN and Dr. Lanny \nBerman from the American Association of Suicidology and Dr. Jane \nPearson from the National Institute of Mental Health for their \nleadership in this field.\n  I also want to acknowledge the countless professionals and volunteers \nacross America who staff the crisis call lines; facilitate the \nworkshops and support groups determined to help survivors go forward \nafter such a loss; organize and implement prevention programs; conduct \nthe research and evaluation to understand the causes of suicidal \nbehavior; provide the treatment and support; and the many brave \nfamilies and survivors who go on helping others to put the pieces back \ntogether again.\n  Mr. President, we have before us today an opportunity to take the \ncritical first step. I hope my colleagues will join me by \noverwhelmingly supporting this Senate resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4012-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 84--RECOGNIZING SUICIDE AS A NATIONAL PROBLEM\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. \nBreaux, and Ms. Landrieu) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 84\n\n       Whereas suicide, the ninth leading cause of all deaths in \n     the United States and the third such cause for young persons \n     ages 15 through 24, claims over 31,000 lives annually, more \n     than homicide;\n       Whereas suicide attempts, estimated to exceed 750,000 \n     annually, adversely impact the lives of millions of family \n     members;\n       Whereas suicide completions annually cause over 200,000 \n     family members to grieve over and mourn a tragic suicide \n     death for the first time, thus creating a population of over \n     4,000,000 such mourners in the United States;\n       Whereas the suicide completion rate per 100,000 persons has \n     remained relatively stable over the past 40 years for the \n     general population, and that rate has nearly tripled for \n     young persons;\n       Whereas that suicide completion rate is highest for adults \n     over 65;\n       Whereas the stigma associated with mental illness works \n     against suicide prevention by keeping persons at risk of \n     completing suicide from seeking lifesaving help;\n       Whereas the stigma associated with suicide deaths seriously \n     inhibits surviving family members from regaining meaningful \n     lives;\n       Whereas suicide deaths impose a huge unrecognized and \n     unmeasured economic burden on the United States in terms of \n     potential years of life lost, medical costs incurred, and \n     work time lost by mourners;\n       Whereas suicide is a complex, multifaceted biological, \n     sociological, psychological, and societal problem;\n       Whereas even though many suicides are currently \n     preventable, there is still a need for the development of \n     more effective suicide prevention programs;\n       Whereas suicide prevention opportunities continue to \n     increase due to advances in clinical research, in mental \n     disorder treatments, and in basic neuroscience, and due to \n     the development of community-based initiatives that await \n     evaluation; and\n       Whereas suicide prevention efforts should be encouraged to \n     the maximum extent possible: Now, therefore, be it\n           Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes suicide as a national problem and declares \n     suicide prevention to be a national priority;\n       (2) acknowledges that no single suicide prevention program \n     or effort will be appropriate for all populations or \n     communities;\n       (3) encourages initiatives dedicated to--\n       (A) preventing suicide;\n       (B) responding to people at risk for suicide and people who \n     have attempted suicide;\n       (C) promoting safe and effective treatment for persons at \n     risk for suicidal behavior;\n       (D) supporting people who have lost someone to suicide; and\n       (E) developing an effective national strategy for the \n     prevention of suicide; and\n       (4) encourages the development, and the promotion of \n     accessibility and affordability, of mental health services, \n     to enable all persons at risk for suicide to obtain the \n     services, without fear of any stigma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4013-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4013-S4033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       WELLSTONE AMENDMENT NO. 57\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 672) making \nsupplemental appropriations and rescissions for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 1997, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 47, strike line 19 and all that follows \n     through page 48, line 12.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       WESSSTONE AMENDMENT NO. 58\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 672, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n       Sec. 326.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Protection from \n     Violent Programming Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television influences children's perception of the \n     values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n     society.\n       (2) Broadcast television, cable television, and video \n     programming are--\n       (A) uniquely pervasive presences in the lives of all \n     American children; and\n       (B) are readily accessible to all American children.\n       (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does \n     indecent programming.\n       (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming at a young age have a higher \n     tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later \n     in life than those children not so exposed.\n       (5) Children exposed to violent video programming are prone \n     to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and \n     therefore to imitate such behavior.\n       (6) Children exposed to violent video programming have an \n     increased fear of becoming a victim of violence, resulting in \n     increased self-protective behaviors and increased mistrust of \n     others.\n       (7) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting \n     the negative influences of violent video programming on \n     children.\n       (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n     channeling programming with violent content to periods of the \n     day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial \n     portion of the television audience.\n       (9) Age-based ratings systems do not allow parents to block \n     programming based solely on violent content thereby rendering \n     ineffective any technology-based blocking mechanism designed \n     to limit violent video programming.\n       (10) If programming is not rated specifically for violent \n     content and therefore cannot be blocked solely on the basis \n     of its violent content, then restricting the hours when \n     violent video programming is shown is the least restrictive \n     and most narrowly tailored means to achieve a compelling \n     governmental interest.\n       (11) Studies show that warning labels based on age \n     restrictions tend to encourage children's desire to watch \n     restricted programming.\n       (12) Technology-based solutions may be helpful in \n     protecting some children, but may not be effective in \n     achieving the compelling governmental interest in protecting \n     all children from violent programming when parents are only \n     able to block programming based on the age of the child and \n     not on the violent content of the programming.\n       (13) Absent the ability to block programming based \n     specifically on the violent content of the programming, the \n     channeling of violent programming is the least restrictive \n     means to limit unsupervised children from the harmful \n     influences of violent programming.\n       (14) Restricting the hours when violent programming can be \n     shown protects the interests of children whose parents are \n     unavailable, unable to supervise their children's viewing \n     behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based \n     solutions, or unable to afford the costs of technology-based \n     solutions.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNLAWFUL DISTRIBUTION OF VIOLENT VIDEO PROGRAMMING.\n\n       Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 701 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 718.

As part of that proceeding, the Commission--\n       ``(1) may exempt from the prohibition under subsection (a) \n     programming (including new programs and sporting events) \n     whose distribution does not conflict with the objective of \n     protecting children from the negative influences of violent \n     video programming, as that objective is reflected in the \n     findings in section 551(a) of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996;\n       ``(2) shall exempt premium and pay-per-view cable \n     programming; and\n       ``(3) shall define the term `hours when children are \n     reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the \n     audience' and the term `violent video programming'.\n       ``(c) Repeat Violations.--If a person repeatedly violates \n     this section or any regulation promulgated under this \n     section, the Commission shall, after notice and opportunity \n     for hearing, immediately revoke any license issued to that \n     person under this Act.\n       ``(d) Consideration Of Violations In License Renewals.--The \n     Commission shall consider, among the elements in its review \n     of an application for renewal of a license under this Act, \n     whether the licensee has complied with this section and the \n     regulations promulgated under this section.\n       ``(e) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       ``(1) Blockable by electronic means.--The term `blockable \n     by electronic means' means blockable by the feature described \n     in section 303(x).\n       ``(2) Distribute.--The term `distribute' means to send, \n     transmit, retransmit, telecast, broadcast, or cablecast, \n     including by wire, microwave, or satellite.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, in the fall of 1940, Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt was attempting something audacious, unprecendented in \nAmerican history--running for a third term as President. His opponent, \nWendell Wilke of Indiana, a man with whom he would attempt to forge an \nalliance 4 years later, was gaining momentum. Roosevelt had waited \nuntil October to begin his formal campaign, but when he hit the trail, \nhe did with characteristic gusto.\n  ``I am an old campaigner,'' he told cheering audiences, ``and I love \na good fight.''\n  Mr. President, it was the love of the fight, not in the sense of \ncarrying a chip on one's shoulder, but more in the manner of relishing \na challenge to one's ideas and abilities, that marked Franklin \nRoosevelt's character. That spirit motivated him in his fight against \npolio, sustained him during many a dark hour in the White House during \nthe Depression and the Second World War and infused itself into his \nconcept of a government that shrugged off old models of action--or \ninaction --and engaged in bold, persistent experimentation, seeking the \nbest solutions for the pressing problems of the Nation.\n  His administration did many things considered audacious in \nWashington, including the creation of then-radical programs like Social \nSecurity. It is well-documented that one of the sources for some of \nRoosevelt's bold experimentation was the Progressive tradition in \nWisconsin, which pioneered unemployment insurance and workers' \ncompensation.\n  Mr. President, Franklin Roosevelt sometimes succeeded gloriously. \nSometimes he failed. Sometimes he was helped by a fortuitous turn of \nevents; other times, events frustrated his purposes. Through it all, \nhowever, he kept trying, kept experimenting, fueled by a restless \nintellect, guided by the constitutional responsibility of government to \npromote the general welfare of the people, and supported by a bedrock \nconviction that an honest attempt would, at the very least, yield a \nuseful lesson and might well solve the problem.\n  Mr. President, last week we dedicated the Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nMemorial, a celebration of his memory, his accomplishments and, perhaps \nmost importantly, his spirit. He was a man of enormous complexity and \nenergy who embraced life and encouraged others to follow his example. \nHis philosophy of encouraging boldness and creativity in the service of \nthe common good and his insistence on an inclusive, not exclusive \npolitics will serve us well in any time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4034-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO JOSHUA GAGNON FOR BEING NEW HAMPSHIRE'S CHAMPION ACROSS \n                                AMERICA\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to 10-year-old Joshua Gagnon from Merrimack, NH, for being \nchosen the New Hampshire champion by the Champions Across America \nProgram of the Children's Miracle Network.\n  These champions are children who have triumphed over life-threatening \nhealth problems. Joshua, along with champions from other States, will \nrepresent the 7 million children treated at children's hospitals each \nyear.\n  Joshua was only 3 years old when his family discovered his illness. \nAn MRI revealed that he suffered from the Dandy Walker syndrome, which \nrequired an extensive shunt that extended from his brain to his \nstomach. In the past 7 years the shunt, which is susceptible to \nclogging, has required three replacements.\n  Another surgery Joshua had undergone was to correct a condition known \nas Streeter's dysplasia. The Genesis fund, which funds the National \nBirth Defects Center, made it possible for Joshua's webbed fingers and \ntoes to be reshaped by a plastic/reconstructive surgeon. Even though he \nonly has use of his ring finger and his pinky finger on his right hand, \nJoshua writes very well and loves to assemble model airplanes and cars.\n  Like any other boy his age, Joshua has many hobbies, such as reading, \nriding his mountain bike and playing basketball. He is very inquisitive \nand his sense of humor gives his mother many reasons to laugh.\n  Mr. President, I want to call attention to the uniqueness of \nchildren's health care and the importance of non-profit hospitals for \nchildren. Joshua is an inspiring example for children and their \nfamilies to fight the battle and beat the odds. He and the other \nchampions show children in New Hampshire and across the Nation how to \npursue a happy life, despite their illness. I am proud to represent \nJoshua in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4034-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4034-S4035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DR. NAN S. HUTCHISON BROWARD SENIOR HALL OF FAME INDUCTEES\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize and \ncongratulate a group of outstanding citizens from Broward County. These \nmen and women have each given a great gift to their communities--they \nhave given of themselves.\n  Samuel Bonier, of Sunrise, has spent the last 4 years volunteering at \nthe Daniel D. Cantor Senior Center. His activities include serving as \nan assistant bookkeeper, mail clerk and needed friend to the center's \nresidents. Samuel is also concerned about the community's children and \nhas donated his time to help feed and bathe children in the Ann Storch \nCenter. For his selfless actions Samuel was awarded the Volunteer of \nthe Month Award in 1994 by the Cantor Center.\n  Pearl Canady, of Fort Lauderdale, imparted her wisdom to countless \nstudents as a teacher for over 30 years in the Broward County School \nSystem. Pearl continues to serve her community as a member of the Area \nAgency on Aging's Advisory Council. Pearl's generous spirit has \nenhanced the lives of many.\n  Daniel D. Cantor, of Tamarac, is one of Broward County's leading \nJewish community leaders. Daniel has been active in countless Jewish \norganizations, including the Jewish National Fund, Israel Bonds and \nUnited Jewish Appeal. He was indispensable in the campaign to help \nresettle Russian Jewry in Israel and in the United States.\n  Marie Antoinette Capazzi, of Plantation, has served as Social \nDirector for the Senior Club of Plantation for over 20 years. Marie has \nalso worked with the Red Cross distributing food to the needy. Because \nof her service to the community, May 11, 1983 was declared Marie \nCapazzi day by the city of Plantation. Marie was also acknowledged as \n1996 Citizen of the Year by the Plantation Elks Club.\n  Chris Franklin, of Pompano Beach, has been a tireless advocate for \nthe elderly. Chris has been extremely active with the Florida Silver-\nHaired Legislature to insure that the rights of the elderly are \nprotected. Later this year Chris will be a delegate to the National \nCongress of Silver-Hairs.\n  Rickey Pine Garber, of Tamarac, works to improve relations between \nseniors and the police. She is involved in several organizations \nincluding Seniors and Lawmen Together and the Citizens Observation \nPatrol. Rickey also works with the Area Agency on Aging assisting both \nseniors and the young who are experiencing financial and social \ndistress.\n  Nat Geier, of Sunrise, volunteers his time to several organizations \nthroughout Broward County. As a result of his efforts in the Area \nAgency's Seniors for Seniors Dollar Drive, Nat has raised over $700 \nevery year. In addition, Nat was instrumental in securing the first \ncomputers for Piper High School and Village Elementary.\n  David J. Mears, of Coral Springs, was instrumental in the founding of \nthe city of Margate. David has been called the founding father of \nMargate because of his active role in developing the eastern section of \nthe city. He has served as honorary mayor of Margate and is presently \npresident of the Gold Coast Chapter of the National Association of \nIndustrial and Office Parks.\n\n[[Page S4035]]\n\n  Angelo Quatrociocchi, of Cooper City, is an active volunteer at \nMemorial Manor, a residential home for seniors. His activities include \ntransporting residents to activities, assisting with meals, and playing \nhis accordion and harmonica for the residents.

For the past 10 years, Herman has been developing fundraising \nconcepts for the Area Agency on Agency. Herman also educates the \ncommunity's elderly on legislation that directly affects them.\n  Bertha Walker, a resident of Broward County for over 50 years, \ndevotes her time to improving the community. She chaperoned local \nstudents on field trips and has been recognized by the YMCA for her \ndedication to the community's youth. Her contributions to the area's \nyouth are appreciated by all.\n  Benjamin Wermiel, of Coconut Creek, has been contributing his time \nand energy to the community for 15 years.

I congratulate \nthem today and wish for them many more productive and healthy years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4034-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYERS SAY ``NO'' TO SPIT TOBACCO\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for far too long, tobacco and \nbaseball have been almost synonyous. Dipping or chewing tobacco has \nbeen one of the rituals of baseball. Batters stepping out of the \nbatters box to spit, fielders checking the pouch or tin tucked in their \nhip pocket, bullpen personnel having spitting contests--the fabric of \nbaseball has been colored by the mix of tobacco juice and spit that \naccompany the use of smokeless tobacco.\n  Unfortunately, even major league baseball superheroes can't avoid the \nconsequences of tobacco use. Players have found themselves addicted. \nWhat seemed to be a colorful and harmless ritual turned out to have a \ndeadly undertow. Many ballplayers have had to deal with serious oral \nhealth problems caused by tobacco use. Some have lost a jaw when oral \ncancer invaded. Some have lost their life.\n  Fortunately, the tide is turning. I was involved in an effort several \nyears ago to discourage the use of tobacco by ballplayers. It led to \nthe banning of smokeless tobacco use in the field and in the clubhouse \nat the collegiate level and throughout the minor leagues.\n  Only the major leagues remain open to smokeless tobacco use, and even \nthere the glorification of tobacco is subsiding. What the players and \nowners have been unwilling to mandate is gradually happening through \neducation and the example of ballplayers who have been willing to take \na stand. Smokeless tobacco use is on the decline.\n  Equally important, ballplayers are beginning to use their positions \nas role models for our Nation's youth to deliver the important message \nthat you don't have to chew or dip to be successful on the field.\n  I attended this year's opening day game at Comiskey Park, home of the \nChicago White Sox, and was pleased to see a full-page color ad with an \nimportant message. Beneath the pictures of one star from each major \nleague team was this message: ``We Agree! Chew, Dip, or Snuff Aren't \nPart of Our Game. Don't Make Spit Tobacco Part of Yours! Just Play the \nGame.''\n  This message was brought to the fans at Comiskey Park as a public \nservice by the Chicago White Sox and the National Spit Tobacco \nEducation Program, a program sponsored by ``Oral Health America.''\n  The National Spit Tobacco Education Program, or NSTEP, is a \nmultimedia, multiyear campaign to communicate to the American public \nthat spit tobacco is not a safe alternative to cigarettes. This year, \nthe initiative includes television and radio public service \nannouncements during baseball broadcasts, an educational outreach to \nbroadcasters and writers, in-stadium outreaches to the fans including \nscoreboard video messages, and intervention efforts to help current \nplayers who need assistance in quitting their use of spit tobacco.\n\n  This program is desperately needed. Spit tobacco leads to nicotine \naddiction, gum disease, and tooth loss, as well as mouth and throat \ncancer. Oral cancer is diagnosed in 30,000 people annually and kills \napproximately 8,000 people annually.\n  While spit tobacco used to be used primarily by older men, boys and \nyoung men are now the primary consumers of this deadly product. In \nIllinois, 10 percent of junior high and high school boys have used \nsmokeless tobacco in the past month. Across the country, nearly 20 \npercent of high school boys are current users of spit tobacco, and the \naverage age at which children first try the product is under age 10.\n  Moreover, the link between baseball and tobacco exists not only in \nthe major leagues, but in the little leagues as well. According to a \nstudy by the Illinois Department of Public Health, 70 percent of \nchildren who report regular use of smokeless tobacco are members of \norganized sports teams.\n  The NSTEP program is an important part of the effort to reverse this \ntrend and help our youngsters and budding all-stars to get off to a \nhealthy tobacco-free start in life.\n  I would also like to commend the Chicago White Sox for their refusal \nto permit tobacco advertising at Comiskey Park.\n  The tobacco companies have used stadium billboards for two purposes: \nto promote their products to the fans in the seats and to get around \nthe television advertising ban to pitch their products to the millions \nof fans sitting at home watching the game on television. Obviously, \nmany of those fans are children --the very people the tobacco industry \nneeds to hook on its products to maintain a steady base of customers.\n  Every year, the tobacco companies lose 2 million American customers. \nFour hundred thousand die of tobacco-related diseases and the rest quit \nsmoking or die of other causes. To replace those smokers, dippers, and \nchewers, they must turn to our children, because very few adults start \nthe dangerous practice of tobacco use.\n  The decision by the White Sox to forego the profits associated with \ntobacco advertising is an important step that helps reduce the barrage \nof marketing that reaches our Nation's children. Both that decision and \nthe ballplayers' campaign against spit tobacco send an important \nmessage: that baseball and tobacco don't mix.\n  I applaud these actions by the players and the team, and I encourage \nevery player and every team to follow these good examples.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4035-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4035-S4036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR AND ROENA MOSES ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Arthur and Roena Moses from Sanbornton, NH, on the \ncelebration of their 50th wedding anniversary.\n  Arthur and Roena were united in marriage on March 2, 1947, in a \ndouble ring ceremony at the Congregational Church in South Danbury, NH. \nAfter a motor trip honeymoon around New England, the couple made their \nhome in Sanbornton and have lived there for the past 50 years.\n  Arthur and Roena raised four children, Eugene, Gail, Jeffrey, and \nBarry Moses. Roena Moses grew up in South Danbury. She attended local \nschools and graduated from Franklin High School in 1945. She worked in \nthe Franklin Public Library, and then for Cormier Hosiery until she \nretired in 1985. Today she spends her time knitting garments for \nnewborn babies, and enjoys doing puzzles, camping, playing games, and \nvisiting with all her friends. Roena has also contributed to the arts \nand crafts program at the Shaker Village in Canterbury, NH.\n  Arthur has lived his whole life in Sanbornton. He grew up at a farm \nand was a farmer for 40 years. He also worked for the New Hampshire \nDepartment of Transportation [DOT] in the maintenance division 3. \nArthur retired in 1985 after working for 25 years at the same Tilton \nDOT location.\n  Arthur and Roena both enjoy camping. For the last several years Roena\n\n[[Page S4036]]\n\nhas been elected president and trail boss of the North American Family \nCampers Association [NAFCA] where she and her husband are charter \nmembers. Their journeys have taken them all over the United States, \nmaking friends wherever they go.\n  On March 2, 1997, Arthur and Roena celebrated their 50th wedding \nanniversary in the vestry of Sanbornton's First Baptist Church.\n  Mr. President, Arthur and Roena Moses provide an inspiring example of \nthe joys of marriage. I am pleased to congratulate them on the \ncelebration of their 50th wedding anniversary and I wish them luck and \nhappiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4035-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PATRICK H. WINDHAM\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to pay a tribute to an \nindividual who, in his service as a staff member in the U.S. Senate, \nhas exemplified the qualities we all look for in a public servant, \ncolleague, and human being. Patrick H. Windham just completed well over \na decade of service in the Senate, always in some association with the \nSenator of South Carolina, Senator Hollings, whom he holds in such \nobvious and deep esteem. Pat and his family are relocating to \nCalifornia to begin new professional opportunities. He will be sorely \nmissed here by a wide range of admirers and colleagues in the Senate, \nthe Clinton administration, and the extensive circle of people and \norganizations concerned with the issues that Pat has been so intensely \ninvolved with.\n  Educated at Stanford and Berkeley, and dubbed the ``Godfather of \nScience and Tech'' by colleagues, Pat began his public service career \nin 1982 as a legislative assistant to Senator Hollings. Two years \nlater, Pat was assigned to the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and \nSpace and since has served as a invaluable senior advisor on this \nextensive range of issues to various members of the committee. Over the \nyears, Pat has served with strong loyalty to the Senate and dedication \nto the public policy interests of the country as a whole.\n  My relationship with Pat stems from my own service as a member of the \nSenate Commerce Committee, and when I became chairman of the Science \nSubcommittee. With Pat assigned to the subcommittee, we have worked \nclosely for years on legislative endeavors and the issues that fall in \nthis jurisdiction. No one matches Pat's breadth of expertise, \nprofessional dedication, and personal commitment. I feel highly \nfortunate to be the beneficiary of his extensive talent and \ncontributions.\n  Pat Windham's involvement in science and technology policy and \nlegislation could fill volumes. Pat was instrumental in the 1988 \nconversion of the National Bureau of Standards [NBS] into the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology [NIST]. He strongly advocated \nexpanding the mission of the old NBS. Thanks in large part to Pat \nWindham, NIST's mission now explicitly includes enhancing the \ncompetitiveness of American companies by providing appropriate \ngovernmental support for industry's development of precompetitive \ngeneric technologies and diffusing Government-developed technological \nadvances to use in all segments of the American economy. Pat has \ntirelessly continued his involvement in framing NIST's role in U.S. \npolicy in today's era of cutbacks.\n  Pat also contributed heavily to the development of The Advanced \nTechnology Program [ATP] and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \n[MEP]. Each of these programs grew out of real concerns over the \ncompetitiveness of American companies in the global marketplace. \nCreated by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, ATP \nencourages public and private cooperation in the development of \nprecompetitive technologies with broad application across industries. \nPat argued fiercely for retaining this successful program in the face \nof last Congress' attempt at eliminating this public-private industrial \npartnership. His dedication to these issues certainly contributed to \nthe President's support of the ATP program, and its continued success. \nThe Clinton administration's strong support of a program led to an \nincrease in ATP funding in fiscal year 1997. And, today, the ATP awards \nalmost 300 public-private partnership projects.\n\n  Pat Windham's contributions do not end here. He has been involved in \ntechnology-related projects including efforts promoting national metric \nconversion. He has steadfastly encouraged and promoted the translation \nof Japanese scientific and technological documents for use by \nscientists and engineers across the globe. His public policy concerns \nalso have included legislative efforts to ensure that foreign-component \nparts meet U.S. standards for quality.\n  The Senate, and that includes me in particular, will miss Pat and his \nsuperb abilities as we address the vital issues in which he has been \npart. His dedication and loyalty have served as a role model for all \nthose around him. On behalf of my own staff and myself, I offer good \nwishes to him and feel confident Pat will continue making a vital \ncontribution to his fellow citizens and the country in his next \nchapter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4036-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING STUDENTS FROM OUR LADY OF LOURDES ACADEMY IN MIAMI, FL\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate some \nvery bright and promising students from the State of Florida who \nvisited our Nation's Capitol last week to participate in the ``We the \nPeople * * *'' nationwide championship on the U.S. Constitution and \nBill of Rights. I am pleased to announce that students attending the \nOur Lady of Lourdes Academy in Miami finished in first place.\n  At the 3-day competition, students demonstrated their knowledge of \nthe Constitution, U.S. history, and current issues facing our Nation. \nTheir diligent preparation and impressive demonstration of their \nknowledge propelled them to first place.\n  Led by their teacher, Rosie Hefferman, the following students \ncompeted on behalf of the Our Lady of Lourdes Academy: Melissa Alvarez, \nSonia Borell, Jackie Chisholm, Annette Comas, Caroline DePosada, Dania \nFyffe, Vanessa Harries, Jaqui Lage, Carolina Latour, Alicia Llosa, \nGiselle Perez, Jennifer Rodriguez, and Caroline Ulvert. I would also \nlike to recognize the district coordinator, John Doyle, and the State \ncoordinator, Annette Boyd Pitts.\n  I extend my sincere congratulations to these fine students, their \nfamilies, and their teachers. They worked hard to achieve this \nimpressive goal. Their parents and teachers long realized that \neducation is an investment in our future and critical to our Nation's \ngrowth, and these students have acted on that sentiment. Students \naround the country should view their accomplishment as an inspiration \nas they seek to achieve their own goals.\n  I hope the students from Our Lady of Lourdes Academy enjoyed their \nexperience while visiting Washington, DC, and that they will continue \nstriving to excel in their studies. I wish them all the best in their \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4036-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4036-S4037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JAMES R. THOMAS, JR.\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nrecognize James R. Thomas Jr., a civil engineer from Salisbury, MD, \nwhich I am proud to say is my hometown. Jim, who commands universal \nrespect as a leader in both his profession and his community, will be \ninstalled on May 14 as president of the American Consulting Engineers \nCouncil.\n  As managing partner of the Salisbury engineering and architectural \nfirm, George, Miles & Buhr, Jim's reputation as a dynamic and capable, \nyet modest, leader precedes him as he assumes the helm of the Nation's \nlargest professional association focusing on the business interests of \nconsulting engineers.\n  ACEC is comprised of 52 State and regional member organizations and \nrepresents 5,500 independent firms, which employ almost 200,000 \nprofessionals nationwide.\n  No stranger to ACEC, Jim served as a national director, then vice \npresident, prior to his selection last year as president-elect. He has \nadvanced steadily through the ranks of the organization, first with the \nConsulting Engineers Council of Maryland [CEC/MD], where he served in \nall the leadership posts, from secretary to president. His strong \ncommitment to these professional organizations is clearly evident.\n  Jim has spent the last 28 years at George, Miles & Buhr, the largest \ncivil\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\nengineering firm on the Delmarva Peninsula. The firm, which employs \nabout 50 people, specializes in water and wastewater treatment systems \nand devotes 80 percent of its time to engineering projects. In 1993, \nGeorge, Miles & Buhr received Engineering Excellence Awards from both \nACEC and CEC/MD for its design of a biological nutrient removal \ndemonstration plant at the Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant in \nBaltimore.\n  In addition to his professional achievements, Jim is a most dedicated \nand effective public servant.\n  His pro bono work on a crisis center for battered spouses earned him \nthe honor of Rotarian of the Year in 1995. He is currently a director \nof the Salisbury Area Chamber of Commerce. In addition, Jim has served \nas president of the board at Trinity United Methodist Church and as a \nmember of the boards of the Peninsula Regional Medical Center, the \nUnited Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, and the Salisbury-Wicomico \nEconomic Development Corp. He has also been a long-time supporter of \nthe Holly Center Foundation for the severely retarded.\n  As a parent and strong supporter of the public school system, Jim has \nserved as president of the PTA's of both Fruitland Elementary and \nBennett Middle Schools, where he and his wife, Kaye, sent their three \nchildren Andy, Tricia, and Betsy. For his efforts, the Maryland PTA \ngave Jim the Gold Seal Award.\n  Jim also has been honored by the Governor's Salute to Excellence. \nBoth the United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore and the Holly Center \nFoundation have named him Volunteer of the Year. These honors are only \na sampling of the many he has received in a lifetime of stellar \ncommunity service.\n  A native of Cambridge, MD, and a graduate of the University of \nMaryland, College Park, where he earned his B.S. in civil engineering, \nthe Salisbury community is truly fortunate to have claimed Jim Thomas \nfor its own.\n  As ACEC's next president, Jim follows in the footsteps of another \nMarylander, Andrew J. Parker Jr., who was ACEC president from 1990-91. \nLikening the ACEC position to that of CEO of a large corporation--\nwithout the pay--Parker praised the leadership abilities of his \nSalisbury colleague last week.\n  Mr. President, in a newspaper interview, Jim Thomas said that his \nactivism in ACEC is rooted in a desire ``to give something back'' to \nthe profession. Clearly, he has already done so and, now, as president \nof the ACEC, he will have a further opportunity to make a contribution. \nIt is gratifying to see him accorded this national recognition. I wish \nhim continued success in this, and all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4036-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO GERALDINE SYLVESTER ON HER RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Geraldine Sylvester of Dover on her retirement after 25 \nyears of service to Dover and the State of New Hampshire. Geraldine has \nended a distinguished career as a State health leader, city councilor, \nbusinesswoman, educator and mother.\n  Gerry has been my friend for more than a decade. She grew up in \nMilton and graduated from Nute High School. She and her husband Bob \nraised 5 daughters and 2 sons and now have 16 grandchildren.\n  Geraldine served seven consecutive terms as a Dover city councilor \nbeginning in 1970. In 1974-75 she also served as mayor. Geraldine \nofficially retired as director of New Hampshire's Office of Alcohol and \nDrug Abuse Prevention in December 1996, which was the single State \nauthority for substance abuse problems in New Hampshire. Geraldine was \nappointed for this post in 1983 by former Gov. John Sununu, and \ncontinued her service under Governors Judd Gregg and Steve Merrill.\n  Gerry is a woman of many talents who approaches any challenge with \ndetermination. She served in miscellaneous local, State, and Federal \npositions, such as the National Advisory Committee on Alcohol and Drug \nAbuse and Mental Health Problems. In 1980 she was a delegate to the \nNational Republican Convention, chairwoman of the New Hampshire Small \nBusiness Advisory Council in 1978, and from 1976 to 1981 she became \ntrustee of the New Hampshire Youth Development Center.\n  Gerry and Bob are also humanitarians. Their compassion is illustrated \nin the fact that, for 12 years, the Sylvester home was a group home for \nphysically and emotionally distraught minors in the seacoast of New \nHampshire.\n  Gerry and Bob founded GFS Manufacturing in 1971 in the garage of \ntheir house. Through the energy, dedication, and drive of Gerry and her \nfamily, the business grew and prospered. In 1978 they were named \ncitizens of the year by the Greater Dover Chamber of Commerce.\n  Mr. President, Geraldine Sylvester has dedicated her time, talent, \nand energy to serving the residents of Dover in an exemplary way. I am \nproud to honor her outstanding community commitment, which is so \nimportant to the future and prosperity of Dover. We are indeed indebted \nto Gerry for her efforts. I thank her for her 25 years of dedicated \nservice, commend her for an extraordinary job and say that I am \nprivileged to call her my friend. I wish her every happiness and health \nfor the years to come as she embraces retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4037-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE GOOD WORK OF FOUR BIG TIMBER GRADE SCHOOL STUDENTS\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very proud today to tell my \ncolleagues in the Senate about four students from my home State of \nMontana: Ariel Overstreet, Amber Overstreet, Lindsey Hauge, and Taylor \nGray. These young Montanans won first place in two separate NASA-\nsponsored national contests. Ariel took first place in the \nIntergalactic Art Contest in which she had to draw an original piece of \nart. Amber, Lindsey, and Taylor made up a team that took first place in \nthe Future Aircraft/Spacecraft design competition. I congratulate them \non their achievements.\n  These students have proven what most of us in Montana have known all \nalong. Montana students are some of the brightest and best educated \nstudents in the country. And while we are proud of our students, we \nknow that a lot of the credit must go to devoted teachers like Rolland \nKarlin and concerned parents like Anne Overstreet. These are the people \nbehind the scenes who make sure that the education our children receive \nis top-notch.\n  Ariel, Amber, Lindsey, and Taylor are now visiting Washington, as \npart of their award. I was pleased to have a chance to meet them. They \nare fine representatives of Montana and their community of Big Timber.\n  Later on in their trip, these four youngsters will be visiting NASA's \nspace camp. I hope that the opportunity to view NASA technology up \nclose will feed their active minds.\n  Congratulations Ariel, Amber, Lindsey, and Taylor. I hope you enjoy \nyour trip. And that you never lose your desire to achieve your \ndreams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4037-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDER FOR MEASURE TO BE PRINTED--S. 104\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Res. 84\n\n       Whereas suicide, the ninth leading cause of all deaths in \n     the United States and the third such cause for young persons \n     ages 15 through 24, claims over 31,000 lives annually, more \n     than homicide;\n       Whereas suicide attempts, estimated to exceed 750,000 \n     annually, adversely impact the lives of millions of family \n     members;\n       Whereas suicide completions annually cause over 200,000 \n     family members to grieve over and mourn a tragic suicide \n     death for the first time, thus creating a population of over \n     4,000,000 such mourners in the United States;\n       Whereas the suicide completion rate per 100,000 persons has \n     remained relatively stable over the past 40 years for the \n     general population, and that rate has nearly tripled for \n     young persons;\n       Whereas that suicide completion rate is highest for adults \n     over 65;\n       Whereas the stigma associated with mental illness works \n     against suicide prevention by keeping persons at risk of \n     completing suicide from seeking lifesaving help;\n       Whereas the stigma associated with suicide deaths seriously \n     inhibits surviving family members from regaining meaningful \n     lives;\n       Whereas suicide deaths impose a huge unrecognized and \n     unmeasured economic burden on the United States in terms of \n     potential years of life lost, medical costs incurred, and \n     work time lost by mourners;\n       Whereas suicide is a complex, multifaceted biological, \n     sociological, psychological, and societal problem;\n       Whereas even though many suicides are currently \n     preventable, there is still a need for the development of \n     more effective suicide prevention programs;\n       Whereas suicide prevention opportunities continue to \n     increase due to advances in clinical research, in mental \n     disorder treatments, and in basic neuroscience, and due to \n     the development of community-based initiatives that await \n     evaluation; and\n       Whereas suicide prevention efforts should be encouraged to \n     the maximum extent possible: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognize suicide as a national problem and declares \n     suicide prevention to be a national priority;\n       (2) acknowledges that no single suicide prevention program \n     or effort will be appropriate for all populations or \n     communities;\n       (3) encourages initiatives dedicated to--\n       (A) preventing suicide;\n       (B) responding to people at risk for suicide and people who \n     have attempted suicide;\n       (C) promoting safe and effective treatment for persons at \n     risk for suicidal behavior;\n       (D) supporting people who have lost someone to suicide; and\n       (E) developing an effective national strategy for the \n     prevention of suicide; and\n       (4) encourages the development, and the promotion of \n     accessibility and affordability, of mental health services, \n     to enable all persons at risk for suicide to obtain the \n     services, without fear of any stigma.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification. I transmit herewith the Agreement Between the Government \nof the United States of America and the Government of Hong Kong on \nMutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, with Annex, signed in Hong \nKong on April 15, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Agreement''). \nI transmit also, for the information of the Senate, a related exchange \nof letters, with attached forms, signed the same date, and the report \nof the Department of State with respect to the Agreement.\n  The Agreement is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance \ntreaties that the United States is negotiating in order to counter \ncriminal activities more effectively. The Agreement should be an \neffective tool in our continued cooperation with Hong Kong after its \nreversion to the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China on July \n1, 1997, to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of modern \ncriminals, including members of drug cartels, ``white-collar'' \ncriminals, and terrorists. The Agreement is self-executing.\n  The Agreement provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal \nmatters. Mutual assistance available under the Agreement includes: (1) \ntaking evidence, testimony, or statements of persons, (2) providing \ninformation, documents, records, and items; (3) locating or identifying \npersons or items; (4) serving documents; (5) transferring persons in \ncustody and others to provide assistance; (6) executing requests for \nsearch and seizure; (7) confiscating and forfeiting the proceeds and \ninstrumentalities of crime and otherwise assisting in relation thereto; \n(8) delivering property, including lending exhibits or other items; and \n(9) and other form of assistance not prohibited by the law of the \nRequested Party.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Agreement and give its advice and consent to ratification so that \nthe Agreement can enter into force no later than July 1, 1997, when \nHong Kong reverts to the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, May 5, 1997.\n                                                                    ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Agreement Between the Government \nof the United States and the Government of Hong Kong for the Transfer \nof Sentenced Persons signed at Hong Kong on April 15, 1997. I transmit \nalso, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department \nof State with respect to this Agreement.\n  At present, transfers of sentenced persons between the United States \nand Hong Kong (in either direction) are conducted pursuant to the 1983 \nmultilateral Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced \nPersons, which is in force for both the United States and the United \nKingdom, and which the latter has extended to Hong Kong. Effective July \n1, 1997, however, when Hong Kong reverts to the sovereignty of the \nPeople's Republic of China, the Council of Europe Convention will no \nlonger provide a basis for such transfers.\n  The agreement signed on April 15, 1997, will provide a basis for such \ntransfers to continue after Hong Kong's reversion. The agreement is \nmodeled after both the Council of Europe Convention and other bilateral \nprisoner transfer treaties to which the United States is a party. It \nwould establish essentially the same procedures as are now followed \nwith respect to transfers of prisoners between the United States and \nHong Kong, and would continue the requirement that all transfers be \nconsented to by the sentencing state, the sentenced person, and the \nreceiving state. When the sentenced person has been sentenced under the \nlaws of a State of the United States, the consent to the authorities of \nthat State will also be required.\n  I recommend that the Senate of the United States promptly give its \nadvice and consent to the ratification of this Agreement.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, May 5, 1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4038-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4038-S4040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I go to the closing statement, I want \nto talk a little bit about where we are on the supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  We began the debate on the supplemental appropriations bill on \nMonday, yesterday, and we have been on it today. We did have one \nrecorded vote at about 2:30 this afternoon, I believe it was, and I \nexpected that we would continue then to work through the amendments, \nwith some recorded votes being\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\nrequired throughout the afternoon and even now late in the afternoon.\n  I understand some of the amendments are efforts to strike language in \nthe bill. Perhaps they have been worked out and we will have some \naccommodation, perhaps, on the census issue. I understand the amendment \nof Senator Wellstone was worked out in some way or the other, and he is \nnot going to offer his.\n  Then I received word that the Democrats decided they were not going \nto offer any more motions to strike, amendments to strike, or any \namendments, until something was worked out with regard to the emergency \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Mr. President, I say to the ladies and gentlemen of America, this is \nsupposed to be emergency supplemental appropriations. This is a piece \nof legislation, appropriations, to provide funds for our troops in \nBosnia--and the funds that are involved there have been offset in this \nbill--and to provide disaster assistance to States all across America \nthat have disaster needs.\n  What has happened? No. 1, the Democrats say, ``We're not going to \noffer any more amendments until we get our way. We want to change the \nbill that was reported out of the Appropriations Committee, and unless \nit is changed to suit our desires, we won't come forward with any more \namendments.''\n  Then, we have before the Senate 109 amendments--109 amendments. Now, \nare we serious about this supplemental emergency appropriations or not? \nI do not believe there are 109 problems existing in this supplemental \nappropriations bill. That is certainly not the way to get this \nlegislation moving quickly.\n  We will have a vote in the morning on cloture, I guess at 10 o'clock, \nto accommodate a request from the Democratic side. If we get cloture, \nthen there will be 30 hours left on the supplemental. Under the rules \nof the Senate, you can have up to 1 hour on an amendment. That is only \n30 amendments. There are 109 pending. I presume some of those will be \nwiped off the board if we get cloture.\n  I want to move the legislation. I am willing to work with the \nDemocrats and with the White House on the issues where they have \nconcerns, as we have on the census issue that has been before us.\n  But I want to serve notice now--and I am sending word to the \nDemocratic leader--that we are going to have a cloture vote in the \nmorning, but I am not filing another cloture motion tonight. I am not \ngoing to try to cut off debate on this supplemental. We need to get \nthis work done. If we do not get the cloture motion passed tomorrow, if \nwe do not invoke cloture and stop what appears to be sort of a slowdown \nfilibuster, then we will just go to other issues or we will stay on \nthis bill as long as it takes.\n  I have been told that we need to pass it right away because there are \nthousands of farmers and other people, small businesses in States in \nthe Midwest and in the Dakotas, and my own State of Mississippi, that \nare going to need this help. It is throughout the country--in the \nMidwest, in the South, in the Far West. And yet now we are ready to go. \nIt has been reported out of the Appropriations Committee last \nThursday--or maybe it was Wednesday--but we only had 1 day go by \nlegislatively before we brought this bill to the floor.\n  I want to emphasize, Republicans are ready to move this disaster \nrelief bill now. We can complete it tomorrow. We should complete it \ntomorrow so that we can then go on to the comp time/flextime bill and \ndo a little something to help the working mothers of America before we \nhave Mother's Day. But we are prepared to work on the disagreements.\n  The way it works is the Senate acts, the committee acts, and then the \nSenate acts. The House, by the way, has to complete their work before \nwe can pass the supplemental anyway. We go to conference and we \ncontinue to work out the disagreements.\n  The way it does not work is, if you do not get your way you stop, you \nknow, offering amendments and you slow down the process.\n  So we will have the cloture vote tomorrow, and hopefully we will have \nan agreement to cut off the filibuster and we can move this bill \nthrough. But I want to talk a minute about what the problem is.\n  The President has indicated that he does not want legislation \nincluded in the bill that would prevent or avert another Government \nshutdown. This is not something that just was discovered last year. We \nhave had problems over the years of getting to the end of the fiscal \nyear and Presidents or Congresses not being satisfied with the state of \nthe situation, and the President would veto a bill or the Congress \nwould not send a bill to the President. We would run out of funds, and \nyou would have these shutdowns.\n  We had them during the Reagan years. We had them during the Bush \nyears. And now we have had them during the Clinton years. I think this \nis an irresponsible way to do business. We need to work through the \nprocess, but we should not endanger the people with the threat of a \nmanmade disaster, which is what happens at the end of the fiscal year.\n  It does not have to be in this bill and it does not have to be a \nspecific way, but what we need to do is to make sure that the American \npeople know that we are working together on a budget agreement, we are \ngoing to be working together on the appropriations, each one of the 13 \nthat comes through, and that they will know what they can count on.\n  If you are in education, you want to know what part the Federal \nGovernment is going to pay on it; if you want to visit a national \nmonument, you would like to know that it is going to be open; if you \nare a private business man or woman, and you do business with some \nFederal facility, you would like to know that it is going to be open.\n  So all we want is some process that makes sure when we get to the end \nof this fiscal year that the numbers we have agreed to will be honored. \nBut in the process we are not going to go through these, what I \nconsider to be very irresponsible games, whether or not the Government \nis open or shut down.\n  So I hope that when we have--I am not going to file a cloture motion. \nI reiterate that. Generally speaking, if I do not have to file a \ncloture motion, that is well received. What I am saying is, we are \nready to go. We need to work on a number of amendments that are still \npending--amendments to change the bill, amendments to pay for the cost \nof the bill, amendments to strike various and sundry sections in the \nbill.\n\n  I think we have a good supplemental here the way it came out of \ncommittee. Probably nobody would say it was perfect. But it is time \nthat we work out the disagreements, have debate, have votes, and move \nto final passage. We can do that tomorrow, or we can do it Friday, or \nwe can do it some other time. But I want to make it clear that we are \nready to go and we are ready to have the debate and have the votes, and \nthen we will go on from there.\n  Mr. President, before I go to the closing script, would the Senator \nfrom South Dakota like to make some comments on these eloquent remarks \nI have been trying to deliver on this occasion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the chance to \nrespond to the eloquence of my friend, the majority leader. And indeed \nhis remarks are eloquent, although misinformed. And so I felt the need \nto come to the floor to clarify for the Record and for his information \nour position with regard to the bill.\n  First of all, there is no Democratic position with regard to not \noffering amendments. I do not know where that information was \ngenerated, but I must tell you our hope is to expedite consideration of \nthe bill.\n  The current amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, \nis being negotiated, as the majority leader indicated, and he was asked \nby Members on his side not to press for a vote until this can be \nnegotiated. So in compliance with the request from the Republicans, we \nhave not pursued a vote. But our desire is to offer amendments, to lay \nthis one aside if the need may be, but, regardless, to move the bill \nalong.\n  If a cloture motion is filed, I will encourage every member of our \ncaucus to support it. And my expectation is they\n\n[[Page S4040]]\n\nwill. So we want to work with the majority leader in getting this \nlegislation passed.\n  I share his concern about the large number of amendments. I urge our \ncolleagues to be prudent in offering amendments. I must say, some \npeople did not have the same opportunity as those in the committee to \noffer extraneous legislation. And that extraneous legislation is the \nsource of some concern to many of us. I am hopeful that negotiations \ncan lead ultimately to a successful elimination of many of these \nmatters prior to the time we reach final passage.\n  I do not want to shut the Government down either. We have been \nthrough some very difficult times in the past Congress with regard to \nshutting the Government down. If that were the only concern, I do not \nthink we would have a problem.\n  Our concern is the degree to which deep cuts are made in investments \nthat we have already negotiated. And really it renders null and void \nthe very budget agreement that I have enthusiastically endorsed that \nhas culminated from our discussions last week. To say we are going to \nagree to certain levels of investments, and then deeply cut those in \nthe very year that they were agreed upon, is not keeping very good \nfaith. That would be the first concern we have with regard to this \nparticular automatic continuing resolution provision.\n  The second concern was addressed by some of our colleagues on the \nother side, as reported in Inside Congress on April 18. It says \nRepublicans support the automatic continuing resolution because it, \nwould remove President Bill Clinton's upper hand in this year's budget \ntalks and remove his ability to influence current appropriations \nbills. Those kinds of statements cause us to be very wary, frankly, \nabout what the real motivation is here. We do not want to put the \nCongress on automatic pilot. We do not want to cut out the role the \nPresident ought to have as he negotiates with us what levels of \ninvestments we make in many of these areas. I do not know if there are \npolitical considerations here or not.\n\n  The best way with which to have a debate about this very important \npiece of legislation is to do it outside an emergency spending bill. I \nknow the majority leader is working in good faith to see if we can find \na reasonable compromise. I hope we can work together to make that \nhappen.\n  As to the bill itself, nothing could be more important than for us to \nsuccessfully conclude consideration of this legislation early this week \nand to get it off to the President as quickly as possible. The bill \nought to enjoy the support of every Member of this body. The sooner we \ncan get it off to the President, the better. The only way we can get it \noff to the President, without a veto, is to successfully conclude some \nnegotiation with regard to the continuing resolution and these other \nvery sticky issues that were not added on the floor but were added in \nthe committee, even though they are extraneous to this particular bill. \nWe would not be in the delay that we are now in were they not added in \nthe first place. Because they were added, we now have to deal with \nthat. They knew they were controversial when they were added, but they \nwere added anyway. Now we have to contend with it. We are doing our \nbest to work with the majority leader to do so successfully.\n  I thank the majority leader for his statement today and hope he will \nrecognize that there is no delay on our side with regard to the \nconsideration of this bill, and we will work with him as best we can \nunder these circumstances to get it done as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have to say I am very pleased to hear the \nDemocratic leader say they are not delaying and they do not intend to \ndelay. In this body, if you have one Senator who prefers not to vote \nfor a while, he can pretty much make that happen. But if it is the \nDemocratic leadership's intent not to delay, that is good news, and I \nam glad to hear that.\n  I presume, then, that based on that we will probably pass cloture \ntomorrow, and we can move on to dispense with the amendments that are \npending in a reasonable time.\n  I think the Senator probably has the list of amendments that have \nbeen filed. As a matter of fact, there are only about 9 or 10 that \nstate any purpose at all. Most of them have no statement of purpose on \nfile.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There are 54 Republican amendments out of the 120 \namendments filed.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thought it was 61 Democrats and 48 Republicans.\n  The point I am making is I have a list here, 10 amendments indicated \nby 1 on our side, with no statement of purpose, and on the next page, \n10 by your side. I think there is a lot of positioning and \nplaceholding, and we understand that is the way it happens around here. \nI think if we could get cloture passed tomorrow and then work through \nthe amendments that are still legitimately filed and we are concerned \nabout, we can get those done tomorrow and bring this to a conclusion. \nIf not tomorrow, at a reasonable time on Thursday so we can move on to \nother legislation. Of course, another thing, obviously, we would like \nto still hold the final passage until the House has acted. We may not \nactually be able to completely have the final passage until Thursday if \nthe House has not acted by Wednesday, but we could complete everything \nand then have final passage on Thursday.\n  Now, with regard to the quote about not wanting the President to have \nthe upper hand, that is right. I do not want him to have the upper \nhand. What we need to have is for nobody to have the upper hand. We \nneed to have coequal positions: Congress has a certain responsibility, \nand the President has a certain responsibility and advantages. We need \nto find a way to work through that, where neither side can hold the \nother hostage, neither side. I am hoping we will find a way to do that \nover the next 24 hours or next 2 days.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I am prepared to go to close.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4038-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4040-S4041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MAY 7, 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its \nbusiness today, it stand in adjournment until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on \nWednesday, May 7. I further ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, \nimmediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the \nmorning hour be granted, and the Senate then proceed to consideration \nof S. 672, the supplemental appropriations bill, and that there be 30 \nminutes equally divided between the chairman and ranking member. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that following the 30 minutes of debate, \nthe Senate then proceed to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on S. \n672, with the mandatory live quorum waived.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but I \nonly ask my dear friend, the majority leader, whether he has prepared \nsome time this week to take up the legislation he and I have discussed \non occasion having to do with legislating on appropriations. That is a \nmatter he and I have agreed to try to resolve at the earliest possible \ndate, by rollcall vote. We would hope legislatively we could address it \nthis week. We would not have this problem if we were not legislating on \nappropriations. We are doing that.\n  I know the majority leader shares my view because he said publicly on \nthe floor this was a mistake. We are living with that mistake right \nnow. The sooner we can expedite consideration of that particular \nlegislative initiative, I think it would be very helpful, and it would \nsolve a lot of his problems, reduce his headaches, and get us back to \nwhere we should be with regard to the appropriations process.\n  Mr. President, I have no objection to the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could comment briefly on that. I have said here \nbefore, last year, and I actually started working on that a couple of \nmonths ago, and as the Senator is probably aware, I met resistance on \nboth sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Capitol, to a large \nextent from the appropriators, members of the Appropriations Committee. \nI do not want to put the blame just on them, but I, personally, think \nthis has been abused over the years and is being abused now. This \nlegislating on appropriations bills is not the way to do business.\n  However, as long as it is allowed under the rules, unless we can find\n\n[[Page S4041]]\n\nsome way to modify or change that, I am sure it will be used with great \nvigor on both sides of the aisle. That is not the way I think business \nshould be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/06/senate-section/article/S4040-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
