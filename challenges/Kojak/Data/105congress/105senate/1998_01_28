Aiken, of Oregon, \nto be United States District Judge for the District of Oregon, the \nnomination of Barry G. Silverman, of Arizona, to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit, and the nomination of Richard W. \nStory, of Georgia, to be United States District Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the nominations.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nAnn Aiken to the federal district bench in Oregon. I know too that my \ndistinguished colleagues from that State, Senators Smith and Wyden, \nwholeheartedly support this nominee.\n  And it is no wonder that Judge Aiken enjoys their support. She has \nserved as a state district and circuit court judge for nearly a decade. \nBefore that, she worked in private practice and had extensive \ninvolvement in Oregon statehouse politics. Perhaps most significantly, \nshe is the mother of 5 children. As the father of 6 myself, I can think \nof no better preparation for the bench than first having served as the \nreferee of a large family.\n  I plan to discuss in greater detail why I intend to support Judge \nAiken's nomination, but first, I would like to address some of the \nconcerns that have been expressed with respect to the Senate's role in \nthe confirmation of federal judges. As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, one of the most important duties I fulfill is in screening \njudicial nominees. Indeed, the Constitution itself obligates the Senate \nto\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nprovide the President with advice concerning his nominees and to \nconsent to their ultimate confirmation. Although some have complained \nabout the pace at which the Senate has moved on judicial nominees, I \nwould note that this body has undertaken its constitutional obligation \nin a wholly appropriate fashion. Indeed, the first matter to come \nbefore the Senate this session are the confirmation of three of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees. Senator Lott is to be commended \nfor giving these nominees early attention. As well, the Judiciary \nCommittee has already announced judicial confirmation hearings for \nFebruary 4 and February 25.\n  In 1997, the first session of the 105th Congress, the Senate \nconfirmed 36 judges. This is only slightly behind the historical \naverage of 41 judges confirmed during the first sessions in each of the \nlast five Congresses. And, I would note, the Judiciary Committee itself \nprocessed 47 nominees--including the three judges we will be \nconsidering today.\n  Keep in mind that the Clinton Administration is on record as having \nstated that 63 vacancies--a vacancy rate just over 7%--is considered \nvirtual full employment of the federal judiciary. The current vacancy \nrate--88 vacancies--is a vacancy rate of approximately 10%. Some of \nthose vacancies occurred after the Senate recess last year, however. \nHow can a rise in the vacancy rate--from 7% to 10%--convert ``full \nemployment'' into a ``crisis''? Although we can always do better, this \nis a record of which I am proud.\n  I would further add that there are currently 32 vacancies for which \nthe Committee has yet to receive a nomination. As hard as I work, I \nhave never been able to confirm a person that has not yet been \nnominated. And I have to say that there were more vacancies just up \nuntil a few days ago.\n  This is a point, gone largely unnoticed by the popular press, that \nChief Justice Rehnquist recently made in his Annual Report on the \nJudiciary. In that report he urged, among other things, that certain \njudicial vacancies be filled. I would ask you to compare today's 88 \njudicial vacancies with the record of a Democratic Senate during \nPresident Bush's presidency. In May 1992 there were 117 vacancies on \nthe federal bench. And, interestingly enough, the Chief Justice made \nbasically the same remarks back in 1992 that he did this past month. \nThe only real difference that I can see, however, is that in the days \nimmediately following the Chief Justice's remarks we have a plethora of \nmedia acting as though there were some big crisis developing basically \nfomented by the White House and some down at the Justice Department. I \nmight say that in the days immediately following Chief Justice \nRehnquist's criticism back in 1992 when there was a Democrat Congress, \nthere were only a handful of newspapers who even bothered to report on \nthe judicial vacancy issue even though there were 117 vacancies during \nthat period of time, and even more. At one time in 1991 there were 148 \nvacancies, and hardly a peep out of the media, or hardly a peep out of \nany of the so-called ``critics'' of today. So it seems that when a \nRepublican President confronted a Democrat Senate on the issue of \njudicial vacancies the press seemed to be considerably less interested.\n\n  That I think is the state of affairs in Washington. We are all used \nto it. But I just wanted to point that out because I think it is pretty \nfallacious to blame the Senate when in many instances we don't have any \nnominees to fill the position, especially when some of the nominees who \ncame over had problems from the last Congress as well.\n  And the number of vacancies is not nearly as problematic as it might \nappear, at first blush. In fact, there are more sitting federal judges \ntoday than there were throughout virtually all of the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations. As of today, there are 756 active federal judges. In \naddition, there are 432 senior judges who must, by law, hear cases, \nalbeit with a reduced load but nevertheless taking the burden off of \nthe sitting full-time judges. Ordinarily, when a judge decides to leave \nthe bench, she does not completely retire, but instead takes senior \nstatus. A judge who takes senior status, as opposed to a judge who \ncompletely retires, must hear a certain number of cases each year. \nThus, when a judge leaves the bench, she does not stop working \naltogether, she merely takes a somewhat reduced caseload. Even in the \nninth circuit, which has ten vacancies, only one judge has actually \nstopped hearing cases; the other have taken senior status and are still \nhearing cases. The total pool of federal judges available to hear cases \nis 1,188--a record number of federal judges. So this so-called \n``crisis'' has been fomented, frankly, by partisan people at the White \nHouse and some at the Justice Department, and, frankly, it is beneath \ntheir dignity to do this. I will say that there is room for \nimprovement, and certainly we on the Judiciary Committee want to do \neverything we can to improve it. I hope that those who manage the floor \nwill feel the same way and do the same thing.\n\n  And some in the media have failed to read completely the Chief \nJustice's report, or, if they ignored all of the other aspects of the \nreport.\n  In fact, his report centered on the problem of judicial workload--not \njudicial vacancies. He went on to compliment the Senate for enacting \nhabeas corpus and prison litigation reform, two of the bills that I \nhave pushed hard for. The Chief observed that these two vital reforms, \nwhich I sponsored, will greatly reduce the federal courts' workload. He \nalso asked Congress to curb federal jurisdiction and to provide better \npay for federal judges. I think we may be able to make progress on both \nthose fronts this session in addition to moving qualified judicial \nnominees.\n  I was disappointed to read in the Washington Post a week or so ago \nthat the Clinton White House, ``galvanized by the critique by Chief \nJustice Rehnquist,'' has tapped communications director Ann Lewis to \nhead a ``fullscale political confrontation'' over judicial \nappointments. [Washington Post, Jan. 16, 1998]. According to the Post, \npart of the so-called ``campaign'' plan is to paint Republicans as \nanti-women and anti-minority.\n  There is no depth to which they will stoop in trying to win political \npoints down there. Frankly, I don't think the American people buy that.\n  This is certainly a poor way to begin what I hope will turn out to be \na cooperative effort to confirm federal judges. We should not play race \nor gender politics with judges, and I personally resent that. I have \nnever considered, much less kept track of, the race or gender of the \nnominees that have been submitted for the Committee's approval. And I \ndon't think anyone else does. I oppose, and support, nominees on the \nbasis of their professional qualifications and their commitment to \nuphold the rule of law--their commitment or lack of commitment. In the \nfinal analysis, all that matters is whether a nominee will make a good \njudge. I hope this is the standard the White House uses as well.\n  Nor will the Judiciary Committee, under my stewardship, push nominees \nthrough just for the sake of filling vacancies. Only recently, after \nthe Judiciary Committee had expeditiously reviewed and held hearings on \ntwo nominees, did information surface that caused one of those nominees \nto withdraw and that places the other nominee's confirmation prospects \nin jeopardy. There is a good deal of background research that must be \ndone by the Judiciary Committee before we can send a nominee to the \nfloor. If the Committee fails to do the groundwork, it fails the \nSenate, and prevents this body from fulfilling its constitutional duty.\n  And it is no secret that Senators rely on us doing this duty in a \nbipartisan way, and I believe for the most part we have.\n  The reality, of course, is that the Republican Senate has confirmed \nthe vast majority of President Clinton's judicial nominees. Even the \nWashington Post expressed dismay over the administration's efforts to \npoliticize the nominations process, writing on its editorial page that \nthe campaign could ``grind the nominations process to a halt.''\n  So I urge the White House to reconsider their plans to politicize the \nFederal judiciary and the process because, if they do, I think they are \ngoing to have nothing but problems up here. I would like to help them. \nI would like to be cooperative. I would like to make sure that good \nnominees get through expeditiously and in the best way.\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\n  Last year I sought to steer the confirmation process in a way that \nkept it a fair and principled one and exercised what I felt was the \nappropriate degree of deference to the President's judicial selections \nand appointees. It is in this spirit of fairness that I will vote to \nconfirm Judge Aiken.\n  Conducting a fair confirmation process, however, does not mean \ngranting the President carte blanche in filling the Federal judiciary. \nIt means assuring that those who are confirmed will uphold the \nConstitution and abide by the rule of law.\n  Based upon the committee's review of her record, I believe Ann Aiken \nto be such a person. Now, Judge Aiken likely would not be my choice if \nI were sitting in the Oval Office, but the President has seen fit to \nnominate her. She has the bipartisan support of both Senators from \nOregon, and the review conducted by my committee suggests that she \nunderstands the proper role of a judge in our Federal system and will \nabide by the rule of law. She has personally assured me that she will, \nwhich goes a long way towards obtaining my vote here today.\n  I will also state that both Senators have actively advocated in her \nbehalf, especially the distinguished junior Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nSmith. He has continuously fought for her--fought for her right to have \nher nomination hearing, fought for her right to be heard in that \nhearing, and fought for her right to be passed out of the committee and \non to the floor. I notice that he is here today to fight for her \nconfirmation on the floor.\n  Based on the committee's review of the record, I believe that Judge \nAiken is a good choice. In fact, when asked whether there were any so-\ncalled constitutional rights that existed independent of the \nConstitution itself, Judge Aiken replied ``No, sir. The Constitution is \none of the most elegantly written documents. The words of the \nConstitution are clear. It expresses the rights that are given. I find \nno need to look beyond those express words and the document itself.''\n  This is precisely the type of answer I would expect of any Federal \njudicial nominee. Of course, sometimes people say things they do not \nmean. But I am willing to give this nominee as well as any nominee the \nbenefit of the doubt unless the evidence is overwhelmingly to the \ncontrary.\n  It is also significant to me that when asked what judge or justice \nhas most influenced her thinking, she replied, ``Justice Felix \nFrankfurter, because of his staunch adherence to the principle of \njudicial restraint and his reluctance to substitute the inclinations of \nthe court for the express will of the legislature.''\n  She has demonstrated to me that she understands the proper role of a \nFederal judge in our constitutional system. But more than that, it is \nimportant that a judge give more than lip service to principles of \njudicial restraint. Rather, a good judge will internalize and abide by \nthose principles. I have no reason to believe that Judge Aiken will not \ndo precisely that.\n  Moreover, I do not think anyone seriously believes that Judge Aiken \nis not qualified to sit on the Federal bench. She is currently a judge \non the Oregon circuit court. She attended the University of Oregon both \nfor her undergraduate and juris doctorate degrees, and she received a \nmaster's degree from Rutgers University. Prior to her appointment to \nthe bench, Judge Aiken practiced largely in the area of domestic \nrelations law. She focused on child custody, foster care and family \npreservation cases. As anyone who has ever engaged in the practice of \nlaw knows, domestic disputes of this type truly require the wisdom of \nSolomon.\n\n  In sum, I join Senators Smith and Wyden in supporting this nominee \nand once again ask the White House to work with, not against, the \nSenate in seeking out qualified individuals to serve on the Federal \nbench.\n  With that, I notice my colleague, the ranking member on the \ncommittee, is here, and I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do want to respond. If the Senator from \nOregon could withhold and let me put this quorum call in for just a \nmoment, I am then going to call it off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court \nhas spoken out forcefully on the judicial vacancy crisis that is \nplaguing our Federal courts. He is correct that: ``Vacancies cannot \nremain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of \njustice that traditionally has been associated with the Federal \njudiciary.''\n  Partisan and narrow ideological efforts to impose political litmus \ntests on judicial nominees and shut down the judiciary have to stop. \nThey hold no place, whether you have a Democrat as President or a \nRepublican as President. The judiciary should not be part of a partisan \nor ideological power struggle. And I think that all of us as Senators \nin the most powerful democracy history has ever known have a stake in \nkeeping an independent judiciary.\n  Now, we begin 1998 still facing vacancies of about one out of every \n10 judgeships. More than a third of these are what are called judicial \nemergencies. They have been empty for more than a year and a half. \nUnfortunately, during the last 3 years in the Senate, under the control \nof my friends across the aisle, the Senate has barely matched the 1-\nyear total of judges confirmed in 1994 when we were on course to end \nthe vacancy gap.\n  In the 1996 session, the Senate confirmed only 17 judges, none for \nthe Federal courts of appeals. We began last year with the Chief \nJustice of the United States Supreme Court expressing in the year-end \n1996 report on the Federal judiciary his ``hope'' that the Senate would \n``recognize that filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and \neffective administration of justice.''\n  Through the course of last year, at virtually each meeting of the \nJudiciary Committee, certainly at each confirmation hearing, and in a \nnumber of statements on the Senate floor, I urged the Senate and the \nRepublican leadership and those responsible for holding up much-needed \njudges to abandon what I saw as ill-advised efforts.\n  In July, seven national lawyer organizations spoke out. In August, \nthe Attorney General spoke about the ``vacancy crisis that has left so \nmany Americans waiting for justice,'' and ``the unprecedented slowdown \nof the confirmation process'' and its ``very real and very detrimental \nimpacts on all parts of our justice system.''\n  Last September, the President of the United States pointed out the \ndangers of partisan politics infecting the confirmation process. He \ncalled upon the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and end ``the \nintimidation, the delay, the shrill voices.''\n  In his 1997 year-end report, Chief Justice Rehnquist focused again on \nthe problems of ``too few judges and too much work.'' He noted the \nvacancy crisis and the persistence of 26 judiciary emergency vacancies, \nand he observed: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a \nconsiderable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final \nfloor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, \nwell under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.''\n\n  Last night in his State of the Union Address the President of the \nUnited States again returned to the matter of the vacancy crisis and \nthe need to provide the courts with the judges and other resources they \nneed effectively to administer Federal criminal and civil justice \nacross the country. The President did more than talk yesterday. He also \nsent us another dozen judicial nominees to help fill the vacancies. \nThat brings to 54 the number of judicial nominees that are pending \ncurrently before the Senate.\n  The Senate still has pending before it 11 nominees who were first \nnominated 2 years ago, including five who have been pending since 1995. \nWe are finally going to vote on one of them this afternoon, Judge Ann \nL. Aiken.\n  I see my good friend, the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, in the \nChamber. I must say, Mr. President, as much as I like Senator Wyden, it \ngot to the point that I almost hated to see him\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\ncoming down the hall because he pounded so often on me: ``Let's get \nthis fine woman confirmed.'' He has been doing this year after year. He \nhas expressed to me and to other Senators and to the leadership of the \nJudiciary Committee: ``Let's get this woman confirmed.'' And he has \nexpressed to me how well qualified she is, how superbly qualified she \nis. He has made his case with passion and with integrity, which is his \nnature. I say to him, while I am always hesitant to predict any vote, I \nsuspect that she is going to be confirmed overwhelmingly today, and I \napplaud the Senator for not giving up, I applaud the Senator from \nOregon for not giving up all those years that he fought so hard to get \nher here. I know that both he and the other Senator from Oregon, who is \nalso in the Chamber, Mr. Smith, will be voting for her with great \nenthusiasm.\n  But there remains no excuse for the Senate's delay in considering the \nnominations of such outstanding individuals as Prof. William A. \nFletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, M. Margaret \nMcKeown, Susan Oki Mollway, Margaret M. Morrow, Clarence J. Sundram, \nAnabelle Rodriguez, Michael D. Schattman, and Hilda G. Tagle.\n  I mention these people because all of these nominees have been \nwaiting at least 18 months, some more than 2 years, for Senate action.\n  Last year the Senate confirmed 36 judges, but that has to be seen in \nrelation to the 120 vacancies through the course of the year and the 55 \njudgeships in addition to the current vacancies that the Judicial \nConference urged Congress to authorize in order to meet the workload \ndemand of all of the new laws that we have passed and, of course, a \ngrowing country.\n  Last year's confirmations did not approach the 58 judges confirmed in \nthe 1995 session or even keep up with the vacancies that came from \nnormal attrition.\n  Last year the President sent us 79 judicial nominations. The Senate \ncompleted action on fewer than half of them. The percentage of judicial \nnominees confirmed over the course of last year was lower than for any \nCongress over the last three decades, possibly any time in our history. \nLeft pending were 42 judicial nominees, including 21 to fill judicial \nemergencies.\n  Last year the Senate never reduced its backlog of pending judicial \nnominees below 20 and at the end of the year had a backlog of over 40 \nnominees. With the dozen additional nominees received yesterday, the \nSenate's backlog of nominees as we begin the year has topped 50. The \nAdministration is demonstrating its resolve to nominate good people to \nfill these vacancies. They are doing their job.\n\n  It is up to the Senate now to do its job. Have the hearings. Vote \nthem up or vote them down. Just don't leave them in limbo. If we don't \nlike the nominee that the President has sent up, then vote him or her \ndown. We are used to voting around here. We can do that very easily. \nBut don't leave them sitting there never knowing what is going to \nhappen.\n  In connection with the President's national radio address last \nSeptember 27, we finally quickened the pace of judicial confirmations, \nand during the last 9 weeks of the Senate's last session the Senate \nheld five confirmation hearings and confirmed 27 judges. I compliment \nthe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee for making that \npossible.\n  In response to the criticism of the Chief Justice, though, the \nchairman has argued that the Senate is on a steady course and making \nsteady progress. But it was only in the last 9 weeks of the last \nsession that we were able to achieve a pace that can make a difference. \nI urge my good friend, the chairman--and he is my good friend--to help \nthe Senate maintain that pace this year.\n  If we can maintain the same pace we had in the last 9 weeks of the \nlast session, we can end the judicial vacancy crisis that now threatens \nthe administration of justice by our Federal courts. I will commit \nmyself to work with him in any way he wants to do that--have hearings \non weekends, hearings in the evening, whatever he chooses--so that we \ncan go forward and maintain the same pace. I compliment the chairman \nfor the pace of those last few weeks. I urge him to do the same for \nthis year. That is the challenge that lies before us as Congress begins \nanew.\n  The Chief Justice compared the past 2 years of Senate inaction to the \nrecord of the 1994 session. That was a Democrat-controlled Senate. We \nworked hard to consider and confirm 101 judges, including a Supreme \nCourt Justice. To make a difference, however, the Senate this year, \n1998, need only maintain the pace it reached last fall, 27 judges every \n9 weeks. That really should be the measure of the Senate's effort this \nyear. Do what we did at the end of the session last year, do it \nthroughout this year, and we in the Senate can make a difference for \nthe judicial system.\n  It will be easy to monitor our progress. Any week in which the Senate \ndoes not confirm three judges is a week in which the Senate is failing \nto address the vacancy crisis. Any fortnight in which we have gone \nwithout a judicial confirmation hearing marks 2 weeks in which we are \nfalling farther behind.\n  I am delighted that the majority leader and the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee have scheduled three nominees for consideration by \nthe Senate today. I thank the majority leader and thank the Senator \nfrom Utah for their cooperation and attention to these matters. I look \nforward to prompt Senate consideration of the other five nominees if \nthey are still pending on the Senate calendar. I would also be willing \nto bet that most of these nominees would not get even a tiny handful of \nvotes against them and that they are going to pass overwhelmingly.\n  I note that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has noticed a \njudiciary hearing for next week. This notice, and what is happening \ntoday, are positive developments. They are signs that the Senate is \ntaking to heart its constitutional duty to consider judicial nominees \nwithout further delay. While I hope it does not hurt him on his side of \nthe aisle, I want to commend the Senator from Utah for his actions. I \nsuspect if the two of us were allowed, without any of the political \npressures on either side, to work this out, we could probably move \nahead more quickly.\n  But the warning from the Chief Justice in his year-end report is more \nthan a question of numbers. This is the responsibility every Senator \nhas, Republican or Democrat. Our responsibility first and foremost is \nto the country, not to individual parties. Our solemn oath is to uphold \nthe Constitution of the United States. That is what should motivate \nevery one of us here. We have to look at this country, the greatest \nexercise of democracy history has ever seen, the most powerful \ndemocracy history has ever known, and recognize that it stays that way \nbecause of the checks and balances between the legislative, judiciary \nand executive branches. A hallmark of that has been the independence, \nthroughout our 200-plus year history, of the Federal judiciary. If we \nallow this to become a partisan football, this confirmation of judges, \nthen the independence and the integrity of the Federal judiciary is \nbeing threatened.\n\n  The nominations backlog that perpetuates a judicial vacancies crisis \nis a function of the targeting of the judicial branch. It was the \nexecutive branch that was targeted and shut down 2 years ago. Pressure \ngroups--and it is a fact--within the right wing of the Republican Party \nhave been formed and money has been raised to the cry of ``killing'' \nClinton judicial nominations. That would be just as wrong if the same \nthing was being done by ideological groups seeking to kill a Republican \nPresident's nominations. Constitutional amendments to undercut the \nindependence of the judiciary have been introduced. Ideological \nimpeachments have been threatened. The Republican leadership in the \nHouse speaks openly about seeking to ``intimidate'' Federal judges.\n  The confirmation process is not immune from politics, but a \nparticularly virulent strain has now infected this body and has \npoliticized the process to the point of paralysis, and this threatens \nthe integrity and the independence of the judiciary. It encumbers the \njudicial confirmation process. In too many courts, judges delayed means \njustice denied. Without judges, courts cannot try cases, they cannot \nsentence the guilty or cannot resolve civil disputes.\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\n  For more than 200 years a strong and independent Federal judiciary \nhas served as a bulwark against overreaching by the political branches \nof the Government. It has been the protector of our constitutional \nrights and liberties. True conservatives should want nothing more than \na truly independent judiciary, because it is the bulwark of our \nindividual freedoms.\n  I hope this new year will bring the realization by those who have \nstarted down this destructive path of attacking the judiciary and \nstalling the confirmation of qualified nominees to the Federal bench \nthat those efforts do not serve the national interest. I hope we can \nremove these important matters from partisan, ideological politics. I \nhope today will move us forward in the interests of the fair \nadministration of justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield to me for just a couple of \nadditional remarks, and then I will yield to the distinguished Senator?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I feel I should make a few more remarks here, because I \nwould not want this day to pass without mentioning Barry Silverman, who \nis one of the judges nominated for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nand, of course, Richard Wayne Story, who was nominated for the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia. Each of these nominees has the support of his home \nState Senators and each is well qualified for the Federal bench. So I \nwant our colleagues to know that.\n  Barry Glen Silverman was nominated for United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit. He graduated summa cum laude in 1973 and got his \nJ.D. in 1976 from Arizona State University. He is currently a U.S. \nMagistrate Judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of \nArizona. He has served as a Superior Court Judge both in Phoenix and \nMaricopa Counties, and he has also served as a prosecutor in Phoenix.\n  He is the recipient of numerous awards including the 1991 Henry \nStevens Award, which recognizes trial judges who represent the finer \nqualities of the judiciary.\n  His nomination is not the least bit controversial, and he is \nsupported by Senators Kyl and McCain.\n  Richard Wayne Story has been nominated for United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of Georgia. He received his B.A. in \nEnglish from LaGrange College in 1975, and his J.D. from the University \nof Georgia in 1978. He is presently a sitting judge on the Superior \nCourt bench in the Northeastern Circuit of Dawson and Hall Counties of \nGeorgia. Prior to that he served as Juvenile Court Judge and as a part-\ntime Special Assistant Attorney General for the State of Georgia. He \nwas also a member of the firm of Kenyon, Hulsey, and Oliver for eight \nyears.\n  His nomination is not controversial, and he is supported by Senator \nCoverdell and Senator Cleland.\n  So I hope that our colleagues will vote for all three of these \njudges. I think all three of them deserve support. We will move on from \nthere.\n  I yield to my colleague from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How much time does the Senator yield to the \nSenator from Oregon?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 10 minutes. How much time is remaining to both \nSenators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side has approximately 40 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield such time as the Senator needs, but at least 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, colleagues, I rise today in \nsupport of the nomination of Judge Ann Aiken to the Federal district \nbench in Oregon.\n  Before I comment on her nomination, though, I would like to thank and \ncompliment my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch. I have gone to him repeatedly about the three \nvacancies in the State of Oregon and the challenges they create in our \njudicial process. Since my time here, against some opposition, Senator \nHatch has in every instance acted responsibly, and helped me to move \nthe Oregon nominees along so we can fill these vacancies and get rid of \na considerable backlog that we have in our State.\n  I would also like to thank the majority leader for scheduling a vote \ntoday so we can vote up or down on this and other nominations. And I \nwould like to thank my colleague, Ron Wyden, who, before my admission \nto this body, was laboring here on behalf of Judge Aiken.\n  To my colleagues on the Republican side, those who may have a \nquestion about the qualifications or the decisions or the political \nleanings of Judge Aiken, I would like to point out to you the \nimpressive list of letters and phone calls I have received from both \nDemocrats and Republicans on her behalf. They include Senator Mark O. \nHatfield; Senator Wyden; Deanna Smith, chair of the Oregon Republican \nParty; Mark Abrams, the chairman of the Oregon Democratic Party; John \nKitzhaber, the Governor of Oregon; Hardy Meyers, Oregon Attorney \nGeneral; Jack Roberts, Oregon Republican State Labor Commissioner; five \nformer Governors of both parties; 20 former presidents of the Oregon \nBar Association; the Oregon Association of District Attorneys; the \nOregon State Police Officers Association; the Lane County Peace \nOfficers Association; the Eugene Police Employees' Association; and all \nthe presiding judges under whom Judge Aiken has served. It is an \nimpressive list of people, all attesting to her worthiness and \nqualification to be a Federal judge.\n  I believe that they based their decision to support Judge Aiken for \nthe very reason I based mine--on her very impressive record of public \nservice. She has served the people of Oregon both on and off the bench \nthrough her dedication to the health and safety of children in Oregon \nand throughout our country. She has served on numerous councils and \nboards of directors. To note a few, she was recently elected to the \nboard of the National Network of Child Advocacy Centers. She is a \ncurrent member of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court \nJudges. She is a current member of the Relief Nursery board of \ndirectors. This charitable institution is particularly near and dear to \nmy heart and is a private organization that provides preschool classes, \nparent education and respite care for families at risk for child \nabuse. This organization reaches out to all at risk children and \nfamilies in our communities, and Judge Ann Aiken is a champion of this \nprivate-public partnership.\n\n  In addition, since 1993 she has been a member of the Task Force on \nChild Fatalities and Critical Injuries, and a member of the Lane County \nDomestic Violence Council.\n  While I have not served on these councils with Judge Aiken, I would \nlike to take a moment to explain why I believe that she is an excellent \nnominee for the U.S. District Court for Oregon.\n  I first came to know Judge Aiken in 1994. We were both appointed by a \nDemocratic Governor to serve on the Governor's Commission on Juvenile \nJustice when I was the Senate Minority Leader in our State legislature. \nI worked with her on this commission to address the issue of juvenile \ncrime. Among a handful of appointees, she stood out as a superstar. I \nwas impressed with her fairness, her experience, and her insight as to \nhow we can work to help the people of our state, particularly our young \nchildren.\n  Over the course of the next election cycle, I became the Oregon State \nSenate President. And with her involvement, and the work of this \ncommission, we produced a bill called Senate bill 1. It produced some \nof the toughest juvenile crime laws in this country.\n  Since that time, Oregon has revisited the whole issue of crime in a \ndramatic way through a number of ballot initiatives and legislative \nactions--and crime is falling in my State. Although these initiatives \noccurred after 1995, Judge Aiken has been tough on crime throughout her \ncareer, and I would encourage my colleagues to review her record of \nstrict sentencing practices.\n  In 1993, Judge Aiken sentenced a 28-year-old woman who was involved \nwith a brutal beating and murder of a 70-year-old man to 20 years in \nprison--twice the amount of time as was called for by the Oregon state \nsentencing guidelines.\n  In 1995, Judge Aiken sentenced a repeat child molester to the maximum \nsentence of 58 years in prison.\n  In 1995, Judge Aiken sentenced a 43-year-old man to 31 years for \nfelony sex\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\nabuse crimes involving two girls aged 7 and 9, invoking a law that \npermits judges to double the prison term normally afforded by State \nsentencing guidelines in cases with aggravating circumstances.\n  Before our recess, my friend and colleague from Wyoming, Senator \nEnzi, raised some concern about one particular case that troubled him. \nI will admit to you that it troubles me. But I want Senator Enzi and \nall of my colleagues to know that their criticism of Judge Aiken in \nthis case should not be of her but of the Oregon law that applied at \nthat time, because she followed the law. And some of my colleagues, \nfrankly, appropriately, criticize judges who become frustrated \nlegislators and use their judicial robes to write new law. Judge Aiken \nsimply did not do that. She followed the Oregon law.\n  It involved a very horrible case. It involved a circumstance where a \nman, 26 years old, Ronny Lee Dye, was convicted of first-degree rape of \na 5-year-old child and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and 5 years of \nprobation plus the payment of a $2,000 fine.\n  With the judicial guidelines that she had to operate within, she had \na choice to make. She could send him directly to prison to serve out a \n5-year sentence or she could put him in a county facility where he \nwould receive sex-offender treatment. She made a judgment. Her judgment \nwas that the society of Oregon would be better served if this man had \ntreatment. You can call that into question now, but she followed the \nlaw.\n  Later, this man was arrested for drunk driving and ultimately served \na 5-year term in prison.\n  I ask myself in this case, however, would I have made that call? \nMaybe not. But she did. And she did it according to the direction of \nthe Oregon guidelines that were given to her. But my complaint was with \nthe law that allowed that, not with her discretion in trying to \nestablish what was in the best interests of society and justice.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I note that one of the reasons that Judge \nAiken appeals to me as a person and as a judge is a reason very \npersonal. As I have come to know this woman, I have come to know this \nmother of five sons, and she is a good mother.\n  I am one of 10 children. My mother has five sons. And while my mother \ndid not always act perfectly on the issues of justice and mercy, she \nacted nearly so. And it seems to me that what I see in her are some of \nthe qualities that I would want on the Federal bench. Because a mother \nof five sons knows how to arbitrate family difficulties and what it \nmeans to raise honorable citizens to serve in our society.\n  So I ask my colleagues to see this woman's record in its totality---\nnot by the outcome of one case. I would never come to this floor and \nadvocate for anyone who was soft on crime. And if this woman's record \nindicated that, I would not support her in this effort today. But it \ndoes not. It represents a person who is tough on crime, who has served \nto make her State's laws tougher and who has a record of putting away \nviolent people for a long time.\n  I wish that one case were different, but it is not. But the man has \nserved prison time and has received sex-offender treatment. And now the \nissue is, should we confirm Ann L. Aiken to the United States district \ncourt? I say affirmatively and with conviction, yes.\n  I ask for your support of her and thank the President for this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, from the time controlled by Senator Leahy, \nI yield myself up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in support of a \nsuperb State judge, a pillar in her community, a devoted mother of five \nwonderful sons and a personal friend, an individual who I believe will \nmake an outstanding Federal district judge, Judge Ann L. Aiken.\n  Let me begin by expressing my thanks and gratitude to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and particularly to Chairman Hatch and the ranking \nDemocrat, Senator Leahy. Both Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy carry an \nenormous workload, and I want to express my appreciation to both of \nthem for all the time and good counsel that they have given Senator \nSmith and myself with respect to Oregon's needs on the Federal bench.\n  I especially want to thank at this time my colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Smith, for his truly extraordinary efforts on behalf of Judge \nAiken. I think this Senate can see from Senator Smith's eloquence and \nhis commitment to Judge Aiken how strongly he feels about this \nappointment. He has made extensive efforts with our colleagues to \nensure that Judge Aiken would be before the U.S. Senate.\n  I want to express my appreciation to Senator Smith for all of those \nefforts on Judge Aiken's behalf and to join Chairman Hatch in saying \nthat I do not believe we could be here today without the extraordinary \nwork of Senator Smith. I want him to know how much I appreciate those \nefforts. He knows Judge Aiken extremely well. Those joint efforts date \nback for years, as Senator Smith has stated, and it has been a pleasure \nto work with him on this, dating back to the days when he was president \nof the Oregon State Senate.\n  Also at this time, I want to thank Congressman Peter DeFazio, a \npersonal friend of Judge Aiken's who has worked with her on many \nimportant community activities. Congressman DeFazio has been a \nvociferous advocate of Judge Aiken's candidacy, and he has done a good \njob of keeping the debate focused on getting Judge Aiken to this point. \nAnd I want to express my appreciation to him.\n  Mr. President, Judge Aiken's journey to be considered on the floor of \nthe Senate has been a long one, and not just in terms of the 3,000 \nmiles she traveled from Oregon for those confirmation hearings.\n\n  Her journey formally began in 1994, when I put together a bipartisan \ngroup of Oregonians to review her qualifications.\n  In January of 1995, I recommended to President Clinton, with the \nstrong bipartisan support of the Oregon congressional delegation, that \nAnn Aiken be named to the Federal bench.\n  As Senator Smith has noted, Judge Aiken's support for this nomination \nspans the political spectrum. Liberals are for Judge Aiken, \nconservatives are for Judge Aiken, moderates are for Judge Aiken, \nDemocrats, Republicans; across all political boundaries, Oregonians \nhave lined up behind this outstanding judge.\n  It is my view that these many endorsements are pouring in because of \nthe hard work and thoroughness that has marked Ann Aiken's career to \ndate. And I would especially like to reference her work on crime.\n  Mr. President, and colleagues, this is an especially important issue \nto me. Before I came to the U.S. Congress, first as a Member of the \nHouse, I was co-director of the Oregon Gray Panthers, a senior citizens \ngroup. And I found that many of these older folks were afraid to have \nmeetings after 4 or 5 at night because of their fear of crime. And so I \nvowed, as a Member of Congress, that I would put a specific focus on \nlaw-enforcement issues in my service in the Congress.\n  As a Member of the House, I joined Senator Specter in authoring the \ncareer criminal law, a law which prescribes tough punishments and no \nparole sentences for career criminals.\n  Last Congress, I joined Senator Hatch in his efforts, his yeoman's \nwork, to deal with the scourge of methamphetamines. And I have \nrepeatedly--repeatedly--voted to impose the death penalty on heinous \ncrimes in our society.\n  So I take a back seat to no individual with respect to support for \ntough law enforcement. And I want to tell my colleagues in the U.S. \nSenate that Judge Aiken did not win all that support from law-\nenforcement groups in Oregon by accident. She won the support of the \nAssociation of District Attorneys and the Police Officers' Association \nbecause of her toughness on crime.\n  As my colleague, Senator Smith, has noted this morning, repeatedly \nshe has sought to impose the toughest possible sentences. And because \nJudge Aiken has a true mastery of the Oregon sentencing guidelines, she \nfrequently is able to impose sentences that are significantly longer \nthan any other judge on the bench.\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\n  She has worked for a new approach to juvenile justice that ensures \nthat young people who commit crimes have to face consequences. It would \nchange the juvenile justice system as we know it. Youngsters would \nunderstand that the justice system is based on personal responsibility \nand individual accountability when they perpetrate those offenses. And \nthe changes that have been made came about because Judge Aiken worked \non a bipartisan basis with leaders of our State like Senator Smith to \nget that done.\n  So she did not win all that support from law enforcement by accident. \nAnd she would not have the bipartisan support of her two U.S. Senators \ntoday were it not for the fact that she took a tough and fair approach \nwith respect to law enforcement.\n  Judge Aiken is also a person who knows how to squeeze an hour out of \na minute. Not only does she maintain a rigorous judicial schedule, but \nthe list of task forces that she has chaired and the boards on which \nshe has served number in the dozens. She has been on the board of \ndirectors of Court-Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), a program in \nwhich we take special pride in our State because it allows us to \nadvocate for young people in our society and focus on trying to help \nthem get their lives on track.\n  On top of all this, somehow she finds time to be a caring and \ninvolved mother for her five boys. How she manages to juggle all these \nactivities is beyond my comprehension, but the fact that she can serve \nas a judge, a community leader, and a devoted mom all simultaneously is \nyet more evidence of her fitness and her ability to serve as an \noutstanding Federal district judge.\n  Ann Aiken is also an expert on family law. She has been a leader in \nthe founding of a model program for youngsters known as the Relief \nNursery. In that effort, she has brought together leaders from across \nher community to help families that were about to crack apart. Recently \nin fact, the successes of the Relief Nursery in keeping families \ntogether were profiled by Peter Jennings on World News Tonight.\n  I am certain that Judge Aiken will bring to the Federal bench the \nsame fairness, toughness and integrity that she has brought to her work \nas a State judge and a specialist in family law. And I am certain that \nJudge Aiken will bring to the Federal court the intellect, intensity \nand drive that has made her one of our State's most respected jurists.\n  Let me wrap up by saying, as Senator Smith has touched on as well, \nthis nomination is particularly important since Oregon already has two \nvacancies on the district bench and will be facing a third in April of \nthis year. Failure to fill these openings in a timely manner is going \nto put an enormous strain on the Federal courts in Oregon. It is time \nto act and time to act swiftly.\n  My colleagues, you have before you a tough judge and a fair one, one \ncommitted to seeing that justice is carried out in an impartial way no \nmatter what the accusation is. She is going to make an exceptional \nFederal judge. She will bring honor to her community and her country. \nTherefore I urge you, as Senator Smith has, that the Senate move today \non the candidacy of Judge Ann Aiken. She is a judge of extraordinary \nability. She has earned this post.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Judge Ann \nAiken as the district court judge for the district of Oregon. I asked \nfor a rollcall vote because I want to be on record as opposing this \nnominee. I put a hold on this nominee before we left on recess, with \nadequate time, I assure, for a rollcall vote. I made that a public, not \na secret, hold. I wanted anyone interested in the case to know that I \nwanted a rollcall vote. I know that message got out. I was told that a \nrollcall vote would be OK, and I am sorry that there was not time or \nsufficient people around to have a rollcall vote prior to the time that \nwe left.\n  I did make a statement on the judge, and I want to reiterate some of \nmy concerns. While I do not question Judge Aiken's experience or \nacademic qualification to sit on the Federal bench, I do have serious \nconcerns about her judicial philosophy as she applied it as a State \ntrial judge in Oregon.\n  One particular case has been mentioned this morning, and I appreciate \nthe extra information that has been passed out at this time. That \nparticularly tragic case perhaps best illustrates my concern, and I \nhave looked at five other cases as well that I don't have more \ninformation on. In the case of the State v. Ronny Lee Dye, a 26-year-\nold man was convicted, convicted, of first-degree rape--first-degree \nrape--of a young 5-year-old girl. Instead of sentencing this convicted \nrapist to State prison, Judge Aiken sentenced him to 90 days in jail \nand 5 years probation, plus a $2,000 fine. The other option was 5 years \nin prison.\n\n  There was concern about whether there would be enough rehabilitation \nin prison. The option was there for 5 years in prison and the effort to \nget a rehabilitation program in that prison. If I were the parents of a \n5-year-old child that was raped and knew the convicted rapist could \nreceive between 90 days and 5 years, I would have serious concerns \nabout anybody who voted for that judge. Out of a concern for those \nparents, I am opposed to this nomination. According to the local \npapers, Judge Aiken did not want to sentence Dye to State prison \nbecause the prison did not have a sex-offender rehabilitation program. \nThere are folks out in my part of the country that would insist on some \nother kind of rehabilitation. Moreover, she believed that probation \nfollowing the jail term provided a stricter supervision than the parole \nthat would have followed a prison sentence. Less than 1 year after his \nconviction for rape, Dye violated his parole by driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol and having contact with minor children without \npermission of his probation officer. I believe Judge Aiken's handling \nof this case and others illustrates an inclination towards an \nunjustified leniency for convicted criminals.\n  Mr. President, I do not pretend to be able to predict with any degree \nof accuracy how this nominee or any other will rule while on the \nFederal bench. In exercising our solemn constitutional duty to advise \nand consent on the President's nominations for the Federal courts, we \nhave only the past action, statements and writings to guide our \ndeliberations. Moreover--and this is one of my big concerns--since \nFederal judges have life tenure and salary protection for the rest of \ntheir lives while they are in office, we have but one opportunity to \nvoice our concerns and disapproval of a judge's record.\n  Now, I understand that she has been repentant of what she did at an \nearly time in her judgeship. But I have got to tell you that I think \nthat we give out Federal judgeships for service, not for repentance. We \ntalk about law and order. We have to back up that law and order through \nthe court system as well, not just with words in this Chamber.\n  I, for one, cannot vote to confirm a nominee to the Federal court who \nI believe is inclined to substitute his or her personal policy \npreferences to those of the U.S. Congress or any other State \nlegislature. I have strong concerns that Judge Aiken, if confirmed, \nwould be inclined to this type of judicial activism. For this reason, I \nasked for a rollcall vote.\n  I appreciate the opportunity for me to go on record as being against \nthe confirmation of Judge Aiken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for this \nexchange this morning, and appreciate the genuineness of his concern.\n  I simply rise to say that Judge Aiken has admitted that early in her \ncareer that was a judgment she made, under the statute and within the \nguidelines, and that in hindsight she would have made a different \ndecision. I simply say that to judge her entire career on the basis of \nthis one case would not be fair. It would not be fair to her, would not \nbe fair to my State, and I think would not be fair to the judicial \nsystem of the United States.\n  I think Caren Tracy, who has served as a local prosecutor in many \ncases in Judge Aiken's courtroom best describes her strict sentencing \npractices by stating, ``With regard to crimes of\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\nviolence, violations of trust relationships, and crimes against \nchildren, Judge Aiken delivers sentences that include periods of \nincarceration that are significantly longer than any other judge on the \nLane County Circuit Court Bench. She has a mastery of the Oregon \nsentencing guidelines which enables her to ensure maximum incarceration \nfor individuals deserving of such sentence. Sentences of thirty to \nforty years for child sex offenders and criminals who commit acts of \nviolence are the norm for her courtroom. I never have any concerns, as \na prosecutor, coming before her for sentencings on significant crimes. \nThe bottom line is she is not a light hitter.''\n\n  I believe that statement reflects Judge Aiken's career in its \ntotality and reflects her commitment to serving justice. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support her nomination and am confident that she will \nreflect credit upon this country and reflect credit on the criminal \njustice system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 10 \nadditional minutes on Senator Leahy's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Let me also join in the remarks expressed by my colleague, \nSenator Smith, with respect to our colleague from Wyoming. I know he is \nsincere in his views.\n  I will talk about what Judge Aiken faced with respect to that Dye \ncase. Judge Aiken had two choices in front of her. Neither were ideal. \nShe chose the one that in hindsight would be different than the one \nthat Senator Smith and I would have chosen. Both of us have been \nconcerned about the case. To her credit--in my view, to her great \ncredit--Judge Aiken has indicated to Senator Smith and me that she \nwould have handled that case differently. Her commitment to tough law \nenforcement has been proven because since that case she has been a \ntough judge. She has often exceeded the sentencing guidelines, and she \nhas shown that she is going to be capable of great growth as a judge.\n  I say to our friend from Wyoming, who among us as new Members of the \nU.S. Senate would not possibly take back a vote early in our career? We \nare constantly faced with tough decisions in the U.S. Senate, decisions \nwhere you have before you a couple of choices, neither of them being \nideal. Judge Ann Aiken, in the Dye case, tried to make the call to the \nbest of her ability. In my view, even more importantly, she showed \ngreat growth, she showed a willingness to evaluate the facts in light \nof additional time and additional opportunities to consider her \ndecision.\n  So we are then faced with the question: Do you throw out the prospect \nof an outstanding career on the Federal bench because of one case, one \ncase where an individual has said, ``If I could do it again, I would \nhave done it differently''? We wouldn't say a Member of this body \nshould be excluded from the possibility of further service in the \nSenate because they would have cast one vote differently had they had \nthe choice. We evaluate Members of the U.S. Senate on the totality of \ntheir records. On the totality of her record, Judge Aiken is an \noutstanding individual, an individual who will be tough on crime when \nshe serves on the Federal bench.\n  Mr. President, I see Chairman Hatch is on the floor. I know he had to \nleave the floor during our earlier remarks. I express to him my \npersonal gratitude for all of the help and effort he has given Senator \nSmith and me on this matter again and again. Chairman Hatch has about \nas hefty a workload as you can imagine for a human being, but he has \nmade time to assist Senator Smith and me. We are very appreciative of \nall the good counsel and help you have given us as new Members of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  In closing, I especially want to express my appreciation to him for \nthat help and counsel.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks. \nThey mean a lot to me because this job of being Judiciary chairman \nisn't all a piece of cake, as anybody can see. I personally appreciate \nthose kind remarks.\n  I want to compliment both of the Senators from Oregon for their \nactive work on behalf of Judge Aiken. Without their work, I don't think \nJudge Aiken would be here today. I personally express that so that she \nwill fully appreciate how hard the Senators from Oregon have worked. \nThey have certainly, along with Judge Aiken, convinced me that she will \nmake an excellent judge. I intend to fully support her. I hope my \ncolleagues will also.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I rise today to state my opposition to the nomination \nof Ann Aiken to be United States District Judge for the District of \nOregon, and to note my support for the other two judges the Senate will \nconsider today.\n  My principal basis for opposition to Judge Aiken's nomination is her \nsentencing decision in State v. Ronny Lee Dye. After finding defendant, \n26, guilty of raping a 5-year-old girl, Aiken sentenced defendant to 90 \ndays in jail, rather than substantial prison time, which was also an \noption under Oregon law.\n  As troubling as this sentencing decision is, her explanation of the \ndecision is worse. She has explained that with a jail sentence she \ncould ensure that Dye would receive psychological counseling, but she \ncould not guarantee counseling if he went to prison. I find this type \nof social engineering from the bench troubling. The focus on what best \nserves the convicted rapist's needs should not be the basis of a \nsentencing decision. I doubt that this is the kind of decision the \npeople of Oregon want to leave to judges.\n  This decision is not ancient history or a rookie mistake. Judge Aiken \nmade this unjustifiable sentencing decision in 1993, in the middle of \nher fifth year on the bench.\n  Let me be clear about one thing: This is not the worst nominee the \nPresident has sent to the Senate. There have been other nominees that \npose even greater problems. The Senate will likely consider one in just \na few weeks, Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson of Philadelphia.\n  Judge Massiah-Jackson has used the language's worst profanity in open \ncourt, she has demonstrated leniency in sentencing and hostility to law \nenforcement, and in recent weeks, she has drawn the opposition of \nimportant local law enforcement officers of the Democratic Party, like \nLynne Abraham, the Philadelphia District Attorney.\n  Ann Aiken is not as troubling a nominee as Frederica Massiah-Jackson. \nBut that should not be the standard. We need to raise the bar on the \nPresident's judicial nominees. America deserves better. The \nConstitution vests the Senate with the critical responsibility to \nadvise the President with respect to his judicial nominees and in \nappropriate cases to give its consent. I take that responsibility \nseriously.\n  The President is capable of making quality judicial appointments and, \nwhen he does so, he deserves the Senate's consent. The two other \nnominees we will vote on today--Richard Story (for the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia) and Barry Silverman (for the 9th Circuit Court of \nAppeals)--both appear to be well-qualified nominees, and I plan to vote \nin favor of both.\n  However, I will vote against the Aiken nomination. For me, the bottom \nline is this: As we embark on a congressional session in which we plan \nto put the emphasis on protecting families and cracking down on violent \ncrime, we should not begin the year by confirming a judge who sentenced \na child rapist to 90 days in jail. We can demand more of the \nPresident's judicial nominees. The people of this country deserve \nbetter.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to respond briefly to the \ncomments of Senator Ashcroft on Judge Aiken's record. Senator Smith, I \nbelieve, has already amply defended Judge Aiken's record. I want to add \na few comments of my own here, if I can. My colleagues, Senators Enzi \nand Ashcroft, have rightly criticized Judge Aiken for her ruling in the \nDye case, in which during her first month on the circuit court bench, \nshe gave the defendant what appears to be a fairly light sentence for \nthe molestation of a 5-year-old girl. I agree with the criticisms of \nJudge Aiken's decision. She did indicate that she imposed the sentence \nin order for the defendant to receive treatment. In her opinion,\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\ntreatment was the only way she could prevent this individual from \nrepeating his heinous crimes.\n  I seriously question the wisdom of her decision. But to her credit, \nJudge Aiken stated that if she had to do it all over again, she would \nhave imposed a lengthy prison term. She recognized her mistake and she \nlearned from it, and it was made in the early tenure of her judgeship.\n  A review of her record since the Dye case suggests that she has more \nthan learned from this original error. I know, too, that some are \ntroubled by Judge Aiken's comment to a young, violent criminal that he \nwas ``a victim of the community's lack of intervention.'' Well, what \noften gets lost in this criticism is that Judge Aiken also sentenced \nthis defendant who had robbed people and threatened to kill them to the \nmaximum range of penalties allowed under the Oregon guidelines. Given \nJudge Aiken's background in family law, her comment was not as \nunreasonable as some might think it seems.\n  So the question for the Senate is whether, in the face of a \nrelatively clear record as a State judge and the overwhelming \nbipartisan support of the Oregon delegation, the Oregon bar, her \ncolleagues on the bench, and the people of Oregon, the Senate should \ndefeat this nominee because of one or two errant cases. I have to say, \nI think not. I hope none of us are going to be judged on one or two \nmistakes we might have made in our lifetimes. To the extent that these \ncases raise questions--and they do raise serious questions--I do not \nbelieve a strong case can be made that Judge Aiken has a record of \nexceeding the proper bounds of judicial authority or that she will \nattempt to legislate from the bench or act otherwise as an activist \njudge. Accordingly, I will vote to confirm Judge Aiken, and I urge all \nof my colleagues to do the same.\n  Now, in addition, I have had personal conversations with Judge Aiken, \nand I have to say she has impressed me greatly as someone who I think \nwill act very properly on the Federal district bench. I agree with both \nSenators that she is going to be a very strong anticrime judge. I think \nher record shows that, in spite of these what some call \n``discrepancies,'' to which I think legitimate criticism can be lodged, \nI don't know of many judges who have been on the bench very long that \nsomebody can't find some criticism to lodge against them, because \njudges sit in judgment. They have to ``split the baby,'' so to speak, \nand make some decisions. In almost every case, somebody is going to be \nunhappy with their decision. If a judge ever shows leniency in this day \nand age, they are going to be subject to criticism by some. If the \njudge is too tough, that judge is going to get criticism from others. \nOne side or the other is always going to find some fault.\n  But in this particular case, she more than adequately explains the \nsituation. In the first case, the Dye case, she admitted that if she \nhad to do it all over again, she would have decided the case \ndifferently. Keep in mind that all people in the early tenures of their \nwork life generally stumble and make a few mistakes. That is what \nhappened here. But you have to judge these judges, and all nominees who \nmay not be judges, on the totality of their lives' work and the \ntotality of what they have done and not just defeat judges on the basis \nof one or two things with which we might legitimately disagree, \nespecially when the judge has indicated a willingness to change and do \nthings differently in the future.\n  There is no doubt that the judge erred in the Dye case. It was wrong \nto sentence the criminal to only 3 months in prison. But you have to \nJudge Aiken on her whole record. She has more than adequately explained \nthat, as far as I am concerned.\n  We are definitely going to have some votes on judges this year where \nthere will be real, legitimate reasons to oppose them, and the \nadministration knows that. They understand that when they send some of \nthese folks up, there might be opposition. But I don't think the \nopposition is justified against this judge. On the other hand, I \nrespect my colleagues who feel otherwise, but I hope that our fellow \nSenators will vote for Judge Aiken.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to executive session and a vote on the \nconfirmation of the nomination of Calendar No. 454, Ann Aiken. I \nfurther ask consent that immediately following that vote, Executive \nCalendar Nos. 486 and 488 be confirmed and the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table and the President be notified of the Senate's \naction and the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. All Senators should now be aware that there will be one \nrollcall vote beginning at 2:15 this afternoon. In order to accommodate \na number of Senators' schedules, the remaining nominations will be \nconfirmed without a rollcall vote. I thank all Members for their \ncooperation in this matter.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Aikens \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there has not been much conversation about \none of the judicial nominees pending before us. I did want to make a \nfew comments on his behalf. The reason for the lack of comments is that \nI believe he has the unanimous, bipartisan support of everyone here in \nthe body. And I appreciate that because I, too, enthusiastically \nendorse the nomination of U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Silverman of the \nState of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I would \nlike to make a few comments on his behalf at this point.\n  Judge Silverman brings a proven judicial track record to this \nposition. For the past 2\\1/2\\ years he has served as a magistrate judge \non the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, my \nhome State. For over 10 years prior to that, he was a superior court \njudge in Maricopa County. While on the superior court bench, he \nrendered superior service in all aspects of his civil, criminal, \njuvenile and domestic relations assignments.\n  In addition to his time on the bench, Judge Silverman spent 5 years \nas court commissioner for the Superior Court of Arizona, Maricopa \nCounty.\n  Throughout his distinguished judicial career, Judge Silverman has \nearned the respect and admiration of fellow judges and the advocates \nwho have appeared in his courtroom. For example, in 1991, Judge \nSilverman received the Henry Stevens Award, which is given annually by \nthe Maricopa County Bar Association to the current or former Arizona \ntrial judge ``who reflects the finest qualities of the judiciary.''\n  Similarly, in 1994, the Maricopa County Committee on Judicial \nPerformance indicated that Judge Silverman received the highest \npercentage of superior ratings from lawyers, litigants, witnesses, and \ncourt staff in all categories of performance reviewed.\n  Also, in 1994, Judge Silverman's court division was honored as the \njudicial division of the year by the Maricopa County Superior Court \nRecognition Committee.\n  Incidentally, I should say that Maricopa County is the county in \nwhich Phoenix is located, the capital of our State.\n  In addition to his regular judicial duties, Judge Silverman has \nadvanced the legal profession through service on the Supreme Court of \nArizona Judicial Ethics and Advisory Committee, the Committee on \nJudicial Education and Training, and the Committee on Professionalism. \nHe also chaired a Committee to Study the Criminal Justice\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\nSystem in the Arizona Superior Court in 1993, and the Governor's \nCommittee on Child Support Guidelines.\n  Judge Silverman has shown his commitment to the United States \nConstitution and the rule of law by cofounding the Sandra Day O'Connor \nPrize for Excellence in Constitutional Law at the Arizona State \nUniversity College of Law.\n  Judge Silverman's academic credentials are equally impressive. He \ngraduated summa cum laude from the Arizona State University College of \nLaw in 1976 and was subsequently honored by his alma mater twice, once \nin 1994, when the college of law presented him with its ``Outstanding \nAlumnus Award,'' and again in 1997 when he received the prestigious \n``Dean's Award.''\n  In short, Mr. President, I believe Judge Silverman meets the highest \nof standards required for our Federal judges, and I have been very \nprivileged to support his nomination as it has proceeded through the \nprocess and come to the floor of the Senate. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support the nomination of Judge Barry Silverman for the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Allow me to conclude, Mr. President, with this observation. It has \nbeen a pleasure to work with the White House on this nomination. From \nthe time that his name came forward, they worked diligently to conclude \nthe FBI process, which does take some time. We received from the White \nHouse the Sunday before Congress adjourned in November the file for \nJudge Silverman and the committee was able to get that file in 1 day, \nthe following Monday.\n  Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who has been \ncriticized for holding up some nominees, I must say, deserves a great \ndeal of credit here for personally conducting the hearing for Judge \nSilverman. And then the following day--this is now 3 days after we \nreceived the file--scheduling an executive session of the committee so \nthat we could send his nomination to the full Senate floor.\n  Chairman Hatch and I then requested the majority leader on the last \nday of the session in November to clear this nomination so that the \nninth circuit could receive him and have his services. Unfortunately, \nthe democratic leader was not able to clear Judge Silverman on the \ndemocratic side and therefore about 2\\1/2\\ months, unnecessarily, the \nninth circuit was without a judge in this particular position. But I am \nparticularly pleased that he is before us today and that we will very \nsoon have an opportunity to vote and to confirm Judge Silverman for the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very glad that we are moving forward \nwith judges today. We all hear, as we are growing up, that, ``Justice \ndelayed is justice denied,'' and we have, in many of our courts, \nvacancies that have gone on for a year, 2 years, and in many cases it \nis getting to the crisis level. So I am pleased that we will be voting. \nI think, whether the delays are on the Republican side or the \nDemocratic side, let these names come up, let us have debate, let us \nvote.\n  In that regard, I am looking forward to having our debate on the \nnominee I had recommended to President Clinton, Margaret Morrow, who \nhas the strong support of Senator Hatch, many Republicans on the \nJudiciary Committee, and I am very hopeful we can get that nomination \nresolved.\n  I know that our leaders had agreed that vote would take place before \nthe February recess and I will be speaking with both leaders to find \nout a date certain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S73-7", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S82]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, last night we learned from our President \nthat the state of the Union is the strongest it has been in decades. \nThe ``misery index,'' that is inflation and interest rates combined, is \nat a 30-year low. Inflation is practically nonexistent. The Federal \ndeficit is about to be eliminated. Over 14 million new jobs have been \ncreated in the last 7 years. We are seeing the lowest unemployment rate \nin a quarter of a century at 4.7 percent today. And we have seen the \nhighest home ownership rate in history, nearly 6 million new homeowners \nsince 1992.\n  The booming economy and the bright fiscal picture give us a wonderful \nopportunity to continue to support a balanced budget, but one with a \nheart and one that makes critical investments in important areas, many \noutlined by the President--education, health care, health research, the \nenvironment, anticrime efforts, child care and, of course, ensuring \nthat Social Security will be fiscally sound well into the next century.\n  I am looking forward to working hard, on a bipartisan basis, with my \ncolleagues as we write this budget. I am privileged to serve on the \nBudget Committee where we will take the first crack at crafting a \nSenate budget. I also sit on other committees that will carry through \nsome of those priorities.\n  I want to point out just a couple of issues that the President talked \nabout which are very near and dear, not only to my heart but, much more \nimportant, to the hearts of the people that I represent, the people of \nCalifornia.\n  This important issue is after-school care. It is a little-known fact \nthat juvenile crime peaks up at 3 o'clock and begins to go down at 6 \no'clock. So, between 3 and 6 our children need something to say ``yes'' \nto. They need mentoring. They need help with their homework. The after-\nschool hours are an opportune time for business to come in and teach \nour young people about business, teach them computers and the many \nskills that they need to succeed.\n  I have written a bill that would set up some model after-school \nprograms. I was debating, should I offer it in the context of education \nor should I offer it in the context of juvenile crime reduction. After-\nschool programs both improve education and reduce juvenile crime.\n  The President is launching a huge initiative there. He is also \ncalling for and end to social promotion, 100,000 new teachers to help \nour children, and something that is important, reducing class sizes in \nthe early grades. We need to implement voluntary national standards and \nwe must rebuild our crumbling schools and build the new schools of the \n21st century. This President is on his way to being the true education \nPresident. I want us to be the true education Senate, and I very much \nlook forward to the time we will spend on this Senate floor debating \neducation.\n  The President is calling our attention to the current health care \ncrisis. We took a giant step in helping our young people last year, by \ngiving a block grant to the States. They are going to work on making \nsure our children are insured.\n  There is a big gap between the ages of 55 and 65, while people are \nwaiting to get into Medicare, and the President proposes a pay-as-you-\ngo system to handle some of those people, to allow\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\nthem to buy into Medicare. I want to emphasize this is a pay-as-you-go \nsystem. We have heard criticism that we can't do anything to expand \nMedicare without harming Medicare. I don't think there is anyone in the \nSenate who would do that. We want to make sure that anything that we \nput forward pays for itself.\n  The President also touched on the rights of health care consumers to \nget quality health care from HMOs. These health maintenance \norganizations often deliver care in a very efficient manner. The \nquestion is, is the quality there? I wrote a bill, the Health Care \nConsumers' Bill of Rights Act, which parallels a lot of what the \nPresident talked about. I hope we can enact a patient's bill of rights \nthis year.\n  When I was in my State, I had the good fortune to meet with a \ngentleman named Harry Christie, who had a poignant story to tell. His \ndaughter Carley at age 9 was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form \nof kidney cancer. His HMO refused to allow him to take that child to a \npediatric surgeon who specialized in this very delicate operation. So, \nMr. Christie was faced with a terrible choice. What to do? He dug into \nhis own pocket, he somehow got the thousands of dollars--$40,000 to be \nexact--to pay for Carley's operation. This story has a happy ending. \nCarley had the operation. She is 14 years old. She is cancer free. But \nonly because her dad went against the HMO.\n  I don't want to see any other parent in America go through that \ntorture. If there is a specialist available to handle a crisis, anyone \nin this country who has health insurance should be able to go to that \nspecialist. That would be part of the patients' bill of rights.\n  I am ready to work with my colleagues to develop a consensus HMO \nreform bill that we can pass and send to the President for his \nsignature. In the end, it doesn't matter whose name is on the bill. I \ndo not care if it is a Democratic bill or a Republican bill. Our task \nis simply to get the job done. I look forward to working on this \nlegislation and I hope the Majority Leader will schedule action on it \nthis year. In my view, HMO reform must be a top priority of this \nsession of Congress.\n  In the crime area, I will be urging my colleagues in the Senate to \nagree to legislation that will require all makers of handguns to \ninclude child safety locks in the weapons. The President proposed this \nlast year, a number of manufacturers have voluntarily complied, but I \nwant to ensure that all of them do.\n  I will also continue to make the case for my legislation to ban the \nmanufacture and sale of ``junk guns'' or ``Saturday night specials'', \nwhich are cheap, poorly made guns that are so often used in the \ncommission of crimes. I realize that the chances of such legislation \npassing are low, given the current makeup of the Congress, but I think \nthat it is important to raise the issue, nevertheless.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I will be \nworking a number of bills that are of great importance to the people \nand communities of my state, including reforming the Superfund program \nto clean up contaminated sites across the country.\n  I will seek opportunities to enact my legislation, the ``Children's \nEnvironmental Protection Act'', which would require all of our \nenvironmental health and safety standards to be set at levels that \nwould ensure protection of children, the elderly, and pregnant women, \nand other vulnerable groups. It would also require the EPA to establish \na list of ``safer-for-children'' products such as pesticides and \nhousehold cleaners, to give concerned consumers more information on the \nproducts found in all American households.\n  I also applaud and will work to enact the President's ``Clean Water \nInitiative'', which will provide substantial new resources to fulfill \nthe promise of the Clean Water Act to give all Americans clean, safe \nlakes, rivers and coastal waters.\n  Sometime in the next few weeks, the Senate is expected to take up the \ntransportation infrastructure bill--ISTEA--and I look forward to that \ndebate. Californians are anxious to see quick action on that \nlegislation, which provides funding for highway, transit, and other \ntransportation projects throughout the state.\n  Last night, the President announced that his budget, which he will \nsubmit to Congress next week, will be in balance beginning in fiscal \nyear 1999. The Budget Committee, of which I am a member, began its \nhearings on the state of the economy and the federal budget this \nmorning. I believe that we can balance the budget next year, and I will \nwork to ensure that it happens. Hopefully, we can start seeing budget \nsurpluses in future years. But I want to be very clear about that: \nbefore we do anything else, we must ensure the integrity of the Social \nSecurity trust fund, so that baby boomers and future generations can \ncount on getting the benefits for which they have contributed all their \nworking lives.\n  Within the context of a balanced budget, I believe we have the \nresources for limited, targeted tax reduction. I will introduce a bill \nin the next few days to provide a tax deduction for the cost of buying \nhealth insurance to people whose employers do not provide health plans \nand for those who are unemployed.\n  There are many other issues I could go into. I see my friend Senator \nGrams is here. We just spent about an hour together in the Budget \nCommittee. I am sure he has some valuable issues to lay out for the \nSenate. But I do think it is important to know--and I am putting it in \nvery blunt terms--that although we celebrate a balanced budget, if it \nweren't for the surplus of Social Security that we are borrowing, we \nwould still be in debt. It is time to pay back the Social Security \ntrust fund. You know, there are many trust funds that we have, that we \nshould pay back--they are much smaller than Social Security; we can do \nit easily--the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Aviation Trust \nFund, the Highway Trust Funds. Those are small. We can pay them back. \nBut Social Security is large.\n  If you owe a debt to someone in life you have to pay him or her back. \nWhen I have young people standing up at my community meetings, looking \nme in the eye, who say, ``Can you tell me Social Security will be there \nwhen I need it? I'm 30 years old and I'm not sure.'' I tell them when I \nwas 30 I wasn't sure Social Security would be there. But because of the \npolicies of the Senators, the Congress, the Presidents of both parties, \nSocial Security will be there for me and my family. ``I assure you,'' I \nsaid to this last gentleman that mentioned it, ``it will be there for \nyou. But only if we heed what President Clinton said.''\n  We have to pay back the Social Security trust fund and then we will \nhave something to be very proud of. We will look back at this time in \nour history and the people will say about us that we made the right \ninvestments in the right things. They paid dividends. They made our \npeople strong and our country strong. And, yes, we saw a looming \nproblem called Social Security and Medicare and we acted to shore up \nthose funds to make sure that future generations will have what this \ngeneration has--peace and security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the American taxpayers sat down last night \nto listen to their Chief Executive speak about the state of the union \nand the future of our country. Bill Clinton knows how to give a good \nspeech, and as we have come to expect, last night's was filled with \nlots of proposals and promises and reminders of some of the successes \nof the past year.\n  It is true--our nation has seen some good times recently. By \nreturning accountability to Washington, we have brought the Federal \ndeficit under control and reduced unemployment to its lowest levels \nthis decade. We have cut taxes for working families for the first time \nin 16 years. The markets have soared to all-time highs and the economy \nis churning out rewards for anyone willing to work. Americans are \nfeeling good about their country and about their futures.\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\n  Unfortunately, their President failed to warn them last night--even \nonce during his 75-minute speech--that many of the achievements he \nacknowledged are at risk, threatened by a Federal Government failure so \nmassive that it may take the taxpayers years, even decades, to burrow \nout from underneath it. What could be so potentially devastating? The \nfailure of the U.S. Department of Energy to begin accepting the \nNation's spent commercial nuclear fuel.\n  And, Mr. President, the taxpayers will inherit the responsibility for \nthat failure just 4 days from now.\n  After 16 years of denials, delays, and indifference on the part of \nthe U.S. Department of Energy, combined with the politics of special \ninterest groups, the American taxpayers are about to find themselves \nsaddled with the liability for our Nation's nuclear waste. It is a \nliability they do not deserve, and one they most certainly cannot \nafford.\n  The clock has been ticking relentlessly for 16 years, and on Saturday \nnight, at midnight, the clock will finally run out on the taxpayers on \nthis issue. After a decade and a half of playing ``cat-and-mouse'' with \nthe Congress and the courts, it appears as though the DOE may be \nsuccessful in ducking out of its responsibility. But that can only \nhappen if Congress allows this Administration to get away with it \nunchallenged.\n  Mr. President, I stand before you today to pledge that this Senator \nwill not let that happen.\n  For 16 years, the public has been assured that by January 31st, 1998, \njust 4 days from now, the Federal Government would take responsibility \nfor storage of the Nation's commercial spent nuclear fuel. Since \nenactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, energy ratepayers \nhave been charged a one-mill fee per kilowatt-hour in exchange for this \n``promise.'' Each dollar collected is from a consumer located in one of \nthe 34 States that benefit from nuclear energy. Only those who benefit \nfrom the lower-cost nuclear power--not the general public--would \nsupposedly fund the waste storage.\n  Dutifully, ratepayers around the country have paid their fees--to the \ntune of some $13 billion. For Minnesota alone, this translates into \nmore than $271 million. For 16 years, these fees have poured into the \nNuclear Waste Fund based upon a legal--and contractual--obligation that \nthe waste would be removed.\n  Today, with $7 billion of those ratepayer dollars already spent, the \nwaste is piling up. Nobody at the DOE wants it, nobody at the DOE is \nprepared to claim it, and because there is no place to put it, nobody \nat the DOE would be ready to take it by January 31 anyway. Again, that \nis just 4 days from now.\n  At the same time, energy consumers are pouring billions into the \nwaste fund, ratepayers and utilities are continuing to pay for on-site \nstorage at more than 70 commercial nuclear plants throughout the \ncountry.\n  In other words, ratepayers are being forced to pay twice for nuclear \nwaste storage, all because the Department of Energy has failed to meet \nits legal obligations to the American people.\n  As troubling as this expensive delay has been, that fact alone is not \nthe greatest affront to the American public. What I find most troubling \nis the financial risk the DOE has dumped at the feet of the taxpayers, \nbecause suddenly, every one of them will soon be on the hook for the \nnuclear waste debacle.\n  Since coming to Congress in 1993, I have watched the Energy \nDepartment play a protracted game of ``would not, could not, should \nnot'' with the States, the ratepayers, and the Congress. It is a bob-\nand-weave strategy the DOE has had 16 years to perfect.\n  In 1994, the DOE argued that it would not accept the nuclear waste by \n1998 because the law did not require it to do so. At that time, \nMinnesota was threatened with a premature shutdown of its Prairie \nIsland nuclear facility, again, due to a lack of on-site storage. The \nDOE's claim exacerbated an already difficult situation for the State \nlegislature and Minnesota residents, as the State faced the very real \npossibility it would lose up to 30 percent of its energy resources.\n  But the Energy Department's flippant response at the time was, ``It's \nyour problem, not ours.''\n  And so the States went to court. They sued and they won. In July of \n1996, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the nuclear waste was \nthe DOE's problem and that the January 31st deadline did apply. When \nthe DOE argued that they would not take the waste, the court told them, \n``yes, you will.''\n  Over the next few months, the DOE was silent on the issue. And so the \nStates wrote to the department asking of its plans to comply with the \ncourt decision. The following month, the Department of Energy responded \nby writing to utilities soliciting their ideas on how they would cope \nwith a failure by the agency to meet the deadline. Having exhausted the \n``would not'' argument, the DOE was now arguing in essence that they \n``could not'' comply with the law.\n  In June of 1997, the DOE, in direct defiance of the 1996 court order, \nagain asserted that delay was unavoidable due to ``acts of Government \nin its sovereign capacity,'' and once again made it the States' and \nutilities problem, not theirs.\n  So back to court went the States and utilities.\n  Last November, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the same court that \nruled the year before, again affirmed that the Department of Energy's \nobligation to accept the nuclear waste. The panel stated explicitly \nthat the federal government could not surrender its responsibility or \nliability, and alluded to whether the DOE was putting the taxpayers on \nthe hook for its failure to comply.\n  Mr. President, the estimates of potential damages and awards have put \nthe dollar figure as high as $80 billion, and some believe it could go \nsignificantly higher. That is a public bailout of immense proportions \nthat would rival the savings and loan bailout.\n  It was never the intent of Congress to put the taxpayers at risk when \nit enacted the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Nor is that the desire \nof the 34 States that have nuclear waste stored on-site; they would \nrather see the waste removed so the production of low-cost power can \ncontinue. Still, the Energy Department persists in opposing the people \nat every turn.\n  Mr. President, on December 29th, 1997, just a few weeks ago, the \nDepartment of Energy filed a ``Petition for Rehearing'' in an effort to \nnullify the earlier court rulings. This most recent stunt by the DOE \nreflects their new position that they ``should not'' be held \nresponsible--technically or financially--primarily because these \nlawsuits have been heard in the wrong court.\n  After the DOE's cries of ``would not, could not, should not,'' it is \nnow up to Congress to respond in the positive: we will protect the \ntaxpayers; and we can develop a solution for resolving the nuclear \nwaste storage crisis; and we must enact the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n1997 as soon as possible, legislation I have coauthored with my friends \nand colleagues, Senators Craig and Murkowski.\n  Mr. President, our legislation would set in motion the implementation \nof a timely and environmentally sound waste solution, and was adopted \nby overwhelming, bipartisan votes last year in the Senate and House. \nNevertheless, with conferee appointments pending, a veto threat from \nthe administration may yet derail the bill. So once again, the \nDepartment of Energy is blocking the will of the people.\n  The taxpayers have the most to lose if the Department of Energy \nprevails and we accept the status quo. These are hard-working Americans \nwho have to keep a budget and account for their spending, and they \nexpect the Federal Government to exercise that same accountability with \ntheir tax dollars as well. With so many Government agencies and \nprograms fighting for limited funds, how can the taxpayers possibly \nafford a multi-billion-dollar bailout of the Energy Department? How can \nthe Nation's energy consumers afford additional on-site storage, early \ndecommissioning costs, alternative fuel purchases to compensate for \nlost power? How can they afford refinancing the billions wasted from \nthe Nuclear Waste Fund? How will the economy handle the loss of jobs \nand productivity that will certainly follow when energy costs begin to \nsoar and generating facilities begin to shut down?\n  How is it possible that all of this will be set into motion just 4 \ndays from now, and yet it did not merit a single sentence in the \nPresident's State of the Union Address last night?\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\n  The President last night also failed to mention that these costs will \nbe borne as much by grandma and grandpa as they will by any corporate \nexecutives or Members of Congress. He did not mention that nuclear \npower is a fuel that burns nothing, thereby helping us achieve cleaner \nair and a better environment. He failed to mention that the costs of \nhis global warming treaty will be even higher for every American if we \ncontinue to shut down nuclear power plants in favor of coal-burning \ntechnologies. And most regrettably, he failed to offer any kind of \nexplanation into why his administration supports the Department of \nEnergy as they unlawfully stick it to the American taxpayers.\n  While the DOE waits, and hides behind courtroom appeals, and shirks \nits responsibilities that it is legally bound to accept, Americans \nacross our country can expect yet more rate increases and yet higher \ntaxes from a government that is either too afraid or too incompetent to \nact.\n  How can we face ourselves come Sunday morning--just 4 days from \ntoday--if we simply step back and quietly allow this to happen? We \ncould not, we should not, and we will not.\n  So finally, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reassure their \nconstituents that come midnight on Saturday, the people will not be \nforgotten, that they will return to Washington next week and fulfill \ntheir oath to protect the taxpayers and ensure that their Government \nfulfills its obligation to them, and that we will never allow such a \nfailure to happen again.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S83-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S85]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was unable to make my comments earlier \ninvolving the consideration and approval of the various judges. I would \nlike to address the Senate for a few moments on this particular issue \nand, most importantly, to express the strong support for the three \nnominations that have just been confirmed by the Senate.\n  Judge Silverman has served with distinction for the past three years \non the federal district court in Arizona and will be an impressive \nmember of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Richard Story, has \nserved as a state court judge for many years, and will do an excellent \njob on the United States District Court in Northern Georgia.\n  I am particularly pleased that at long last the Senate is allowed to \nconsider the nomination of Judge Ann Aiken. She is an outstanding \nchoice for the federal district court in Oregon. For the past decade, \nshe has served with distinction as a state court judge--first on the \ndistrict court and, for the past five years on the circuit court. She \nis widely respected in Oregon for her service to her community. She \nreceived the Woman of Achievement award in 1993 from the Oregon \nCommission for Women. The U.S. Department of Justice honored her in \n1994 for her leadership in helping victims of crime.\n  But despite her impressive qualifications, her nomination has been \nstonewalled by Republicans in the Senate for more than two years.\n  On the average, it is taking twice as long for Senate Republicans to \nconfirm President Clinton's nominees as it took for Democrats to act on \nPresident Bush's nominations to the federal courts.\n  For women, the problem is especially serious. Women nominated to \nfederal judgeships are being subjected to greater delays by Senate \nRepublicans than men.\n  So far in this Republican Congress, women nominated to our federal \ncourts are four times--four times--more likely than men to be held up \nby the Republican Senate for more than a year.\n  Last year, the Senate confirmed 30 men, but only 6 women. So only 17 \npercent of the nominees that the Republican leadership brought before \nthe Senate were women--half as many as President Clinton nominated.\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\n  The country is paying a heavy price for this obstruction. Citizens \ncan't get their day in court, because the Republican Senate is playing \npolitics with the courts and preventing needed judicial positions from \nbeing filled.\n  When even a Republican Chief Justice criticizes the Republican \nCongress, you know something's wrong.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist issued his annual year-end report on the \nState of the Judiciary last month, and he sharply criticized the \nRepublican Senate for refusing to move more quickly to confirm judges.\n  The Chief Justice is deeply concerned about the high number of \njudicial vacancies on the federal courts. There are too few judges to \nhandle the workload.\n  The Republican bottleneck in the Senate is jeopardizing the court \nsystem and undermining the quality of justice. Of the 77 judicial \nnominations pending last year, only 36 were confirmed--less than half. \nEleven have been awaiting action for over 18 months.\n  That's a scandal. Nominees deserve a vote. If our Republican \ncolleagues don't like them, vote against them. But don't just sit on \nthem--that's obstruction of justice.\n  Free and full debate over judicial nominations is healthy. The \nConstitution is clear that only individuals acceptable to both the \nPresident and the Senate should be confirmed. The President and the \nSenate do not always agree. But we should resolve these disagreements \nby voting on these nominees--yes or no. As Chief Justice Rehnquist said \nin his annual report, ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to \nconfirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time it should \nvote'' up or down.\n  Some Republicans claim they are protecting the federal courts from \n``judicial activism.'' But this argument is a smokescreen. If President \nClinton is actually nominating judicial activists, then why is it that \nthese nominees are approved almost unanimously when the Senate is \nfinally allowed to vote on them?\n  Eric Clay's nomination to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was held \nup in the Senate for more than 15 months. He was finally confirmed--\nunanimously--by voice vote.\n  Joseph Battalion--President Clinton's nominee to the District Court \nof Nebraska--was held up for 17 months. Then he, too, finally passed \nthe Senate on a voice vote.\n  Other nominees were confirmed by overwhelming votes, but only after \nlong delays. Katherine Sweeney Hayden was confirmed to the District \nCourt in New Jersey by a vote of 97-0. Ronald L. Gilman's nomination to \nthe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and Janet C. Hall's nomination to \nthe District Court of Connecticut were each confirmed by a vote of 98-\n1.\n  The closest vote we have had on any of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees was 76 to 23 in favor of confirmation.\n  Clearly, the Republicans' claim that Clinton judges are activist \njudges is a transparent smokescreen being used to slow down the \nconfirmation process. The reason is obvious. The Republican majority in \nCongress is doing all it can to prevent a Democratic President from \nnaming judges to the federal courts. The courts are suffering and so is \nthe nation.\n  In some areas of the country, people have to wait years to have their \ncases even heard in court. And then they have to wait years more for \noverburdened judges to find time to reach their decisions. Families, \nworkers, small businesses, women and minorities have traditionally \nlooked to the courts to resolve disputes. The lack of federal judges \nmakes the swift resolution of their cases impossible.\n  The number of cases filed in the federal appeals courts has grown by \n11 percent over the last six years. The average time between filing and \ndisposition has also increased. Courts with long-standing vacancies are \nin even worse shape.\n  In the District Court in Oregon, the court to which Ann Aiken has \nbeen nominated, the number of case filings has risen by nearly a third \nsince 1990.\n  Another nominee, Margaret Morrow has been nominated to the federal \ndistrict court in Los Angeles, and I hope we will consider her \nnomination next week. Since 1994, the caseload in that court has grown \nby 15 percent. The time people have to wait for their civil cases to be \nresolved has increased by 11 percent. In that district, over 300 \npending civil cases are more than three years old.\n  Real people are being hurt. Consider the case of Rudy Boerseker, a \n40-year-old mine worker in Illinois who was injured by poor maintenance \nof equipment. The facts of the case made clear that the accident \nresulted from the mining company's negligence. Yet Mr. Boerseker was \nfinally forced to accept a settlement for less than half of what he \nwould probably have received if the case had gone to trial.\n  He agreed to an unfair settlement, because he could not afford to \nwait the three or four years it would take for the case to be decided.\n  In the Southern District of Texas, 4,000 victims of a student loan \nscam are waiting for the outcome of a class action suit that has been \npending for almost eight years.\n  In South Carolina, there is still no decision in a suit filed more \nthan six years ago against the state's apportionment laws. The outcome \nof this case will affect hundreds of thousands of citizens. It goes to \nthe heart of whether the basic constitutional principle of ``one \nperson, one vote'' is being fairly applied.\n  In Southern Florida, Julio Vasquez--a U.S. citizen migrant worker--\nbroke his leg in 1989 in a boarding house provided by his employer. To \nthis day, nearly nine years later, Mr. Vasquez has never received \nsufficient medical attention, and his injury affects his ability to \nwork. He is still waiting for the judge's ruling in his case.\n  In the District Court of Oregon, a five-million dollar judgment in \nfavor a family business in a patent dispute with a Fortune 500 firm was \ntied up for more than a year because of the delays caused by two \nvacancies on the court.\n  These examples are typical victims of the vacancy crisis in the \nfederal courts.\n  They are hard-working Americans injured on the job--citizens seeking \nto exercise their right to vote--students trying to get an education--\nsmall businesses denied their rights by large corporations.\n  It is time to end these delays and end these industries. It's a new \nyear, and a new session, and I hope very much that our colleagues will \nturn over a new leaf and end these unreasonable, unacceptable, and \nunconscionable delays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S85-5", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S86-S88]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

This Supplementary Notice requests \nfurther comment on proposed amendments to procedural rules previously \nadopted implementing various labor and employment and public access \nlaws to covered employees within the Legislative Branch.\n  Section 304(b) requires this Notice to be printed in the \nCongressional Record, therefore I ask unanimous consent that the notice \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the notice was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Office of Compliance--The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \n                     Amendments to Procedural Rules\n\n\n              supplementary notice of proposed rulemaking\n\n       Summary: On October 1, 1997, the Executive Director of the \n     Office of Compliance (``Office'') published a Notice of \n     Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM'') to amend the Procedural Rules \n     of the Office of Compliance to cover the General Accounting \n     Office (``GAO'') and the Library of Congress (``Library'') \n     and their employees. 143 Cong. Rec. S10291 (daily ed. Oct. 1, \n     1997). The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'') \n     applies rights and protections of eleven labor, employment, \n     and public access laws to the Legislative Branch. Sections \n     204-206 and 215 of the CAA, which apply rights and \n     protections of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 \n     (``EPPA''), the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification \n     Act (``WARN Act''), the Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Act of 1994 (``USERRA''), and the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Act of 1970 (``OSHAct''), became effective \n     with respect to GAO and the Library on December 30, 1997. The \n     NPRM proposed to extend the Procedural Rules to cover GAO and \n     the Library and their employees for purposes of: (1) \n     proceedings relating to these sections 204-206 and 215, (2) \n     proceedings relating to section\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\n     207 of the CAA, which prohibits intimidation and reprisal for \n     the exercise of rights under the CAA, and (3) regulating ex \n     parte communications.\n       In the only comments received in response to the NPRM, the \n     Library questioned whether the CAA authorizes employees of \n     the Library to initiate proceedings under the administrative \n     and judicial procedures of the CAA alleging violations of \n     sections 204-207 of the Act. The Office is publishing this \n     Supplementary Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (this ``Notice'') \n     to give the regulated community an opportunity to provide \n     further comment on the questions raised by the Library's \n     submission.\n       With respect to proceedings relating to section 215 of the \n     CAA (OSHAct) and with respect to ex parte communications, a \n     separate Notice of Adoption of Amendments is being prepared \n     to extend the Procedural Rules to cover GAO and the Library \n     and their employees and to respond to relevant portions of \n     the Library's comments, and will be published shortly.\n       Dates: Comments are due within 30 days after the date of \n     publication of this Notice.\n       Addresses: Submit comments in writing (an original and 10 \n     copies) to the Executive Director, Office of Compliance, Room \n     LA 200, John Adams Building, 110 Second Street, S.E., \n     Washington, D.C. 20540-1999. Those wishing to receive \n     notification of receipt of comments are requested to include \n     a self-addressed, stamped post card. Comments may also be \n     transmitted by facsimile (``FAX'') machine to (202) 426-1913. \n     This is not a toll-free call.\n       Availability of comments for public review: Copies of \n     comments received by the Office will be available for public \n     review at the Law Library Reading Room, Room LM-201, Law \n     Library of Congress, James Madison Memorial Building, \n     Washington, D.C., Monday through Friday, between the hours of \n     9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.\n       For further information contact: Executive Director, Office \n     of Compliance, at (202) 724-9250 (voice), (202) 426-1912 \n     (TTY). This Notice will be made available in large print or \n     braille or on computer disk upon request to the Office of \n     Compliance.\n\n\n                       supplementary information\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     the ``Act''), Pub. L. 104-1, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438, \n     applies the rights and protections of eleven labor, \n     employment, and public access laws to certain defined \n     ``covered employees'' and ``employing offices'' in the \n     Legislative Branch. The CAA expressly provides that GAO and \n     the Library and their employees are included within the \n     definitions of ``covered employees'' and ``employing \n     offices'' for purposes of four sections of the Act:\n       (a) EPPA. Section 204, making applicable the rights and \n     protections of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 \n     (``EPPA'')--in which subsection (a) generally prohibits an \n     employing office from requiring a covered employee to take a \n     lie detector test, regardless of whether the covered employee \n     works in that employing office; and subsection (b) provides \n     that the remedy for a violation shall be such legal and \n     equitable relief as may be appropriate, including employment, \n     reinstatement, promotion, and payment of lost wages and \n     benefits.\n       (b) WARN Act. Section 205, making applicable the rights and \n     protections of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (``WARN Act'')--in which subsection (a) \n     prohibits the closure of an employing office or a mass layoff \n     until 60 days after the employing office has served written \n     notice on the covered employees or their representatives; and \n     subsection (b) provides that the remedy for a violation shall \n     generally be back pay and benefits for up to 60 days of \n     violation.\n       (c) USERRA. Section 206, making applicable the rights and \n     protections of section 2 of the Uniformed Services Employment \n     and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (``USERRA'')--in which \n     subsection (a) protects covered employees who serve in the \n     military and other uniformed services against discrimination, \n     denial of reemployment rights, and denial of benefits by \n     employing offices; and subsection (b) provides that the \n     remedy for a violation shall include requiring compliance, \n     requiring compensation for lost wages or benefits and, in \n     case of a willful violation, an equal amount as liquidated \n     damages, and the use of the ``full equity powers'' of ``[t]he \n     court'' to fully vindicate rights and benefits.\n       (d) OSHAct. Section 215, making applicable the rights and \n     protections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 \n     (``OSHAct'')--in which subsection (a) protects the safety and \n     health of covered employees from hazards in their places of \n     employment; subsection (b) provides that the remedy for a \n     violation shall be an order to correct the violation; and \n     subsection (c) specifies procedures by which the Office of \n     Compliance conducts inspections, issues and enforces \n     citations, and grants variances.\n       Sections 204-206 and 215 go into effect by their own terms \n     with respect to GAO and the Library one year after \n     transmission to Congress of the study under section 230 of \n     the CAA. The Board of Directors of the Office (``Board'') \n     transmitted its study (the ``Section 230 Study'') to Congress \n     on December 30, 1996, and sections 204-206 and 215 therefore \n     went into effect at GAO and the Library on December 30, 1997.\n       The NPRM proposed to extend the Procedural Rules of the \n     Office, which govern the consideration and resolution of \n     alleged violations of the CAA, to cover GAO and the Library \n     and their employees in four respects:\n       (1) Sections 401-408 of the CAA establish administrative \n     and judicial procedures for considering alleged violations of \n     part A of Title II of the CAA, which includes sections 204-\n     206, and the Procedural Rules detail the procedures \n     administered by the Office under sections 401-406. On the \n     premise that GAO and the Library and their employees are \n     covered by the statutory procedures of sections 401-408 when \n     there is an allegation that sections 204-206 have been \n     violated, the NPRM proposed to extend the Procedural Rules to \n     include GAO and the Library and their employees for the \n     purpose of resolving any allegation of a violation of these \n     sections.\n       (2) Section 207 prohibits employing offices from \n     intimidating or taking reprisal against any covered employee \n     for exercising rights under the CAA. On the premise that GAO \n     and the Library and their employees are covered under section \n     207, as well as under the statutory procedures of sections \n     401-408 when there is an allegation that section 207 has been \n     violated, the NPRM proposed to extend the Procedural Rules to \n     include GAO and the Library and their employees for the \n     purpose of resolving any allegation of intimidation or \n     reprisal prohibited under section 207.\n       (3)  Section 215 specifies the procedures by which the \n     Office conducts inspections, issues citations, grants \n     variances, and otherwise enforces section 215, and the \n     Procedural Rules detail the procedures administered by the \n     Office under that section. As these statutory procedures are \n     part of section 215, which expressly covers GAO and the \n     Library and their employees, the NPRM proposed to extend the \n     Procedural Rules to cover these instrumentalities and \n     employees for purposes of proceedings under section 215.\n       (4) Section 9.04 of the Procedural Rules, which regulates \n     ex parte communications, includes within its coverage any \n     covered employee and employing office ``who is or may \n     reasonably be expected to be involved in a proceeding or \n     rulemaking.'' As GAO and the Library and their employees may \n     reasonably be expected to be involved in proceedings and \n     rulemakings, the NPRM proposed to extend the Procedural Rules \n     to cover these instrumentalities and employees for purposes \n     of section 9.04.\n       As to proceedings under section 215 of the CAA (OSHAct) and \n     ex parte communications, the Library's comments argue that \n     the Library should not now come under the Office's Procedural \n     Rules generally or under the Rules relating to section 215 \n     proceedings specifically. After considering those arguments, \n     the Executive Director, with the approval of the Board, has \n     decided to amend the Procedural Rules to cover GAO and the \n     Library and their employees with respect to proceedings under \n     section 215 and ex parte communications, and a Notice of \n     Adoption of Amendments to accomplish this and to respond to \n     relevant portions of the Library's comments is being prepared \n     and will be published shortly.\n       However, as to whether CAA procedures cover GAO and the \n     Library and their employees for purposes of resolving \n     disputes under sections 204-207, the Library's comments raise \n     issues of statutory interpretation upon which the Office \n     seeks comment. The Library argues that Congress ``expressly \n     excluded'' the Library and other instrumentalities from the \n     application of all procedural and other provisions of the CAA \n     other than the substantive provisions in Title II. The \n     Library states: ``A fair reading of the CAA is that Congress \n     intended to ensure that the Library's employees were covered \n     by the substantive protections of the law, but that no \n     procedural regulations should affect the Library's employees \n     until the Office of Compliance completed its study [under \n     section 230], made its legislative recommendations, and \n     Congress acted on those recommendations.'' (The Office of \n     Compliance had made the Library's entire submission available \n     for public review in the Law Library Reading Room of the Law \n     Library of Congress, at the address and times stated at the \n     beginning of this Notice.) The Office hereby invites the \n     views of the entire regulated community on the issues raised \n     by the Library, including the following specific questions:\n\n\n                   supplemental request for comments\n\n     1. Can GAO and Library employees use the administrative and \n         judicial procedures of sections 401-408 of the CAA when a \n         violation of sections 204-206 (EPPA, WARN Act, USERRA) is \n         alleged?\n       As noted above, the NPRM was premised on the view that the \n     administrative and judicial procedures of sections 401-408 \n     cover GAO and the Library and their employees with respect to \n     proceedings where violations of sections 204-206 are alleged. \n     Because the procedures in sections 401-408 can only be \n     invoked upon an allegation that substantive rights granted in \n     Title II have been violated, the procedures arguably derive \n     their scope from the substantive provisions involved in a \n     particular proceeding. Sections 204-206 expressly cover GAO \n     and the Library and their employees, and, if the premise of \n     the NPRM is correct, proceedings under sections 401-408 that \n     involve alleged violations of sections 204-206 may likewise \n     cover those instrumentalities and employees. However, the \n     Library's comment challenged this premise, arguing that \n     Congress ``expressly excluded'' the Library and other \n     instrumentalities from the application of all portions of the \n     CAA except the substantive provisions of Title II.\n       Commenters are asked to provide their views as to whether \n     the statutory procedures\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\n     under sections 401-408 should be construed as covering GAO \n     and the Library and their employees where violations of \n     sections 204-206 are alleged, and are requested to present \n     the legal rationales that may bear on this inquiry. \n     Commenters should address:\n       The relationship, if any, between the substantive \n     requirements and remedies granted in part A of Title II and \n     the procedures established in Title IV of the CAA.\n       The definitions and usage of the defined terms ``covered \n     employees'' and ``employing office'' in various portions of \n     the Act.\n       Whether the statute can be read to provide substantive \n     rights and remedies but not procedures.\n       The provision in section 415 of the CAA prohibiting the use \n     of the Office's awards-and-settlements account for awards and \n     settlements involving GAO and the Library.\n       The effect that section 225(d) of the CAA should have in \n     determining this issue.\n       The canons of construction requiring that statutes in \n     derogation of sovereign immunity must be construed strictly \n     in favor of the sovereign and that a statutory construction \n     which raises constitutional questions such as separation-of-\n     powers may be adopted only if clearly required by the \n     statutory text.\n     2. Notwithstanding whether the procedures established under \n         the CAA apply, are other procedures, whether internal or \n         external to GAO and the Library, available for \n         considering alleged violations of sections 204-206 and \n         for imposing the remedies available under those sections?\n       In considering the Section 230 Study, The Board received \n     information from GAO and the Library and their employees \n     indicating that a variety of internal and external venues are \n     available for consideration of employee allegations of \n     violations of workplace rights and protections. Commenters \n     are invited to provide their views on the extent to which \n     procedures other than those established by the CAA are \n     available to GAO and the Library and their employees where a \n     violation of sections 204-206 is alleged and the monetary and \n     equitable remedies specified in those sections are sought. \n     Furthermore, insofar as existing procedures may not \n     comprehensively cover any dispute or provide any remedy \n     afforded under the CAA, do GAO, the Library, and other \n     employing offices have the authority to craft new procedures \n     and, through such procedures, to grant whatever monetary and \n     non-monetary remedies the CAA provides?\n       In responding to this inquiry, commenters are also asked to \n     consider the implications of several provisions in the CAA. \n     Do the following provisions limit the availability to GAO and \n     the Library and their employees of the administrative, \n     judicial, and negotiated procedures and might otherwise be \n     available to them where violations of sections 204-206 are \n     alleged and remedies granted under those sections are sought:\n       Section 225(d) and (e) and 401 contain provisions \n     specifying, in general terms, what procedures must be used to \n     consider a CAA violation and to seek a CAA remedy.\n       Sections 409 and 410 allow judicial review of CAA \n     regulations and of CAA compliance only pursuant to the \n     procedures of section 407, which provides for judicial review \n     of Board decisions, and section 408, which provides a private \n     right of action.\n       Commenters are also requested to be clear as to whether \n     procedures available outside of the CAA cover claims by \n     applicants for employment, former employees, and temporary \n     and intermittent employees, and whether these procedures \n     cover allegations by GAO or Library employees that their \n     rights granted under the CAA were violated by other employing \n     offices and allegations by employees of other employing \n     offices that their CAA rights were violated by GAO or the \n     Library.\n     3. Does section 207 of the CAA cover GAO and the Library and \n         their employees with respect to sections 204-206 and 215? \n         If not, do other laws, regulations, and procedures \n         covering GAO and the Library and their employees afford \n         similar protection against intimidation and reprisal for \n         exercising CAA rights?\n       The NPRM proposed to amend the Procedural Rules to cover \n     GAO and the Library and their employees with respect to ``any \n     allegation of intimidation or reprisal prohibited under \n     section 207 of the Act.'' While the Library did not object to \n     this proposal, section 207 does not expressly cover GAO and \n     the Library and their employees. Comment is therefore invited \n     on whether the prohibition against intimidation and reprisal \n     established by section 207 should be construed as covering \n     GAO and the Library and their employees.\n       If section 207 is construed not to apply, would other laws \n     and regulations covering GAO and the Library and their \n     employees afford protection against intimidation and reprisal \n     for exercising rights under the CAA? Would these laws and \n     regulations afford the same substantive rights and remedies \n     as section 207? What procedures would be available to \n     consider violations and to impose such remedies? Commenters \n     are requested to be clear as to whether such laws, \n     regulations, and procedures outside of the CAA cover \n     applicants for employment, former employees, and temporary \n     and intermittent employees, and whether these laws, \n     regulations, and procedures cover allegations that GAO or the \n     Library intimidated or took reprisal against employees of \n     other employing offices and allegations that other employing \n     offices intimidated or took reprisal against GAO or Library \n     employees for exercising rights granted under the CAA.\n       No decision will be made as to whether the Procedural Rules \n     will be amended to cover GAO and the Library and their \n     employees for purposes of alleged violations of sections 204-\n     207 until after the comments requested in this Notice have \n     been received and considered. During this interim period, the \n     office will accept requests for counseling under section 402, \n     requests for mediation under section 403, and complaints \n     under section 405 filed by GAO or Library employees and/or \n     alleging violations by GAO or the Library where violations of \n     sections 204-207 of the CAA are alleged. Any objections to \n     jurisdiction may be made to the hearing officer or the Board \n     under sections 405-406 or to the court during proceedings \n     under sections 407-408. The Office will counsel any employees \n     who initiate such proceedings that a question has been raised \n     as to the Office's jurisdiction and that the employees may \n     wish to preserve their rights under any other available \n     procedural avenues.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 26th day of January, \n     1998.\n                                                  Ricky Silberman,\n     Exective Director, Office of Compliance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S86-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S88]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, with the administration expected to seek \neventual Senate approval of the recent Kyoto Protocols on ``global \nwarming,'' I would like to enter into the Record an excellent article \non the subject by the noted author and historian T.R. Fehrenbach. It is \na timely reminder of the many climate-related changes our planet has \nexperienced and places the current debate in much needed historical \ncontext. I commend this article to my Senate colleagues and ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the San Antonio Express-News, Jan. 4, 1998]\n\n                     Who's Really Full of Hot Air?\n\n       The most cursory study of geology, archaeology and history \n     shows that Earth has undergone vast climatic changes \n     throughout its existence. The oil and gas under Texas soil \n     come from natural decay when this land was a hot, fetid, \n     fern-filled swamp. Later Texas was covered by sea, emerging \n     again as geological ``new land.''\n       When the first human beings arrived, it was much cooler and \n     wetter than today, supporting very different life forms from \n     those Indians hunted in historic times.\n       Archaeology shows that Saudi Arabia was once a well-\n     watered, populated plain, while Greece and Italy were heavily \n     forested. Yes, people cut down those trees, some to make the \n     ships that Helen launched, but man had nothing to do with the \n     enormous climatic changes around the Mediterranean during our \n     own geologic age, the decaying Pleistocene.\n       The world has grown steadily warmer and drier, the reason \n     Spanish forests, once cut, never resprouted. Conversely, \n     today in Alaska cut-over forests regrow within a few years \n     without replanting.\n       The evidence of repeated glaciations--they seem to come \n     about every 20,000 solar years--lies all over North America, \n     the most obvious being our Great Lakes. During these repeated \n     Ice Ages, Earth's water supply being constant, the oceans \n     shrink, falling as much as 200 feet. The first Americans got \n     here across a land bridge now sunk beneath\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\n     the Bering Sea. But as glaciation recedes the seas rise, \n     which they have been doing for thousands of years.\n       In recorded history, we can trace a warming trend \n     interspersed with ``little Ice Ages'' or irregular cold \n     periods within the cycle. The Rhine and Danube froze over in \n     late Roman times; wine-growing in those regions was \n     impossible. With warming, olive orchards grew in France, only \n     to be destroyed by horrendous cold in the late 16th and early \n     17th centuries, the same change that killed off Norse \n     settlers in Greenland.\n       Climatology, a still-rudimentary science, attributes these \n     cycles to sunspots, changes in the sun's energy output, or to \n     slight tilts in the Earth's axis. A wobble can make a \n     difference of a degree or two in average temperature, and \n     that much difference can make seas recede or flood and huge \n     areas unfit for agriculture.\n       Then there's El Nino, killing off marine life and raising \n     hob on both sides of the Pacific Rim. It was around for \n     thousands of years before the media discovered it.\n       Archeologists believe El Ninos in A.D. 546 and 576 \n     destroyed an early Indian civilization in Peru with floods, \n     soil erosion and destruction of irrigation systems, followed \n     by a 32-year-long drought.\n       And, of course, there's vulcanism, very active in our age. \n     The bubbling up of Earth's molten core causes volcanic \n     eruptions, earthquakes, and vanishing islands. Everybody \n     knows about Pompeii; few know about the many thousands killed \n     in this century, or the eruption of a Pacific crater that, by \n     smoke and dust hurled into the atmosphere, caused crop \n     failures across America in the early 1800s.\n       And, friends, the tectonic plates, which once separated \n     continents, are still shifting ever so slightly. One day \n     California may join Japan, if it doesn't join Atlantis first.\n       Climatic disasters occurred before man, and most have \n     happened when there weren't enough wood-burning people around \n     to create atmospheric pollution or much other kind. This is \n     why I suspect the recent Kyoto Protocols on global warming \n     (though it exists and governments should study it) are an \n     exercise in human arrogance.\n       The Kyoto pontificators were mostly politicians, social \n     scientists (which the media accept as ``scientists'') and \n     bureaucrats, while climatologists, weathermen, and true \n     ``hard'' scientists remain divided as to the causes of global \n     warming and whether it's good or bad. They agree, meanwhile, \n     that nothing disastrous in any case will happen for 100 \n     years, when we may be in a new Ice Age.\n       Listening to the rhetoric makes me wonder if we've advanced \n     all that far from the days of the Aztecs, when priest-rulers \n     ordered sacrifices to propiate nature, in their case tossing \n     virgins down wells to bring rain and cardiectomies to make \n     the sun rise. We understand the forces of nature better--but \n     we have no more control over them than ancient peoples \n     praying to the moon.\n       Without more proof--of the scientific, not the ideological \n     kind--I'm not prepared to sacrifice my Grand Cherokee to the \n     current shamans' gods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S88-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S89-S90]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEDICARE, FREEDOM, AND PRIVATE CONTRACTS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation that will be considered by the Senate this year is Senator \nJon Kyl's bill, S. 1194, the ``Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract \nAct''. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of this bill.\n  Enactment of this legislation will insure that our senior citizens \nwho participate in the Medicare program will retain the right to pay \nfor the treatment or services they want from the doctor of their \nchoice.\n  The Clinton administration has sought to restrict such a fundamental \nfreedom but I do not believe that the American people will support that \nposition once we have had a chance to bring the matter to their \nattention.\n  Mr. Kent Masterson Brown, writing in the Washington Times on January \n25, 1998 has provided a succinct analysis of this issue and I commend \nhis article to my colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that the article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Medicare's Assault Against the Elderly\n\n       Throughout my 23-year career as a litigator of \n     constitutional issues, principally in the health care arena, \n     I have witnessed the growth of Medicare with a sense of \n     alarm.\n       From what was designed by Congress to be a ``voluntary'' \n     health benefits program for the elderly, it has mutated into \n     a bureaucratic leviathan that controls who provides health \n     care services, and how those health care services are \n     delivered--despite absolutely explicit, statutory guarantees \n     to the contrary. We now have a federal agency--the Health \n     Care Financing Administration (HCFA)--involved in a \n     relentless effort to totally control the delivery of health \n     care to the elderly by deciding, without legal authority, \n     what services a physician will provide even though Medicare \n     will not pay for them. Those controls now manifest themselves \n     in the denial of basic health care services to the elderly, \n     as well as denying the elderly access to the most innovative \n     and cost-effective health care technologies.\n       HCFA has exercised its power to control the delivery of \n     health care by steadily racheting down payment for health \n     care services, and, at the same time, stepping up its threats \n     against providers who deliver health care services which \n     HCFA, for purely fiscal reasons, deems ``unnecessary'' even \n     though those services might be life-saving and even though \n     the federal government does not pay for them. Recent changes \n     in law which we are challenging in court, will make the \n     situation even worse.\n       To understand what is taking place, we need to start with \n     the basic Medicare law. Nowhere in the Medicare Act is a \n     beneficiary required to file a claim for payment for health \n     care services each and every time he or she sees a physician. \n     Yet, those in charge of HCFA threaten physicians with severe \n     sanctions ``even criminal prosecution'' if they do not file \n     such claims. Why make such a demand, which only adds to \n     costs? If a car insurance company made such demands on its \n     policyholders everytime a door was dinged it would go \n     bankrupt.\n       In 1992, I had to file a lawsuit in federal court in \n     Newark, N.J., in order to allow five patients to contract \n     privately with their personal physician. All those patients \n     wanted was the opportunity to see their physician in the \n     nursing home more than once a month and to protect the \n     privacy of their medical records, nothing more. The federal \n     government, however, threatened the physician with sanctions \n     if she complied with the patients' wishes and did not file a \n     claim. HCFA entered the courtroom declaring that the \n     physician could not contract privately with her Medicare \n     patients because she is required to file a claim with \n     Medicare each and every time she sees her Medicare patients. \n     If those patients wanted to pay privately, HCFA declared, \n     they could write a check to the federal government.\n       The federal court disagreed with HCFA in Stewart vs. \n     Sullivan. The court found there were no statutory \n     prohibitions against private contracting for Medicare \n     beneficiaries and that HCFA had developed no ``clearly \n     articulated'' policies against it. The threats were just \n     that: threats. They were made without any statutory or even \n     regulatory authority.\n       Last summer, all this sparring took a drastic turn for the \n     worse. Congress, under pressure and threats from the Clinton \n     administration, enacted Section 4507 of the Balanced Budget \n     Act of 1997. This provision makes it unlawful for a physician \n     to contract privately with a Medicare-eligible patient unless \n     the physician agrees, in writing, not to bill Medicare for \n     any services delivered to any Medicare patient for two years.\n       The practical consequences of Section 4507 ``which amounts \n     to a de facto ban on private contracting'' are not difficult \n     to foresee. We know, for example, more than 96 percent of the \n     nation's physicians see Medicare patients. We know the vast \n     majority of these physicians will not abandon all their \n     current Medicare patients in return for entering into private \n     contracts with a few. And we know many of the less than 4 \n     percent of physicians not directly affected by the de facto \n     ban already, for one reason or another, have been excluded \n     from the Medicare program. Thus, no senior citizen will be \n     able to contract privately for any meaningful health care \n     services even if he or she could find a physician who was \n     willing.\n       Seniors are thus left with a ``take it or leave it'' system \n     that denies and rations health care. They will get only those \n     services the federal government says they should get Nothing \n     more can be provided--even if they wish to pay for it \n     themselves.\n       What does this mean in real life terms? The answer is \n     simple. For everyday, inexpensive screening and diagnostic \n     laboratory services, our seniors will receive one, unless \n     there is an ``approved'' diagnosis accompanying a claim for \n     payment filed with HCFA. Because all laboratory services \n     claims must be filed on an ``assignment'' basis, if HCFA will \n     not pay, the services will not be provided unless the \n     physician pays for them and exposes himself/herself to severe \n     sanctions.\n       Thus, the elderly will be denied asymptomatic prostate-\n     specific antigen (PSA) tests to detect prostate cancer, \n     asymptomatic serum glucose tests to detect diabetes, and \n     thyroid tests to detect hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, \n     to name a few.\n       What is alarming is that senior citizens, more than most, \n     need to have such tests available because as a group they are \n     the most vulnerable to a variety of life-threatening \n     diseases. To detect these diseases (all of which have long \n     asymptomatic periods) early is to control or to cure them. \n     That saves lives and money. If HCFA get its way, seniors will \n     only get those important diagnostic tests after the symptoms \n     have appeared--either too late for much help, or when \n     intervention becomes expensive. That is how the federal \n     government has determined to control health care for what it \n     calls our ``frail elderly.''\n       This is Medicare's brave new world. It is a world that \n     offers the minimum at best. It allows for no decision-making \n     on the part of the Medicare beneficiary.\n       It is incredible that in this country--supposedly the \n     freest on Earth--the government prohibits a senior citizen \n     from paying for his\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\n     or her own health care. Even in the British National Health \n     Service, a citizen can privately contract. But not here.\n       If the U.S. Constitution protects a pregnant teen-ager when \n     she seeks an abortion, even one so young the law considers \n     her lacking the capacity to vote, it must protect senior \n     citizens who seek only to receive the health care they want \n     and for which they are willing to personally pay. If the \n     Constitution protects the medical records of those with \n     deadly diseases about which we know very little, it surely \n     protects the medical records of seniors who seek privacy. If \n     the Constitution protects citizens against discrimination, it \n     surely protects seniors from being singled out and denied the \n     opportunity to make decisions regarding their personal health \n     just because they are 65 years of age or older.\n       On Dec. 30, the members of the United Seniors Association, \n     including Tony Parsons, Peggy Sanborn, Ray Perry and Margaret \n     Perry filed a lawsuit in federal court asking that Section \n     4507 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 be declared \n     unconstitutional as violative of Article I, Section 8, of the \n     Constitution and the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, 10th and \n     14th Amendments of the Constitution. They have asked the \n     court for an injunction to stop the Clinton administration \n     from enforcing Section 4507, and to block any attempts to \n     interfere in the private contracting of America's elderly.\n       Until this unconstitutional provision is eradicated by \n     Congress, the freedom and safety of America's senior citizens \n     will be severely jeopardized.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: It is my \nunderstanding that for the next hour and a half the control of the time \nis under the direction of the Senator from Georgia or others he may \ndesignate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Under the previous \norder, the Senator from Georgia or his designee is recognized for 90 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S89-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S90-S99]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STATE OF THE UNION RESPONSE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, last night President Clinton \ndelivered some good news and some bad news for those who, like me, want \nto address the crisis in American education. And Madam President, that \ncrisis exists in grades kindergarten through high school. I repeat, \nkindergarten through high school. The good news is that President \nClinton has finally joined the Republicans in recognizing that we must \naddress this crisis.\n  It is bad enough that our Nation's schoolchildren have to run a \ngauntlet of drugs and violence just to sit in class, but when they get \nto the classroom they are not learning the basics. Just recently, a \nstudy published in Education Week showed that only 4 in 10 urban school \nstudents could master basic math and reading skills. Four in 10. It \ndoes not get much better when we move to the suburban schools. There it \nis only 6 in 10 who can master these basic skills when tested.\n  Madam President, we are failing our students, and we clearly are not \npreparing America for the new century that the President spoke of last \nevening. Republicans first attacked this problem with a comprehensive \nproposal over 1 year ago, S. 1, that addressed how to help children in \nunsafe schools, how to increase literacy, and how to give new authority \nto parents and communities to improve their local schools.\n  Regrettably, although we were able to reach common ground on making \ncollege more accessible and affordable, President Clinton fought real \neducation reform for the kindergarten through high school grades every \nstep of the way.\n  Most notably and unforgettably, he threatened to veto the entire tax \nrelief bill last year unless we dropped one single provision, one that \nprovided education savings accounts to parents for use for their \nchild's specific educational needs.\n  Madam President, if there was ever a proposal that was win-win in \nthis city, the education savings account was it. The President said he \nwould veto the entire tax relief proposal if that remained. The bad \nnews in President Clinton's speech last night is that he still does not \nunderstand what needs to occur and where it needs to occur for grades \nkindergarten through high school. President Clinton last night repeated \nhis belief that politics should stop at the schoolhouse door. I agree. \nI do not know anybody who does not agree. President Clinton should get \nout of the schoolhouse doorway and allow real education and reform to \nhelp the kids inside those schools.\n  What we saw last night was education proposals that ignored giving \nparents and local communities real power and real choices; ignored real \nreform in favor of business as usual--we call it the status quo around \nhere--spending increases, and paying for all these new programs with \nmoney the Government does not even have and may not ever have. I \nrepeat, paying for all these new programs in the State of the Union \nwith money the Government does not have and may never have.\n  We have a better way. It is called BOOKS, the Better Opportunities \nfor Our Kids and Schools Act.\n  Madam President, BOOKS has several very powerful provisions that do \nexactly what I just alluded to--give new authority and choice to \nparents, give new authority and choice to States and local school \ndistricts that move decisionmaking capability to the people on the \nfrontline and away from the Washington bureaucrat who could not \nassociate a single face with a single name.\n  Title I. A-plus accounts, education savings accounts. Parents can \ncontribute $2,500 a year for a child's K through 12 education--public, \nprivate, religious or home schools. Everybody wins no matter where \ntheir children are in school. I might add that if they chose, they \ncould keep those savings accounts on through higher education as well.\n  Dollars could be used for a home computer, the tutor that is needed \nfor a math deficiency, tuition or the expenses of home schooling; 75 \npercent of these massive new resources would be used by those in public \nschools. They would be a major winner. And 70 percent of the people \ntaking advantage of the savings account earn less than $75,000 per \nyear. The Joint Tax Committee is the source of this estimate. The cost \nwould be $2.6 billion over the next 5 years. Basically, what we are \nsaying is that we are going to leave $2.6 billion in the checking \naccounts of parents trying to help their children.\n  Title II. Dollars to the classroom. Dollars to the classroom would \nblock grant about $3 billion to States and continue to send $7 billion \nin title I, part A funds to the States with only one requirement--that \n95 percent of those Federal dollars go to the classroom to where the \nkids are, not where the bureaucracy offices are. So the money to the \ndisadvantaged children stays the same with the exception we want it in \nthe classroom, and we free $3 billion a year so that those local school \ndistricts can do what they need to do. Do they need to hire teachers? \nThen they hire the teachers. Do they need to build schools? Then they \nbuild schools. Whatever it is they need--not what we envision they may \nneed--could be done through dollars to the classroom. Bureaucracy eats \nup scarce dollars as State and local governments comply with \nWashington's strings. This is not new. It has become endemic in our \nGovernment.\n\n  Even in title I, the moneys that go to the disadvantaged, 99 percent \nreaches the school district but 4 to 13 percent is eaten up by \nadministrative costs--4 to 13 percent. That is big dollars. The $3 \nbillion block grant could pay for as many as 50,000 teachers a year and \n1 million new computers every year or it could pay for building up to \n500 elementary schools. The key point here it is their choice--their \nchoice.\n  Title III. Opportunity and safety for low-income children. This is a \n5-year pilot choice program at 20 to 30 sites to allow low-income \nchildren to attend a safe school through a choice system. We would \ninvest $75 million for 1 year on this project.\n  I do want to point out, Madam President, that this is voluntary. This \nis not imposed on anyone. In fact, with the exception of requiring that \nFederal dollars go to the classroom at the 95 percent level, there is \nnothing in the BOOKS Act that is mandatory. It defines, under this \ntitle, low income as 185 percent of the poverty line. Unsafe schools \nare those with high crime\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\nrates, serious drug problems and disciplinary problems. This gives kids \nat risk a chance to attend a public, charter, private, or sectarian \nschool where the emphasis is on learning, not survival.\n  Madam President, I just think it is unconscionable policy to order \nchildren to go to schools that are certifiably unsafe and drug ridden.\n  Title IV. Testing and merit pay for teachers. It allows States to use \nFederal funds to reward good teachers and weed out the bad, and it will \nmake it easier for States to carry out performance assessments of \nteachers and establish merit pay programs. Americans across the board \nagree with these concepts. Reward good teachers, weed out the bad, and \nmake it easier for States to carry out performance assessment of \nteachers.\n  Title V. Reading excellence. This is similar to Chairman Bill \nGoodling's bill in the House which passed the House by a voice vote on \nNovember 8, 1997.\n  Madam President, it would provide $210 million for teacher training \nand individual grants for K through 12 reading instruction. It requires \nfunds to be spent on programs demonstrated by scientific research to be \neffective, like phonics. It gives parents of kids at risk the ability \nto purchase additional tutoring assistance through grants.\n  President Clinton's America Reads program which cost $2.7 billion \nover 5 years proposed sending semitrained volunteers into the \nclassroom. This is a flawed concept, when you would send a semitrained \nvolunteer into a classroom that has already demonstrated that it is not \nteaching a student to read. So you would send an unprofessional \nvolunteer to help the student read better--that is not logical. The \nreading excellence title requires funds to be spent on programs proven \neffective by scientific research to enable the teacher to improve his \nor her skills so that she or he can teach the student to read.\n  Title VI is the teacher and student safety title. This title allows \nthe use of Federal funds to move victims of violence to safe schools. \nThey could be a public, private or sectarian schools. The key here is \nif the student has become a victim, there should be nothing in the way \nof that school board's ability to move the student to a safe place. It \nallows use of noneducational funds--Victims of Crime Act administered \nby the Department of Justice--for innovative programs to help victims \nand witnesses of crime on school property. And it encourages the use of \nimmediate notification and annual report cards to parents and teachers \nabout incidents of violence and drugs at schools.\n  Title VII is the Charter Schools Expansion Act title. This is similar \nto Congressman Riggs' bill which passed the House 367 to 57 on November \n7. This provision of the legislation ensures charter schools are \neligible for their fair share of Federal funding, whether it is title \nI, IDEA, or title VI block grants. Charter schools are public schools \nfreed of many of the regulations in turn for increased accountability \nin terms of student outcomes. Without excessive regulation these \nschools are better able to design programs tailored to the needs of \nstudents and communities.\n  Madam President, I see we have been joined by my good colleague from \nNebraska. I am going to turn to the Senator in just a minute or so \nhere.\n  Under title VIII, the last title, we say the Federal Government \nshould honor its agreement, which it made when it imposed special \neducation requirements on local education, to fund a sizable portion of \nit. We agreed to fund up to 40 percent but we have never done it. You \nknow, it's one of those stories, ``The check is in the mail.'' It never \nquite gets there.\n  Senator Gregg deserves a lot of credit for this. He started the \nprocess last year but this would finish it with $9.3 billion over the \nnext 6 years to fully honor our commitment to fund special ed, which we \ncall IDEA. That would free up $9.3 billion for local communities to \nassess and take care of their own specific needs. That is the general \ndescription of the proposal our conference announced on January 20.\n  I now turn to my colleague and good friend from Nebraska, Senator \nHagel, for up to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I would like to make a couple of \nobservations about last night, the agenda for the second session of \nthis 105th Congress; what is ahead of us, what is ahead for the \nAmerican people, the challenges that lie ahead for the world.\n  As I listened intently and seriously last night, as I am sure all my \ncolleagues did, to the President's message, questions came to me like, \n``Isn't the definition of the debate for this year and the defining of \nthe debate that the Congress will have into the next century about the \nrole of Government?'' That is the issue. What is the role of Government \nin our lives? How much Government do we want? How much Government can \nwe afford? What do we want Government to do for us? And how much are we \nwilling to pay for Government?\n  The President--and I have all eight single-spaced pages of the text \nof his speech last night--gave a good speech. But the speech was about \nnew programs, the federalization of America. This is the same President \nwho said 2 years ago in a State of the Union Message that the era of \nbig Government is gone. No more big Government. And then the President \nsaid last night, early on in his text, that we, today, have, ``the \nsmallest Government in 35 years.'' I don't know how the President \nmeasures that, but this body is going to debate this year a $1.7 \ntrillion Federal budget to keep this small little Government going.\n  He talks about federalizing education. I don't find the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to be education anywhere in \nthe Constitution. I don't find it in any document that education is in \nthe purview and the province of the Federal Government. Yet this \nPresident says we, the Federal Government, representing the people who \npay the taxes, are going to hire 100,000 new teachers. We are going to \nfederalize new teachers. We are going to build new schools across \nAmerica, federalize our schools. But yet, of course, he fails to tell \nus how he intends to do that. Where are those resources coming from?\n  At the same time he boasts, rightfully so, that we in fact have moved \ntoward balancing our budget. So he takes credit for that on this side. \nAnd then on this side we have page after page, line after line, of new \nGovernment spending proposals.\n  Medicare has been running a deficit the last couple of years. Yet \nthis President is proposing that we add more people onto Medicare. This \nis at the same time the President and the Congress have come together \nand said we need a Medicare commission, a bipartisan Medicare \ncommission to take a look at the seriousness of the problem, of the \nissue, of the challenge, and report back to the President next year. \nBut, no, he decides not to wait for that.\n  Child care--we are going to federalize child care? These are all \nimportant, critical issues for our country, for our people. Of course \nthey are. But I think we might be better off if we would essentially \ncontinue this effort to cut Government, cut spending, cut programs, cut \ntaxes, and take the responsibility of governing ourselves back to where \nit should be; back to the cities, the school boards, the counties. Who \nbest understands the problem? I trust school boards. I trust teachers. \nI trust parents. I don't trust bureaucrats. We are rapidly developing \ninto this monolithic centralization of bureaucratic rule. People in the \nDepartment of Education and all these areas are good people, family \npeople, but we just, year after year, load more on them.\n\n  I ask this question when I hear a retort from my friends on the other \nside, or from the President, that Medicare, for example, and all these \nnew programs, will pay for themselves; there will not be an increase in \nspending; we don't need to find more taxpayers' money: Is there anyone \nout there who can show me any time we have had a Federal program that \nhas gotten smaller? Do Federal programs and agencies and bureaucracies \nand departments vanish after a few years? Oh, no, no; they get bigger. \nAnd who has to pay for it? My children and your children. And it gets \nbigger and bigger. Where have we cut Government in the 1990s? We have \ncut it in one department. What department? Defense. Our national \nsecurity has been cut over the last 10 years in real dollars by 40 \npercent. How many other departments and agencies have been cut? None.\n  So my point is this. Before we rush into all these new programs and \nnew\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\nGovernment and new federalization, we better sober up for a moment. \nThis is not a time for campaign rhetoric. This is not a time for \ncampaign speeches. This is a time for clear-headed, strong, dynamic, \nsmart, realistic leadership, gutsy leadership. That is what America \ndemands. That is what America will get.\n  I say these things not because I am opposed to the President or \ntrying to complicate the President's life. But we, too, have a \nconstitutional responsibility in this body. We have accountability to \nthe people we represent. And this is one U.S. Senator who is going to \nask some very tough questions about every one of these new programs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for \nhis remarks and the contribution he made here this afternoon. I am \ngoing to now turn to our distinguished colleague, Senator Hutchinson \nfrom Arkansas, and yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding. First, \nI want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nNebraska and his excellent analysis of the efforts by our government to \nfederalize not only education, but many other programs as well. And I \napplaud Senator Coverdell from Georgia for his efforts in the area of \neducation, and in particular, his leadership on the Better \nOpportunities for Our Kids and Schools Act, the BOOKS Act. I believe \nthis bill demonstrates that we, as Republicans, have a deep concern \nabout education in this country. We have a deep concern about improving \neducation for our children, who are precious to us. And we recognize \nthat this is best done at the local level, where teachers know the \nnames of our kids, and can pick up the phone and call the parents when \nthe need arises. These decisions are better made at the local school \ndistrict level, the State level, and not by a greater and bigger \nFederal bureaucracy.\n  Last evening, in his State of the Union Address, the President \nproposed ``the first ever national effort to reduce the class size in \nthe early grades . . . by hiring 100,000 new teachers.'' So I ask, is \nthis really a genuine effort to reduce the size of our children's \nclasses? Or is it just another exercise of ever bigger Government, and \na move in that gradual effort toward federalizing education in this \ncountry?\n  Why are new teachers, mandated from Washington, the ticket to smaller \nclass sizes? It is well-documented that many States across this Nation \nhave taken on the responsibility of reducing the size of their \nclassrooms; namely, California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut \nand Wisconsin. The Governors of these five States have proposed hiring \nthousands of new teachers using, not Federal dollars, but State \ndollars. This makes sense, allowing individuals closest to our children \nto make these kinds of decisions.\n  Madam President, I trust those individuals in the thousands of cities \nand towns across this country who know your child's name, to make the \nimportant decisions that impact the very classrooms in which our \nchildren learn much more than I trust bureaucrats in our Nation's \ncapital. In an effort to allow States and localities to make these \ndecisions, I, as part of the BOOKS legislation, will be introducing the \nDollars to the Classroom Act, that will redirect about $3 billion of K-\n12 education dollars to the States, requiring only that 95 percent of \nthat money actually reach our children's classrooms. This money can be \nfor books, it can be for teachers, it can be for computers--whatever \nthe local education officials deem necessary and important to the \neducation of our children.\n\n  While no one can deny the importance of providing the best possible \neducation to our children, we also must implement these programs in the \nmost responsible manner: by returning control over the education of our \nchildren to the place that it belongs, the parents and teachers and \nlocal communities and local school boards. By doing that, we will \nensure that education dollars are spent wisely on programs and \nactivities which really benefit our children in the classroom.\n  Currently, the vast majority of all Federal education funding does \nnot go to school districts or classrooms. In fact, in 1995, of the $100 \nbillion the Federal Government allocated for education programs, only \nabout 13 percent actually got to the local level from the Department of \nEducation. That is a travesty, and a national nightmare.\n  Madam President, the current system of Federal bureaucrats attempting \nto administer hundreds of education programs to our children is, to say \nthe least, highly inefficient, as reflected in falling test scores and \nincreased illiteracy rates.\n  Many students are not adequately prepared to meet the challenges of \nlife beyond high school, whether they go on to college, take a job, or \nattend a trade school. In fact, last year alone, 43 percent of high \nschool seniors scored below the basic level in science, while 29 \npercent of all college freshmen were required to take at least one \nremedial course. Most alarming is that 68 percent of employers say that \nhigh school graduates are not prepared to succeed in the workplace. \nThese statistics paint a very sad picture in a country which prides \nitself on having the best education system in the world. When limited \nFederal funding is spread so thin over such a wide area, the result is \nineffective programs that fail to provide students with the basic \nskills they need to succeed.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join Senator Coverdell and my good friend \nfrom Nebraska, Senator Hagel, and I, in asking hard questions. Which do \nour constituents really prefer? In whom do the citizens of America \nreally place their confidence? The real question is--is it going to be \nBOOKS, or is it going to be bureaucrats? So why not let those on the \nState level, why not let those on the local level, who best know the \nneeds of our children, make those decisions, make those determinations? \nPerhaps it is books, perhaps it is computers, or perhaps it will be a \nneed for more teachers so that children will have smaller class sizes. \nBut I truly believe that those decisions must be made at the local \nlevel.\n  I believe the alternative, the Dollars to the Classroom Act, \ndemonstrates not only our commitment to the education of our kids, but \nalso proves that there is a better way to implement this commitment \nrather than creating an ever-growing Federal bureaucracy and \nappropriating ever-larger sums of money which are failing to provide \nfor the real needs that our schools have.\n  So, once again, I applaud Senator Coverdell for his leadership in \neducation, his leadership on our efforts to improve education for all \nof the children in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I commend the Senator from Arkansas. I think he very \nadroitly draws the distinction between our proposal, which frees these \nlocal communities to make decisions about what they need, in \ndistinction to the last 30 or 40 years where more and more and more we \nhave somebody, as you say, who couldn't recognize one of the students, \ntrying to set the priorities, and all the assistance we send is with a \nmandate to shackle the local school boards.\n  Everywhere I go--I don't know about yourself--but it is over and over \nI am being told that you all are going to have to decide. ``You all \nhave to let us teach these kids.'' Or, ``Are you going to keep \nmandating us and throttling us down with all of your agendas?'' And \nwhile we have been doing that, we, each year, have more and more data \nsuggesting that the children cannot do the basics, cannot read right, \nthey cannot understand the basic science, and they cannot add and \nsubtract.\n  If they cannot do that, they cannot succeed in our society. I think \nyou have adroitly hit it. And I appreciate your work on dollars to \nthese local systems.\n  We have now been joined, Madam President, by the distinguished \nSenator from Florida, Senator Mack. I yield Senator Mack up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for this opportunity. I want to \nagain commend the Senator for the leadership he provided last year in \nfocusing us on this issue, leading the debate and the effort to try to \npass the A-plus education savings account with great leadership. We \nappreciate what the Senator is doing.\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\n  I want to kind of set the stage as to why I think the issue of \neducation is so important. When I go home and speak to the people, they \nwill tell you that the No. 1 issue facing the Nation, facing their \nState, facing their community, is education. I think they recognize \nthat if their children are going to be successful with their lives, \nthey have to have an education that is second to none.\n  But let me put it in a broader perspective in that I believe that the \n21st century is going to be the century of knowledge.\n  We have all heard about, for the last 10 or 15 years, folks like \nAlvin Toffler talking about the information/communications age. Some of \nus find ourselves totally surprised that we are engaged in playing \naround on the computer, the Internet, things I couldn't have dreamed of \na couple years ago. We know there is an explosion of knowledge and \ninformation out there. We also know that if our children are going to \nbe successful and be able to compete in the 21st century, they are \ngoing to have to have an education second to none.\n  To just build on that, there was an educator in the State of \nFlorida--President Bush put him on his commission-- Mitch Madique, who \nis the president at one of our State universities. He traveled to South \nAmerica and had discussions with the various leaders of education in \nthose countries. They were saying to him, ``We are really looking \nforward to the 21st century because competition in the 21st century is \nno longer going to be based on military capability, military strength \nor the amount of your natural resources. Instead, competition is going \nto be based on knowledge. If that's the case, we're all starting off on \nthe same foot. And we believe we have just as much of an opportunity to \ndevelop a first-class education system as you do. So we look forward to \ncompetition in the 21st century.''\n  To me, this means that if those three little grandsons of mine, who \nare 13, 11 and 4, if they are going to have an opportunity to make it, \nand if they are going to have an opportunity to have the same kind of \nexperiences and opportunities that we had, then they do have to have an \neducation that is second to none.\n  The proposals that the Senator from Georgia has already laid out make \nclear that there is not going to be a solution described and defined at \nthe Federal level and passed on to the local communities and States. \nConversely, we believe that the answers are going to come from the \ngrassroots level.\n  So I would like to just share for a moment an experience that I had \nin California a few years ago. I went to a school in the area where the \nriots took place. The name of this school was the Marcus Garvey School. \nWe have had some experience with the Marcus Garvey School here in \nWashington. The experience we had in California was totally different \nthan here locally, so don't be confused.\n\n  As I went to the school and I drove down the street, I would suggest \nthat probably most of you would think, ``I'm not sending my child to \nthat school.'' There were just absolutely no amenities. There was not a \nblade of grass anywhere. There was not a single basketball hoop or any \nplaygrounds that I could see. There was just a building that had been \nconverted, I am not sure what from, into a series of classrooms.\n  We went in and we met with the owner, the administrator, the \nprincipal--all one person. His name was Anyim Palmer. His office was \nprobably 10 by 12, stacked full of papers. He had no secretary. When \nthe phone rang, he answered it. The equipment or the desks and chairs \nappeared to be 30-40 years old. The point I am making is there was not \na lot of money invested in amenities in this school.\n  He suggested that maybe we go down and work our way through the \ndifferent classes that were being taught. We started out in the day \ncare area. We saw about eight or nine children age 2--not second grade, \nbut age 2. When my wife and I went down to the room, the teacher said \nto the children, ``Show the Senator and Mrs. Mack how you can say your \nABCs''--again, they were 2 years old. They said their ABCs. Just as \ncute as they could be, they ran through the alphabet. When they \nfinished with that, the teacher said, ``Now say it in Spanish.'' Then \nthey said it in Spanish. Then she said, ``Do it in Swahili.'' Then they \nsaid it in Swahili. Here are 2-year-old children who have already \nmastered the alphabet in three different languages.\n  We went from there over to where the 3-year-old children--again, I \nemphasize 3-year-old children--were working on math. These little \nchildren were walking up to the blackboard working through math \nproblems. So the teacher said to me, ``Give them a problem to work \non.'' I suspect everybody here would have reacted the same way I did. I \nsaid, ``How about 5 plus 3?'' She said, ``No. I mean, give them a \ndifficult problem to do.'' So I said, ``Well, how about 153 plus 385.'' \nAnd the little 3-year-old stood there and put a couple dots on the \nboard, wrote down one number; put a couple more dots on the board, and \nanother number went down; a few more dots, another number went down. It \nwas the right answer--3 years old.\n  We went over where the 4-year-olds were being taught reading, and \nthey were reading at the second and third grade levels--at the age of \n4.\n  I went to where the 5-year-old children were--and mind you, we have \nnot gotten to the first grade yet. The teacher asked one of the little \nboys to stand up and recite for me, in the proper chronological order, \nall the Presidents of the United States. This little boy stood up and \nlooked me right square in the eye, and he listed every President of the \nUnited States in proper chronological order.\n  You might be asking yourself, how did I know that? Frankly, they \nhanded me a cheat sheet, and I was working my way down it as he was \ngoing through it.\n  My point is, here is a school that most people, again, would look at \nand say, ``I don't want my child to go there.'' No amenities. It is \nbare bones. You may say, ``Well, what makes this thing work?'', which \nis exactly what I asked every teacher in every room that we went into. \nHow is this happening? Anyim Palmer told me that the answer was the \nteacher. It is the teacher. Every time they asked the question, the \nanswer was the same--it is the teacher.\n  Interesting things came out of it. I don't believe any of the \nteachers were certified. I think only two of them had college \neducations. What happened is Anyim Palmer, who was the owner, \nadministrator, the principal, was a former public schoolteacher who \nbecame so frustrated with the public school system that he said, ``I'm \ngoing to start my own school. I'm going to teach people how to teach.''\n\n  Again, I would encourage anyone who has an opportunity to make a \nvisit to that school or something like it to do so. But the point is, \nif we rely on the present system, the present system will produce \nexactly what it has produced in the past, unless there is something \nthat forces people to change. We believe the program that we have put \ntogether will in fact assist local communities and States to develop \nalternatives to the present public school system.\n  I visited a charter school in Miami just a few days ago and spoke \nwith a teacher there, who up until a few years ago was an engineer. I \nsaid, ``What happened? Why are you teaching?'' He said two things. One \nis, he said, ``I lost my job. And I didn't want to put my family \nthrough that kind of an experience again. I felt there was some \nsecurity in teaching.'' And then he said, ``You know what? I have found \nmy calling.'' He is teaching second grade children. He said, ``This is \nexactly where I should be.''\n  But in this charter school, this individual had flexibility. This \nindividual could approach the opportunity of teaching our children in a \ntotally different way than in the past. So, again, I think if we \nencourage innovative thinking, we are going to find there are some \nremarkable ways to improve education in our country.\n  As you know, one of the major points in our proposal is to reward \nteachers who do a good job. We ought to reward excellence. We ought to \nsay to those teachers, ``You have done a great job and we are going to \nreward you for it.'' That is why we are talking about the importance of \nmerit pay.\n  But if we are going to have merit pay, we also need to recognize \nthose teachers who are not doing a good job. We need a way to determine \nthat, other than whether a principal likes an individual or does not \nlike an individual, or\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\na school board does not like an individual. We ought to say there ought \nto be competence testing. Part of this plan, known as BOOKS, calls for \ncompetency testing and for merit pay.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to point out that in the State of \nFlorida, 70 percent of the community college freshmen require remedial \neducation. We have to change that. The cost to the State of Florida is \n$50 billion a year to handle this problem. Let's improve our K-12 \neducation system.\n  With that, I yield the floor and again thank the Senator from Georgia \nfor tackling this initiative. I look forward to working with you on \nthis important issue.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I commend the Senator from Florida. It is an \nabsolutely fascinating story. There are many of these around the \ncountry.\n  Just to make a point, of late when you read the statistics of 4 in 10 \nare all that can pass in urban city schools' basic standards tests, 3 \nin 10, 4 in 10 go to college, as you have noted, and have to go back \nand learn these skills again. We are beginning to hear an echo that \nthese students were not educable, that there was something wrong \nsomeplace else, something wrong at home, something wrong with society.\n  What kind of community was this? What was the surrounding like around \nthis school? Was this a very wealthy suburb?\n  Mr. MACK. No. As I indicated, it was in the riot area in Los Angeles.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Would you surmise that those students could not have \npossibly all come from very stable, two-parent families that you might \nfind in some communities?\n  Mr. MACK. I could suspect you could draw the conclusion they were \nsomewhat different than, say, what most people think of as the \ntraditional family in America. But I would be careful about drawing too \nmany conclusions on that because I think there are some things about \nwhat was going on in this school that also sends a message to moms and \ndads.\n  I think that one of the reasons for success was because mom and dad \nwere involved. They made the determination. I mean, this was a private \nschool, so they have to pay to go to that private school--some of them \nat great sacrifice. Some of them, frankly, from outside the community.\n  But the point there is, if you go back to the charter school, for \nexample, one of the things that most charter schools require, as you \nknow, is that they want parent involvement. In fact, when I was at the \nschool in Liberty City, in Miami, mom and dad parents came into the \nclassroom, as I was talking with the teacher, to discuss with him the \nproblems of their student. What was the problem? Or what should they be \ndoing more at home to help?\n  Again, I think one of the messages that we do get is that in the \ncharter schools--I guess there are others who are much more \nknowledgeable at these things than I am, but because it is a very \nfocused school, it understands the importance of mom and dad being \nengaged. The teacher understands the importance of moms and dads being \nengaged, and, clearly, the parents understand if they are going to be \nable to keep their children in this charter school, they have to be \npart of it.\n  Again, I would make the case, whether it be a mother and a dad or \nsingle mom or single father, that if you can engage them in the \neducation process, regardless of that background, in probably 9 out of \n10 cases--I am just saying this from my feeling; I do not have the \nstatistics--but 9 out of 10 times, if you, the parent, one or both, are \nengaged in your children's education, you are going to improve the \nability of your child to learn. And, again, I think you are going to \nfind that you are going to create that environment, something different \nthan we are doing today.\n  There is just so much we can learn from this experience. Again, the \nanswer that kept coming back, ``It is the teacher. It is the teacher. \nIt is the teacher.'' I think people ought to recognize that what \nRepublicans are saying is we value teachers. They are the ones who \nreally make a difference.\n  Again, if my grandsons are going to succeed, they need to be exposed \nto good teachers. We have to help create an environment in which \npeople, (a) want to come into the teaching profession and, (b) once \nthey are there, want to remain and experience the excitement of seeing \nyoung children learn. Teachers help children realize how important \nknowledge is to them and their future. Again, teachers are the ones who \nreally make a difference.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator makes an excellent point. Who does not \nremember the teacher that affected them? There is no one that does not \nremember that teacher.\n  Mr. MACK. I can name my first-grade teacher.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator for the presentation.\n  I turn to our distinguished colleague from Wyoming, Senator Thomas, \nand yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I appreciate the Senator from Georgia arranging for an \nopportunity to talk about our agenda. After all we have just returned \nnow from recess, just returned from a time to talk with our \nconstituents. I spent all this time in Wyoming doing a number of town \nmeetings, talking to people about various things they are interested \nin.\n  It is time for us, of course to talk about agendas, to talk about \npriorities, to talk about what it is that we intend to do during what \nis already a relatively short work year, during an election year. The \nthing, of course, that is on our minds today, I suppose, is the \nPresident's State of the Union Address last evening in which he laid \nout his agenda, not a surprise agenda, and talked about the issues he \nhas been talking about now for several weeks, with a new proposal each \nweek, all put together in a State of the Union Message which had, I \nthink, about 30 different proposals of things to do.\n\n  It seems to me that what we have to do now as a responsible Congress \nis to decide on those items that we think are priorities to this \ncountry, that we think are priorities for success in families in this \ncountry, economically, from a freedom standpoint, how-to-govern \nstandpoint, and really press for those. I must say that I feel rather \nstrongly about that.\n  I felt last evening that--the President, of course, is certainly free \nto have his own agenda--that was an agenda that had been put together \nby pollsters, an agenda that had been put together to enumerate all \nthose things that would sound good to everyone that was listening, an \nagenda that I think, clearly, again the President is perfectly free to \nmove his position, move his position back toward the more liberal \nDemocrat Party from which he has departed in the last several years \nsomewhat to establish more support for Al Gore when the time comes. I \nthink that is legitimate. I don't happen to agree with that.\n  I think we ought to be moving forward to continue to do the things \nthat we have begun to do over the last several years, some of the \nthings that I am particularly proud of, frankly, that this Congress has \nbeen able to do, to bring forth a balanced budget. That, after all, is \nthe responsibility of the Congress. We have done that. We need to \ncontinue to do that. We need to continue to try and control spending so \nthat we can move toward this idea of a balanced budget and beyond, to \nbegin to work on the debt that is there, to begin to do something about \nthat $280 billion we spend on interest every year to service a $5.5 \ntrillion debt. That, it seems to me, ought to be the real focus of what \nwe do.\n  Our responsibility now, I believe, in the Congress is--we shall meet \non Friday, our friends across the aisle will meet I am sure next week--\nto come to grips with those kind of things we think are the priorities \nfor our agenda. I don't think our agenda can be a laundry list of 30 or \n40 things that appeal to the polls but rather ought to be the kinds of \nthings that are terribly important to us.\n  I think we ought to talk about ISTEA, for example. We ought to get \nout into the country to do the highway maintenance, the highway \nbuilding. We didn't get that done last time because we got diverted \ntalking about something else. ISTEA needs to be there. I think we need \nto continue to work on the budget. There is probably nothing more \nimportant than being responsible in the spending that we do. Again, I \nam\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\npleased with what has happened with the budget over time. I am pleased \nfor what has happened in the last couple of years on welfare reform. \nThe Congress has moved forward, with the cooperation of the President, \nafter a couple of vetoes. That is OK. But we need to continue to do \nthat, to provide the opportunity to help people move off of welfare \ninto work, which is what most people want to do, of course. We have \nmade some progress in moving away some from the entitlement program \nthat we have had. We have made some progress in terms of moving \nGovernment closer to people, where Government is more responsive at the \nState level, and do those things at the State level that we should do \nthere.\n  As I listened last night to the enumeration of things that might be \ndone it seemed to me at least one of the considerations that has to be \nmade is where do you do these things most efficiently? Child care--\neverybody is for having quality child care. Everybody wants to \nstrengthen the child care program. The question first we ought to ask \nis, where is that best done? What is the role of the Federal Government \nin child care? What is the role of the State government in these kinds \nof things?\n  I happened to have the privilege last night of having my Governor \naccompany me to the State of the Union Message. I could sense as we \nwent through last night's State of the Union Message him saying to \nhimself, ``We can do that better at the State level. We can really make \nthose things work.'' I agree with that.\n  There are a number of other things that I personally would like to \nsee us move forward on. One of my personal areas of interest is the \nnational parks. National parks are a national treasure for all of us. \nMore and more people go to visit national parks. More and more people \nare interested. Yet we have less resources for national parks than we \nneed. National parks, some claim, are as much as $8 billion in arrears \non infrastructure. We need to work at that. That happens to be \nsomething that I am most interested in.\n  I think most of all we need to be sure that we are responsible, \nfinally. Spending continues to go up. If we are going to balance the \nbudget--why balance the budget? Because revenues have gone up. I think \nthe President's proposal goes far beyond what is going to be available \nfor dollars. The President says we want to keep a balanced budget and \nthen lists 30 items that will cost billions of dollars plus additional \ntax deductions there that will reduce revenue. So we find ourselves I \nam sure with spending far beyond our income if we do those things.\n\n  Those, I believe, have to be the constraints. That is what I heard \nfrom my people. That is what I heard from the people of Wyoming. They \nsaid, look, stay with that business of balancing the budget. We not \nonly want to balance the budget, we would like to see you begin to \nreduce spending. This idea of the era of large Government being over is \na good idea.\n  I was disappointed the President had done a complete reversal from 2 \nyears ago when he announced that would be his objective. This certainly \nwas not an effort to reduce and to change the era of big Government.\n  Spending continues to go up, 16 percent last year, 24 percent on \nentitlements. Over a period of time, entitlements continue to grow. \nMany of these programs that we talked about inevitably will become \nentitlements. These young people that are here on the floor as pages \nwon't see those benefits because they will not be sustained if we \ncontinue to grow at 24 percent a year.\n  Madam President, I think we have a real opportunity. As I said, I \nenjoyed the President's State of the Union Message. That is his agenda. \nNow it is our responsibility to have an agenda and to put our \npriorities there, put our philosophy there, our philosophy of a \nresponsible Government, our philosophy of a financially accountable \nGovernment, one in which we limit size and move as close as we can to \npeople to solve people's problems.\n  The educational program that Senator Coverdell has recommended is one \nthat puts the responsibility in the hands of local people, parents. \nThat is what we need to do. Those are the kinds of things we can do \nhere to assist in those problems. So I am excited about this year. I \nthink we have an opportunity to do a great deal. I am very proud of \nhaving been in this Senate since 1994. I think we have made some real \nchanges in direction. It is my hope and my desire to help ensure that \nwe continue to move in the direction of a more responsible Government, \nresponsive to the folks that we represent, the folks I have had a \nchance to visit with for 2 months and have come back with some renewed \ndedication to the idea that this Congress, this Government, is \nresponsible to the people, to the taxpayers, responsible for protecting \nliberty, responsible for being financially responsible, responsible for \nreducing taxes as much as we can, to leave the money to the people it \nbelongs to. I am excited about the opportunity.\n  So my friend, Mr. Coverdell, I appreciate very much what you are \ndoing in this time to talk. I think we should continue to talk about \nour agenda and talk about the reasons we are doing what we are doing. I \nlook forward to that happening this year.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As always, Madam President, I enjoyed the remarks of \nthe distinguished Senator from Wyoming. He brings that clear Western \nthinking to the Senate.\n  If I might add a thought, it is a little hard to believe, but this \nCongress passed the first balanced budget in the 104th Congress. That \nwas vetoed by the President. We did it again. So we passed two. The \nPresident signed it. It is the first one in 30 years. In 30 years \nWashington has never developed the will to balance its budget. It \npassed the first tax relief in the last Congress. That was vetoed. A \nmodified tax relief was passed last year. That was signed. That is the \nfirst tax relief in 16 years.\n  Now, I don't know what the situation is in Wyoming but that tax \nrelief proposal leaves $750 million every year in Georgia checking \naccounts of working families, businesses, people sending kids to school \nand college, trying to make ends meet. It left $750 million in those \naccounts. It was not a particularly large tax reduction. But it means a \nlot. It puts about 2,000 additional dollars in the checking account of \nan average family.\n  Now, the point I am making is this, and I would like to get the \nSenator's comment, don't you find it interesting that once the United \nStates balanced its budget, once it has become more engaged in managing \nits financial affairs, how much more optimistic the people are, how \nmany more of them of working, how interest rates have stayed somewhat \ndown, and how we are talking about surpluses for the first time? Pretty \nremarkable, very remarkable. It ought to be a lesson to every Congress \nand every President. This is a good idea. We better keep doing it.\n  Mr. THOMAS. If I might, I certainly agree with the Senator. It isn't \nthat difficult.\n  In other words, this is what our system is all about. Our system of \nprivate enterprise, our system of limited Government, our system of \nallowing as much money as possible to stay in the hands of the citizens \nso they can invest it and create jobs, that is what our system is all \nabout. Through the years it has been tested against socialism and big \ngovernment and the government doing all these things, and throughout \nthe world this system is the success. It is being copied everywhere. \nSometimes it is scary when we see ourselves moving away from our own \nsystem that has been so successful, that everybody else has adopted.\n  So the Senator is exactly right. That certainly is what creates this \nkind of an economic environment is the ability to take the risk, to \ninvest, to work, to earn, to keep and to do things for yourself and \nyour family.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of the \nSenator from Wyoming. I see we have been joined by the distinguished \nSenator from New York. I welcome his presentation and yield up to 10 \nminutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia for his leadership on this most important issue. I believe that \neducation is the most important issue facing our country.\n  We have focused a majority of our attention on the need to give \nassistance to those of our students who are college bound, and that is \nimportant. We have done, I think, a good job in expanding, for example, \nthe Pell grants\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\nto take in nearly 300,000 students, and I voted for that. We have \nincreased the amounts of those grants substantially, from about $2,400 \nto $3,000 and I support that. And we worked to create educational \nsavings accounts, and I think that is important, Madam President.\n  But I think it is time that we look at our elementary schools and our \nhigh schools, because one in five third-graders across New York State \ncould not read with comprehension even the easiest connected sentences \nand paragraphs, according to the New York State Department of \nEducation. We have heard that 40 percent of the children in some of our \nschool districts are reading below grade level and are below grade \nlevel in math. 50 percent-plus of the students in some of our school \ndistricts are dropping out of school, including here in the Nation's \nCapital. What is going to happen to those children who are dropping \nout? How can they compete? What jobs are they going to hold? What will \nhappen to society if this continues?\n  Let me say that last night the President talked about a number of \nissues. One of those issues he talked about was the need to hire more \nteachers. Let me tell you that I believe we need more teachers in the \nclassrooms. We should empower, by way of making moneys available, the \nlocal districts to do exactly that. I am going to work with whoever it \nis--the President, this administration, my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle--to do exactly that.\n  The President also called for greater accountability in education, \nand I believe that's important. He said students must be more \naccountable for their performance, that we should not have social \npromotion. That is true. Unfortunately, we didn't hear one word about \nmaking teachers accountable also. One of the things that this bill, the \nB.O.O.K.S. Act, does is make available funds for accountability. You \ncan't have our kids learning if the people teaching them do not meet \nperformance standards. We must have competency testing so that we know \nmath teachers do understand basic math and that they can teach it. We \nhave to have some system of evaluating, and we should give the school \ndistricts that ability. It is not that we should say what test they \nshould give, but we should empower the local districts and the parents \nto have a choice.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Most of our teachers, I believe, Mr. President, do a \ngreat job and are dedicated and hard-working. Unfortunately, there is \nno financial reward for those great teachers. I think we need merit \npay. That is one of the things that we encourage in this legislation, \nwhich offers better opportunities for our kids.\n  We need major reform, not just tinkering at the edges of the problem.\n  Let me touch on that which, in many cases, brings about a hue and cry \nnot from the parents, but from those who want to protect the status \nquo, the teachers' union.\n  By perpetuating the status quo, too many of our children are falling \nby the wayside--they are not making it. I am talking about a system \nthat many of my colleagues quake when we bring the issue up, and that \nis called accountability and seeing to it that teachers don't have \nlifetime tenure. I think our kids are entitled to have teachers who \nmake a difference just like the teachers I had in grade school who \ncreated magic in the classroom.\n\n  Those teachers exist today. Let's understand that. I think the vast \nmajority of our public school teachers are dedicated, work hard, do a \ngood job, and they should be rewarded with merit pay.\n  But, by gosh, let's not be afraid to say there should be \naccountability as well with teacher competency tests and ending a \nsystem where teachers, in essence, in too many of our schools and too \nmany of our States, have what is likened to lifetime tenure. After 3 \nyears, it becomes virtually impossible to remove those who are not \ndoing the job. I will give you an example from New York State. Last \nyear, only seven out of 200,000 teachers were removed. Seven. It has \nbecome virtually impossible. And it costs hundreds of thousands of \ndollars to bring this type of action.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am not suggesting that we jeopardize those good \nteachers who are doing the job or that we create some arbitrary \nstandards. I am suggesting that we have some review, some system to \nevaluate performance so that nobody has what is, in essence, lifetime \ntenure regardless of the job the person is doing.\n  The education of our children is too important. Those who teach our \nchildren must be competent in these subjects, that is why we need \ncompetency testing for all teachers. Our children deserve nothing less.\n  Let me point to just one other area before I conclude my remarks, and \nthat is school safety. My gosh, if we have children in our public \nschools that say it is dangerous and they feel safer in their \nneighborhoods than going from one class to another, what more do we \nneed? If we don't have schools as a safe haven, creating the \nenvironment where our children can learn in that safe haven, that oasis \nof learning, then how can the best teacher do the job? So we have to be \nable to fast-track violent, disruptive students out of the school. You \ncannot suggest that public education has ever said that even violent, \ndisruptive juveniles have a right to stay in school no matter what \ntheir conduct. That is unfortunately the case in too many areas. I will \ntell you that the 1,116 schools in New York City reported 22,000 \nincidents in 1996-97, including nearly 5,000 person-related incidents. \nIt becomes impossible to have serious learning in the classroom.\n  Last but not least, let me just touch on one aspect that I think is \nso important. Why should we have a plethora of Federal programs that \nserve cross-purposes, when we can take that money and establish \neducation block grants. Somehow bureaucrats have planted in the minds \nof many of our parents and local officials that they are going to lose \nmoney.\n  What we call for in this bill is saying that we are going to give you \nthe same amount of money, and, in fact, we will actually give you more \nmoney. In title II of the BOOKS Act, States would receive funds through \nblock grants, which can be used for educational needs that the local \ncommunities and school boards think are important--not that Washington \nmandates. So they are going to get more money. In addition, they are \ngoing to get a lot more money because 95 percent of those funds must \nreach the local schools in the classrooms and cannot be used for \nadministrative expenses. We cannot have 15 to as high as 25 and 30 \npercent of the money being used for administrative overhead. The money \nis not reaching the kids.\n  I might give one example. Senator Gorton's amendment along these \nlines last year would have sent an additional $670 million to local \nschool districts. But we have the bureaucrats in Washington who are \nopposed to that. They want to keep these ties. That is an employment \ncenter as opposed to becoming an educational opportunity. So $670 \nmillion more could go to the school districts. And by the way, that \nhires 26,000 teachers. So when our President says, ``we want to hire \n100,000,'' here is a way. If we were to adopt the block grant proposal, \nand some amendments to it, we could hire as many as 26,000 teachers at \nthe local districts without raising one additional penny. My gosh, \nthat's over a quarter of the number that the President talked about, \nwith no increase in taxes. It just means using the resources we have \nand empowering our parents and the local school districts to make these \nchoices.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Coverdell, Senator Lott, and \nthe occupant of the Chair, Senator Coats, for being leaders in this \narea. We have to do better for our children, not just tinkering at the \nedges.\n  By the way, why should we be afraid of the teachers' unions? We \nshould encourage them to work with us. It should not be a battle \nagainst them. Notwithstanding that I have been critical of their status \nquo position and their opposition to basic, good, fundamental reform, \nthis should be a fight for our children, to give our kids a better \neducation. I would hope that the Members and all of the teachers would \njoin and be in favor of this and work together. We can do better and we \nmust do better because our children are entitled to that.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank you for your leadership. I thank Senator \nCoverdell and my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I certainly echo the compliments of the \nSenator from New York to the Chair\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nbecause, clearly, throughout your career you have been dedicated to \nthis kind of work. It was appropriate to mention that. We appreciate \nthe remarks of the Senator from New York. They are very much on target.\n  We have been joined by our distinguished colleague from Colorado. I \nyield up to 7 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized to \nspeak for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nyielding me a few moments. One of the strengths of the Republican \nParty, and one of the reasons I am so proud of the leadership is that \nthey have encouraged us to go back to our States and talk with the \ncitizens in our States and really find out what the problems are. As we \nare putting together our agenda here for this session, I really feel \nlike this is a grassroots message. It has come from within the States. \nIt has come from our friends and our neighbors and our local elected \nofficials, the people who have to work with the Federal Government on a \ndaily basis. I have gone back to my State and held a lot of town \nmeetings. This particular year, I decided to hold a lot of town \nmeetings in January. I held 40 town meetings in January. The message \nthat came loud and clear to me is the main thing on people's minds is \nthat there is a growing Federal Government that is continuing to \ninterfere in their daily lives. Somehow or other, they feel they are \nlosing control. Local officials in Colorado feel like they are losing \ncontrol. Small business people feel like they are losing control and \nare getting too many dictates from Washington.\n  Another thing that has come up in all of my town meetings has been \nthe Tax Code. People are concerned about the tax burden that they have \nto bear today, particularly from the Federal Government. People want \nour tax system reformed. They certainly would like to have lower taxes, \nand they want a simpler and a less intrusive means of collecting those \ntaxes. It strikes me that the two issues of taxes and the growth of \nGovernment tend to intertwine with one another. Those two issues, I \nthink, are simply pulled together with this statement: Where the money \ngoes is where the power goes. So people stand up, and say, ``Well, \nthere is too much power in Washington.'' Then they complain the next \nminute that my request for funds from some program in Washington comes \nwith mandates and strings attached and they begin to realize that there \nis power related to where that money goes. I think they think that the \nFederal Government is entirely too powerful. It does claim a huge \nportion of our economy each year.\n\n  Let me review just a few numbers to make the case for tax reduction \nand tax reform which is going to be an important part of our agenda. \nThe tax burden has been steadily rising since 1992. In 1992, the \nFederal Government claimed 19 percent of the economy. By the end of \n1997 this has risen to around 21.4 percent. Remember, this is just the \nFederal Government. It is not State taxes. It is not local taxes. And \nif we include all of the State and local taxes and Federal taxes, of \ncourse, it is much, much larger. We are just talking about the Federal \nGovernment's share.\n  The government at all levels now claims about one-third of the wealth \nproduced each year in our economy--one-third. I think that is really a \nhigh number--certainly much more than any of our forefathers ever \ndreamed as far as the role of the Federal Government in our national \neconomy.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, State, Federal, and local taxes will \nclaim 38 percent of the median two-income family--38 percent. By \ncomparison, in 1965, the burden was 28 percent. It has gone up 10 \npercent. The tax burden amounts to no more than a typical family will \nspend on housing, food, and clothing combined.\n  Mr. President, if we really want to help families with child care \nexpenses, education expenses, health expenses, or housing expenses, we \nshould reduce the tax burden. They have more money in their pocket. It \ngives them additional flexibility to spend it how they feel they should \ninstead of sending it to Washington and then coming down with those \nmandates.\n  There is much talk in Washington about the budget balancing and the \nforecast of some excess revenues which are referred to as a \n``surplus.'' I certainly hope that this happens.\n  When I was first elected to the United States House of \nRepresentatives, I remember our deficits were running around $340 \nbillion a year. That is how much more they were spending a year than \nthey were bringing in that same year. Now they are projecting--the \nCongressional Budget Office--somewhere around $5 billion. That is quite \na change.\n  So I certainly hope that happens. Maybe we can do something here in \nthe Senate to move that along by saying let's look at our budget that \nwe passed last year. Maybe we can do something this year to cut back \nthe $5 billion in spending and actually balance the budget and make \nsure that it happens.\n  But I think we need to be honest about why the budget numbers look so \ngood. The budget is balancing not because of any tough decisions that \nwe made here in the Congress. But it is balancing because of hard-\nworking Americans out there that are being productive. And the reason \nthat they are being productive, I think, is because they really believe \nthat we are committed to balancing the budget. It holds down costs \nbecause interest rates are going down. And when they go to buy a car, \nor house, or when they are in business for themselves, this means they \ncan invest more in themselves than the community. That is certainly \npart of it. Another part of it is because I think they believe that \nRepublicans are going to--and they did last session--work for reducing \nthe tax burden so they will have more of that for spending.\n  So the economic performance in the past year and why it has really \ndone so well is because of action here, I think, in the Republican \nCongress.\n  The American people have been sending greater and greater amounts of \ntheir money to Washington. There is no doubt about it. With the budget \nbalancing that we are going to be facing this year, I think we all \npretty much agree that it is because of increased tax receipts coming \nin and not because of restraint in spending or the fact that the budget \ncontinues to grow. I think we have to keep that in mind.\n  Federal spending in 1998 is estimated to be around 4.3 percent over \nour 1997 spending level. It is well in excess of inflation which is a \nlittle bit over 2 percent.\n  So I hope that we will keep in mind that we need to make decisions \nthat move the power from Washington back to the local level, and move \nit back to the pocketbooks of people who are in business for themselves \nand are making decisions on behalf of their families.\n  So we are going to reduce the role of the Federal Government by \ncutting taxes. And I am here to say that we need to get on with it. And \nthe sooner we show the American people that we are really serious about \ncutting taxes I think the better our growth is going to be in this \neconomy and the more we can count on to sustain the economy so it is \neasier for us to balance the budget and move forward with our daily \nlives.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding me time to comment on \ntaxes and our economy and how my constituents feel about reducing the \nbudget within their daily lives.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for \nhis very generous remarks, and I enjoyed his presentation here this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our time be elongated by \n5 minutes. We have cleared this with the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we have been joined by the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas. I yield up to 7 minutes to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized to speak \nfor up to 7 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for letting us talk about this \nimportant issue, because I think we are getting to the crux of what \nCongress wants to do. I am glad to be able to address this issue today \nafter the President's State of the Union Message because I was somewhat \nconcerned that in his State of the Union message. The President\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\nseemed to throw aside any hope for tax cuts. That is a very important \nagenda that I have, and I think most Members of Congress have because \nwe believe that hard-working American families should be able to keep \nmore of the money they earn, not less.\n  I want to outline what I think is the right approach, if we do in \nfact start seeing budget surpluses. I want to put forward the \nproposition that ``half and half'' is more than just a high-quality \nmilk product. In fact, half and half is the right formula for the \nresponsible spending of the surplus that we hope to see in our budget \nover the next 10 years. Half should go for paying down the debt. If we \nare going to be the responsible stewards of this country for our future \ngeneration, we must start whittling away the $5 trillion debt. We have \nworked hard in a bipartisan way in Congress and with the President to \ncome to a balanced budget. We have done the hard work. To now fritter \nit away with new ideas for spending our hard-earned taxpayer dollars is \nthe wrong thing to do at this time.\n  So I think one-half should go towards paying down debt, so that we \ncan say to our children we are going to give you at least as good a \nsolid base as we had when we were growing up in this great country. The \nother half should go for direct tax cuts for the people who have earned \nthis money.\n  When I hear people on this floor talking about tax cuts, you can \nreally tell the difference in the way they frame the question. The \nquestion asked by people who do not want tax cuts is ``Well, now if we \ngive these tax cuts, what is it going to cost the federal government?'' \nThat is the wrong question. It is not the government's money, it is the \nmoney of hard-working taxpayers. A tax cut lets them keep more of the \nmoney they earn. It is not robbing it from the Federal Government. It \nis letting the people who earn it keep it.\n  So half and half I think is the right formula.\n  I will be introducing legislation very quickly that would provide tax \ncuts, and it would do it in a descending order of priority so that we \nwould never go over one-half of the budget surplus of that year.\n  Here is what my tax bill would do. It would first eliminate the \nmarriage tax penalty. People in our country should not have to choose \nbetween love and money. We value marriage. And the people who get hurt \nthe most are the middle-income. The policeman who marries the school \nteacher will pay over $1,000 in taxes in a marriage tax penalty just \nbecause they got married. That is wrong, and I want to eliminate it.\n  No. 2, I want to raise the level of income that people would start \npaying taxes at 15 percent and 28 percent. This helps the people who \nare paying the most. I want to raise that 15-percent tax on a single \nperson which, in 1998 will kick in at $25,350. I want to raise that to \n$35,000 so that you would not go into that 15-percent bracket until you \nare single and earning $35,000. If you are married, it would be \n$50,000, up from $42,350. If you are the head of a household, it would \nbe $40,000, up from $33,950. The 28-percent bracket, the next bracket, \nwould start at $71,000 for a single person, up from $61,109, $109,950, \nfor a couple, up from $102,000, and for a head of household, $93,000, \nup from $87,000.\n\n  This just raises the point at which people would have to pay higher \nrates. It gives a break to those who are paying the biggest share, and \nthat is the lower- and middle-income people of our country.\n  No. 3, the bill will repeal the 18-month capital gains holding period \nand make it 12 months. I think 12 months is ample time for a capital \ngains tax to set in. And keep in mind that capital gains are more \ndisproportionately paid by our elderly citizens.\n  No. 4, in my proposal, I will index capital gains for inflation. This \nwill be a tremendous help to elderly people because most of their \nincome is investment income rather than earned income. We are indexing \nthe personal exemption on earned income. Why not do it for those who \nare earning it through investment, as elderly people are?\n  Finally, my bill will cut the top estate tax rate from 55 percent, to \n28 percent. I don't like the estate tax at all because I think the \nAmerican dream for over 200 years has been that you could come to this \ncountry, you could work harder, and you could give your children a \nbetter chance than you had. So I do not want the estate tax at all. But \nif we are going to have one, I think it should be lower so that people \nwill be able to give their children a little bit better start than they \nhad.\n  This is a balanced tax-cut plan. It is not the only one that is good. \nI have heard many versions of tax-cut plans being put forward by my \ncolleagues that I could easily support. But, I think the important \npoint here is that most Americans, the average American family, pay \n38.2 percent of their income in taxes. Mr. President, that is too much. \nAnd we want to change it, and it is a priority for this Congress.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for letting us focus on this very \nimportant issue for strengthening the American family by letting them \nkeep more of the money they work hard to earn.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \nexcellent remarks and her dedication to leaving money in the checking \naccounts of people who earn it.\n  Let me just say in closing, because I know we are going to the other \nside, that to me American liberty and freedom rests on three principal \nstanchions: Economic liberty, which means workers can keep the fruits \nof their labors and make decisions about their lives and fulfill their \nresponsibilities. We have been talking about that here today making \nsure we leave resources with American workers and families so that they \ncan do the job and always be dependent upon them to do so in America.\n  No. 2, for freedom to exist people have to be safe. They have to be \nsecure at work and at home and in their school. We talked about making \nthem safer today.\n  Last, but certainly not least, an uneducated mind cannot enjoy the \nbenefits of American citizenship. An uneducated mind is denied American \nliberty. The first major denial occurs, as Senator D'Amato from New \nYork said, when they are denied economic liberty because they cannot \nget a job and they cannot connect with the vast opportunity in society.\n  So America has to get about the task of assuring that all her \nchildren and her population have the fundamentals to be free and to \nenjoy American freedom. And that is what we have been talking about \ntoday. We want America to be educated so that she will remain free.\n  We want workers to be able to benefit from their work so that they \ncan do the job of raising their families and fulfilling their \nresponsibilities as American citizens. And we know they have to be safe \nbecause no commerce, no civil interaction can occur in a society that \nis violence-ridden. And that is what we have been talking about all \nafternoon.\n  If you keep America educated, you give her citizens economic \nviability and options; protect them at home and in the workplace and \nschool, America will be just fine. Our people will take this country \nand build a new American century.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Robb pertaining to the introduction of S. 1582 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ROBB. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota for yielding me time that was \nto be his, and which I would ask unanimous consent not be charged \nagainst the 90 minutes that are allocated to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that 90 minutes \nhave been reserved in a block of time for the Democratic Leader or his \ndesignee. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S90-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S90-S99]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STATE OF THE UNION RESPONSE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, last night President Clinton \ndelivered some good news and some bad news for those who, like me, want \nto address the crisis in American education. And Madam President, that \ncrisis exists in grades kindergarten through high school. I repeat, \nkindergarten through high school. The good news is that President \nClinton has finally joined the Republicans in recognizing that we must \naddress this crisis.\n  It is bad enough that our Nation's schoolchildren have to run a \ngauntlet of drugs and violence just to sit in class, but when they get \nto the classroom they are not learning the basics. Just recently, a \nstudy published in Education Week showed that only 4 in 10 urban school \nstudents could master basic math and reading skills. Four in 10. It \ndoes not get much better when we move to the suburban schools. There it \nis only 6 in 10 who can master these basic skills when tested.\n  Madam President, we are failing our students, and we clearly are not \npreparing America for the new century that the President spoke of last \nevening. Republicans first attacked this problem with a comprehensive \nproposal over 1 year ago, S. 1, that addressed how to help children in \nunsafe schools, how to increase literacy, and how to give new authority \nto parents and communities to improve their local schools.\n  Regrettably, although we were able to reach common ground on making \ncollege more accessible and affordable, President Clinton fought real \neducation reform for the kindergarten through high school grades every \nstep of the way.\n  Most notably and unforgettably, he threatened to veto the entire tax \nrelief bill last year unless we dropped one single provision, one that \nprovided education savings accounts to parents for use for their \nchild's specific educational needs.\n  Madam President, if there was ever a proposal that was win-win in \nthis city, the education savings account was it. The President said he \nwould veto the entire tax relief proposal if that remained. The bad \nnews in President Clinton's speech last night is that he still does not \nunderstand what needs to occur and where it needs to occur for grades \nkindergarten through high school. President Clinton last night repeated \nhis belief that politics should stop at the schoolhouse door. I agree. \nI do not know anybody who does not agree. President Clinton should get \nout of the schoolhouse doorway and allow real education and reform to \nhelp the kids inside those schools.\n  What we saw last night was education proposals that ignored giving \nparents and local communities real power and real choices; ignored real \nreform in favor of business as usual--we call it the status quo around \nhere--spending increases, and paying for all these new programs with \nmoney the Government does not even have and may not ever have. I \nrepeat, paying for all these new programs in the State of the Union \nwith money the Government does not have and may never have.\n  We have a better way. It is called BOOKS, the Better Opportunities \nfor Our Kids and Schools Act.\n  Madam President, BOOKS has several very powerful provisions that do \nexactly what I just alluded to--give new authority and choice to \nparents, give new authority and choice to States and local school \ndistricts that move decisionmaking capability to the people on the \nfrontline and away from the Washington bureaucrat who could not \nassociate a single face with a single name.\n  Title I. A-plus accounts, education savings accounts. Parents can \ncontribute $2,500 a year for a child's K through 12 education--public, \nprivate, religious or home schools. Everybody wins no matter where \ntheir children are in school. I might add that if they chose, they \ncould keep those savings accounts on through higher education as well.\n  Dollars could be used for a home computer, the tutor that is needed \nfor a math deficiency, tuition or the expenses of home schooling; 75 \npercent of these massive new resources would be used by those in public \nschools. They would be a major winner. And 70 percent of the people \ntaking advantage of the savings account earn less than $75,000 per \nyear. The Joint Tax Committee is the source of this estimate. The cost \nwould be $2.6 billion over the next 5 years. Basically, what we are \nsaying is that we are going to leave $2.6 billion in the checking \naccounts of parents trying to help their children.\n  Title II. Dollars to the classroom. Dollars to the classroom would \nblock grant about $3 billion to States and continue to send $7 billion \nin title I, part A funds to the States with only one requirement--that \n95 percent of those Federal dollars go to the classroom to where the \nkids are, not where the bureaucracy offices are. So the money to the \ndisadvantaged children stays the same with the exception we want it in \nthe classroom, and we free $3 billion a year so that those local school \ndistricts can do what they need to do. Do they need to hire teachers? \nThen they hire the teachers. Do they need to build schools? Then they \nbuild schools. Whatever it is they need--not what we envision they may \nneed--could be done through dollars to the classroom. Bureaucracy eats \nup scarce dollars as State and local governments comply with \nWashington's strings. This is not new. It has become endemic in our \nGovernment.\n\n  Even in title I, the moneys that go to the disadvantaged, 99 percent \nreaches the school district but 4 to 13 percent is eaten up by \nadministrative costs--4 to 13 percent. That is big dollars. The $3 \nbillion block grant could pay for as many as 50,000 teachers a year and \n1 million new computers every year or it could pay for building up to \n500 elementary schools. The key point here it is their choice--their \nchoice.\n  Title III. Opportunity and safety for low-income children. This is a \n5-year pilot choice program at 20 to 30 sites to allow low-income \nchildren to attend a safe school through a choice system. We would \ninvest $75 million for 1 year on this project.\n  I do want to point out, Madam President, that this is voluntary. This \nis not imposed on anyone. In fact, with the exception of requiring that \nFederal dollars go to the classroom at the 95 percent level, there is \nnothing in the BOOKS Act that is mandatory. It defines, under this \ntitle, low income as 185 percent of the poverty line. Unsafe schools \nare those with high crime\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\nrates, serious drug problems and disciplinary problems. This gives kids \nat risk a chance to attend a public, charter, private, or sectarian \nschool where the emphasis is on learning, not survival.\n  Madam President, I just think it is unconscionable policy to order \nchildren to go to schools that are certifiably unsafe and drug ridden.\n  Title IV. Testing and merit pay for teachers. It allows States to use \nFederal funds to reward good teachers and weed out the bad, and it will \nmake it easier for States to carry out performance assessments of \nteachers and establish merit pay programs. Americans across the board \nagree with these concepts. Reward good teachers, weed out the bad, and \nmake it easier for States to carry out performance assessment of \nteachers.\n  Title V. Reading excellence. This is similar to Chairman Bill \nGoodling's bill in the House which passed the House by a voice vote on \nNovember 8, 1997.\n  Madam President, it would provide $210 million for teacher training \nand individual grants for K through 12 reading instruction. It requires \nfunds to be spent on programs demonstrated by scientific research to be \neffective, like phonics. It gives parents of kids at risk the ability \nto purchase additional tutoring assistance through grants.\n  President Clinton's America Reads program which cost $2.7 billion \nover 5 years proposed sending semitrained volunteers into the \nclassroom. This is a flawed concept, when you would send a semitrained \nvolunteer into a classroom that has already demonstrated that it is not \nteaching a student to read. So you would send an unprofessional \nvolunteer to help the student read better--that is not logical. The \nreading excellence title requires funds to be spent on programs proven \neffective by scientific research to enable the teacher to improve his \nor her skills so that she or he can teach the student to read.\n  Title VI is the teacher and student safety title. This title allows \nthe use of Federal funds to move victims of violence to safe schools. \nThey could be a public, private or sectarian schools. The key here is \nif the student has become a victim, there should be nothing in the way \nof that school board's ability to move the student to a safe place. It \nallows use of noneducational funds--Victims of Crime Act administered \nby the Department of Justice--for innovative programs to help victims \nand witnesses of crime on school property. And it encourages the use of \nimmediate notification and annual report cards to parents and teachers \nabout incidents of violence and drugs at schools.\n  Title VII is the Charter Schools Expansion Act title. This is similar \nto Congressman Riggs' bill which passed the House 367 to 57 on November \n7. This provision of the legislation ensures charter schools are \neligible for their fair share of Federal funding, whether it is title \nI, IDEA, or title VI block grants. Charter schools are public schools \nfreed of many of the regulations in turn for increased accountability \nin terms of student outcomes. Without excessive regulation these \nschools are better able to design programs tailored to the needs of \nstudents and communities.\n  Madam President, I see we have been joined by my good colleague from \nNebraska. I am going to turn to the Senator in just a minute or so \nhere.\n  Under title VIII, the last title, we say the Federal Government \nshould honor its agreement, which it made when it imposed special \neducation requirements on local education, to fund a sizable portion of \nit. We agreed to fund up to 40 percent but we have never done it. You \nknow, it's one of those stories, ``The check is in the mail.'' It never \nquite gets there.\n  Senator Gregg deserves a lot of credit for this. He started the \nprocess last year but this would finish it with $9.3 billion over the \nnext 6 years to fully honor our commitment to fund special ed, which we \ncall IDEA. That would free up $9.3 billion for local communities to \nassess and take care of their own specific needs. That is the general \ndescription of the proposal our conference announced on January 20.\n  I now turn to my colleague and good friend from Nebraska, Senator \nHagel, for up to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I would like to make a couple of \nobservations about last night, the agenda for the second session of \nthis 105th Congress; what is ahead of us, what is ahead for the \nAmerican people, the challenges that lie ahead for the world.\n  As I listened intently and seriously last night, as I am sure all my \ncolleagues did, to the President's message, questions came to me like, \n``Isn't the definition of the debate for this year and the defining of \nthe debate that the Congress will have into the next century about the \nrole of Government?'' That is the issue. What is the role of Government \nin our lives? How much Government do we want? How much Government can \nwe afford? What do we want Government to do for us? And how much are we \nwilling to pay for Government?\n  The President--and I have all eight single-spaced pages of the text \nof his speech last night--gave a good speech. But the speech was about \nnew programs, the federalization of America. This is the same President \nwho said 2 years ago in a State of the Union Message that the era of \nbig Government is gone. No more big Government. And then the President \nsaid last night, early on in his text, that we, today, have, ``the \nsmallest Government in 35 years.'' I don't know how the President \nmeasures that, but this body is going to debate this year a $1.7 \ntrillion Federal budget to keep this small little Government going.\n  He talks about federalizing education. I don't find the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to be education anywhere in \nthe Constitution. I don't find it in any document that education is in \nthe purview and the province of the Federal Government. Yet this \nPresident says we, the Federal Government, representing the people who \npay the taxes, are going to hire 100,000 new teachers. We are going to \nfederalize new teachers. We are going to build new schools across \nAmerica, federalize our schools. But yet, of course, he fails to tell \nus how he intends to do that. Where are those resources coming from?\n  At the same time he boasts, rightfully so, that we in fact have moved \ntoward balancing our budget. So he takes credit for that on this side. \nAnd then on this side we have page after page, line after line, of new \nGovernment spending proposals.\n  Medicare has been running a deficit the last couple of years. Yet \nthis President is proposing that we add more people onto Medicare. This \nis at the same time the President and the Congress have come together \nand said we need a Medicare commission, a bipartisan Medicare \ncommission to take a look at the seriousness of the problem, of the \nissue, of the challenge, and report back to the President next year. \nBut, no, he decides not to wait for that.\n  Child care--we are going to federalize child care? These are all \nimportant, critical issues for our country, for our people. Of course \nthey are. But I think we might be better off if we would essentially \ncontinue this effort to cut Government, cut spending, cut programs, cut \ntaxes, and take the responsibility of governing ourselves back to where \nit should be; back to the cities, the school boards, the counties. Who \nbest understands the problem? I trust school boards. I trust teachers. \nI trust parents. I don't trust bureaucrats. We are rapidly developing \ninto this monolithic centralization of bureaucratic rule. People in the \nDepartment of Education and all these areas are good people, family \npeople, but we just, year after year, load more on them.\n\n  I ask this question when I hear a retort from my friends on the other \nside, or from the President, that Medicare, for example, and all these \nnew programs, will pay for themselves; there will not be an increase in \nspending; we don't need to find more taxpayers' money: Is there anyone \nout there who can show me any time we have had a Federal program that \nhas gotten smaller? Do Federal programs and agencies and bureaucracies \nand departments vanish after a few years? Oh, no, no; they get bigger. \nAnd who has to pay for it? My children and your children. And it gets \nbigger and bigger. Where have we cut Government in the 1990s? We have \ncut it in one department. What department? Defense. Our national \nsecurity has been cut over the last 10 years in real dollars by 40 \npercent. How many other departments and agencies have been cut? None.\n  So my point is this. Before we rush into all these new programs and \nnew\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\nGovernment and new federalization, we better sober up for a moment. \nThis is not a time for campaign rhetoric. This is not a time for \ncampaign speeches. This is a time for clear-headed, strong, dynamic, \nsmart, realistic leadership, gutsy leadership. That is what America \ndemands. That is what America will get.\n  I say these things not because I am opposed to the President or \ntrying to complicate the President's life. But we, too, have a \nconstitutional responsibility in this body. We have accountability to \nthe people we represent. And this is one U.S. Senator who is going to \nask some very tough questions about every one of these new programs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for \nhis remarks and the contribution he made here this afternoon. I am \ngoing to now turn to our distinguished colleague, Senator Hutchinson \nfrom Arkansas, and yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding. First, \nI want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nNebraska and his excellent analysis of the efforts by our government to \nfederalize not only education, but many other programs as well. And I \napplaud Senator Coverdell from Georgia for his efforts in the area of \neducation, and in particular, his leadership on the Better \nOpportunities for Our Kids and Schools Act, the BOOKS Act. I believe \nthis bill demonstrates that we, as Republicans, have a deep concern \nabout education in this country. We have a deep concern about improving \neducation for our children, who are precious to us. And we recognize \nthat this is best done at the local level, where teachers know the \nnames of our kids, and can pick up the phone and call the parents when \nthe need arises. These decisions are better made at the local school \ndistrict level, the State level, and not by a greater and bigger \nFederal bureaucracy.\n  Last evening, in his State of the Union Address, the President \nproposed ``the first ever national effort to reduce the class size in \nthe early grades . . . by hiring 100,000 new teachers.'' So I ask, is \nthis really a genuine effort to reduce the size of our children's \nclasses? Or is it just another exercise of ever bigger Government, and \na move in that gradual effort toward federalizing education in this \ncountry?\n  Why are new teachers, mandated from Washington, the ticket to smaller \nclass sizes? It is well-documented that many States across this Nation \nhave taken on the responsibility of reducing the size of their \nclassrooms; namely, California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut \nand Wisconsin. The Governors of these five States have proposed hiring \nthousands of new teachers using, not Federal dollars, but State \ndollars. This makes sense, allowing individuals closest to our children \nto make these kinds of decisions.\n  Madam President, I trust those individuals in the thousands of cities \nand towns across this country who know your child's name, to make the \nimportant decisions that impact the very classrooms in which our \nchildren learn much more than I trust bureaucrats in our Nation's \ncapital. In an effort to allow States and localities to make these \ndecisions, I, as part of the BOOKS legislation, will be introducing the \nDollars to the Classroom Act, that will redirect about $3 billion of K-\n12 education dollars to the States, requiring only that 95 percent of \nthat money actually reach our children's classrooms. This money can be \nfor books, it can be for teachers, it can be for computers--whatever \nthe local education officials deem necessary and important to the \neducation of our children.\n\n  While no one can deny the importance of providing the best possible \neducation to our children, we also must implement these programs in the \nmost responsible manner: by returning control over the education of our \nchildren to the place that it belongs, the parents and teachers and \nlocal communities and local school boards. By doing that, we will \nensure that education dollars are spent wisely on programs and \nactivities which really benefit our children in the classroom.\n  Currently, the vast majority of all Federal education funding does \nnot go to school districts or classrooms. In fact, in 1995, of the $100 \nbillion the Federal Government allocated for education programs, only \nabout 13 percent actually got to the local level from the Department of \nEducation. That is a travesty, and a national nightmare.\n  Madam President, the current system of Federal bureaucrats attempting \nto administer hundreds of education programs to our children is, to say \nthe least, highly inefficient, as reflected in falling test scores and \nincreased illiteracy rates.\n  Many students are not adequately prepared to meet the challenges of \nlife beyond high school, whether they go on to college, take a job, or \nattend a trade school. In fact, last year alone, 43 percent of high \nschool seniors scored below the basic level in science, while 29 \npercent of all college freshmen were required to take at least one \nremedial course. Most alarming is that 68 percent of employers say that \nhigh school graduates are not prepared to succeed in the workplace. \nThese statistics paint a very sad picture in a country which prides \nitself on having the best education system in the world. When limited \nFederal funding is spread so thin over such a wide area, the result is \nineffective programs that fail to provide students with the basic \nskills they need to succeed.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join Senator Coverdell and my good friend \nfrom Nebraska, Senator Hagel, and I, in asking hard questions. Which do \nour constituents really prefer? In whom do the citizens of America \nreally place their confidence? The real question is--is it going to be \nBOOKS, or is it going to be bureaucrats? So why not let those on the \nState level, why not let those on the local level, who best know the \nneeds of our children, make those decisions, make those determinations? \nPerhaps it is books, perhaps it is computers, or perhaps it will be a \nneed for more teachers so that children will have smaller class sizes. \nBut I truly believe that those decisions must be made at the local \nlevel.\n  I believe the alternative, the Dollars to the Classroom Act, \ndemonstrates not only our commitment to the education of our kids, but \nalso proves that there is a better way to implement this commitment \nrather than creating an ever-growing Federal bureaucracy and \nappropriating ever-larger sums of money which are failing to provide \nfor the real needs that our schools have.\n  So, once again, I applaud Senator Coverdell for his leadership in \neducation, his leadership on our efforts to improve education for all \nof the children in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I commend the Senator from Arkansas. I think he very \nadroitly draws the distinction between our proposal, which frees these \nlocal communities to make decisions about what they need, in \ndistinction to the last 30 or 40 years where more and more and more we \nhave somebody, as you say, who couldn't recognize one of the students, \ntrying to set the priorities, and all the assistance we send is with a \nmandate to shackle the local school boards.\n  Everywhere I go--I don't know about yourself--but it is over and over \nI am being told that you all are going to have to decide. ``You all \nhave to let us teach these kids.'' Or, ``Are you going to keep \nmandating us and throttling us down with all of your agendas?'' And \nwhile we have been doing that, we, each year, have more and more data \nsuggesting that the children cannot do the basics, cannot read right, \nthey cannot understand the basic science, and they cannot add and \nsubtract.\n  If they cannot do that, they cannot succeed in our society. I think \nyou have adroitly hit it. And I appreciate your work on dollars to \nthese local systems.\n  We have now been joined, Madam President, by the distinguished \nSenator from Florida, Senator Mack. I yield Senator Mack up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for this opportunity. I want to \nagain commend the Senator for the leadership he provided last year in \nfocusing us on this issue, leading the debate and the effort to try to \npass the A-plus education savings account with great leadership. We \nappreciate what the Senator is doing.\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\n  I want to kind of set the stage as to why I think the issue of \neducation is so important. When I go home and speak to the people, they \nwill tell you that the No. 1 issue facing the Nation, facing their \nState, facing their community, is education. I think they recognize \nthat if their children are going to be successful with their lives, \nthey have to have an education that is second to none.\n  But let me put it in a broader perspective in that I believe that the \n21st century is going to be the century of knowledge.\n  We have all heard about, for the last 10 or 15 years, folks like \nAlvin Toffler talking about the information/communications age. Some of \nus find ourselves totally surprised that we are engaged in playing \naround on the computer, the Internet, things I couldn't have dreamed of \na couple years ago. We know there is an explosion of knowledge and \ninformation out there. We also know that if our children are going to \nbe successful and be able to compete in the 21st century, they are \ngoing to have to have an education second to none.\n  To just build on that, there was an educator in the State of \nFlorida--President Bush put him on his commission-- Mitch Madique, who \nis the president at one of our State universities. He traveled to South \nAmerica and had discussions with the various leaders of education in \nthose countries. They were saying to him, ``We are really looking \nforward to the 21st century because competition in the 21st century is \nno longer going to be based on military capability, military strength \nor the amount of your natural resources. Instead, competition is going \nto be based on knowledge. If that's the case, we're all starting off on \nthe same foot. And we believe we have just as much of an opportunity to \ndevelop a first-class education system as you do. So we look forward to \ncompetition in the 21st century.''\n  To me, this means that if those three little grandsons of mine, who \nare 13, 11 and 4, if they are going to have an opportunity to make it, \nand if they are going to have an opportunity to have the same kind of \nexperiences and opportunities that we had, then they do have to have an \neducation that is second to none.\n  The proposals that the Senator from Georgia has already laid out make \nclear that there is not going to be a solution described and defined at \nthe Federal level and passed on to the local communities and States. \nConversely, we believe that the answers are going to come from the \ngrassroots level.\n  So I would like to just share for a moment an experience that I had \nin California a few years ago. I went to a school in the area where the \nriots took place. The name of this school was the Marcus Garvey School. \nWe have had some experience with the Marcus Garvey School here in \nWashington. The experience we had in California was totally different \nthan here locally, so don't be confused.\n\n  As I went to the school and I drove down the street, I would suggest \nthat probably most of you would think, ``I'm not sending my child to \nthat school.'' There were just absolutely no amenities. There was not a \nblade of grass anywhere. There was not a single basketball hoop or any \nplaygrounds that I could see. There was just a building that had been \nconverted, I am not sure what from, into a series of classrooms.\n  We went in and we met with the owner, the administrator, the \nprincipal--all one person. His name was Anyim Palmer. His office was \nprobably 10 by 12, stacked full of papers. He had no secretary. When \nthe phone rang, he answered it. The equipment or the desks and chairs \nappeared to be 30-40 years old. The point I am making is there was not \na lot of money invested in amenities in this school.\n  He suggested that maybe we go down and work our way through the \ndifferent classes that were being taught. We started out in the day \ncare area. We saw about eight or nine children age 2--not second grade, \nbut age 2. When my wife and I went down to the room, the teacher said \nto the children, ``Show the Senator and Mrs. Mack how you can say your \nABCs''--again, they were 2 years old. They said their ABCs. Just as \ncute as they could be, they ran through the alphabet. When they \nfinished with that, the teacher said, ``Now say it in Spanish.'' Then \nthey said it in Spanish. Then she said, ``Do it in Swahili.'' Then they \nsaid it in Swahili. Here are 2-year-old children who have already \nmastered the alphabet in three different languages.\n  We went from there over to where the 3-year-old children--again, I \nemphasize 3-year-old children--were working on math. These little \nchildren were walking up to the blackboard working through math \nproblems. So the teacher said to me, ``Give them a problem to work \non.'' I suspect everybody here would have reacted the same way I did. I \nsaid, ``How about 5 plus 3?'' She said, ``No. I mean, give them a \ndifficult problem to do.'' So I said, ``Well, how about 153 plus 385.'' \nAnd the little 3-year-old stood there and put a couple dots on the \nboard, wrote down one number; put a couple more dots on the board, and \nanother number went down; a few more dots, another number went down. It \nwas the right answer--3 years old.\n  We went over where the 4-year-olds were being taught reading, and \nthey were reading at the second and third grade levels--at the age of \n4.\n  I went to where the 5-year-old children were--and mind you, we have \nnot gotten to the first grade yet. The teacher asked one of the little \nboys to stand up and recite for me, in the proper chronological order, \nall the Presidents of the United States. This little boy stood up and \nlooked me right square in the eye, and he listed every President of the \nUnited States in proper chronological order.\n  You might be asking yourself, how did I know that? Frankly, they \nhanded me a cheat sheet, and I was working my way down it as he was \ngoing through it.\n  My point is, here is a school that most people, again, would look at \nand say, ``I don't want my child to go there.'' No amenities. It is \nbare bones. You may say, ``Well, what makes this thing work?'', which \nis exactly what I asked every teacher in every room that we went into. \nHow is this happening? Anyim Palmer told me that the answer was the \nteacher. It is the teacher. Every time they asked the question, the \nanswer was the same--it is the teacher.\n  Interesting things came out of it. I don't believe any of the \nteachers were certified. I think only two of them had college \neducations. What happened is Anyim Palmer, who was the owner, \nadministrator, the principal, was a former public schoolteacher who \nbecame so frustrated with the public school system that he said, ``I'm \ngoing to start my own school. I'm going to teach people how to teach.''\n\n  Again, I would encourage anyone who has an opportunity to make a \nvisit to that school or something like it to do so. But the point is, \nif we rely on the present system, the present system will produce \nexactly what it has produced in the past, unless there is something \nthat forces people to change. We believe the program that we have put \ntogether will in fact assist local communities and States to develop \nalternatives to the present public school system.\n  I visited a charter school in Miami just a few days ago and spoke \nwith a teacher there, who up until a few years ago was an engineer. I \nsaid, ``What happened? Why are you teaching?'' He said two things. One \nis, he said, ``I lost my job. And I didn't want to put my family \nthrough that kind of an experience again. I felt there was some \nsecurity in teaching.'' And then he said, ``You know what? I have found \nmy calling.'' He is teaching second grade children. He said, ``This is \nexactly where I should be.''\n  But in this charter school, this individual had flexibility. This \nindividual could approach the opportunity of teaching our children in a \ntotally different way than in the past. So, again, I think if we \nencourage innovative thinking, we are going to find there are some \nremarkable ways to improve education in our country.\n  As you know, one of the major points in our proposal is to reward \nteachers who do a good job. We ought to reward excellence. We ought to \nsay to those teachers, ``You have done a great job and we are going to \nreward you for it.'' That is why we are talking about the importance of \nmerit pay.\n  But if we are going to have merit pay, we also need to recognize \nthose teachers who are not doing a good job. We need a way to determine \nthat, other than whether a principal likes an individual or does not \nlike an individual, or\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\na school board does not like an individual. We ought to say there ought \nto be competence testing. Part of this plan, known as BOOKS, calls for \ncompetency testing and for merit pay.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to point out that in the State of \nFlorida, 70 percent of the community college freshmen require remedial \neducation. We have to change that. The cost to the State of Florida is \n$50 billion a year to handle this problem. Let's improve our K-12 \neducation system.\n  With that, I yield the floor and again thank the Senator from Georgia \nfor tackling this initiative. I look forward to working with you on \nthis important issue.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I commend the Senator from Florida. It is an \nabsolutely fascinating story. There are many of these around the \ncountry.\n  Just to make a point, of late when you read the statistics of 4 in 10 \nare all that can pass in urban city schools' basic standards tests, 3 \nin 10, 4 in 10 go to college, as you have noted, and have to go back \nand learn these skills again. We are beginning to hear an echo that \nthese students were not educable, that there was something wrong \nsomeplace else, something wrong at home, something wrong with society.\n  What kind of community was this? What was the surrounding like around \nthis school? Was this a very wealthy suburb?\n  Mr. MACK. No. As I indicated, it was in the riot area in Los Angeles.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Would you surmise that those students could not have \npossibly all come from very stable, two-parent families that you might \nfind in some communities?\n  Mr. MACK. I could suspect you could draw the conclusion they were \nsomewhat different than, say, what most people think of as the \ntraditional family in America. But I would be careful about drawing too \nmany conclusions on that because I think there are some things about \nwhat was going on in this school that also sends a message to moms and \ndads.\n  I think that one of the reasons for success was because mom and dad \nwere involved. They made the determination. I mean, this was a private \nschool, so they have to pay to go to that private school--some of them \nat great sacrifice. Some of them, frankly, from outside the community.\n  But the point there is, if you go back to the charter school, for \nexample, one of the things that most charter schools require, as you \nknow, is that they want parent involvement. In fact, when I was at the \nschool in Liberty City, in Miami, mom and dad parents came into the \nclassroom, as I was talking with the teacher, to discuss with him the \nproblems of their student. What was the problem? Or what should they be \ndoing more at home to help?\n  Again, I think one of the messages that we do get is that in the \ncharter schools--I guess there are others who are much more \nknowledgeable at these things than I am, but because it is a very \nfocused school, it understands the importance of mom and dad being \nengaged. The teacher understands the importance of moms and dads being \nengaged, and, clearly, the parents understand if they are going to be \nable to keep their children in this charter school, they have to be \npart of it.\n  Again, I would make the case, whether it be a mother and a dad or \nsingle mom or single father, that if you can engage them in the \neducation process, regardless of that background, in probably 9 out of \n10 cases--I am just saying this from my feeling; I do not have the \nstatistics--but 9 out of 10 times, if you, the parent, one or both, are \nengaged in your children's education, you are going to improve the \nability of your child to learn. And, again, I think you are going to \nfind that you are going to create that environment, something different \nthan we are doing today.\n  There is just so much we can learn from this experience. Again, the \nanswer that kept coming back, ``It is the teacher. It is the teacher. \nIt is the teacher.'' I think people ought to recognize that what \nRepublicans are saying is we value teachers. They are the ones who \nreally make a difference.\n  Again, if my grandsons are going to succeed, they need to be exposed \nto good teachers. We have to help create an environment in which \npeople, (a) want to come into the teaching profession and, (b) once \nthey are there, want to remain and experience the excitement of seeing \nyoung children learn. Teachers help children realize how important \nknowledge is to them and their future. Again, teachers are the ones who \nreally make a difference.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator makes an excellent point. Who does not \nremember the teacher that affected them? There is no one that does not \nremember that teacher.\n  Mr. MACK. I can name my first-grade teacher.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator for the presentation.\n  I turn to our distinguished colleague from Wyoming, Senator Thomas, \nand yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I appreciate the Senator from Georgia arranging for an \nopportunity to talk about our agenda. After all we have just returned \nnow from recess, just returned from a time to talk with our \nconstituents. I spent all this time in Wyoming doing a number of town \nmeetings, talking to people about various things they are interested \nin.\n  It is time for us, of course to talk about agendas, to talk about \npriorities, to talk about what it is that we intend to do during what \nis already a relatively short work year, during an election year. The \nthing, of course, that is on our minds today, I suppose, is the \nPresident's State of the Union Address last evening in which he laid \nout his agenda, not a surprise agenda, and talked about the issues he \nhas been talking about now for several weeks, with a new proposal each \nweek, all put together in a State of the Union Message which had, I \nthink, about 30 different proposals of things to do.\n\n  It seems to me that what we have to do now as a responsible Congress \nis to decide on those items that we think are priorities to this \ncountry, that we think are priorities for success in families in this \ncountry, economically, from a freedom standpoint, how-to-govern \nstandpoint, and really press for those. I must say that I feel rather \nstrongly about that.\n  I felt last evening that--the President, of course, is certainly free \nto have his own agenda--that was an agenda that had been put together \nby pollsters, an agenda that had been put together to enumerate all \nthose things that would sound good to everyone that was listening, an \nagenda that I think, clearly, again the President is perfectly free to \nmove his position, move his position back toward the more liberal \nDemocrat Party from which he has departed in the last several years \nsomewhat to establish more support for Al Gore when the time comes. I \nthink that is legitimate. I don't happen to agree with that.\n  I think we ought to be moving forward to continue to do the things \nthat we have begun to do over the last several years, some of the \nthings that I am particularly proud of, frankly, that this Congress has \nbeen able to do, to bring forth a balanced budget. That, after all, is \nthe responsibility of the Congress. We have done that. We need to \ncontinue to do that. We need to continue to try and control spending so \nthat we can move toward this idea of a balanced budget and beyond, to \nbegin to work on the debt that is there, to begin to do something about \nthat $280 billion we spend on interest every year to service a $5.5 \ntrillion debt. That, it seems to me, ought to be the real focus of what \nwe do.\n  Our responsibility now, I believe, in the Congress is--we shall meet \non Friday, our friends across the aisle will meet I am sure next week--\nto come to grips with those kind of things we think are the priorities \nfor our agenda. I don't think our agenda can be a laundry list of 30 or \n40 things that appeal to the polls but rather ought to be the kinds of \nthings that are terribly important to us.\n  I think we ought to talk about ISTEA, for example. We ought to get \nout into the country to do the highway maintenance, the highway \nbuilding. We didn't get that done last time because we got diverted \ntalking about something else. ISTEA needs to be there. I think we need \nto continue to work on the budget. There is probably nothing more \nimportant than being responsible in the spending that we do. Again, I \nam\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\npleased with what has happened with the budget over time. I am pleased \nfor what has happened in the last couple of years on welfare reform. \nThe Congress has moved forward, with the cooperation of the President, \nafter a couple of vetoes. That is OK. But we need to continue to do \nthat, to provide the opportunity to help people move off of welfare \ninto work, which is what most people want to do, of course. We have \nmade some progress in moving away some from the entitlement program \nthat we have had. We have made some progress in terms of moving \nGovernment closer to people, where Government is more responsive at the \nState level, and do those things at the State level that we should do \nthere.\n  As I listened last night to the enumeration of things that might be \ndone it seemed to me at least one of the considerations that has to be \nmade is where do you do these things most efficiently? Child care--\neverybody is for having quality child care. Everybody wants to \nstrengthen the child care program. The question first we ought to ask \nis, where is that best done? What is the role of the Federal Government \nin child care? What is the role of the State government in these kinds \nof things?\n  I happened to have the privilege last night of having my Governor \naccompany me to the State of the Union Message. I could sense as we \nwent through last night's State of the Union Message him saying to \nhimself, ``We can do that better at the State level. We can really make \nthose things work.'' I agree with that.\n  There are a number of other things that I personally would like to \nsee us move forward on. One of my personal areas of interest is the \nnational parks. National parks are a national treasure for all of us. \nMore and more people go to visit national parks. More and more people \nare interested. Yet we have less resources for national parks than we \nneed. National parks, some claim, are as much as $8 billion in arrears \non infrastructure. We need to work at that. That happens to be \nsomething that I am most interested in.\n  I think most of all we need to be sure that we are responsible, \nfinally. Spending continues to go up. If we are going to balance the \nbudget--why balance the budget? Because revenues have gone up. I think \nthe President's proposal goes far beyond what is going to be available \nfor dollars. The President says we want to keep a balanced budget and \nthen lists 30 items that will cost billions of dollars plus additional \ntax deductions there that will reduce revenue. So we find ourselves I \nam sure with spending far beyond our income if we do those things.\n\n  Those, I believe, have to be the constraints. That is what I heard \nfrom my people. That is what I heard from the people of Wyoming. They \nsaid, look, stay with that business of balancing the budget. We not \nonly want to balance the budget, we would like to see you begin to \nreduce spending. This idea of the era of large Government being over is \na good idea.\n  I was disappointed the President had done a complete reversal from 2 \nyears ago when he announced that would be his objective. This certainly \nwas not an effort to reduce and to change the era of big Government.\n  Spending continues to go up, 16 percent last year, 24 percent on \nentitlements. Over a period of time, entitlements continue to grow. \nMany of these programs that we talked about inevitably will become \nentitlements. These young people that are here on the floor as pages \nwon't see those benefits because they will not be sustained if we \ncontinue to grow at 24 percent a year.\n  Madam President, I think we have a real opportunity. As I said, I \nenjoyed the President's State of the Union Message. That is his agenda. \nNow it is our responsibility to have an agenda and to put our \npriorities there, put our philosophy there, our philosophy of a \nresponsible Government, our philosophy of a financially accountable \nGovernment, one in which we limit size and move as close as we can to \npeople to solve people's problems.\n  The educational program that Senator Coverdell has recommended is one \nthat puts the responsibility in the hands of local people, parents. \nThat is what we need to do. Those are the kinds of things we can do \nhere to assist in those problems. So I am excited about this year. I \nthink we have an opportunity to do a great deal. I am very proud of \nhaving been in this Senate since 1994. I think we have made some real \nchanges in direction. It is my hope and my desire to help ensure that \nwe continue to move in the direction of a more responsible Government, \nresponsive to the folks that we represent, the folks I have had a \nchance to visit with for 2 months and have come back with some renewed \ndedication to the idea that this Congress, this Government, is \nresponsible to the people, to the taxpayers, responsible for protecting \nliberty, responsible for being financially responsible, responsible for \nreducing taxes as much as we can, to leave the money to the people it \nbelongs to. I am excited about the opportunity.\n  So my friend, Mr. Coverdell, I appreciate very much what you are \ndoing in this time to talk. I think we should continue to talk about \nour agenda and talk about the reasons we are doing what we are doing. I \nlook forward to that happening this year.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As always, Madam President, I enjoyed the remarks of \nthe distinguished Senator from Wyoming. He brings that clear Western \nthinking to the Senate.\n  If I might add a thought, it is a little hard to believe, but this \nCongress passed the first balanced budget in the 104th Congress. That \nwas vetoed by the President. We did it again. So we passed two. The \nPresident signed it. It is the first one in 30 years. In 30 years \nWashington has never developed the will to balance its budget. It \npassed the first tax relief in the last Congress. That was vetoed. A \nmodified tax relief was passed last year. That was signed. That is the \nfirst tax relief in 16 years.\n  Now, I don't know what the situation is in Wyoming but that tax \nrelief proposal leaves $750 million every year in Georgia checking \naccounts of working families, businesses, people sending kids to school \nand college, trying to make ends meet. It left $750 million in those \naccounts. It was not a particularly large tax reduction. But it means a \nlot. It puts about 2,000 additional dollars in the checking account of \nan average family.\n  Now, the point I am making is this, and I would like to get the \nSenator's comment, don't you find it interesting that once the United \nStates balanced its budget, once it has become more engaged in managing \nits financial affairs, how much more optimistic the people are, how \nmany more of them of working, how interest rates have stayed somewhat \ndown, and how we are talking about surpluses for the first time? Pretty \nremarkable, very remarkable. It ought to be a lesson to every Congress \nand every President. This is a good idea. We better keep doing it.\n  Mr. THOMAS. If I might, I certainly agree with the Senator. It isn't \nthat difficult.\n  In other words, this is what our system is all about. Our system of \nprivate enterprise, our system of limited Government, our system of \nallowing as much money as possible to stay in the hands of the citizens \nso they can invest it and create jobs, that is what our system is all \nabout. Through the years it has been tested against socialism and big \ngovernment and the government doing all these things, and throughout \nthe world this system is the success. It is being copied everywhere. \nSometimes it is scary when we see ourselves moving away from our own \nsystem that has been so successful, that everybody else has adopted.\n  So the Senator is exactly right. That certainly is what creates this \nkind of an economic environment is the ability to take the risk, to \ninvest, to work, to earn, to keep and to do things for yourself and \nyour family.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of the \nSenator from Wyoming. I see we have been joined by the distinguished \nSenator from New York. I welcome his presentation and yield up to 10 \nminutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia for his leadership on this most important issue. I believe that \neducation is the most important issue facing our country.\n  We have focused a majority of our attention on the need to give \nassistance to those of our students who are college bound, and that is \nimportant. We have done, I think, a good job in expanding, for example, \nthe Pell grants\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\nto take in nearly 300,000 students, and I voted for that. We have \nincreased the amounts of those grants substantially, from about $2,400 \nto $3,000 and I support that. And we worked to create educational \nsavings accounts, and I think that is important, Madam President.\n  But I think it is time that we look at our elementary schools and our \nhigh schools, because one in five third-graders across New York State \ncould not read with comprehension even the easiest connected sentences \nand paragraphs, according to the New York State Department of \nEducation. We have heard that 40 percent of the children in some of our \nschool districts are reading below grade level and are below grade \nlevel in math. 50 percent-plus of the students in some of our school \ndistricts are dropping out of school, including here in the Nation's \nCapital. What is going to happen to those children who are dropping \nout? How can they compete? What jobs are they going to hold? What will \nhappen to society if this continues?\n  Let me say that last night the President talked about a number of \nissues. One of those issues he talked about was the need to hire more \nteachers. Let me tell you that I believe we need more teachers in the \nclassrooms. We should empower, by way of making moneys available, the \nlocal districts to do exactly that. I am going to work with whoever it \nis--the President, this administration, my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle--to do exactly that.\n  The President also called for greater accountability in education, \nand I believe that's important. He said students must be more \naccountable for their performance, that we should not have social \npromotion. That is true. Unfortunately, we didn't hear one word about \nmaking teachers accountable also. One of the things that this bill, the \nB.O.O.K.S. Act, does is make available funds for accountability. You \ncan't have our kids learning if the people teaching them do not meet \nperformance standards. We must have competency testing so that we know \nmath teachers do understand basic math and that they can teach it. We \nhave to have some system of evaluating, and we should give the school \ndistricts that ability. It is not that we should say what test they \nshould give, but we should empower the local districts and the parents \nto have a choice.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Most of our teachers, I believe, Mr. President, do a \ngreat job and are dedicated and hard-working. Unfortunately, there is \nno financial reward for those great teachers. I think we need merit \npay. That is one of the things that we encourage in this legislation, \nwhich offers better opportunities for our kids.\n  We need major reform, not just tinkering at the edges of the problem.\n  Let me touch on that which, in many cases, brings about a hue and cry \nnot from the parents, but from those who want to protect the status \nquo, the teachers' union.\n  By perpetuating the status quo, too many of our children are falling \nby the wayside--they are not making it. I am talking about a system \nthat many of my colleagues quake when we bring the issue up, and that \nis called accountability and seeing to it that teachers don't have \nlifetime tenure. I think our kids are entitled to have teachers who \nmake a difference just like the teachers I had in grade school who \ncreated magic in the classroom.\n\n  Those teachers exist today. Let's understand that. I think the vast \nmajority of our public school teachers are dedicated, work hard, do a \ngood job, and they should be rewarded with merit pay.\n  But, by gosh, let's not be afraid to say there should be \naccountability as well with teacher competency tests and ending a \nsystem where teachers, in essence, in too many of our schools and too \nmany of our States, have what is likened to lifetime tenure. After 3 \nyears, it becomes virtually impossible to remove those who are not \ndoing the job. I will give you an example from New York State. Last \nyear, only seven out of 200,000 teachers were removed. Seven. It has \nbecome virtually impossible. And it costs hundreds of thousands of \ndollars to bring this type of action.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am not suggesting that we jeopardize those good \nteachers who are doing the job or that we create some arbitrary \nstandards. I am suggesting that we have some review, some system to \nevaluate performance so that nobody has what is, in essence, lifetime \ntenure regardless of the job the person is doing.\n  The education of our children is too important. Those who teach our \nchildren must be competent in these subjects, that is why we need \ncompetency testing for all teachers. Our children deserve nothing less.\n  Let me point to just one other area before I conclude my remarks, and \nthat is school safety. My gosh, if we have children in our public \nschools that say it is dangerous and they feel safer in their \nneighborhoods than going from one class to another, what more do we \nneed? If we don't have schools as a safe haven, creating the \nenvironment where our children can learn in that safe haven, that oasis \nof learning, then how can the best teacher do the job? So we have to be \nable to fast-track violent, disruptive students out of the school. You \ncannot suggest that public education has ever said that even violent, \ndisruptive juveniles have a right to stay in school no matter what \ntheir conduct. That is unfortunately the case in too many areas. I will \ntell you that the 1,116 schools in New York City reported 22,000 \nincidents in 1996-97, including nearly 5,000 person-related incidents. \nIt becomes impossible to have serious learning in the classroom.\n  Last but not least, let me just touch on one aspect that I think is \nso important. Why should we have a plethora of Federal programs that \nserve cross-purposes, when we can take that money and establish \neducation block grants. Somehow bureaucrats have planted in the minds \nof many of our parents and local officials that they are going to lose \nmoney.\n  What we call for in this bill is saying that we are going to give you \nthe same amount of money, and, in fact, we will actually give you more \nmoney. In title II of the BOOKS Act, States would receive funds through \nblock grants, which can be used for educational needs that the local \ncommunities and school boards think are important--not that Washington \nmandates. So they are going to get more money. In addition, they are \ngoing to get a lot more money because 95 percent of those funds must \nreach the local schools in the classrooms and cannot be used for \nadministrative expenses. We cannot have 15 to as high as 25 and 30 \npercent of the money being used for administrative overhead. The money \nis not reaching the kids.\n  I might give one example. Senator Gorton's amendment along these \nlines last year would have sent an additional $670 million to local \nschool districts. But we have the bureaucrats in Washington who are \nopposed to that. They want to keep these ties. That is an employment \ncenter as opposed to becoming an educational opportunity. So $670 \nmillion more could go to the school districts. And by the way, that \nhires 26,000 teachers. So when our President says, ``we want to hire \n100,000,'' here is a way. If we were to adopt the block grant proposal, \nand some amendments to it, we could hire as many as 26,000 teachers at \nthe local districts without raising one additional penny. My gosh, \nthat's over a quarter of the number that the President talked about, \nwith no increase in taxes. It just means using the resources we have \nand empowering our parents and the local school districts to make these \nchoices.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Coverdell, Senator Lott, and \nthe occupant of the Chair, Senator Coats, for being leaders in this \narea. We have to do better for our children, not just tinkering at the \nedges.\n  By the way, why should we be afraid of the teachers' unions? We \nshould encourage them to work with us. It should not be a battle \nagainst them. Notwithstanding that I have been critical of their status \nquo position and their opposition to basic, good, fundamental reform, \nthis should be a fight for our children, to give our kids a better \neducation. I would hope that the Members and all of the teachers would \njoin and be in favor of this and work together. We can do better and we \nmust do better because our children are entitled to that.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank you for your leadership. I thank Senator \nCoverdell and my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I certainly echo the compliments of the \nSenator from New York to the Chair\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nbecause, clearly, throughout your career you have been dedicated to \nthis kind of work. It was appropriate to mention that. We appreciate \nthe remarks of the Senator from New York. They are very much on target.\n  We have been joined by our distinguished colleague from Colorado. I \nyield up to 7 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized to \nspeak for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nyielding me a few moments. One of the strengths of the Republican \nParty, and one of the reasons I am so proud of the leadership is that \nthey have encouraged us to go back to our States and talk with the \ncitizens in our States and really find out what the problems are. As we \nare putting together our agenda here for this session, I really feel \nlike this is a grassroots message. It has come from within the States. \nIt has come from our friends and our neighbors and our local elected \nofficials, the people who have to work with the Federal Government on a \ndaily basis. I have gone back to my State and held a lot of town \nmeetings. This particular year, I decided to hold a lot of town \nmeetings in January. I held 40 town meetings in January. The message \nthat came loud and clear to me is the main thing on people's minds is \nthat there is a growing Federal Government that is continuing to \ninterfere in their daily lives. Somehow or other, they feel they are \nlosing control. Local officials in Colorado feel like they are losing \ncontrol. Small business people feel like they are losing control and \nare getting too many dictates from Washington.\n  Another thing that has come up in all of my town meetings has been \nthe Tax Code. People are concerned about the tax burden that they have \nto bear today, particularly from the Federal Government. People want \nour tax system reformed. They certainly would like to have lower taxes, \nand they want a simpler and a less intrusive means of collecting those \ntaxes. It strikes me that the two issues of taxes and the growth of \nGovernment tend to intertwine with one another. Those two issues, I \nthink, are simply pulled together with this statement: Where the money \ngoes is where the power goes. So people stand up, and say, ``Well, \nthere is too much power in Washington.'' Then they complain the next \nminute that my request for funds from some program in Washington comes \nwith mandates and strings attached and they begin to realize that there \nis power related to where that money goes. I think they think that the \nFederal Government is entirely too powerful. It does claim a huge \nportion of our economy each year.\n\n  Let me review just a few numbers to make the case for tax reduction \nand tax reform which is going to be an important part of our agenda. \nThe tax burden has been steadily rising since 1992. In 1992, the \nFederal Government claimed 19 percent of the economy. By the end of \n1997 this has risen to around 21.4 percent. Remember, this is just the \nFederal Government. It is not State taxes. It is not local taxes. And \nif we include all of the State and local taxes and Federal taxes, of \ncourse, it is much, much larger. We are just talking about the Federal \nGovernment's share.\n  The government at all levels now claims about one-third of the wealth \nproduced each year in our economy--one-third. I think that is really a \nhigh number--certainly much more than any of our forefathers ever \ndreamed as far as the role of the Federal Government in our national \neconomy.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, State, Federal, and local taxes will \nclaim 38 percent of the median two-income family--38 percent. By \ncomparison, in 1965, the burden was 28 percent. It has gone up 10 \npercent. The tax burden amounts to no more than a typical family will \nspend on housing, food, and clothing combined.\n  Mr. President, if we really want to help families with child care \nexpenses, education expenses, health expenses, or housing expenses, we \nshould reduce the tax burden. They have more money in their pocket. It \ngives them additional flexibility to spend it how they feel they should \ninstead of sending it to Washington and then coming down with those \nmandates.\n  There is much talk in Washington about the budget balancing and the \nforecast of some excess revenues which are referred to as a \n``surplus.'' I certainly hope that this happens.\n  When I was first elected to the United States House of \nRepresentatives, I remember our deficits were running around $340 \nbillion a year. That is how much more they were spending a year than \nthey were bringing in that same year. Now they are projecting--the \nCongressional Budget Office--somewhere around $5 billion. That is quite \na change.\n  So I certainly hope that happens. Maybe we can do something here in \nthe Senate to move that along by saying let's look at our budget that \nwe passed last year. Maybe we can do something this year to cut back \nthe $5 billion in spending and actually balance the budget and make \nsure that it happens.\n  But I think we need to be honest about why the budget numbers look so \ngood. The budget is balancing not because of any tough decisions that \nwe made here in the Congress. But it is balancing because of hard-\nworking Americans out there that are being productive. And the reason \nthat they are being productive, I think, is because they really believe \nthat we are committed to balancing the budget. It holds down costs \nbecause interest rates are going down. And when they go to buy a car, \nor house, or when they are in business for themselves, this means they \ncan invest more in themselves than the community. That is certainly \npart of it. Another part of it is because I think they believe that \nRepublicans are going to--and they did last session--work for reducing \nthe tax burden so they will have more of that for spending.\n  So the economic performance in the past year and why it has really \ndone so well is because of action here, I think, in the Republican \nCongress.\n  The American people have been sending greater and greater amounts of \ntheir money to Washington. There is no doubt about it. With the budget \nbalancing that we are going to be facing this year, I think we all \npretty much agree that it is because of increased tax receipts coming \nin and not because of restraint in spending or the fact that the budget \ncontinues to grow. I think we have to keep that in mind.\n  Federal spending in 1998 is estimated to be around 4.3 percent over \nour 1997 spending level. It is well in excess of inflation which is a \nlittle bit over 2 percent.\n  So I hope that we will keep in mind that we need to make decisions \nthat move the power from Washington back to the local level, and move \nit back to the pocketbooks of people who are in business for themselves \nand are making decisions on behalf of their families.\n  So we are going to reduce the role of the Federal Government by \ncutting taxes. And I am here to say that we need to get on with it. And \nthe sooner we show the American people that we are really serious about \ncutting taxes I think the better our growth is going to be in this \neconomy and the more we can count on to sustain the economy so it is \neasier for us to balance the budget and move forward with our daily \nlives.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding me time to comment on \ntaxes and our economy and how my constituents feel about reducing the \nbudget within their daily lives.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for \nhis very generous remarks, and I enjoyed his presentation here this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our time be elongated by \n5 minutes. We have cleared this with the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we have been joined by the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas. I yield up to 7 minutes to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized to speak \nfor up to 7 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for letting us talk about this \nimportant issue, because I think we are getting to the crux of what \nCongress wants to do. I am glad to be able to address this issue today \nafter the President's State of the Union Message because I was somewhat \nconcerned that in his State of the Union message. The President\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\nseemed to throw aside any hope for tax cuts. That is a very important \nagenda that I have, and I think most Members of Congress have because \nwe believe that hard-working American families should be able to keep \nmore of the money they earn, not less.\n  I want to outline what I think is the right approach, if we do in \nfact start seeing budget surpluses. I want to put forward the \nproposition that ``half and half'' is more than just a high-quality \nmilk product. In fact, half and half is the right formula for the \nresponsible spending of the surplus that we hope to see in our budget \nover the next 10 years. Half should go for paying down the debt. If we \nare going to be the responsible stewards of this country for our future \ngeneration, we must start whittling away the $5 trillion debt. We have \nworked hard in a bipartisan way in Congress and with the President to \ncome to a balanced budget. We have done the hard work. To now fritter \nit away with new ideas for spending our hard-earned taxpayer dollars is \nthe wrong thing to do at this time.\n  So I think one-half should go towards paying down debt, so that we \ncan say to our children we are going to give you at least as good a \nsolid base as we had when we were growing up in this great country. The \nother half should go for direct tax cuts for the people who have earned \nthis money.\n  When I hear people on this floor talking about tax cuts, you can \nreally tell the difference in the way they frame the question. The \nquestion asked by people who do not want tax cuts is ``Well, now if we \ngive these tax cuts, what is it going to cost the federal government?'' \nThat is the wrong question. It is not the government's money, it is the \nmoney of hard-working taxpayers. A tax cut lets them keep more of the \nmoney they earn. It is not robbing it from the Federal Government. It \nis letting the people who earn it keep it.\n  So half and half I think is the right formula.\n  I will be introducing legislation very quickly that would provide tax \ncuts, and it would do it in a descending order of priority so that we \nwould never go over one-half of the budget surplus of that year.\n  Here is what my tax bill would do. It would first eliminate the \nmarriage tax penalty. People in our country should not have to choose \nbetween love and money. We value marriage. And the people who get hurt \nthe most are the middle-income. The policeman who marries the school \nteacher will pay over $1,000 in taxes in a marriage tax penalty just \nbecause they got married. That is wrong, and I want to eliminate it.\n  No. 2, I want to raise the level of income that people would start \npaying taxes at 15 percent and 28 percent. This helps the people who \nare paying the most. I want to raise that 15-percent tax on a single \nperson which, in 1998 will kick in at $25,350. I want to raise that to \n$35,000 so that you would not go into that 15-percent bracket until you \nare single and earning $35,000. If you are married, it would be \n$50,000, up from $42,350. If you are the head of a household, it would \nbe $40,000, up from $33,950. The 28-percent bracket, the next bracket, \nwould start at $71,000 for a single person, up from $61,109, $109,950, \nfor a couple, up from $102,000, and for a head of household, $93,000, \nup from $87,000.\n\n  This just raises the point at which people would have to pay higher \nrates. It gives a break to those who are paying the biggest share, and \nthat is the lower- and middle-income people of our country.\n  No. 3, the bill will repeal the 18-month capital gains holding period \nand make it 12 months. I think 12 months is ample time for a capital \ngains tax to set in. And keep in mind that capital gains are more \ndisproportionately paid by our elderly citizens.\n  No. 4, in my proposal, I will index capital gains for inflation. This \nwill be a tremendous help to elderly people because most of their \nincome is investment income rather than earned income. We are indexing \nthe personal exemption on earned income. Why not do it for those who \nare earning it through investment, as elderly people are?\n  Finally, my bill will cut the top estate tax rate from 55 percent, to \n28 percent. I don't like the estate tax at all because I think the \nAmerican dream for over 200 years has been that you could come to this \ncountry, you could work harder, and you could give your children a \nbetter chance than you had. So I do not want the estate tax at all. But \nif we are going to have one, I think it should be lower so that people \nwill be able to give their children a little bit better start than they \nhad.\n  This is a balanced tax-cut plan. It is not the only one that is good. \nI have heard many versions of tax-cut plans being put forward by my \ncolleagues that I could easily support. But, I think the important \npoint here is that most Americans, the average American family, pay \n38.2 percent of their income in taxes. Mr. President, that is too much. \nAnd we want to change it, and it is a priority for this Congress.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for letting us focus on this very \nimportant issue for strengthening the American family by letting them \nkeep more of the money they work hard to earn.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \nexcellent remarks and her dedication to leaving money in the checking \naccounts of people who earn it.\n  Let me just say in closing, because I know we are going to the other \nside, that to me American liberty and freedom rests on three principal \nstanchions: Economic liberty, which means workers can keep the fruits \nof their labors and make decisions about their lives and fulfill their \nresponsibilities. We have been talking about that here today making \nsure we leave resources with American workers and families so that they \ncan do the job and always be dependent upon them to do so in America.\n  No. 2, for freedom to exist people have to be safe. They have to be \nsecure at work and at home and in their school. We talked about making \nthem safer today.\n  Last, but certainly not least, an uneducated mind cannot enjoy the \nbenefits of American citizenship. An uneducated mind is denied American \nliberty. The first major denial occurs, as Senator D'Amato from New \nYork said, when they are denied economic liberty because they cannot \nget a job and they cannot connect with the vast opportunity in society.\n  So America has to get about the task of assuring that all her \nchildren and her population have the fundamentals to be free and to \nenjoy American freedom. And that is what we have been talking about \ntoday. We want America to be educated so that she will remain free.\n  We want workers to be able to benefit from their work so that they \ncan do the job of raising their families and fulfilling their \nresponsibilities as American citizens. And we know they have to be safe \nbecause no commerce, no civil interaction can occur in a society that \nis violence-ridden. And that is what we have been talking about all \nafternoon.\n  If you keep America educated, you give her citizens economic \nviability and options; protect them at home and in the workplace and \nschool, America will be just fine. Our people will take this country \nand build a new American century.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Robb pertaining to the introduction of S. 1582 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ROBB. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota for yielding me time that was \nto be his, and which I would ask unanimous consent not be charged \nagainst the 90 minutes that are allocated to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that 90 minutes \nhave been reserved in a block of time for the Democratic Leader or his \ndesignee. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S90-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S99-S109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          THE AGENDA FOR 1998\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleagues and I intend to come here to \nthe floor today to discuss the agenda and what we see ahead of us in \nthis congressional session, the second session of this Congress.\n  My expectation is that we will find ourselves this year, just as we \nhave in previous years, debating a range of controversial, interesting, \nand in some cases very provocative issues. We will agree on some of \nthese issues on a bipartisan basis. There may well be aggressive \ndebates about other issues. That is the way the democratic system \nworks. That is the way it should work.\n  Where we can reach across the aisle and achieve agreement and do the \nright thing for this country in a harmonious way, good for us. That's \nwhat the American people expect us to do. However, when there are \npolicy issues that are very, very controversial, the people expect us \nto have a vigorous debate, and we will do that.\n  Most of us head home on weekends or during time when the Senate is \nnot in session. I expect other Senators had the same experience I did \nduring this most recent recess. Constituents say to you, ``Well, what \nare you doing down there in Washington? What's going on in Washington? \nWhat's happening in the Senate?'' It's a question that everyone asks, \nno matter where you meet them.\n  What is happening in the U.S. Senate, and what is happening down here \nin Washington with respect to legislative duties, is whatever we decide \nto have happen here on the floor. By virtue of what we schedule for the \nbusiness of the Senate, we decide what parts of the people's business \nwe will address this year.\n  I want to talk just for a moment about what I think the business of \nthe Senate ought to be in the coming months.\n  First and foremost, we ought to take up the legislation that \nreauthorizes the highway program. That bill was supposed to have been \npassed last year. It wasn't passed; it was extended for 6 months. And \nthe majority leader, quite appropriately, told us that it will be near \nthe first order of business when Congress returns.\n  We must take that legislation up and pass it so that the folks around \nthis country who have to plan to maintain our roads and bridges can \nmake those plans. It is our responsibility to pass that bill--not \nlater, but sooner, and I urge that the majority leader bring that \nlegislation to the floor and do it soon.\n  Some in the Chamber counsel, ``Well, let's wait until the budget is \npassed.'' No, this is the legislation that was supposed to be passed \nlast year. Let's not wait any longer. Let's bring it to the floor as \nthe first order of business and pass a highway bill. It is also a bill \nthat deals with jobs and opportunity and economic growth in every State \nin this country. We have a responsibility, in my judgment, to bring it \nto the floor and to move it.\n  Second, I hope in the next days we will pass a piece of legislation \nthat the House of Representatives approved last year by an overwhelming \nvote. This bill deals with the Internal Revenue Service. It would \nchange how the IRS does its business. It would make significant, \nimportant changes in the relationship between the Internal Revenue \nService and the American taxpayer. The Senate should pass that bill \nquickly. It ought to be this week or next week. That ought to be at the \nfront end of the business of this Senate.\n  Last night President Clinton came to Capitol Hill and in his State of \nthe Union Address talked about the agenda that he thinks Congress ought \nto consider. At least one of the items of that agenda, which I expect \nwill be controversial but really should not be, is the issue of managed \ncare. I want to describe why this is so important.\n\n  President Clinton last night talked about the number of Americans who \nare now in managed care plans. Well over 100 million Americans are now \nin these plans. All of us have heard the stories about what managed \ncare means to our families.\n  Peter Van Etten of Stanford Health Services, in Time magazine, said \nthis on April 14: ``In the insanity of economics in health care, the \npatient always loses.''\n  President Clinton last night said there ought to be a patient's bill \nof rights. Let me give some real-life examples that will demonstrate \nthe importance of this issue.\n  In California, an employee who suffered from hemophilia was unable to \nfind out whether the new insurance plan offered by his employer would \ncover his blood-clotting concentrates unless he first joined the plan. \nIn other words, they said you either decide to join or not to join, and \nwe won't tell you whether this covers you as a hemophiliac. What kind \nof health care plan is that?\n  A large California HMO denied a referral of an 8-year-old girl \nsuffering from a rare cancer called Wilms' tumor. According to the \nNational Cancer Institutes' protocol for this type of cancer, the girl \nshould have been referred to a Wilms' tumor multi-disciplinary team. \nBut the HMO covering this girl demanded the surgery she required be \nperformed by a urologist who did not specialize in pediatrics and who \nnever before performed this surgery. Even though that HMO had a \nrelationship with a local teaching hospital, which, in fact, did have a \nWilms' tumor team, the family was told they would have to go out of the \nplan and that even the girl's hospital stay would not be covered by the \nHMO. This, by the way, ended up in court. The HMO was fined a half a \nmillion dollars by the California Department of Corporations.\n  A Time magazine cover story titled ``What Your Doctor Can't Tell \nYou'' featured a young mother of two, battling with her managed care \ninsurer for coverage of expensive treatments for breast cancer that had \nalready spread to other parts of her body. She died before the article \nwas published, so the fight was over. But she made her point.\n  In New Jersey, a young woman took a terrible fall from a horse. \nAccording to a New York Times newspaper article, she was suffering from \nswelling of the brain, and was being taken by ambulance to the nearest \nhospital. In the ambulance, as her brain was swelling from this injury, \nshe said she didn't want to go to the nearest hospital because it was a \nfacility concerned with the bottom line. She didn't want to go to an \nemergency room where she felt her health care would be a function of \nprofit and loss statements. She told the ambulance crew to take her to \na hospital that was farther away, where she was not worried about the \nkind of care she would get, and where her health was not going to \ndepend on someone's profits and losses.\n  A Missouri managed care plan sent all of its customers a letter that \nsaid a trip to the emergency room with a broken leg, or a baby running \na high fever, should not generally be assumed to be covered by the \nmanaged care plan. The letter read like this: ``An emergency room visit \nfor medical treatment is not automatically covered under your benefit \nplan.''\n  Mr. President, over 100 million Americans are in managed care plans. \nThese plans can, in fact, save money. In some cases they can improve \ncare. But they can also set up circumstances where decisions about \nhealth care are made not by a doctor, but by an accountant in an office \n400 miles away, who decides what procedures are covered. I have had \ndoctors tell me that this isn't serving patients' interests. And \npatients are very concerned about the quality of their health care in \nthis circumstance.\n  The President said let's pass a piece of legislation to give the \npatient a right to know about health care options, to ensure the \nfundamental rights of patients under these plans.\n\n  Others will talk about other parts of the agenda. But in conclusion \nlet me just talk for a moment about President Clinton's budget proposal \nlast night. He said that if our budget no longer has a deficit, we \nshould use any additional funds to put Social Security first, to save \nSocial Security first.\n  I want to describe why that is important. This is a brand new \ndocument, January 1998, put out by the Congressional Budget Office. I \nwill bet if you go to the Congressional Budget Office and you find out \nwho wrote this, those people have some fancy degrees, probably three or \nfour of them, from the best schools in the country. They probably wear \ntiny little glasses that make you look really smart. They probably work \nhard all day, have several titles. And everybody respects them \nimmensely.\n  So they write a white book and the white book says that the budget is\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\ngoing to be balanced in the year 2001. It's right here. These are smart \npeople. They published it this month.\n  Then the same people, wearing the same glasses and gray suits and \nhaving the same pride in their work, say on page 43 that in the same \nyear, 2001, when they say the budget will be balanced, the Federal debt \nwill increase by over $100 billion.\n  I didn't take higher math. I probably didn't go to the best school in \nthe world. But I ask the question, if you claim the budget is in \nbalance, why would the Federal debt be increasing? I know the answer. \nApparently these folks don't. It's because they are taking Social \nSecurity trust fund money and using it over in the operating side of \nthe budget in order to say that the budget is in balance.\n  What the President said last night was ``Save Social Security \nfirst.'' We need to save the money in those trust funds. This \naccounting system ought to be honest. These people know better than to \nput out reports like this. The Congress ought to know better that to \nthink we are running a surplus when the surplus is actually in Social \nSecurity and it's for future years. And I hope this Congress will \nexpress itself on that issue.\n  Do we decide as a Congress to save Social Security first? Or do we, \nas some suggest, spend more money quickly? Or, as others suggest, give \nmoney back, quickly, at a time when our Federal debt is still \nincreasing? I hope this Congress will heed the advice of the President \nand make the right choices.\n\n  There is plenty more to talk about in the agenda. And my colleagues \nwill do so.\n  Mr. President, we have an hour and a half. And I understand that the \nSenator from West Virginia wishes to take 15 minutes. So I yield to the \nSenator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota. And I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, on several occasions during the last session of \nCongress, I took to the Senate floor to discuss the importance of \nreauthorizing the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or \nISTEA. I shared my observation that this effort to renew our Nation's \nhighway, highway safety and transit programs would be one of the most \nimportant, if not the most important, legislative accomplishment of the \nfirst session of the 105th Congress. As all Senators are aware, the \nprovisions of ISTEA expired on September 30 of last year 1997. This \nmeant that, absent enactment of new authorization legislation, many \nimportant highway, bridge, and transit projects would grind to a halt. \nUnfortunately, the Senate did not turn to the critically important \nISTEA reauthorization bill until October 8 of last year. Between that \ndate and October 29, 1997, the Senate was unable to adopt even one \nsubstantive amendment due to the impasse over Senate consideration of \ncampaign finance reform legislation.\n  The parliamentary amendment tree was filled. And it was impossible to \nget an amendment in which I and other cosponsors of the amendment \nwanted to have brought before the Senate.\n  The Senate failed to invoke cloture four times on the ISTEA bill. In \nthe end, notwithstanding the fact that a unanimous consent agreement \nwas reached on the campaign finance issue, the 6-year ISTEA bill was \npulled from the floor. Finally, on November 10, the Senate debated and \npassed a short-term extension of our existing highway and transit \nprograms, effectively putting off completion of Senate action on our \nNation's surface transportation policy for the next 6 years until the \nsecond session of the 105th Congress.\n  Now, despite the stated intentions of the Senate leadership to take \nup the ISTEA reauthorization bill, S. 1173, during the first week of \nthe second session of this Congress, I am very concerned that the \nSenate may not return to the ISTEA reauthorization bill until after \ncompletion of the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution in late spring.\n  Mr. President, the onus is now upon us to return to the full 6-year \ntransportation authorization bill and complete our work as soon as \npossible. While I supported the enactment of the short-term extension \nbill back in November, I remind my colleagues that it was only a \nstopgap measure providing only about one-half year of funding for our \nexisting highway, highway safety, and transit programs. As of this \ndate, our State highway departments and our mass transit systems cannot \nestablish a budget for the current fiscal year because they do not know \nthe final level of Federal resources that they will receive for this \nyear. Morever, they cannot develop or implement any long-term financing \nplans because they do not know the level of Federal resources that will \nbe available to them over the next 5 years. This is an impossible \nsituation for our State highway departments. Given the cost and \nduration of major highway projects and the complexities associated with \nshort construction seasons in our cold weather States, planning and \npredictability are essential to the logical functioning of our Federal-\nAid Highway program. But that kind of rational planning is precisely \nwhat our States cannot do at this time because of our inaction. This is \nnot how our State and local transportation agencies should have to do \nbusiness. Certainly, no corporation could long survive doing business \nin this fashion. It is, nonetheless, the circumstances that we have \nplaced upon our transportation agencies, due to our failure to enact a \nmulti-year ISTEA reauthorization bill in a timely manner.\n  Members will recall that, prior to S. 1173, the ISTEA bill's being \npulled from the floor, I, along with Senator Gramm of Texas, and the \nchairman and ranking member of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, \nSenators Warner and Baucus, filed an amendment numbered 1397. Our \namendment embodies the simple premise that the 4.3 cents-per-gallon gas \ntax, which previously went to deficit reduction, but which is now being \ndeposited in the Highway Trust Fund, should be authorized to better \naddress our Nation's considerable highway needs. The amendment has two \nprincipal objectives. First, to put an authorization in place that \nallows for a substantial increase in highway spending in order to stem \nthe continuing deterioration of our National Highway System. And \nsecond, to fulfill the trust of the American people, the people out \nthere who pay these gas taxes every time they drive up to the gas pump \nbelieving that these funds will be used to maintain and improve our \nnational transportation system. That was the position of Senators \nGramm, Baucus, Warner, and myself back in October when we brought forth \nour amendment, and that is our position today.\n  Our amendment, which now has 49 co-sponsors, provides for the \nauthorization of highway spending levels over the next 5 years \nconsistent with the revenues derived from this 4.3 cents gas tax--\nroughly $31 billion over the 5 years 1999-2003.\n  By the way, we have 49 cosponsors on that amendment. But several \nother Senators have assured us that they will vote for the amendment \neven though they were not interested in cosponsoring it for one reason \nor another. They will vote for it. They will be supportive of it if it \nwill be brought up for a vote.\n  Nothing has changed since October regarding the resolve of Senators \nGramm, Warner, Baucus, and myself to see this amendment adopted. \nHowever, other things have changed since the amendment was introduced. \nWe are now well into fiscal year 1998 and the 4.3-cents gas tax is \nbeing deposited--where?--into the highway trust fund. By the end of \nthis fiscal year, more than $7 billion--with a big ``B''--$7 billion in \nadditional new revenue will be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund, \nnot one penny--not one penny--of which is authorized to be spent under \nthe committee-reported ISTEA bill. Instead, these funds will be allowed \nto sit in the highway trust fund, earning interest, and being used as \nan offset to the Federal deficit for the next 6 years. In other words, \nif we adopt the levels authorized in the committee-reported bill, as \nSenators Domenici and Chafee--both of whom I have the greatest respect \nfor--would have us do, we will have accomplished nothing--nothing at \nall--toward improving our National Highway System. Instead, we will \nhave just enacted legislation to actually prevent using this 4.3 cents \ngas tax for highways. What the committee-reported bill does, then, \nwithout the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, is ignore the \navailability of this new trust fund revenue for\n\n[[Page S101]]\n\nthe entire upcoming 6 years. Not one red cent will be authorized for \nexpenditure if we accept the committee bill, as reported. This means \nthat by the end of 2003, the highway trust fund balances will have \ngrown to roughly $72 billion! In other words, some $72 billion will be \nsitting there in the highway trust fund as government IOUs collecting \ninterest and being used to lower the Federal deficit instead of for \nhighways as we, the Members of Congress, have told the American people \nit would be. I cannot imagine a more perverse scam on the American \npeople.\n  Well, one may say, we need to balance the Federal budget and we \ncannot do it if we let these highway monies be spent. Not true. Not \ntrue, Senators.\n  The resources were available back in October to finance the levels of \nhighway spending embodied in the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment. \nAnd today, it appears that there are even more resources available to \nprovide for a healthy increase in infrastructure spending, without \nbusting the budget. When one reviews the conditions of our Nation's \nhighways and bridges and the current inadequate levels of investment--\nwhich would continue for the next 6 years under the committee-reported \nbill--one must come, as I do, to the conclusion that it would be \nirresponsible to do any less.\n  Mr. President, our national highway system is America's lifeline, not \njust for rural areas, but for all of our Nation's cities--even those \nthat make extensive use of mass transit and rail systems. Our major \nhighways carry nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate commercial traffic, \nand nearly 80 percent of intercity passenger and tourist traffic. Even \nthough our Nation has among the most extensive and efficient rail and \naviation systems in the world, eight out of every ten tons of \ninterstate cargo still travel over our highways. And eight out of every \nten of our constituents travel between States over highways. In regard \nto intrastate traffic, Americans take 91 percent of all work trips and \n87 percent of all trips in a car or truck. Like it or not, we are a \nNation on wheels.\n  Yet, despite the indispensable role our highway system plays in \nmodern American life, we have, as a Nation, been negligent--let us \nconfess it--we have been negligent in its upkeep. We have allowed the \nsystem to fall into a woeful state of disrepair while the unspent \nbalances of the Highway Trust Fund have continued to climb. According \nto the most recent report by the U.S. Department of Transportation \nregarding the conditions and performance of our National Highway \nSystem, only 39 percent of our National Highway System is rated in good \ncondition. Fully 61 percent of our Nation's highways are rated in \neither fair or poor condition. For our interstate system, which is the \ncrown jewel of our National Highway System, fully 50 percent of the \nmileage is rated in fair or poor condition. And these figures only \nworsen when we look at our other major Federal and State highways. In \nour urban areas, fully 65 percent of our non-interstate highway mileage \nis rated as being in fair or poor condition. There are literally over a \nquarter-of-a-billion miles of pavement in the United States that are in \npoor or mediocre condition, and there are almost 95,000 bridges in our \ncountry that have been deemed to be deficient. Within that total, \nroughly 44,000 bridges have been deemed to be structurally deficient, \nmeaning that they need significant maintenance, rehabilitation or \nreplacement. Many of these bridges require load posting, requiring \nheavier trucks to take longer, alternate routes. And an additional \n51,000 bridges have been deemed to be functionally deficient, meaning \nthat they do not have the lane widths, shoulder widths, or vertical \nclearances sufficient to serve the traffic demand.\n  Paradoxically, as our roads continue to deteriorate, our Nation's \ndependence on those roads continues to grow. Highway use is on the \nrise. The number of vehicle miles traveled grew by roughly 40 percent \nover the last decade to an astronomical rate of 2.3 trillion. Within \nthat total, the rate of traffic growth on our rural interstates grew by \nan even higher rate. And these levels of growth show no sign of \nabating. Since 1969, the number of trips per person taken over our \nroadways increased by more than 72 percent and the number of miles \ntraveled increased by more than 65 percent. This combination of traffic \ngrowth and deteriorating conditions has led to an unprecedented level \nof congestion, not just in our urban centers but also in our suburbs \nand rural areas. Congestion is literally choking our roadways as our \nconstituents seek to travel to work, to the shopping center, to the \nchild care center, to their houses of worship.\n  Mr. President, the traveling public is waiting for us--for us--to \ntake up and pass a comprehensive ISTEA bill that truly addresses the \nneeds of our surface transportation system. We should take up that \nlegislation at the earliest possible time. And when we do, I hope all \nof my colleagues will join Senator Gramm, Senator Baucus, Senator \nWarner and me, in supporting our amendment to re-invest in America's \nlifeline--our amendment to restore the trust of the American people in \nthe Highway Trust Fund--our amendment to authorize the spending of our \nHighway Trust Fund resources where they are so desperately needed: On \nour Nation's highways.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me thank the Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd, for a very important statement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me thank my friend for his courtesy and kindness in \nyielding this time to me, but more than that for his leadership that he \nis demonstrating on this floor. This is quite characteristic of him.\n  Let me also say that my colleague, Senator Rockefeller, likewise, is \nready to speak. I shall wait, I shall sit, and I shall listen.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my colleague from North Dakota. I secondly \nthank my colleague from West Virginia. I wish the Presiding Officer a \nhappy new year as we start off on what I think, based upon what we \nheard last night, ought to be a very optimistic and productive year. I \nthought it was really quite an extraordinary speech.\n  Even at the time there seemed to be so much in it that we could do \nthat I worried, was it too much? And I came to the conclusion, no, it \nwas all perfectly sensible--not all of it huge, some of it incremental, \nsome of it large and challenging--all of it doable, and I think that is \nour challenge.\n  I think our country ought to be very happy about the fact that we \nhave a balanced budget. It really was extraordinary, $357 billion down \nto $10 billion. We will present a balanced budget to the President for \nthe first time in 30 years. That is an extraordinary accomplishment. We \nall share in that. The Democrats probably get the lion's share of the \ncredit for the 1993 part, but the Republicans and Democrats did it \ntogether last year and, therefore, sealed what is a remarkable \naccomplishment in being fiscally prudent--and I think surprising, in a \ngood way, the American people. I think that is probably a good thing \nbecause the markets rallied by our action. The markets are now troubled \nbecause of what is happening in Asia, and our President last night held \nout challenges to us on that matter, too, very boldly and I thought \nvery correctly.\n  The point is we really have to go forward. We have, according to \nwhoever you listen to, somewhere between 70 days and 100 days in which \nto enact legislative affairs. I haven't counted it up. I don't know \nexactly how that works, but I will take their word for it. In any \nevent, there is really not much time, which means we have to reach \nacross the aisle. The Presiding Officer and I often don't agree on \nsubjects. On the other hand, we agreed on something of monumental \nimportance when it came to the adoption bill at the end of the last \nsession, and that is the way things get done around here, and that is \nthe way things ought to get done around here. Republicans can't succeed \nwithout Democrats. Democrats, obviously in the minority, cannot succeed \nwithout Republicans. Yet we often succeed and do ourselves proud here, \nand I feel very comfortable in saying that.\n  I think the President made very clear that parents want their \nchildren to have the best kind of education. He put a program on the \nline. It is not an extravagant program. It is a sensible program. On \nour side, we have been grumbling about crumbling schools for quite a \nlong time, and now I think we have a\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\nchance to do something about that. The President put forward some money \nfor that.\n  I think workers have reason to feel--workers of all ages--have good \nreason to feel good about last night because I think the President is \nvery concerned particularly about those between 55 and 65 years old who \ndon't have health insurance. We have all watched the phenomenon as \nAmerican companies, reacting to principles that I'm not prepared to \nargue with, which I regret I am not prepared to argue with, as they \ndecrease coverage, as coverage becomes more expensive or they decrease \ncoverage, perhaps, of the dependents of the worker, even if they hold \non to the coverage for their worker, and often it is the coverage of \nthe worker's children that is really the matter most at stake. I think \nhe wants that to be solved. He wants people to be able to buy into the \nMedicare Program between 55 and 65.\n  Interestingly enough, that is a group which has an enormous amount of \ndependency on health care because right now 15 percent of those older \nAmericans are completely uninsured. So that is the time in life when \nthings begin to get more difficult in terms of health, and the \nPresident understands that and reacted to that.\n  I really did like, Mr. President, what he talked about in health \ncare. I liked the idea of pushing us further than we have been on \nchildren's health care. We did a very good job last year on a \nbipartisan basis, and that is exactly what it was. I remember the \nFinance Committee meetings. They were an absolute model, Senator Byrd, \nof bipartisan cooperation. All staff, everybody left the room, and then \nthere were just the 20 Senators--11 Republicans, 9 Democrats--facing \neach other. And rather rapidly, perhaps because there was no glare, an \nenormous amount of cooperation just exploded in that cooperation, and \nall of a sudden we had the children's health care bill which is being \nput to good use. Fifteen States have already asked Donna Shalala for a \nwaiver to be able to proceed. West Virginia has not at this point \nconcluded what it will do. Governor Underwood presented a good program \nto the State legislature. The State legislature is going to come back \nwith a good program. There will be a compromise reached. The \nlegislature is Democratic. The Governor is Republican. They both want \nthe same thing. They both want to see children insured. So does the \nPresident, and he wanted to see more of that.\n  I will express a concern to the Presiding Officer that a large number \nof those 5 million children that we included in our bill last year are \nchildren who are already eligible for Medicaid but simply don't know it \nbecause their families are detached from the system, because somehow \nthrough the school lunch program they just have not found out they are \neligible, they don't want to fill out the paper forms, or they are \nafraid. That is a phenomenon that one finds in the hills and hollows of \nvarious parts of this country. I worry a great deal about being able to \nget out to those children. In the case of West Virginia there are some \n30,000 children who are already eligible for Medicaid. But the \nPresident was challenging us to do that and to do more, and well he \nshould because there are 10 million uninsured children in this country. \nNo other industrial nation on Earth has to go through the pain of \nsaying that. He pushes us forward.\n  I think he cares very much, as I indicated, about the workers in the \n55- to 65-year-old range. They worry about their future. The baby \nboomers, the younger generation, wonder whether there will be Social \nSecurity and Medicare for them, and they have reason to worry. I think \nthe President, therefore, said, look, let's take the money which is \ngoing into a surplus, should there be one, and put that into Social \nSecurity. He said, ``Social Security first.'' That is strong stuff. I \nthink the American people really identify with that. That means that, \nno, there cannot be some of the tax cuts which some on both sides of \nthe aisle may want to see, some of which may be very useful. But in a \nsense he was saying we can't have it all. We have to make priorities. \nSocial Security comes first.\n\n  There is also, as the Presiding Officer knows, a commission on \nMedicare which I am very proud to serve on. That is a huge problem that \nwe will have to solve. Last year we bought ourselves about 10 years, \nbut let's face it, in the buying of those 10 years we took some of the \npressure off, the decision that we will have to make in the next 2 \nyears, and we cannot allow that to happen.\n  The Social Security Commission of 1983 succeeded because Social \nSecurity was in the act of collapsing and the commission knew it and \ntherefore they acted. The commission on Medicare, which affects so many \nin our country, is not going to be faced with that kind of immediate \npressure so we will have to bring it on through our own energies, our \nown intellectual and moral commitments, and I believe we will be able \nto do that.\n  The other thing that the President said among many that I liked very \nmuch was the whole concept of people dealing for the first time with \nmanaged care. He pointed out the enormous number of Americans that are \nin managed care now and he wants to see basic rights for people that \nhave that available to them. I think he is quite right. We will see, as \nwe have before, insurance companies and their lobbyists talking about \nmandates and big Government and all kind of things like that, but I \ndon't sign on to that. I think the President is right, that \nconfidentiality ought to be a right, and managed care patients ought to \nbe able to see a specialist. Just because it is the cheapest doesn't \nmean it is the best. Patients should not be herded into something \nbecause it is cheap. It ought to be as cheap as possible, but it has to \nbe very, very good.\n  All in all, I thought the President had a lot to say. I thought he \nsaid it with eloquence. I thought he said it with strength. I thought \nhe said it with a very, very strong vision. Health care is hard. No. 1, \nit is hard just as a subject, but it tends to automatically send people \nscurrying one direction or another direction. People either say too big \nGovernment or people say that is not enough. Somehow we have to find in \nthis Chamber a way of understanding that the world's greatest economy \ncan afford, even if it is on an incremental basis, that all of our \ncitizens be insured. We really can do that and we can work together to \ndo that.\n  There has been marvelous cooperation--Senator Chafee and myself, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Hatch--on children's health last year. There \nhave been so many examples of that over the recent years. I think part \nof the lesson that he preached last night was, ``Let's do this \ntogether.'' It wasn't just ``I, a Democratic President of the United \nStates.'' It is ``we,'' representing all of us, representing \nRepublicans and Democrats all across this country.\n  I am ready to fight for a good solution for Medicare. I want to see \nparents satisfied that their children are getting the best education. I \nwant to see baby boomers have a sense of security about Social Security \nin the future because we dedicate surpluses to that area, and I also \nwant to see retired workers who are either kicked out of jobs or \nretired from jobs during the vulnerable period of their older lives, 55 \nto 65, to have a basic sense of being able to buy into Medicare. I \nthink that is sound health care policy and I congratulate the President \non doing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Rockefeller for a \nwonderful presentation.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, \nfollowing which I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I \nmay not take a full 10 minutes, I advise the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Let me start and make the points that I came here to make because I \ndo believe that some important issues were raised by the President last \nnight in the State of the Union Address, and they are points that are \nworthwhile to go back and look at for just a minute.\n  One change that has occurred here in Washington in the time I have \nbeen here--and it was very clear last night when I listened to the \nPresident--is that we now have a consensus; at least a majority agree \nthat education is a national responsibility as well as a State and \nlocal responsibility. I can remember very recently--and you still hear \npeople say this, but not many anymore--but I can remember when a\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\nsubstantial number of people used to say education is not an \nappropriate issue for the Federal Government to concern itself with.\n  Clearly, it is a great concern for the people I represent in New \nMexico, and it is a great concern for working families all over this \ncountry; but ``it should not be a concern for people who come to \nWashington to make the laws or to appropriate funds or to allocate tax \ndollars because this is not a national responsibility.'' That was the \nargument that we always heard. I think one of the great legacies that \nthis President will leave and this Congress will leave is that there is \na change in that attitude. There is a recognition here in Washington, \nfinally, that just as every other industrial nation in the world \nconsiders education a national concern as well as a State and local \nconcern, here in America we need to consider it a national concern as \nwell as a State and local concern as well. So I think that is a major \nchange and a change for the better.\n  Last year, Congress and the President agreed on some very significant \ninitiatives in the area of education--a new HOPE scholarship for 2 \nyears of college, a $3 billion overall increase in education funding \nwas included last year, and funding for a new $210 million reading \ninitiative. There were various other initiatives in the education area \nthat were agreed upon by Democrats and Republicans alike. So we have \nmade progress so far in the 105th Congress, and in the second session \nwe can make more progress. I have heard some speeches today and some \ncomments today by my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the \naisle, and they go along two lines. Number one is the old argument that \nthis is not a national concern, education is not a national concern, we \nshould not be doing more in this area. We ought to leave it up to local \nschool districts if they want to do it. Second, there is no money. We \nmay have the largest economy in the world, and we may be in a period \nwhere the Union is strong and where the economy is strong and where we \nare finally getting to a balanced budget, or very near to it, but there \nis no money. ``We now spend less than 2 percent of our Federal budget \non education and that is too much. We can't afford to spend any more.'' \nThat is the argument I hear.\n  I don't think the American people agree with that. When I go to my \nState and have town hall meetings and visits with people around New \nMexico, I hear them say they are shocked to find that the Federal \nGovernment commits so little in resources relative to what the Federal \nGovernment spends in other areas. So I think we are expected by the \npeople who sent us here to do better by education. The President is \nshowing us the way to do that.\n  There are three areas in particular I want to highlight today where I \nthink he is showing some leadership, and we need to follow that \nleadership and try to make a difference. One is in the very important \narea of lowering the dropout rate in our schools, reaching those at-\nrisk students who historically have left high school before they \ngraduate. We have oversized schools in this country. We have low \nexpectations of many of our students. We have inadequate involvement of \nparents in the education of their children. As a result of all of these \nfactors, over 500,000 students each year in this country drop out of \nschool before they complete high school. Thirty percent of the young \nHispanic adults in this country lack a high school degree because of \nthat very problem. This is a national tragedy, in my opinion, and we at \nthe Federal level can do some things to try to assist with this \nproblem.\n  I hope very much we will take the lead of the President in doing \nthat. He has proposed key programs such as title I, the TRIO program, \nbilingual education, and several new initiatives to make schools more \nconducive to learning, to raise expectations and lower dropout rates. \nHe has proposed $12 billion for class size reduction and teacher \ntraining and a mentoring program for at-risk middle school students. He \nhas proposed $150 million for comprehensive reform. Now, that funding \nwould go to schools with a serious dropout problem that want to focus \non restructuring those schools and coming up with ways to give \nattention to the at-risk student, to keep them in that school, prevent \nthem from dropping out. That is an initiative that is worth our effort \nand support.\n\n  A second area, in addition to the dropout problem that the President \nis providing leadership on and that we here in Congress have done a \nsubstantial amount on in recent years, is providing computers and \naccess to the Internet for the students in our schools today. \nTechnological literacy is an essential part of being educated today. We \nneed to ensure that the schools throughout this Nation are equipped so \nthat students who come through those schools have access to that \ntechnology. The President is proposing significant fiscal year 1999 \nincreases for key technology programs. For the formula grants to States \nthere is $425 million in fiscal 1997. For competitive grants, $76 \nmillion for technology training for teachers. And all of us understand \nthat you have to train the teachers to use the technology in order that \nit can be used effectively by the students as well in the classroom. \nThe President is proposing increases in each of these areas. I believe \nit is in the best interest of this country for us to follow his lead in \nthat area.\n  The President's $10 billion school construction initiative will also \nhelp to provide access to fully-wired, technology-ready facilities for \ncomputers, and the Internet can be readily integrated into classrooms. \nSchools are the last area of our society where technology is really \nhaving an impact. It is more prevalent in our homes and in our offices \nthan it is in our schools, and it is time that we fix that problem.\n  The final area I want to mention is where I believe the President has \nmade some progress and this Congress has made some progress and we need \nto keep moving forward in, which is the area of world-class academic \nstandards. Too many schools still offer watered-down academic programs, \ngeneral education tracks, and low expectations that will not meet the \ndemands of local competition. The President has proposed $200 million \nin incentives to help districts to set high academic standards, to \neliminate the problem of social promotion which he spoke about very \neloquently last night, and to take other measures to upgrade the \nquality of education in our schools. He requested roughly $13 million \nto pilot and field test a new voluntary national test in reading at the \nfourth grade level and math at the eighth grade level. This test would \nbe developed by the National Assessment Governing Board, which is not \npart of the Department of Education.\n  Mr. President, these three initiatives--the effort to reduce dropout \nrates, the effort to provide technology for our schools, and the effort \nto assist our local schools to achieve world-class academic standards--\nare all worthy goals for us in this second session of the 105th \nCongress. I hope very much that we will follow the lead of the \nPresident and support these efforts with real resources. We will \nrecognize that our constituents do not want to have us debate and \ndebate and debate about whose responsibility it is to improve the \nschools. They want to see progress, they want to see improvement, they \nwant to see their children receive a better education. We have the \npower to do that by continuing what we started in the last session of \nthis Congress--that is, putting more resources into education, giving \nthe priority to education that the President talked about last night. I \nhope very much we will do that. I believe the President has shown a \ndirection that the American people want to see us follow. And I hope \nvery much we will have the good sense to follow that direction.\n  Mr. President, I know there are others who intend to speak. So at \nthis point I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, commend my colleague \nfrom New Mexico for the very thoughtful statement on education, on the \nimportance of it. I did not hear all of the statements made earlier. I \nknow my colleague from West Virginia, the senior Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, discussed the issue of transportation and the \nimportance of the ISTEA bill, the intermodal transportation system \nbill, which has to be brought up very quickly here. I heard our junior \nSenator from West Virginia\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\ndiscuss the issue of Medicare and health care. So a number of these \nitems the President discussed last evening in his State of the Union \nMessage have been the subject of some discussion here today.\n  I think all of us were very impressed with the agenda the President \nhas laid out for this session of this Congress, the remaining 70 to 120 \ndays. The distinguished majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Senator \nLott, has indicated this will not be a long session. So we have a \nrelatively short amount of time for an agenda that I think is important \nfor the country. I hope many of these items will be considered in a \nstrong bipartisan sense. Some will obviously provoke some \ndisagreements. Minimum wage and family and medical leave are two items \nthat come to mind immediately. But I hope on things like Medicare and \nSocial Security and building our public schools and campaign finance \nreform, we can find some common ground here and get the business of the \ncountry done.\n  Mr. President, I would like to focus some remarks, if I could, on a \nsubject that is I think critically important. The President spent some \ntime discussing it last evening. It is one that I had worked on for \nabout a month and a half here, during the month of December and a good \npart of the month of January, with a bipartisan group of Republicans \nand Democrats, and that subject is child care.\n  Unfortunately, in the last week, I received some correspondence from \nour colleagues on the Republican side who decided to pull out of the \neffort basically to come up with another bill. I understand Senator \nChafee of Rhode Island has introduced a bill that, in many ways, \nreflects the work product of those 6 weeks, where I had tried to see in \nthat quiet time if we could come out with a proposal that we could \nrally around here. Unfortunately--and this happens--these things break \napart. I hope at some point we will come back together again. This is \nimportant. We have introduced a bill on our side, so there are two \nbills out there. The President laid out some thoughts and ideas on it. \nLet me say to you, Mr. President, how important this issue is. We are \ntalking about millions of families in this country that are either \nsingle parents raising children, or two-income parents that need both \nincomes. They may have children and have to pay the tremendous cost of \nchild care because, obviously, you can't leave them home alone. Maybe \nthey don't necessarily have grandparents or aunts and uncles around to \ntake care of them on a daily basis. It poses a serious problem for \nparents. When schools close down for snow days during the winter. What \ndo you do with your children when you have to go off to work? You have \nthe job you need and the children you love. How do you reconcile these \nissues?\n  In the past, many of us grew up in a situation where you had \nneighbors and friends and you would accommodate an occasion when a \ncrisis like that emerged. Today, it is a daily effort, if a family is \nto make ends meet and fulfill these obligations. The average cost of a \nchild care setting is between $4,000 and $9,000 per child per year. If \nyou are making, as the average family does, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000 a \nyear, with two children that need some care because they are minors or \ninfants, you immediately get a sense of how difficult a situation \npeople can be placed in financially.\n  What we have proposed is to expand the block grants, to come up with \nsome tax credits--by the way, tax credits not just to families who have \nchildren they want to place in care, but to families who decide they \nare going to try and get along with one income. Some parents are going \nto stay home. We provide the credits for them as well. We make it \nrefundable, too, Mr. President, because people who make that $30,000 \nand below don't pay taxes. Yet, many of them are out there just barely \ngetting along. If they don't have a refundable tax credit, they don't \nget any benefit at all. So we refund the tax credits for those families \nthat either want to stay home with their child or place that child in a \nchild care setting, because they need that extra help to get along. On \nthe stay-at-home parent idea--and I am delighted to see more and more \ncoming to this issue--I authored something called the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, which was a source of some controversy back in the \n1980's. It took me 7 years. It went through 2 vetoes, and as the \nPresident said, it was the first bill he signed into law in 1993. That \nwas basically a stay-at-home parent idea. The idea was that if your \nchild is facing a medical crisis or serious problem that could be \ndocumented, that a parent could make the choice to take 12 weeks away \nfrom their job, up to 12 weeks, without pay, without losing their job. \nWe were the only country that I could find among industrialized nations \nthat didn't permit a family and medical leave policy, giving parents \nthe ability to stay at home and care for their children without losing \nthe job that they need.\n\n  So the idea of providing some assistance for parents who want to stay \nat home and care for their children, I think, is a very sound idea. I \nhope we don't get into the situation where we cause stay-at-home \nparents and those who must work to be pitted against each other, to \ncause a quarrel, if you will, between parents who don't have that \nchoice. If you are raising 2 or 3 kids on your own, the idea that you \nhave a choice to stay home and watch them is nonexistent. You don't \nhave that choice. Or if you are a two-income family barely getting by \nor you want to invest money that you are earning for their education, \nor to buy a better home, or to plan a vacation, you should not be \nbranded somehow as an uncaring parent because you made that choice. I \ndon't want to see us get into a debate here and suggest somehow that \nparents who need that second income are less caring about their \nchildren because they make that choice, any more than I want to see us \ndeprive parents who make that choice to be at home by not providing \nthem with help so that they can do that.\n  So I am hopeful that we can come to some common ground here. We have \nbegun Welfare to Work. We have a lot more people in the work force. We \ndon't have the child care vacancies, and we don't have the high-paying \nchild care workers, as the average income is $12,000 a year. I don't \nknow anyone who can now get along on that income. How do you attract \ngood people to care for our children in this society?\n  There have been studies done recently about the quality of child care \nprograms around the country. Some 17 States now have certification \nprocesses. Yet the Ziegler Child Study Center at Yale University would \ntell you that even in the States that have certification and \naccreditation processes the quality of child care is embarrassing. It \nis mortifying.\n  So for States that do not have that certification process you can \nimagine what it is like. In fact, if you pick up almost any daily \nnewspaper in any city or any State in the country, you will find a case \nalmost on a daily basis of parents who placed their child in what they \nthought was a safe, quality child care setting only to discover, of \ncourse, that child is not safe, and lost its life as we have seen in \nnumerous cases. So we need to be far more conscientious.\n  We don't deal with quality here in Washington. We don't set \nstandards. I realize that is too high a hurdle to probably overcome. So \nwe let the States set the standards. There is nothing in our Federal \nbill that mandates what standards are. But we do think there ought to \nbe at least health and safety standards. We require that for our pets. \nIf you leave them at a vet or in one of these weekend kennels, you get \na State requirement of safety and health standards for your puppies. It \nseems to me, if we are going to require that minimum standard for \nanimals that we might try it for our own children in this country.\n  So our bill provides assistance to employers and providers of child \ncare, and to parents who want to have the security of knowing their \nchildren are in safe places.\n  To give you an idea of how serious this problem is, in the State of \nFlorida today, there is a need of 40,000 spaces for child care that are \nnonexistent in the State. We are told with Welfare to Work that number \nwill increase by 440,000 in the coming year. So you are going to have \nan explosion, I guess, of child care providers. What will be the \nquality? How much will the cost be? Is it accessible to people? The \nState of Florida may be an example where the vacancy rate is \nparticularly high. But it is not unique. Other States across\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nthe country are facing similar problems.\n  I was disappointed when I saw the list of the 19 priority items that \nthe majority leader has placed before us in this brief session that \nchild care is not on that list of 19. Child care is not on that list. \nWe went through the debate on welfare reform a year or so ago. One of \nthe promises made in this Chamber was that as we moved people from \nwelfare to work, we would do something about caring for the children of \nthese people who have been on welfare. What we are being told now, with \nthis priority list of 19, is that child care is not on that list; that \nworking families who are trying to make ends meet in caring for their \nchildren are not going to be a part of this agenda in the next 70 or \n120 days of a legislative process. I am hopeful that agenda can change, \nthat it is not written in concrete, that there will be an opportunity \nto make the case that we ought to be able to come up with a compromise \nbill if need be between Republicans and Democrats that takes out the \npartisanship on this issue and says that we ought to be able to come up \nwith some idea here that can assist these working families.\n  I know my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, with whom I wrote the \nchild care block grant program 13 years ago, and my colleague from \nKansas, Senator Pat Roberts, care very much about this issue. Senator \nJeffords cares about this issue, and had his own bill up earlier. \nObviously, Senator Chafee does. He has a bill in. I know my colleagues \nfrom Maine, Senator Collins and Senator Snowe, and Senator Specter have \nan interest in this. I am just disappointed. I can't hide it--that \nhaving invested 6 weeks of staff time and effort to try to come up with \na compromise bill that it all falls apart literally in the last few \ndays after we pretty much had a work product.\n\n  So I am going to continue to raise this issue. I am glad the \nPresident did last night. I am glad he highlighted it. I think a lot of \npeople in this country understand in very graphic ways how important \nthis issue is to them for their neighbors and their coworkers. They \nunderstand it. They see every day what goes on, how difficult this is, \nhow costly it is, and how worried people are. After-school care is a \nbig issue in this context. We put over $3 billion over 5 years in after \nschool care. 5 million children every day are home alone between 3 \no'clock and 6 o'clock and 7 o'clock. Any police chief in any town will \ntell you the problems that kids get into is not after 11 p.m. at night \nwhen people want to put in curfews. Where kids get in trouble is in the \nafternoon between 3 o'clock and 8 o'clock. That is when trouble occurs. \nSeventy percent of our schools in this country have no after-school \ncare programs at all. It seems to me that we ought to do something \nabout that. I am not just talking about infants but young children in \nelementary schools. Try and dial a phone in a relatively small \ncommunity between 3 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. in the afternoon. There is a \ndelay between the last digit you dial and when the phone actually \nclicks in. That is because the phone system is overloaded with parents \ncalling their homes to make sure their kids have gotten home safely.\n  So after-school care is a part of our effort and a part of this \nproposal that we will put before this body.\n  So with those thoughts I am urging our colleagues to see if we can't \nfind some common ground. Hopefully the majority leader will change that \nagenda to include child care on it with the recommendation of the \nadministration. We are not arguing now with an executive branch over \nwhether or not we ought to do this.\n  There are two bills here that it seems to me we should move on. I am \ngoing to raise this issue at every opportunity I can in the coming \nweeks to see to it that before this session of this Congress adjourns \nthat this U.S. Senate will address child care, after-school care, and \ncare for parents who want to stay at home, and that these parents are \ngoing to get some relief before we call it quits. I think it is a \ncritical issue and one that ought to be one of our top priorities \nrather than not a priority at all.\n  With that I yield the remainder of my time, if any of my colleagues \nwant to take a few minutes before the time expires. I see my colleague \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the State of the Union Address last \nevening reminds me of the words of President Kennedy who in 1962 came \nbefore the Nation and he said, ``It is my responsibility to report on \nthe state of the Nation but it is all of our responsibility to improve \nit.''\n  Increasingly that is a responsibility that is being met. It is \nincredible now to remember that when President Clinton assumed office 5 \nyears ago there was projected to be in 1998 a Federal budget deficit of \n$357 billion. Indeed, in the budget that the President is about to \nsubmit there is a $10 billion deficit. And the reality is within a year \nthe U.S. Government for the first time in 30 years will be conducting \nits affairs in a fiscal surplus.\n  For 3 decades, six Presidents of both political parties in their \nState of the Union Addresses have had it incumbent upon them to \ndistribute pain--not to challenge the Nation to meet problems but to \ndistribute sacrifice because of mounting deficits that left the U.S. \nGovernment with no choice.\n  There have indeed been many victims of the deficit. It is common to \ntalk about them in terms of taxpayers having to pay an ever larger \nshare of their income in Federal tax with an ever-larger share of their \ntaxes going to interest on the national deficit. The taxpayers were not \nthe only victims. The Federal deficit made victims out of children who \nnever got the education they required. Students were never able to \ncontinue with assistance into higher education because of programs we \ncould not pass; young families that could not get day care, and people, \nmothers and fathers, who could not follow opportunities because of it. \nThere were many victims of the Federal deficit, and we each now need to \nbe reminded that the country's budget evolved into a surplus.\n\n  Alan Greenspan may have said it best when he said we cannot just \nbalance the Federal budget and think that our work is complete for if \nthere is no investment in the Nation's future then we have still \nfailed. That, Mr. President, is where we find ourselves tonight. Part \nof our national mission is accomplished. There will be a Federal budget \nsurplus. Now the question is are we wise enough to recognize where the \nsacrifices have been? Are we smart enough to plan for the future to \nassure that the economic growth that we are now experiencing can \ncontinue?\n  Last night in the State of the Union Address the President outlined \nseveral specific investments that go to the core of this question, each \nin a way addressing an aspect of the national infrastructure. The first \nwas Social Security.\n  There are in our Nation 80 million members of my generation born in \nthe years after the last world war. They have worked hard. They are \nsaving diligently. They have participated in building this high-growth \neconomy. Soon they begin to face retirement. The Social Security trust \nfund through their savings and participation will continue to run a \nsurplus through the year 2014. The current projections are that the \nsame trust fund will expire by the year 2031.\n  Last night the President left us with a simple challenge. In facing \nthe Federal budget surplus let's deal with Social Security first. Let \nthis generation of Americans now retire. My generation who will be \nfacing it in all too few years know the trust funds will be secure, \npermanent. Let's begin that planning now.\n  Second, the President recognized that in the 21st century the \nfoundation of our Nation's economy and perhaps its principal national \ninfrastructure will be our educational institutions. As certainly as in \nthe 17th century it may have been the construction of canals, as \ncertainly as in the 18th and 19th century it may have evolved into \nrailroads to most certainly what now are institutions of higher \nlearning in our schools.\n  As part of the program to deal with this reality, the President \nchallenged us to create a Federal program to hire 100,000 new teachers \nto enable the Nation to reduce the class size for first, second, and \nthird graders to 18 students, an extraordinary challenge with \neverything that it could mean for expanding the quality of American \nschools. But it did more.\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\n  Recognizing that smaller school classes is going to mean the need for \nmore classrooms and facing the reality that fully two-thirds of all \nAmerican schools are now substandard, two-thirds have at least one \nserious construction problem that must be addressed, potentially $100 \nbillion worth of necessary construction to bring America's schools up \nto standards, the President recommended a program whereby the Federal \nGovernment would not build the schools; that responsibility would \nremain local. But we could reduce the cost of the construction by the \nFederal Government paying the interest on the loans of local \ngovernments and State governments to build those schools.\n  Third, the President challenged this Congress to continue progress on \naccess to quality health care in America. Two years ago, this Congress \nassured that Americans could change their jobs without losing their \nhealth care. This Congress assured that if a member of a family was \ntaken ill, they would not lose their health care because they made use \nof it. Two years ago, we did right by the American people in expanding \nour health care opportunities. And a year ago we did so again, adding 5 \nmillion American children, previously uninsured, without access to the \nsystem. We brought them into health care insurance through the \nGovernment.\n  Now the question is even larger. The President challenged us in the \nState of the Union Address to deal with the reality of 160 million \nAmericans who now have their health care delivered through managed care \nsystems. I know something of this issue because only a week ago in New \nJersey, meeting with 100 individuals, many of whom had had difficulties \nwith their managed care systems, I heard the stories that Americans are \nexperiencing every day--members of managed care systems who could not \nget the truth of their own files, people who needed to see specialists \nbut were denied, people whose privacy had been violated, people who \ntraveled needing access to emergency rooms and could not get it because \ncare would not be received through their managed care program.\n  The President's challenge last evening was we can make managed care \nwork, and, indeed, in reducing costs it has worked. We have gone from \n12 and 13 and 14 percent annual increases in the cost of health care to \n2.5 percent last year. But saving money is only half the equation. The \nremainder is assuring that what has been the finest quality care system \nin the world in the United States is maintained and that managed care \ncomplements that system and does not frustrate it.\n  Fourth, the President recognized the reality that fully 60 percent of \nAmerican women today with children, with homes to maintain, are also in \nthe work force--not always by choice, certainly not usually by luxury. \nBut with the cost of raising children and maintaining a home today, two \nfamily incomes are often a necessity, and yet in modern America the \nambitions of these women, the needs of these families are frustrated \nbecause they cannot get affordable child care. It is hard to imagine \nany higher priority today for young working families in America than \nassuring quality, safe, affordable child care. Indeed, America remains \nalmost alone in the world in not helping our families meet this urgent \nneed and responsibility.\n  Through tax credits for businesses, through a larger child care tax \ncredit for working families, the challenge has been laid before the \nCongress. More directly, the President said, ``Not a single American \nfamily should ever have to choose between the job they need and the \nchild they love.'' Exactly, Mr. President, and that is the challenge \nbefore this Congress.\n  And yet, finally, I recognize that having fought all of these years \nto balance the Federal budget, to reach the point where an American \nPresident could honestly predict a surplus in our finances, we achieve \nnothing if we meet these responsibilities but require higher taxes on \nAmerican families that cannot afford the increased burden. It is \nnotable that this balanced budget has been achieved and some of these \nsocial objectives already met while the country has the lowest tax \nburden on middle-income families in 20 years. But it is important still \nto recognize that that burden can still be eased more through targeted, \nresponsible tax cuts that do not add to the deficit but help meet some \nof these social objectives-- tax cuts to encourage and expand child \ncare, targeted tax cuts to help with the cost of financing education, \ntax cuts that encourage savings and investment to maintain this rapid \neconomic growth that is producing these extraordinary revenues.\n  Mr. President, this is an extraordinary time in the life of our \ncountry. We can do good and great things but not by resting on what we \nhave achieved. This economy has not grown, our people are not \nproductive, our industries are not competitive, we are not leading the \nworld in finance and industry, no less in diplomacy, statesmanship and \nmilitary power because we have learned to rest but, rather, because we \nhave learned to challenge --not because we live off the growth of \nprevious years, the investments of other generations but because we \ninvest and save ourselves. That challenge remains with us tonight, not \nto accept things as they are but to invest, to educate, to build,\n  There is a quote that I have through the years always admired from an \narchitect in Chicago, Daniel Burnham, who said in 1909 to his \ncolleagues, ``Make no little plans, for they have no magic to stir \nmen's blood and will probably never be realized. Make big plans.'' Last \nnight, in his State of the Union Address, President Clinton made before \nthe Nation an ambitious agenda. It is a big plan worthy of a big and a \ngreat nation.\n\n  I hope and trust in this final year of the 105th Congress our vision \nwill be as big, our action will be as bold as the State of the Union \nAddress this Congress heard last night from President Clinton.\n  Madam President, with that, if I could, I should like to yield to the \nSenator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, by focusing on Social Security reform, educational \nquality, and strengthening the rights of health care patients, last \nnight's speech zeroed in on the issues that I have been hearing \nOregonians talk about during the course of 12 town meetings this month. \nCertainly a budget surplus, no matter how you count to create that \nsurplus, is not going to bring us into some sort of budget nirvana if \nit is followed by more years of deficits. And I thought what was \nespecially constructive about last night's speech was it zeroed in on \nthe critical questions of retirement and health care that clearly drive \nthe budget and the deficit for the long-term. The fact is you cannot \nhave long-term budget discipline unless you deal with Social Security \nand health care, and I think last night we heard a call to arms, to dig \nin on a bipartisan basis on those key issues.\n  Now, with respect to Social Security--and I am sure it is the case \nfor all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle--I can report that \nin my State more young people think that they are going to have a date \nwith an extraterrestrial than think they are going to get a Social \nSecurity check. They look at these whopper payroll taxes that they are \npaying today, more than 6 percent for the worker, more than 6 percent \nfor the employer, millions of Americans paying more in payroll taxes \nthan they pay in income taxes, and they see that essentially their \nretirement contribution in the past has gone to a great extent to \noperate the budget.\n  I think it is fair to say--and there has been a considerable amount \nof discussion of this in the last few weeks --that the budget surplus \nin America is to a great extent the Social Security surplus in America. \nI think last night we learned that the real challenge ahead--the \nPresident essentially called for what amounts to a year-long national \nteach-in on retirement finance in America--is to be straight with \npeople. We are going to have to talk about the tough choices and in \nparticular how we protect the millions of Americans for whom Social \nSecurity is a lifeline, vulnerable folks who every month are balancing \ntheir food costs against their medical bills and medical bills against \ntheir pharmaceutical bills, and the question is, how do we take care of \nthose vulnerable folks and still get\n\n[[Page S107]]\n\nready for this demographic tsunami--75, 80 million baby boomers that \nare going to retire early in the next century.\n  But it seems to me that if we spend the next year working on a \nbipartisan basis to dig into these issues, look at a variety of \ndifferent approaches--I am particularly attracted to the idea of trying \nto stimulate more private saving; I think there are a variety of ways \nin which that can be done--we will have said on our watch, on our \nwatch, Madam President--and I have enjoyed serving with you on the \nSenate Committee on Aging--we will be able to say that on our watch we \ndid not duck the tough and difficult questions. And certainly they are \njust as difficult with respect to health care as they are to retirement \nfinance.\n  I come from a part of the United States where we have perhaps the \nhighest concentration of managed care in the country. In fact, in my \nhometown of Portland, more than half of the older people are in HMOs, \nare in managed care, and the challenge always is, even in a hometown \nlike mine where we have a lot of good managed care, how do you hold the \ncost down while still protecting the rights of patients in those health \nplans.\n  I am of the view that a lot of those folks feel powerless today. \nFrankly, they feel powerless throughout the health system, whether they \nare in an HMO or a fee-for-service plan or one of these hybrids that is \na little bit of each. And I think that we as a body differ on lots of \naspects about health care. Certainly you can differ on the role of the \nFederal Government, State government, tax policy, and a variety of \nissues, but I, for the life of me, cannot understand why any of us \nwould not support what we heard last night with respect to patients \nbeing told about all their options in the health care system. Disagree \nall you want about the kind of services that ought to be part of a \nhealth plan but let us not disagree on the fundamental right to know \nwhat treatment might be available to you and what your options are. The \nsame with the right of appeal, the right to make sure that if you felt \nyou did not get a fair shake from the health care system you would have \nan opportunity to be heard and you could have another chance to make \nsure that your claim for services was addressed in a fair way. This \nissue, the question of protecting the rights of patients in health \nplans while holding costs down, is the essence of our challenge in \nhealth care. Of course you can hold costs down if you don't give people \nany care. That is a walk in the park. Anybody can do that. That is not \nthe kind of health care system we want. We want one that both holds \ncosts down and protects the quality of health care in our country. We \nhave been able to achieve some of that success in my home State. I am \nconvinced we can do it in every community in Oregon and across the \ncountry, but it is going to mean, as we heard last night, stepping \nforward, stepping up to the key issues.\n\n  Madam President, what I was especially pleased about with respect to \nlast night's speech was the call for bipartisanship. I think that is \ncritical to taking on these key issues such as retirement and health \ncare. Again, in our home State, that's the kind of government that we \nare trying to practice. I can tell you that my colleague in the U.S. \nSenate, Senator Gordon Smith and I, after we ran against each other for \nthe seat to replace Bob Packwood--of all people, we could probably have \ncome here and quarreled about all kinds of issues. We have not wanted \nto make that part of our service. We wanted to make part of our service \ntackling these issues on a bipartisan basis, in a way that makes sense \nfor Oregon and our country. That is why, as new members of the Budget \nCommittee, we joined in the last session in terms of Medicare \nreimbursement reform.\n  As the Presiding Officer of this body knows, regarding much of the \nMedicare reimbursement system, since its inception the program has \nactually rewarded folks for being inefficient and penalized States for \nholding costs down. Senator Smith and I thought that was particularly \nunfair to our constituents, who have done so much heavy lifting to get \nthe health care system back on track. We worked with other Senators, \nleaders on both sides, and were able to make some very dramatic changes \nin that reimbursement system. It has an eye-glazing name called the \nAAPCC, the Average Adjusted Per Capita Costs, but it's the guts of \nreimbursement. And I am convinced that when, on a bipartisan basis, \ncolleagues can work for those kinds of changes, and we were successful \nlast session, we can certainly rise to the challenge that we were given \nlast night and move ahead with respect to reform as it relates to \nhealth maintenance organizations--consumer rights, like the right to \nfull information and the right to appeal.\n  So I am optimistic, as we go forward in the days ahead to tackle \nthese issues, Madam President. I think we have an opportunity on our \nwatch to say that we did not duck, that we understand that these \nissues, with respect to retirement and health care financing, are the \nbiggest issues that in the past folks in politics ducked. We cannot \nafford to do that any longer. I look forward to working on a bipartisan \nbasis with my colleagues on those questions in the days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I do want to say to my colleague from \nWyoming that I shall stay within 10 minutes. He is here on the floor. \nWe have had a chance to speak as Democrats for a while. So I will try \nand stay relatively brief. When I say 10 minutes I mean by clock time, \nnot by Senate time. So I really will try to do this.\n  I thank my colleague from Oregon for his fine statement.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I want to talk about the President's \nspeech last night. Let me start out with where I disagree with some of \nwhat he had to say, and then let me talk about what I think were some \nof the sharp differences between Democrats and Republicans. That is not \nto say I am not interested in bipartisanship, but I think, frankly, if \nthere are differences between the parties that make a difference, and \npeople see a real debate and it is important to their lives, that will \nbe all to the good.\n  I think the President is dead wrong in what he had to say about \nwelfare reform. I never called it reform because I think that takes for \ngranted the very question in doubt, as to whether or not it is really \nreform. That there are a million or 2 million or 3 million fewer women \nand children--those are the welfare recipients on welfare today--than \nseveral years ago does not necessarily represent reform. A reduction of \nthe caseload, reduction of people who are receiving assistance, has \nnothing to do with whether or not you have reduced poverty. It is \nreform when we have reduced poverty.\n  I will just say for the record that, as I have had a chance to travel \naround the community, and a lot of poor communities in our country, \nthere are several things which I found which are very troubling. I do \nnot believe I do any damage to the truth when I say this, and think all \nSenators need to take note of it. First of all, it is simply true that \nthere are 3- and 4-year-olds at home alone. It is simply true that \nthere were long waiting lists for affordable child care, long before \nwelfare reform, and many of these children are not receiving nurturing, \nimportant developmental care at the most critical years of their lives.\n  This is wrong.\n  It is also true, as I said the other day, that there are first and \nsecond and third graders who, when they go home, there is no parent \nthere. I think it is poignant. I think it is wrong that there are fewer \nchildren playing outdoors now because when many of these kids go home \nthey go into a housing project and they are told to go inside, not take \nany phone calls, not answer the door. That is happening in the United \nStates of America. We need to take note of that.\n  I think the President is also wrong because we don't know where these \nmothers are. We don't know what kind of jobs they have. And what is \nreally astounding to me, Madam President, is at the State level we are \nnot collecting the data. I think, as responsible policymakers, since 4 \nyears, 3 years, 2 years from now, depending upon the State, all of \nthese women and children are going to essentially be receiving no \nassistance, they are going to be cut off from all assistance, don't we \nneed to know whether or not they have reached\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\neconomic self-sufficiency? These parents, mainly women--do they have \njobs that pay a decent wage? Do they have health care coverage? Can \nthey afford child care? Where are their children? We need to know that. \nThat is where I disagree with the President's analysis. And I will have \nsome amendments almost on the first piece of legislation that comes to \nthe floor of the Senate where I will try to get the Senate to address \nthese problems.\n  Second, I think we have to do much better in higher education. I was \na college teacher for 20 years and I believe that we didn't expand \nassistance gaining the best bang for the buck. The way of targeting the \nassistance to those students in most need would have been to \ndramatically expand the Pell grant program. And if you are going to \nhave tax credits, they have to be refundable. If you don't have tax \ncredits that are refundable and you have a student from a family \nearning less than $27,000, $28,000 a year--which, by the way, is the \nincome profile of many, many community college students--it doesn't do \nyou any good. You have no tax liability. You can't cash flow paying \nyour tuition because you get it too late to pay your tuition, and you \nare not eligible anyway. So if we are going to talk about making higher \neducation more affordable let's, for gosh sakes, talk about these \nworking families.\n\n  That is disagree.\n  Agreement: I think the President's focus on education, on early \nchildhood development, affordable child care, on health care, was \nextremely important. Let me make but a couple of points for my \nRepublican colleagues. As I listened to some of my Republican \ncolleagues talk about the President's speech last night, I felt like \nwhat they were saying is: Oh, this is just Government all over again. \nAmericans, when it comes to these pressing issues of your lives, there \nis nothing the Government can or should do.\n  Madam President, if you own your own large corporation and you are \nwealthy, then that's fine. But for most of the working families in this \ncountry, affordable child care is a huge issue. For most of the working \nfamilies in this country, making sure that your children get a good \neducation and a commitment to public education and lowering class sizes \nand having more teachers and having more teaching assistance is hugely \nimportant to you. If you are from a working family in our country, you \nwant to make sure, vis-a-vis an increasingly corporatized and \nbureaucratized health care system--listen, managed care can be good or \nbad. It depends upon who manages the managed care. But the fact of the \nmatter is, the nine largest insurance companies own and control well \nover 60 percent of the managed care plans, and for them the bottom line \nhas become the only line.\n  So of course we want to make sure that people have access to the care \nthey need. Of course we want to make sure that nurses and doctors can \nprovide that care. Of course we want to make sure there are some \nindependent appeals processes for ordinary people in our country. Of \ncourse we want to make sure that there are some basic consumer \nprotections. And I think the President is right on the mark. What I am \nworried about, it is a challenge to colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, is that the Congress will sure enough pass a bill. It will have \na great acronym. It will sound great and it will have that made-for-\nCongress look, because there will not be any teeth in it, enforcement \nteeth.\n  By the way, one way in which I would love to amend some of what the \nPresident was talking about last night, and I think we could get \nbipartisan support for this, is we ought to think about --Families USA \nhas talked about ombudsmen, you know, through nongovernment \norganizations, through nonprofits, where people would have somewhere to \ngo so they can have basic information about what their rights are as \nconsumers. We absolutely ought to do that. We absolutely ought to do \nthat. It's a simple proposition. Either we are here to represent big \ninsurance companies or we are here to represent doctors, nurses, \nnurse's assistants, other caregivers, and consumers.\n  The third point I want to make has to do with jobs. I said it the \nother day on the floor of the Senate. I will summarize. I will say it \nagain. No matter where I go, whether it be low-income communities, poor \ncommunities, middle-income communities, it doesn't matter--and for that \nmatter upper-income communities. People are focused on how to earn a \ndecent living and how to give their children the care they know they \nneed and deserve. I am going, for a moment, to talk about low-income, \nsince we don't talk that much about low-income, poor people. I will \ntell you that there are two challenges here. One, the President talked \nabout raising the minimum wage. Senator Kennedy and I have been out on \nthe floor. We talked about the legislation we have introduced, 50 cents \na year for 3 years and then indexing it. I will tell you that is \nextremely important. Because it is wrong when people work full-time, \nall year round, and they are still poor in America. That should not be \nthe case. When people work, play by the rules of the game, they ought \nnot to be poor.\n\n  My second point, however, is different. It doesn't do any good to \nraise the minimum wage if people live in communities where there is no \nwork at all. We have communities in our country, ghettos and barrios in \nrural areas, where there is no work. And we really do need to figure \nout ways of combining our initiatives while at the same time providing \nsome job opportunities for people to build up some skills and then be \nable to transition to private sector employers. If we are going to \nrebuild crumbling schools--and we should, God knows, when students go \ninto schools that are so uninviting, with ceilings falling in. Imagine, \ncould we do our work if the heating didn't work? If the plumbing didn't \nwork? If the air conditioning didn't work during the summer? If we \ndidn't have access to Internet? If we didn't have access to the best \nbooks? Could we do our work? A lot of students are going to school in \ndecrepit buildings, unsafe, that tell those students we don't value \nthem.\n  If we are going to rebuild crumbling schools, invest some money in \nthat infrastructure, I think we ought to also make sure that a certain \npercentage of the jobs go to the adults, the fathers and mothers of \nthose children who live in these communities. Because these are \ncommunities that are ravaged by high levels of unemployment. Let's \ncombine rebuilding the schools with some job training and jobs for some \nof the parents in the community.\n  If we are going to reduce class size we can talk about 100,000 more \nteachers, but there is also a role for teaching assistants that can \nhelp a teacher in a classroom. That could provide employment for people \nwho live in these communities without any jobs at all. So I would like \nto see us have more of a focus in this area. To a certain extent I am \ntalking about people who all too often are faceless and voiceless here, \nbut I think it is extremely important, as a matter elementary justice, \nthat we focus in this area.\n  Finally, Madam President--I hope I have stayed within 10 minutes--an \nissue that you care a great deal about, an issue that I wish all of us \nwould care a great deal about, even if we disagree on the specifics. I \ndo not know what other people find, but I tell you I think an awful lot \nof people in our country, I am sorry, I think it is well over 50 \npercent, are just disillusioned and disaffected with politics. It is \nterrible. I think people think that both parties are owned and \ncontrolled by the same investors.\n  I think that people think that when it comes to their concerns and \ntheir hopes about themselves, their families, their communities, their \nloved ones, these concerns are of little concern to those of us in the \nCongress. I hate that.\n  I have two Republican colleagues on the floor with me from Wyoming \nand from Colorado, both of whom I respect. It does not matter if we \ndisagree on issues, this is one thing we do not want to have happen. I \nmean, we do not want people to just kind of become so disillusioned \nthat participation becomes less and less. We lose our democracy.\n  So, Madam President, the final issue the President talked about--I \nhope we can move some campaign finance reform. We cannot get all the \nbig money out of politics. I wish we could. But if we could at least \npass some reforms that would give people some confidence we are serious \nabout trying to get some of the money out of politics and make politics \nmore responsive to the concerns and circumstances of their lives, we \nwould be taking a big step forward.\n\n[[Page S109]]\n\n  I look forward to the debate. I hope we have a lot of debate. I do \nnot want it to be acrimonious. But I think differences between the \npolitical parties are healthy. I think if the differences make a \ndifference to the people we represent, it is even better. The sooner we \nget substantive, the sooner we have bills out here on the floor, the \nsooner we have the debate, and the sooner we get on with the work of \ngovernance, the better I will like it as a Senator from Minnesota.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in the last 3 hours there has been some \npretty heavy lifting and some excellent debate by both sides about what \nis to come of this country. But I am going to take just a moment and \nlet everyone relax and reflect a little bit and realize that everything \nin the world isn't happening right here in Washington. I want to bring \nsome attention to some things that have happened over the last weekend.\n  One of those, of course, was the Super Bowl game. I want to \ncongratulate those Broncos and people in Wyoming and Colorado who are \navid supporters of that team. They did a wonderful job as fans, as \nplayers. It was a great game. But something that is not as well known \nout of this part of the country is that there is the Western Athletic \nConference. There are a bunch of basketball players out there that are \nhaving a great year.\n  Some people may have heard about Utah because, frankly, they are No. \n4 in the Nation right now. You may have heard about New Mexico because \nthey are also in the top 20 in the Nation. But I want to talk just for \na moment about another team that is going to be in that top 20 in the \nNation, and that is Colorado State University, a small university in \nnorthern Colorado just south of Wyoming. This last weekend we had an \nevent called the ``Border Wars.'' That is an event that has been going \non for 101 games in Laramie, WY, alone. They play the other half of the \ngames in Colorado. So the oldest traditional rivalry in basketball, \nprobably, in the United States--101 games. This last weekend was the \nevent of that 101st game.\n\n  I cannot convey to you enough the rivalry that we have between these \ntwo schools that have been playing for that long and that are only \nseparated by 45 miles, which out in our part of the country is very \nlittle distance.\n  It is my pleasure to say that Colorado State University won that \ngame. They beat an outstanding team. That is why you are going to hear \nmore about Colorado State University. They won that game 53-46. They \ngot out to a 9-0 lead in the game, then a 15-2 lead, which is almost \nwhat their record is this year, 15-3, a pretty outstanding record, \nparticularly in that conference. They are 3-2 in the Western Athletic \nConference. But they have won nine of their home games, only losing \none. Their coach, Stew Morrill, has done an outstanding job with the \nteam that came back from last year. As most people do not realize, they \nhad that entire team back for another season. And they will have a \ngreat season.\n  So keep your eye on the Western Athletic Conference and particularly \nColorado State University.\n  This is such a rivalry that this last weekend I had the pleasure of \nhosting Senator Allard and his wife Joan for the basketball game in \nWyoming. As part of that competition, part of that rivalry, I agreed \nthat if Wyoming lost that game, I would wear this Colorado State tie \nfor a week. It was really fun having the folks from Colorado come up \nand to have that competition continue. I want to congratulate Senator \nAllard for the outstanding job that they did.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I want to stand up and thank my \ncolleague from Wyoming for having both Joan and I join him and his \nlovely wife for a great, great basketball game in Laramie, WY. We look \nforward to a continuation of this rivalry. He is a great sport. I am so \npleased that he has agreed to go ahead and wear that tie now for the \nrest of the week. It makes all of us feel so proud at Colorado State \nUniversity to see somebody who is such a strong supporter of the \nUniversity of Wyoming willing to share that win with the rest of the \npeople in Colorado.\n  So we are looking forward to many, many more rivalries in the Western \nAthletic Conference with the University of Wyoming in Laramie. I want \nto wish everybody the very best.\n  Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I will make one correction, if I can. \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair apologizes. The Senator from North \nDakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No need to apologize. We often get mixed up with our \nsister State. They sometimes call us the four amigos, the four Senators \nfrom North and South Dakota. So we are always glad to be put in the \nclass of our friends from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S109-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S109-S111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE FISCAL CONDITION OF OUR COUNTRY\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, last night we heard the President's \nState of the Union Address. It was an important review of where the \ncountry stands. I want a chance to discuss today what I think are some \nof the most important points that were made last night, the most \nimportant points with respect to the fiscal condition of our country.\n  I came here to the U.S. Senate 12 years ago. The thing that compelled \nme to run was the fact that fiscal conditions in the country were a \ndisaster. I was convinced that unless steps were taken to get us back \non a sound fiscal track, the future economic security of our country \nwas threatened, which would have an adverse effect on the people that I \nrepresent in the State of North Dakota. We are very much affected by \nthe national economy.\n\n  But I was also concerned about where we were headed in terms of a \nnational legacy. What were we going to leave to our children? Remember \nthose times when we were running massive deficits? It looked like there \nwas no end to red ink. So I came here with a commitment to get our \nfiscal house in order. I wanted not only to balance the budget, as it \nis called in Washington, but I also wanted to see us stop the practice \nof looting the Social Security trust funds in order to make the deficit \nappear smaller than it really was.\n  So last night was a very special night for me. I was able to hear a \nPresident say he was going to submit a balanced budget for the first \ntime in 30 years. I was also able to hear a President say that he was \ngoing to go further than that and he was going to move to stop the \npractice of raiding and looting Social Security trust fund surpluses.\n  Madam President, I think that is critically important to the Nation's \nfuture. I want to describe what has happened, what is happening and why \nit matters to people.\n  I brought this chart along to show precisely what has happened and \nwhat the differences are between the budget we talk about here in \nWashington and what I think any fair commentary would be on the budget. \nIf we go back to 1992, the blue line shows what is termed the unified \nbudget. What has happened to the so-called unified budget? That \nincludes all of the resources of the Federal Government, all the \nrevenues and all the expenditures. Of course, that means it also \nincludes the Social Security surpluses.\n  The red line shows the budget of the United States if you exclude the \nSocial Security surpluses. What these lines show is that in 1992 we had \na unified budget deficit of $290 billion--$290 billion. And the \nprojections were that the\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\ndeficits were just going to go up from there.\n  That is where we were in 1992. The next year we passed an economic \nplan proposed by this President. And I might say all the votes were on \nthis side of the aisle because none of our friends on the other side \nwould vote for it. It was controversial. And it is controversial. Any \ntime you really are going to take action and reduce the deficit, that \nmeans you are going to cut spending, and perhaps even raise taxes. That \nis what the 1993 plan did. It cut spending, and it raised taxes on the \nwealthiest 1.5 percent of the income-tax payers of the country.\n  That plan has worked and worked remarkably well. You can see what has \nhappened here to the unified deficit. It has gone down each and every \nyear so that this year, fiscal 1998, the Congressional Budget Office is \nnow projecting a budget deficit of only $5 billion. But let us remember \nthat is the unified deficit.\n  The President said for fiscal 1999 he is going to propose a balanced \nbudget. That means all of the revenues of the Federal Government, when \nmatched with all of the outlays of the Federal Government, are going to \nbalance. That is dramatic progress. That is real progress. That is \nimportant.\n  But we should never forget that that means we are still using Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses. We ought to stop it. We ought to stop it \nbecause we have to get ready for the time the baby-boom generation \nstarts to retire. It is coming sooner than any of us might think. In \nfact, I am one of the leading edge members of the baby-boom generation. \nI will be 50 years old in just a few short weeks. When I retire, along \nwith millions of other baby boomers, that is going to put enormous \npressure on the Federal budget.\n  I call it a demographic time bomb. It is lurking just over the \nhorizon. We have to get ready for that time. The way we get ready is to \nstop using the Social Security trust fund surpluses to fund the other \naspects of Government.\n  I said to my colleagues in the Budget Committee this morning, if any \nprivate company tried to do what we are doing, they would be in big \ntrouble. Because if any private company took the retirement funds of \nits employees and threw those into the pot in order to balance its \noperating budget, they would be in violation of Federal law. They would \nbe headed for a Federal institution, but it would not be the U.S. \nCongress. They would be headed for a Federal penitentiary because that \nis considered fraud.\n  That is the reason we ought to stop it. It is wrong. But it is not \njust wrong in the sense of being illegal. It is also wrong in the sense \nof preparing the economic future for this country. If we do not take \naction now, we will face very draconian decisions as we get closer to \nthe time when the baby boomers actually start to retire.\n  So this blue line shows the so-called unified budget. It shows that \nwe have made dramatic progress moving towards a so-called balanced \nbudget. But it is not really balanced until or unless we also stop \nraiding the Social Security trust fund, until we stop looting the trust \nfund surpluses to pay for the other actions of governments. You can see \nthat this year we will be using the difference between a $5 billion \ndeficit and $106 billion. We will be using $101 billion of Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses.\n  Last night the President said, whoa, wait a minute.\n  Let's not continue this practice. Let's not fool ourselves by saying \nwe have surpluses when, in fact, we are taking trust fund money and \nusing those moneys to make believe we have surpluses. So before anybody \ngets busy figuring out new spending or new tax cut schemes, let's make \nsure we have secured the future of Social Security. As the President \nsaid, save Social Security first. That should be the first order of \nbusiness for this Congress and future Congresses to come.\n  Now, one reason it is important to end this raid on Social Security \nis because that will better secure the economic future for our country. \nThis progress that we have made, this dramatic progress on reducing the \ndeficit, has led to remarkably good economic conditions. We have seen \nover these last 4 years real business fixed investment growing at 10 \npercent a year, one of the strongest rates we have ever seen in our \nhistory. We have seen the unemployment rate in the United States \nreduced to the lowest level since 1973. We have the lowest rate of \nunemployment in 24 years.\n  The good news doesn't stop there. If you look at the inflation rate, \nthat is the best sustained performance since 1967, the lowest rate of \ninflation on a sustained basis in 30 years. These are truly remarkable \neconomic numbers. In addition to that, we know over 14 million jobs \nhave been created. This has been one of the most successful economic \npolicies ever put in place, and it was done at a time when there was \ngreat controversy about it. That is clear if you go back to 1993 and \nread the debate. Folks on the other side of the aisle said if you pass \nthat plan, you will increase the deficit. They said you will increase \nunemployment. They said you will increase inflation. They were wrong. \nThey were wrong on every single point.\n  They had an economic theory called trickle down economics. When we \npursued that theory in the 1980s, the deficit and the debt exploded. In \n1993, we reversed course and said, no, we are going back to commonsense \neconomics, which means you look at what you are spending and what your \nrevenues are and you put them into balance. That is how you eliminate \nthe deficit. You cut your spending, you increase your revenue, and you \neliminate the deficit. In doing this you take pressure off of interest \nrates and relieve that debt burden on the economy and the economy will \ngrow. And this economic course worked. It did precisely what we hoped \nit would do. In fact, the results have been even better than we \nanticipated. The deficit has come down dramatically. We have seen \nremarkably strong economic growth, the lowest inflation in 30 years, \nthe lowest unemployment in 24 years, the biggest reduction in elderly \npoverty in our history. That is a record we can be proud of.\n  Let me just say I heard the other night somebody on television saying \nit is not because of the fiscal policy that was passed in 1993, it is \nbecause of the monetary policy the Federal Reserve Board has been \npursuing that we have had this economic success. Mr. Greenspan, the \nhead of the Federal Reserve, doesn't even subscribe to that \nproposition. He has said that the 1993 economic plan has played a \nsignificant role in the good economic circumstances that we have seen \nsince that time. He is exactly right. It is a combination of fiscal \npolicy and monetary policy that has brought us to the strong economic \nposition we are in today. The fiscal policy is controlled by the \nCongress and the White House. The fiscal policy that we put in place \nwith the 1993 economic plan has worked and it has worked like a charm. \nIn fact, it has permitted the Federal Reserve Board to follow the \nmonetary policy they have pursued that has also helped create this very \nsuccessful economic environment in which we are in.\n  Madam President, I wanted this chance to review where we have been, \nwhere we are going, how we got here, and how we can continue to make \nprogress that strengthens the economy of this country.\n  In conclusion, I just want to say we have an unparalleled opportunity \nthis year. We have a chance to build on the remarkable success that was \nstarted with the 1993 economic plan. We have a chance to take that, \ncoupled with the bipartisan budget plan that was passed last year, and \nthankfully we now see we are 3 years ahead of schedule on that plan. We \nnow can take the next step and stop the raiding and the looting of \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses in a way that would strengthen \nthis economy for decades to come. We shouldn't let this moment pass. We \nshouldn't allow ourselves to get caught up in new spending schemes or \ntax cut schemes that threaten and endanger this remarkable progress \nthat we have made.\n  I hope that my colleagues, as we go through the legislative agenda of \nthis year, will pay special attention to doing all that we can to \nsecure the economic future for our country. We have, really, very few \nresponsibilities that are more important than laying the groundwork for \nthe economic prosperity and opportunity of the people that we \nrepresent.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S111]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The joint memorandum \nsubmitted to me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy, \nwhich includes a summary of the provisions of the agreement and various \nother attachments, including agency views, is also enclosed.\n  The proposed agreement with the Republic of Kazakhstan has been \nnegotiated in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended \nby the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 and as otherwise amended. \nIn my judgment, the proposed agreement meets all statutory requirements \nand will advance the nonproliferation and other foreign policy \ninterests of the United States. The agreement provides a comprehensive \nframework for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the United States \nand Kazakhstan under appropriate conditions and controls reflecting our \ncommon commitment to nuclear nonproliferation goals.\n  Kazakhstan is a nonnuclear weapons state party to the Treaty on the \nNonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Following the dissolution of \nthe Soviet Union, the Republic of Kazakhstan agreed to the removal of \nall nuclear weapons from its territory. It has a full-scope safeguards \nagreement in force with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \nto implement its safeguards obligations under the NPT. It has enacted \nnational legislation to control the use and export of nuclear and dual-\nuse materials and technology.\n  The proposed agreement with the Republic of Kazakhstan permits the \ntransfer of technology, material, equipment (including reactors), and \ncomponents for nuclear research and nuclear power production. It \nprovides for U.S. consent rights to retransfer, enrichment, and \nreprocessing as required by U.S. law. It does not permit transfers of \nany sensitive nuclear technology, restricted data, or sensitive nuclear \nfacilities or major critical components thereof. In the event of \ntermination, key conditions and controls continue with respect to \nmaterial and equipment subject to the agreement.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  Because this agreement meets all applicable requirements of the \nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, for agreements for peaceful nuclear \ncooperation, I am transmitting it to the Congress without exempting it \nfrom any requirement contained in section 123 a. of that Act.

I am also \npleased to transmit my written approval, authorization, and \ndetermination concerning the agreement, and the memorandum of the \nDirector of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency with \nthe Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement concerning the \nagreement. The joint memorandum submitted to me by the Secretary of \nState and the Secretary of Energy, which includes a summary of the \nprovisions of the agreement and other attachments, including the views \nof the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is also enclosed.\n  The proposed new agreement with Switzerland has been negotiated in \naccordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended by the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (NNPA) and as otherwise amended. \nIt replaces an earlier agreement with Switzerland signed December 30, \n1965, which expired by its terms August 8, 1996. The proposed new \nagreement will provide an updated, comprehensive framework for peaceful \nnuclear cooperation between the United States and Switzerland, will \nfacilitate such cooperation, and will establish strengthened \nnonproliferation conditions and controls including all those required \nby the NNPA. The new agreement provides for the transfer of moderator \nmaterial, nuclear material, and equipment for both nuclear research and \nnuclear power purposes. It does not provide for transfers under the \nagreement of any sensitive nuclear technology (SNT). (U.S. law permits \nSNT to be transferred outside the coverage of an agreement for \ncooperation provided that certain other conditions are satisfied. \nHowever, the Administration has no plans to transfer SNT to Switzerland \noutside the agreement.)\n  The proposed agreement has an initial term of 30 years, and will \ncontinue in force indefinitely thereafter in increments of 5 years each \nuntil terminated in accordance with its provisions. In the event of \ntermination, key nonproliferation conditions and controls, including \nguarantees of safeguards, peaceful use and adequate physical \nprotection, and the U.S. right to approve retransfers to third parties, \nwill remain effective with respect to transferred moderator materials, \nnuclear materials, and equipment, as well as nuclear material produced \nthrough their use. The agreement also establishes procedures for \ndetermining the survival of additional controls.\n  Switzerland has strong nonproliferation credentials. It is a party to \nthe\n\n[[Page S112]]\n\nTreat on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and has an \nagreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the \napplication of full-scope IAEA safeguards within its territory. In \nnegotiating the proposed agreement, the United States and Switzerland \ntook special care to elaborate a preamble setting forth in specific \ndetail the broad commonality of our shared nonproliferation commitments \nand goals.\n  The proposed new agreement provides for very stringent controls over \ncertain fuel cycle activities, including enrichment, reprocessing, and \nalteration in form or content and storage of plutonium and other \nsensitive nuclear materials. The United States and Switzerland have \naccepted these controls on a reciprocal basis, not as a sign of either \nParty's distrust of the other, and not for the purpose of interfering \nwith each other's fuel cycle choices, which are for each Party to \ndetermine for itself, but rather as a reflection of our common \nconviction that the provisions in question represent an important norm \nfor peaceful nuclear commerce.\n  In view of the strong commitment of Switzerland to the international \nnonproliferation regime, the comprehensive nonproliferation commitments \nthat Switzerland has made, the advanced technological character of the \nSwiss civil nuclear program, the long history of U.S.-Swiss cooperation \nin the peaceful uses of nuclear energy without any risk of \nproliferation, and the long-standing close and harmonious political \nrelationship between Switzerland and the United States, the proposed \nnew agreement provides to Switzerland advance, long-term U.S. approval \nfor retransfers to specified facilities in the European Atomic Energy \nCommunity (EURATOM) of nuclear material subject to the agreement for \nreprocessing, alteration in form or content, and storage, and for the \nreturn to Switzerland of recovered nuclear materials, including \nplutonium, for use or storage at specified Swiss facilities. The \nproposed agreement also provides advance, long-term U.S. approval for \nretransfers from Switzerland of source material, uranium (other than \nhigh enriched uranium), moderator material, and equipment to a list of \ncountries and groups of countries acceptable to the United States. Any \nadvance, long-term approval may be suspended or terminated if it ceases \nto meet the criteria set out in U.S. law, including criteria relating \nto safeguards and physical protection.\n  In providing advance, long-term approval for certain nuclear fuel \ncycle activities, the proposed agreement has features similar to those \nin several other agreements for cooperation that the United States has \nentered into subsequent to enactment of the NNPA. These include U.S. \nagreements with Japan and EURATOM. Among the documents I am \ntransmitting herewith to the Congress is an analysis of the advance, \nlong-term approvals contained in the proposed U.S. agreement with \nSwitzerland. The analysis concludes that the approvals meet all \nrequirements of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended.\n  I believe that the proposed agreement for cooperation with \nSwitzerland will make an important contribution to achieving our \nnonproliferation, trade, and other significant foreign policy goals.\n  In particular, I am convinced that this agreement will strengthen the \ninternational nuclear nonproliferation regime, support of which is a \nfundamental objective of U.S. national security and foreign policy, by \nsetting a high standard for rigorous nonproliferation conditions and \ncontrols.\n  Because the agreement contains all the consent rights and guarantees \nrequired by current U.S. law, it represents a substantial upgrading of \nthe U.S. controls in the recently-expired 1965 agreement with \nSwitzerland.\n  I believe that the new agreement will also demonstrate the U.S. \nintention to be a reliable nuclear trading partner with Switzerland, \nand thus help ensure the continuation and, I hope, growth of U.S. civil \nnuclear exports to Switzerland.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  Because this agreement meets all applicable requirements of the \nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, for agreements for peaceful nuclear \ncooperation, I am transmitting it to the Congress without exempting it \nfrom any requirement contained in section 123 a. of the Act.

Reg. 5079, January 25, 1995). \nThe Order blocks all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which \nthere is any interest of 12 terrorist organizations that threaten the \nMiddle East peace process as identified in an Annex to the Order. The \nOrder also blocks the property and interests in property subject to \nU.S. jurisdiction of persons designated by the Secretary of State, in \ncoordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney \nGeneral, who are found (1) to have committed, or to pose a significant \nrisk of committing, acts of violence that have the purpose or effect of \ndisrupting the Middle East peace process, or (2) to assist in, sponsor, \nor provide financial, material, or technological support for, or \nservices in support of, such acts of violence. In addition, the Order \nblocks all property and interests in property subject to U.S. \njurisdiction in which there is any interest of persons determined by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Secretary of \nState and the Attorney General, to be owned or controlled by, or to act \nfor or on behalf of, any other person designated pursuant to the Order \n(collectively ``Specially Designated Terrorists'' or ``SDTs'').\n  The Order further prohibits any transaction or dealing by a United \nStates person or within the United States in property or interests in \nproperty of SDTs, including the making or receiving of any contribution \nof funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of such persons. \nThis prohibition includes donations that are intended to relieve human \nsuffering.\n  Designations of persons blocked pursuant to the Order are effective \nupon the date of determination by the Secretary of State or her \ndelegate, or the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control \n(OFAC) acting under authority delegated by the Secretary of the \nTreasury. Public notice of blocking is effective upon the date of \nfiling with the Federal Register, or upon prior actual notice.\n  Because terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East \npeace process and vital interests of the United States in the Middle \nEast, on January 21, 1998, I continued for another year\n\n[[Page S113]]\n\nthe national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures \nthat took effect on January 24, 1995, to deal with that emergency. This \naction was taken in accordance with section 202(d) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)).\n  2. On January 25, 1995, the Department of the Treasury issued a \nnotice listing persons blocked pursuant to Executive Order 12947 who \nhave been designated by the President as terrorist organizations \nthreatening the Middle East peace process or who have been found to be \nowned or controlled by, or to be acting for or on behalf of, these \nterrorist organizations (60 Fed. Reg. 5084, January 25, 1995). The \nnotice identified 31 entities that act for or on behalf of the 12 \nMiddle East terrorist organizations listed in the Annex to Executive \nOrder 12947, as well as 18 individuals who are leaders or \nrepresentatives of these groups. In addition, the notice provided 9 \nname variations or pseudonyms used by the 18 individuals identified. \nThe list identifies blocked persons who have been found to have \ncommitted, or to pose a significant risk of committing, acts of \nviolence that have the purpose or effect of disrupting the Middle East \npeace process or to have assisted in, sponsored, or provided financial, \nmaterial, or technological support for, or services in support of, such \nacts of violence, or are owned or controlled by, or act for or on \nbehalf of other blocked persons. The Department of the Treasury issued \nthree additional notices adding the names of three individuals, as well \nas their pseudonyms, to the List of SDTs (60 Fed. Reg. 41152, August \n11, 1995; 60 Fed. Reg. 44932, August 29, 1995; and 60 Fed. Reg. 58435, \nNovember 27, 1995).\n  3. On February 2, 1996, OFAC issued the Terrorism Sanctions \nRegulations (the ``TSRs'' or the ``Regulations'') (61 Fed. Reg. 3805, \nFebruary 2, 1996). The TSRs implement the President's declaration of a \nnational emergency and imposition of sanctions against certain persons \nwhose acts of violence have the purpose or effect of disrupting the \nMiddle East peace process. There has been one amendment to the TSRs, 31 \nC.F.R. Part 595 administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of \nthe Department of the Treasury, since my report of August 5, 1997. The \nRegulations were amended on August 25, 1997. General reporting, \nrecordkeeping, licensing, and other procedural regulations were moved \nfrom the Regulations to a separate part (31 C.F.R. Part 501) dealing \nsolely with such procedural matters (62 Fed. Reg. 45098, August 25, \n1997). A copy of the amendment is attached.\n  4. Since January 25, 1995, OFAC has issued three licenses pursuant to \nthe Regulations. These licenses authorize payment of legal expenses of \nindividuals and the disbursement of funds for normal expenditures for \nthe maintenance of family members of individuals designated pursuant to \nExecutive Order 12947, and for secure storage of tangible assets of \nSpecially Designated Terrorists.\n  5. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from July 22, 1997, through January 22, 1998, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the national emergency with respect to organizations \nthat disrupt the Middle East peace process are estimated at \napproximately $165,000. These data do not reflect certain costs of \noperations by the intelligence and law enforcement communities.\n  6. Executive Order 12947 provides this administration with a tool for \ncombating fundraising in this country on behalf of organizations that \nuse terror to undermine the Middle East peace process. The order makes \nit harder for such groups to finance these criminal activities by \ncutting off their access to sources of support in the United States and \nto U.S. financial facilities. It is also intended to reach charitable \ncontributions to designated organizations and individuals to preclude \ndiversion of such donations to terrorist activities.\n  Executive Order 12947 demonstrates the United States determination to \nconfront and combat those who would seek to destroy the Middle East \npeace process, and our commitment to the global fight against \nterrorism. I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to \napply economic sanctions against extremists seeking to destroy the \nhopes of peaceful coexistence between Arabs and Israelis as long as \nthese measures are appropriate, and will continue to report \nperiodically to the Congress on significant developments pursuant to 50 \nU.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to permit the exclusive \napplication of California State regulations regarding reformulated \ngasoline in certain areas within the State; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n              THE MTBE CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will amend the Clean Air Act to allow California to operate its \nown reformulated gasoline program, which is stricter than the federal \nprogram and meets the air quality requirements set forth in the 1990 \nClean Air Act.\n\n\n                           What the bill does\n\n  The bill provides that if a state's reformulated gasoline rules \nachieve equal or greater emissions reductions than federal regulation, \nthat state's rules will take precedence. This works to exempt \nCalifornia from overlapping federal oxygenate requirements.\n  The bill is the Senate version of legislation introduced last year in \nthe House by Congressman Brian Bilbray (R-San Diego) and cosponsored by \n46 members of the California Congressional delegation.\n  The bill applies only to states which have received waivers under \nSection 209(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, for which California is the \nonly state currently eligible for such a waiver.\n  By exempting California from the oxygenate requirement, this \nlegislation will give gasoline manufacturers the flexibility to reduce \nor even eliminate the use of gasoline oxygenates, such as methyl \ntertiary butyl ether (MTBE)--which has been detected in alarming \namounts in California groundwater.\n  The legislation allows the companies who serve California's gasoline \nneeds to continue to adopt better methods of producing California \nCleaner Burning gasoline, without being restricted by oxygenate \nrequirements.\n\n\n                     california air quality history\n\n  California's efforts to improve air quality predate similar federal \nefforts, and have achieved marked success in reducing toxic emission \nlevels, resulting in the cleanest air Californians have seen in \ndecades. This trend will continue with the passage of this bill.\n  Since the introduction of the California Cleaner Burning Gasoline \nprogram, there has been a 300 ton per day decrease in ozone forming \ningredients found in the air. This is the emission reduction equivalent \nof taking 3.5 million automobiles off the road. California reformulated \ngasoline reduces smog forming emissions from vehicles by 15 percent.\n  The state has also has seen a marked decrease in first stage smog \nalerts, during which residents with respiratory ailments are encouraged \nto stay indoors.\n  California Environmental Protection Agency Chairman John Dunlop, who \nsupports this legislation, says:\n\n       . . . our program has proven (to have) a significant effect \n     on California's air quality. Following the introduction of \n     California's gasoline program in the spring of 1996, monitor \n     levels of ozone . . . were reduced by 10 percent in Northern \n     California, and by 18 percent in the Los Angeles area. \n     Benzene levels (have decreased) by more than 50 percent.\n\n  Although California has made great progress in decreasing the amount \nof toxins in the air, the overlap of federal regulations, on top of the \nstrict state regulations, does not allow the state much flexibility in \nthe design and implementation of its reformulated fuels program.\n  This inflexibility makes it difficult for gasoline producers to \nrespond effectively to unforeseen problems associated with their \nproduct. Such is the case with the oxygenate MTBE leaking into \nCalifornia groundwater.\n  Refiners are bound by federal law to include an oxygenate in their \ngasoline, even if they can make gasoline which meets Clean Air Act \nemissions requirements without its use.\n  Thus, the need for the legislation is twofold--to streamline \noverlapping federal and state regulations, and to allow gasoline \nmanufacturers the flexibility to make California Cleaner Burning \nGasoline without oxygenated fuels.\n\n\n           Federal reformulated gasoline requirement history\n\n  Federal reformulated gasoline, and the oxygenate requirement included \nin it, came as a response to the worsening air quality of many American \ncities.\n  For many years major cities, including San Diego, Sacramento and Los \nAngeles, were facing serious pollution problems due to increasing \namounts of smog and ozone in the air.\n  As the air quality worsened, people around the country began \nexperiencing more frequent respiratory illnesses, and increased asthma \nattacks due to the toxins in the air.\n  In 1990, Congress recognized the gravity of this national problem and \namended the Clean Air Act to ensure that our nation's most smoggy and \npolluted areas were the beneficiaries of tougher motor vehicle emission \ncontrol standards.\n  One of these amendments directed the United States Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) to adopt a federal reformulated gasoline \nprogram for urban areas with the most serious pollution problems.\n  The federal reformulated gasoline program mandated that this new \ncleaner burning gasoline reduce emissions of benzene, a known human \ncarcinogen, and other toxins.\n  The federal program also mandated that this reformulated gasoline \ncontain 2 percent by weight oxygenate, which functions to make the gas \nburn more completely and efficiently.\n\n\n                    california reformulated gasoline\n\n  By December 1994, the oxygenate requirement went into effect. In \nCalifornia, this mandate affected three cities in particular, where the \nair quality was the worst.\n  Reformulated gasoline was required to be sold during the winter \nseason in the greater Los Angeles, San Diego and Sacramento regions. \nThis gasoline contained 11 percent MTBE, in order to meet the federal \noxygenate requirement.\n  While federal Clean Air Act regulations were being promulgated, the \nCalifornia Air Resources Board developed even tougher and more \nstringent environmental standards. However, these standards permitted \nmore flexibility in how they could be achieved by California's gasoline \nmanufacturers.\n  By establishing a State Implementation Plan which restricts eight \ndifferent properties that affect emissions of toxic air pollutants and \nozone forming compounds, California's stricter regulations were \napproved by the U.S. EPA and are federally enforceable.\n  Additionally, California regulations contain an innovative predictive \nmodel which is based on the analysis of a large number of vehicle \nemission test studies. Refiners have the option of using this model to \nproduce reformulated gasoline as long as its usage results in \nequivalent or greater reductions in emissions than federal regulations. \nCalifornia EPA states that the predictive model ``shows that a \ndifferent formulation will achieve equivalent or better air quality \nbenefits.''\n  While the amendments to the Clean Air Act have helped reduce \nemissions throughout the United States, they imposed limitations on the \nlevel of flexibility that U.S. EPA can grant to California.\n  The overlapping applicability of both the federal and state \nreformulated gasoline rules has actually prohibited gasoline \nmanufacturers from responding as effectively as possible to unforeseen \nproblems with their product. This bill addresses exactly this type of \nsituation.\n  This legislation rewards California for its unique and effective \napproach in solving its own air quality problems by permitting it an \nexemption from federal oxygenate requirements as long as tough \nenvironmental standards are enforced.\n\n[[Page S115]]\n\n              mtbe contamination of california groundwater\n\n  This legislation will allow refiners to address the problems that \nhave occurred with the use of MTBE as it has leaked into groundwater \nsupplies.\n  Such problems were certainly not anticipated during the drafting of \nthese amendments, and therefore only exemplifies the need for a \nCalifornia exemption to this requirement.\n  MTBE is a highly soluble organic compound which moves quickly through \nsoil and gravel, therefore posing a more rapid threat to aquifers than \nthe other constituents of gasoline when leaks occur. MTBE is easily \ntraced, but very difficult and expensive to clean up.\n  Higher quantities of MTBE in drinking water has a smell similar to \nturpentine and a taste like paint thinner.\n  Although we do not have all of the data we need to determine the \npotential damage of MTBE to our water and our health, we do know that \nit is increasingly a problem for California:\n  MTBE has been detected in drinking water supplies in a number of \ncities including Santa Monica, Riverside, Anaheim, Los Angeles and San \nFrancisco;\n  MTBE has also been detected in numerous California reservoirs \nincluding Lake Shasta in Redding, San Pablo and Cherry reservoirs in \nthe Bay Area, and Coyote and Anderson reservoirs in Santa Clara;\n  The largest contamination occurred in the city of Santa Monica, which \nlost 75% of its ground water supply as a result of MTBE leaking out of \nshallow gas tanks beneath the surface;\n  MTBE has been discovered in publicly owned wells approximately 100 \nfeet from City Council Chamber in South Lake Tahoe;\n  In Glennvile, California, Near Bakersfield, MTBE levels have been \ndetected in groundwater as high as 190,000 parts per billion--\ndramatically exceeding the California Department of Health advisory of \n35 parts per billion; and\n  250 underground fuel tank sites have leaked MTBE in Santa Clara \nCounty not far from water wells used by the residents of San Jose.\n  In the face of mounting evidence of extensive MTBE contamination in \nCalifornia groundwater, several gasoline manufacturers, including \nChevron and Tosco (Union 76), have made it clear they would like to \nhave the flexibility to use only the amount and type of oxygenate \nnecessary to continue to meet the environmental specifications of clean \nburning gasoline.\n  Many manufacturers believe that it is possible to meet California's \nmore stringent clean air standards using reduced amounts of, or in some \ncases, no oxygenate in their gasolines.\n  In a recent letter to me, Chevron chairman Ken Derr expressed \nhis belief that while he believes MTBE is safe if handled properly, his \ncompany is exploring other options. He says:\n\n       (Chevron has) taken another look at the extensive body of \n     data that relates to fuel composition to vehicle emissions \n     and have concluded that it may be possible to make more \n     gasoline without MTBE and still meet California's cleaner \n     burning gasoline standards.\n\n  If California refiners can meet the stricter state clean air standard \nwhile reducing or eliminating the use of a chemical that is \ncontaminating California water, it makes good sense to give them the \nflexibility they need to solve the problem.\n  By amending the Clear Air Act to waive the requirement for oxygenates \nin California, which already has in place its own stricter standards, \nthis legislation does not detract in any way from the gains in emission \nreductions mandated in the Clear Air Act. It will simply allow for \ncompanies like Chevron to meet Clean Air Act requirements, while \nmaximizing the advantages of increased flexibility in order to respond \nmore efficiently and effectively to any unforseen problems encountered \nin the production of California cleaner burning gasoline.\n  If exempting California from the oxygenate requirement meant \nweakening the Clear Air Act in any way, I would be the first person to \nstand up and lead the battle against such an effort.\n  This bill does not weaken the Clear Air Act, but instead is a step in \nthe right direction, towards sound environmental policy.\n  This narrowly-targeted legislation simply makes sense. With this \nbill, California is once again taking the initiative to lead the way in \nensuring the protection of the air we breathe, and the water we drink.\n  By allowing the companies that supply our state's gasoline to utilize \ngood science and sound environmental policy, we can achieve the goals \nset forth by the Clear Air Act, without sacrificing California's clean \nwater.\n  In short, when we pass this legislation, we will take another step \nforward in ensuring that protecting our air qualify does not come at \nthe expense of safeguarding our water.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1576\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Senator Snowe, who has worked on this issue for many years. \nSenator Roberts, who has taken an active interest in this issue. \nSenator Specter, who made an enormous contribution to the development \nof this bill. And Senator Susan Collins, who we are very fortunate to \nhave on our child care proposal.\n  Last night, in his State of the Union Address to the nation, \nPresident Clinton issued a challenge to Congress to develop child care \nlegislation in a bipartisan manner with the Administration. Well, that \nis exactly what we are doing today.\n  Our proposal is straightforward and far-reaching. It makes the \ncurrent child care credit more equitable for lower and middle income \nfamilies. And, for the first time, makes the credit available to \nfamilies where one parent stays at home to care for the children. That \nis a critical step and an important change for families across America.\n  Raising children in today's world is a true challenge. In many \nfamilies, both parents must work in order to support the family. Often, \nthe child care expenses consume all or most of one parent's income. How \noften do we hear the refrain, particularly from women, that after they \npay for day care, there is little or nothing left of their wages.\n  Another common complaint is from parents who desperately want to stay \nhome and raise their children themselves--especially in those very \ncritical, early years of childhood--but who simply cannot afford to \nforego that second income.\n  The legislation we are introducing today responds to both of these \nconcerns. We believe that parents should make their own decisions about \nwho is going to care for their children. The government and the tax \ncode should not be promoting one choice over another.\n  By making more of the existing child care tax credit available to \nlower and middle income families, and making it available also to \nfamilies where one parent stays at home, we are sending the message \nthat the choice is yours, and we support your choice.\n  Our bill makes several changes to the existing dependent care tax \ncredit.\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\nFirst, the maximum credit percentage is increased from 30 percent to 50 \npercent to provide more benefits to those most in need. Second, the \nincome level at which the maximum credit begins to be reduced is moved \nfrom $10,000 to $30,000, so that more lower-income families will \nqualify for the maximum amount of assistance. Third, we propose to \ncompletely phase out the credit for wealthier families. Finally, \nfamilies where one spouse stays at home to care for the children will \nbe eligible for a credit similar to the one they would receive if both \nparents were working outside the home and the child was in daycare.\n  We also acknowledge that we cannot solve the entire child care \nproblem through the tax code alone. Many low-income families do not \nhave taxable income, and therefore cannot benefit from a tax credit. \nThe Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) provides critical \nfunding to help these lower-income families--and I have been a strong \nsupporter of the program. Recognizing the critical role CCDBG plays in \nsubsidizing daycare for low-income families in the states, our proposal \ndoubles the block grant over a five-year period.\n  Of course, the problem with child care is not limited to just \naffordability. Many parents cannot find an available child care slot. \nOur proposal addresses this issue of accessibility by providing a tax \ncredit to businesses to build or renovate on or near-site child care \ncenters for their employees.\n  Finally, there is the issue of quality daycare. Parents cannot be \nproductive in the workplace if they are constantly worrying about the \nhealth and safety of their children in daycare. We have all read the \nhorrifying stories in the newspapers about daycare facilities that are \nunsafe or unsanitary, about the poor record of enforcement of standards \nin many states.\n  while we acknowledge that the federal government should not be \nsetting standards for daycare providers, we do believe the states \nshould set at least minimum health and safety standards and enforce \nthem rigorously. Our legislation beefs up this enforcement by rewarding \nstates with a good enforcement record and penalizing those with poor \nrecords.\n  I am very proud of this legislation, and proud that this group was \nable to come together and produce this initiative. Child care is a \nproblem that must be solved, and we are committed to doing that. I look \nforward to working with the President and my colleagues in the Congress \nto find workable, affordable solutions for all families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1577\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n               SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join my \ncolleagues in introducing the ``Caring for Children Act,'' which will \nease the financial burden of child care for American families--for \nthose parents who work, and for those who choose to stay home to raise \ntheir children for a period of time. The sponsors of this legislation \nrecognize the importance of affordable quality child care to the \nsuccessful development of our children.\n  Our bill would expand the Dependent Care tax credit to make it more \naccessible to families who need it, double the authorization for the \nChild Care Development Block Grant, and provide grants to small \nbusinesses to create or enhance child care facilities for their \nemployees. This bill also includes provisions from the proposal I \nintroduced last year with my colleague, Congressman Jon Fox, ``The \nAffordable Child Care Act,'' which provides a tax credit for employers \nwho provide on-site or site-adjacent child care to their employees in \norder to reduce the child care expenses of the employee.\n  Not all families choose the same option for child care. Many families \nrely on relatives, centers operated by churches and other religious \norganizations, centers at or near their workplace, or make other \narrangements to provide care for their children while they work. In \nlight of the diverse needs for child care in America, this bill \nrepresents a good start toward expanding the choices for American \nparents. And, any such legislation must recognize that there is a need \nto provide some relief to families where one parent stays at home.\n  The need for affordable and accessible day care is critical given the \nincreasing numbers of working parents and dual-income families in the \nUnited States. According to the Bureau of the Census, in 1975, 31 \npercent of married\n\n[[Page S120]]\n\nmothers with a child younger than age one participated in the labor \nforce. By 1995, that figure had risen to 59 percent. Almost 64 percent \nof married mothers and 53 percent of single mothers with children \nyounger than age six participated in the labor force in 1995.\n  The cost of child care for families is also significant. Licensed day \ncare centers in some urban areas cost as much as $200 per week, and the \ndisparity in costs and availability of child care between urban and \nrural grows greater every day. For families which need or choose to \nhave both parents work outside the home, the burden of making child \ncare decisions is great. These figures serve to underscore the need for \naction on the part of the Federal government to provide the necessary \nassistance to our nation's working families.\n  As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I am pleased that this legislation would \nbuild on an existing federal child care program by authorizing an \nadditional $5 billion over five years to the Child Care Development \nBlock Grant program, bringing total spending for this program to $2.5 \nbillion annually by FY2002. The CCDBG program which works well in \nassisting low-income families acquire child care and helped over 93,000 \nPennsylvania families last year. By increasing the authorization, we \ncan help even more families without creating a new entitlement program.\n  Our legislation will also require States to create and enforce safety \nand health standards in child care facilities, and provide money for \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to disseminate information \nto parents and providers about quality child care, through brochures, \ntoll-free hotlines, the Internet, and other technological assistance.\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' complements my recent efforts to \nassist working families in the context of welfare reform and children's \nhealth insurance. When Congress debated welfare reform in 1995 and \n1996, I worked to ensure that adequate funds were provided for child \ncare, a critical component for welfare mothers who would be required to \nwork to receive new limited welfare benefits. I am pleased that the \nwelfare reform bill that became law provides $20 billion in child care \nfunding over a six year period. Similarly, I was pleased to participate \nin the bipartisan effort in 1997 to enact legislation to provide $24 \nbillion over the next five years for States to establish or broaden \nchildren's health insurance programs.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that it is critical that the \n105th Congress not adjourn without enacting legislation to assist \nfamilies in their ability to afford safe, quality child care for their \nchildren, either at home with a parent or another arrangement. Our \nlegislation will provide peace of mind to millions of American families \nstruggling to balance career and child raising. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in cosponsoring this important legislation, and I urge its \nswift adoption.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, eight years ago, Congress passed and \nPresident Bush signed the landmark Child Care and Development Block \nGrant Act. I was proud to have helped lead the effort, and I am proud \nof what our states have been able to accomplish since its \nimplementation.\n  But, it is also clear that we must do more to help families. In my \nhome state of Utah, more than half of the children under age 6 have \neither their only parent or both parents in the workforce.\n  The ``Child Care Connection,'' a four-county resource and referral \nprogram, reported last year that there were five major Salt Lake area \nzip codes that had zero openings for infants.\n  Utah child care officials have reported that there are too few slots \ngenerally for infants and toddlers and for special needs children.\n  It is my pleasure to be here today with Senators Chafee, Snowe, \nRoberts, and Specter, each of whom has a long track record of \ninvolvement in child care issues. We believe that we have developed a \ncomprehensive, yet realistic, child care proposal that will augment the \nability of the child care block grant to serve families in each state.\n  Of particular note, this proposal recognizes the choice that many \nfamilies make to have one parent remain at home as primary caregiver. \nAs important as it is to assist low- and middle-income families with \nnecessary out-of-home child care expenses--and our proposal will \nincrease the Dependent Care Tax Credit for such families--it is also \nimportant for us to realize the value of a parent in the home and that \nthe sacrifice of a second income is also a child care expense.\n  Additionally, our proposal will not create major new programs in need \nof permanent funding. We do not intend to spend federal dollars on \nbigger bureaucracy in the name of expanding child care. We want \navailable resources to be put directly in the hands of parents through \ntax credits and in the hands of states to address specific gaps in \navailability and enforcement of health and safety standards.\n  Our bill takes a very balanced approach to the issues of \naffordability, availability, and quality.\n  Child care costs, of course, are a significant part of a family \nbudget. The average cost of child care has been estimated at over $4000 \nper child. This is a substantial increase from the $3000 average it was \nwhen we enacted the Child Care and Development Block Grant eight years \nago. Clearly, low- and middle-income taxpayers devote a larger share of \ntheir earnings to child care.\n  And, at a time when we are trying to move families off of public \nassistance and into employment, child care has to be a key element of \ntransitional support.\n  Our bill increases the Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) for working \nparents. Our bill raises the maximum credit from 30 percent to 50 \npercent. And, it raises the maximum income level for the maximum credit \nfrom $10,000 to $30,000. No change is made in the maximum allowable \nexpenses of $2400 for one child and $4800 for two or more children.\n  Thus, a family in St. George, Utah, earning $30,000, with two \nchildren, would receive a tax credit of $2400. Under current law, this \nfamily's credit would be $960.\n  Both our bill and the proposal made by the Clinton administration \nbegin to gradually reduce the percentage of the credit at $30,000, but \nthe ``Caring for Children Act'' reduces the credit at a slower rate. \nThus, families earning between $30,000 and $75,000 will receive a \nbigger tax benefit than under either President Clinton's proposal or \ncurrent law.\n  We can afford to provide larger benefits for this income group \nbecause we have recommended a phase-out of the credit entirely for \nfamilies with incomes of $105,000 or more. Under current law, there is \nno income limit for eligibility for the DCTC. This is one tax credit \nthat wealthy taxpayers do not need.\n  But, our bill, the ``Caring for Children Act,'' goes one step \nfurther. The bill I have developed along with Senators Chafee, Snowe, \nRoberts, and Specter would, for the first time, recognize child care \nprovided by a parent.\n\n  Our bill would extend eligibility for the Dependent Care Tax Credit \nto families with young children in which one parent remains at home as \ncaregiver. How would this work? The bill would impute monthly child \ncare expenses of $150 to families with children age 3 and under. For \nexample, a family in Morgan, Utah, earning $30,000 a year and having \none or more children under age 3, would receive a $900 tax credit. It \nworks this way: 50% credit $150 monthly imputed expenses 12 months = \n$900.\n  I would like to see this tax break be even more generous. I will work \ntoward that end. But, given our budget realities, this ground-breaking \nextension of the DCTC is feasible. And, I believe it is an essential \ncomponent of the ``Caring for Children Act.''\n  It is high time we recognize the value of stay-at-home parents. This \ntax credit in no way offsets their work or their monetary sacrifices; \nbut it does, at last, give a mother or father in the home standing in \nour tax code. It transforms the Dependent Care Tax Credit from an \nemployment-based credit to a child-based credit.\n  These two changes to the DCTC will put money--their own money I might \nadd--back into the pockets of America's families.\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' also deals with the issue of \navailability. As I mentioned, there are areas where child care--\nparticularly infant care,\n\n[[Page S121]]\n\nafter school care, or care for special needs children--is tough to \nfind. The substantial increase we are recommending for the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant (CCDBG) will provide states with the \nability to address shortages as well as to increase support to low-\nincome families.\n  President Clinton has recommended solving the availability problem by \ncreating two new programs, one for after school care and one geared to \nearly childhood. While I can appreciate the President's concern that \nthere may be few choices out there for parents who depend on out-of-\nhome care, I do not believe it makes sense to create new programs when \nthe CCDBG already permits such programs. I think the answer is not to \nsecond guess how the states have chosen to allocate their scarce \nresources under the block grant, but rather to give the states some \nadditional resources so that they can better meet their own priorities.\n  We are proposing a $5 billion increase in the CCDBG over five years. \nThese additional resources will give states much more flexibility in \ntheir planning. States will be able to provide subsidies for a greater \nnumber of the eligible population; they will be able to finance child \ncare programs in underserved areas of the state; they will be able to \naddress particular shortages. And, they will be able to better enforce \ncritical health and safety standards.\n  I am a firm believer that states should be able to set their own \nrules and regulations for child care providers. I do not believe that \nthe federal government can or should interfere with child care \naffordability in our various states by setting national standards that \nare unrealistic. Moreover, to the extent that child care standards \nreflect the values as well as the economic conditions of any given \nstate, the federal government has no business micromanaging them.\n  But, I also believe that states that participate in the block grant \nprogram--and that would be all of them--have an obligation to ensure \nthat children are in safe and healthy environments. And, they have an \nobligation to see that such standards are adequately enforced. A \nsanitary standard is no standard at all if it is unenforced.\n  It may not matter where you have your car washed, but it absolutely \nmatters who is taking care of your child.\n  Therefore, the ``Caring for Children Act'' puts some teeth into the \nrequirement for inspections under the block grant. A state that \ninspects a threshold number of facilities subject to inspection will be \neligible for a 10 percent bonus. After the second year, a state failing \nto inspect a minimum number of child care sites will be subject to a 10 \npercent penalty.\n  Additionally, our bill authorizes $50 million a year for HHS to \nundertake two important quality enhancing activities. First, more \ninformation about child care can be made available to parents. Consumer \ninformation about automobiles, credit cards, and well-baby care are \navailable. I believe parents would welcome more information on what to \nlook for in a child care center or family-based care setting. I also \nbelieve that parents are the best form of accountability in child care. \nSecond, to assist providers and child care workers enhance the quality \nof their services, the bill would enable HHS to award grants for the \ndevelopment of a technology infrastructure for distance learning.\n  Many child care providers are in rural areas. Traditional training in \nthe form of workshops and college classes are not practical. Programs \nfor child care providers that could be developed and made available \nthrough distance learning, however, could prove a viable alternative as \nwell as a valued help. My home state of Utah, I might add, has been a \nleader in the distance learning arena. I have no doubt that such a \nformat would be eagerly received in my state.\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' contains several other provisions of \ninterest. In order to test the effectiveness of small business \nconsortia as employer-based child care providers, the bill authorizes \n$60 million over three years for demonstration grants.\n  To increase the awareness of the existing Dependent Care Assistance \nProgram (DCAP), a tax provision that permits employees to authorize \ntheir employers to withhold up to $5000 of the employee's salary in a \nDCAP account for child care expenses to be paid by the employer, the \n``Caring for Children Act'' authorizes $1 million a year for the next \nfive years to the Secretary of Labor to conduct outreach to both \nemployers and employees about this program and its benefits.\n  Finally, the bill would require that child care facilities located in \nfederal buildings for federal employees be held to the same quality \nstandards that apply to child care programs in the state in which the \nfederal facility is located.\n  I believe the measure we have introduced is a balanced approach. It \ndoes not depend entirely on the tax code to address child care issues, \nnor does it depend solely on federal spending.\n  It does not concentrate benefits on only one income group. The DCTC \nexpansion is geared particularly to assist the middle class. The \nincrease in the CCDBG is targeted to subsidies for low-income families.\n  It recognizes that we have to make an investment in our children, but \nit does not propose new federal mandatory spending programs that can \nbecome wildly expensive.\n  Our bill gives careful attention to each of the three cornerstones of \nchild care: affordability, availability, and quality.\n  And, for the first time, federal child care legislation will not \nignore those families who choose to forego one income to have a parent \nremain at home.\n  I want to say again that I am proud to sponsor this bill with my \ncolleagues, Senators Chafee, Snowe, Roberts, and Specter. I urge other \nsenators to join us in this legislation.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to join with my \ncolleagues to introduce legislation to help meet the child care \nchallenges facing families around the nation. Our bill is entitled the \n``Caring for Children Act.''\n  Child care, in the home when possible and outside the home when both \nparents work, goes right to the heart of keeping families strong. \nUnfortunately, finding quality, affordable child care is one of the \nmost pressing problems for families in Kansas and around the country.\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' takes the first steps to address this \nchallenge through a responsible approach. This legislation expands \nchild care opportunities without expanded government costs or intrusion \nin our lives. This legislation builds into the existing network without \nadding more government intervention or mandates. This legislation will \nhelp families that have two working parents and families that have a \nstay-at-home parent. This legislation will help to increase the supply \nof quality of child care.\n  First, in order to provide additional tax relief and increase \naffordability of child care, we expand the Dependent Care Tax Credit \n(DCTC) by raising the income level to $30,000 at which families become \neligible for the maximum tax credit. We also raise the maximum \npercentage of child care expenses that parents can deduct to 50 \npercent. These changes make the DCTC more realistic for families that \nface increasing child care costs.\n  Increasing the income level and the percentage of child care expenses \nthat are deductible will help families where both parents work. But, we \nalso recognize that families who choose to have one parent remain at \nhome have child care expenses as well. Therefore, we extend eligibility \nfor the DCTC to families with a stay-at-home parent. This provides \ngreater options to more families and leaves child care choices where \nthey should be--with the family. In order to target this credit to \nparents who need it the most and meet our fiscal responsibilities, the \ncredit is phased out for higher income wage earners.\n  Small businesses play a critical role in providing child care options \nto millions of working parents. Unfortunately, small businesses \ngenerally do not have the resources required to start up and support a \nchild care center. The ``Caring for Children Act'' includes a short-\nterm, flexible grant program to encourage small businesses to work \ntogether to provide child care services for employees. This program is \nmore of a demonstration project that will sunset at the end of three \nyears. In the meantime, small businesses will be eligible for grants up \nto $100,000 for start-up costs, training, scholarships, or other \nrelated activities. Businesses\n\n[[Page S122]]\n\nmust continue to meet state quality and health standards. Businesses \nwill be required to match federal funds to encourage self-sustaining \nfacilities well into the future.\n  ``Caring for Children'' also includes provisions to provide a tax \ncredit of expenses up to $500,000 for employers who choose to \nconstruct, renovate, or operate on- or near-site child care facilities \nfor their employees. And, ``Caring for Children'' includes funding to \npromote greater availability of the Dependent Care Assistance Program \n(DCAP) for families with children. This will allow the Department of \nLabor to conduct outreach to businesses to promote awareness of the \nDCAP program.\n  All children deserve quality care. Although all states have health \nand safety standards in place, many times these regulations are not \nenforced. ``Caring for Children'' includes incentives for states to \nimprove their inspection efforts and ensure that facilities are in \ncompliance with their own state standards. The bill also authorizes \nfunding for the Department of Health and Human Services to get more \ninformation in the hands of parents and help child care providers \naccess child care training programs.\n  Finally, we authorize additional funding for the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant. This program sends federal assistance to \nstates, permitting them to allocate resources where they are most \nneeded in the state. We maintain maximum flexibility and allow states \nto make decisions about how to address their own child care challenges.\n  Child care is an issue that impacts each and every one of us. While \nparents continue to struggle to meet the constant demand of work and \nfamily, we must continue to do our part to expand child care options \nand protect our nation's most valuable resource, our children. I look \nforward to working with all of my colleagues in this important effort.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleagues, Senators Hatch, Roberts, Specter, and Chafee to introduce a \nbill that I believe is an historic opportunity to help ensure the well-\nbeing of our children and by extension the very well-being of our \nnation: the Caring for Children Act.\n  I come before you as a veteran on child care issues who has worked to \naddress child care throughout my political life, and was the lead \nRepublican cosponsor on the Act for Better Child Care in 1989--the bill \nwhich set the stage for the bipartisan package that was adopted by the \n101st Congress. Since that time we have advanced the ball in profound \nways that reflect the changing nature of the American family, but our \nwork must never cease when it comes to our children. We must build on \nour laurels, not rest on them: and that is precisely what this bill \ndoes.\n  Consider the challenge: In California alone in 1997, 500,000 children \nwere already on waiting lists for federal child care in--half a \nmillion! Now, it is estimated that, as welfare reform proceeds, some 2 \nmillion parents across America will join the workforce and their \nchildren will require child care. A GAO report from May of last year \ndetermined that in Chicago, for example, the known supply of child care \nwould only meet 14 percent of the need for infant child care in the \nfirst year of welfare reform implementation. And within three years, 3 \nout of 4 American women with children under 5 will be working and in \nneed of child care.\n  With the perspective of years spent on this issue, I have come to the \nconclusion that what American parents need most are choices. The \ndecision of how to care for a young child is a deeply personal and \ndifficult one. Many feel handcuffed by economic concerns, others worry \nabout the safety of child care, but all face different circumstances \nthat make the decision making process unique.\n  Given the tremendous challenges of raising children today, and the \nextraordinary range of issues facing families, I believe the federal \ngovernment should not be in the business of encouraging one choice over \nanother. Instead the government's role must be to ensure that families \nhave viable options and that the basis for decisions is the best \ninterests of the child. If we are to care about children we must care \nabout choices, and not politicize the issue with partisanship or \nideology.\n  That is the spirit in which we crafted our bill. Because it is not \nabout pitting one group against another. It is not about starting a \n``mommy war''. It is about helping parents do the best they can for \ntheir children--no matter what choice they make.\n  The reality is that, despite our best efforts to date to make \nquality, affordable child care accessible, the myriad pressures facing \nAmerican families today still imperil their ability to provide the best \npossible care for their children. In my home state of Maine, one out of \nevery five Mainers are working multiple jobs. Across the country, 63 \npercent of women with children under age six are in the workforce, and \nas a result, over 12 million children are cared for by someone other \nthan a parent during working hours. In Maine, there are 42,000 women in \nthe labor force with children under 6, and 64,000 with children between \nthe ages of 6 and 17.\n  At the same time, child care costs can range from $4,000 to $9,000 \nannually--with families earning less than $14,000 per year paying more \nthan one quarter of their income in child support. As a result, \nfamilies are often forced to make a choice between two unacceptable \noptions: find care for their children that may not be safe or \nappropriate, or stay home and hope that they can somehow still put food \non the table.\n  Our bill respects parents' decisions and expands the choices \navailable in a number of innovative ways. By expanding the Dependent \nCare Tax Credit, we make it more affordable for parents to choose \nquality child care, but we also leave the door open for a parent to \nstay at home with their child. And we target our tax benefits to those \nwho need them most: working American families.\n  For two-working parent families with child care expenses, we raise \nthe income level at which parents can take the maximum credit from \n$10,000 to $30,000, allowing more parents to take advantage of the \nmaximum tax credit. In addition, we raise the percentage of child care \nexpenses that parents can put toward their credit to 50% (up from 40% \nunder current law) of expenses up to $2400 for one child, or $4800 for \ntwo or more children. The credit will phase down 1% for every $1500 of \nincome above $30,000, phasing out completely for families earning over \n$105,000 per year. Under this new scheme, the maximum tax credit will \nbe $1200 for one child (up from $720), or $2400 for two or more \nchildren (up from $480).\n  For the first time, parents who forgo an income to stay at home to \ntake care of a child between the ages of 0-3 will be able to take \nadvantage of the Dependent Care Tax Credit. By attributing child care \nexpenses to stay at home parents of $150 per month, they will be \neligible for a maximum tax credit of up to $900 per year, depending on \ntheir income. Applying the tax credit to parents who wish to stay \nhome for children ages 0-3 acknowledges that parents of infants and \ntoddlers often face the toughest decisions between working or staying \nat home, particularly in light of recent research in the area of early \nchildhood development which demonstrates that care from one or two \nconsistent, loving and stimulating caregivers during these earliest \nyears is crucial to brain development.\n\n  The Caring for Children Act will also help defray the considerable \ncosts of child care for low-income families by doubling funding for the \nChild Care and Development Block Grant, to the time of $5 billion. This \nwill create more child care slots for low-income families and double \nthe amount of money devoted to improving quality, again leaving more \noptions for parents.\n  And we also address the issue safety, because parents are still \nrightfully concerned about safety. According to a US News and World \nReport article last August, a query of all 50 states and the District \nof Columbia revealed that 76 children died in day care in 1996. The \ncauses included drownings, falls, and being struck by automobiles. And \nthese numbers are low because, shockingly, some states do not even \ntrack day care deaths. In terms of oversight, the US News report \nrevealed that in Virginia, for example, the state had failed to make \nmandatory twice-a-year inspections of 722 of its 4,200 licensed \nfacilities in 1996; 159 centers were not visited even once.\n  No parents should have to fear for their child's safety--no parent \nshould\n\n[[Page S123]]\n\never get that dreaded call that their child was hurt at day care. \nBringing a young child to day care in the morning should not be an act \nof faith--it should be an act of confidence. While states have the \nresponsibility to set health and safety standards, states need to be \nheld accountable for enforcing these standards by adhering to the \ninspection-schedule that they establish under state law. Accordingly, \nour bill provides a 10 percent bonus in CCDBG funding to states that \nmeet targeted inspection rates, while penalizing those by 10 percent \nthat don't meet their existing responsibility to ensure health and \nsafety. This gives our bill ``teeth'' to ensure that child care is safe \nand children are protected.\n  Finally, we encourage more American businesses to become partners in \nchild care by offering then tax credits for child care operation, \nconstruction and renovation expenses up to $500,000. And recognizing \nthat it is not always feasible for small businesses to assist with \nchild care, we offer grants to small employers to provide such care. \nBusinesses already have an incentive to provide child care in that \nparents who are confident in their child care arrangements are more \nreliable, productive workers. These initiatives will not only create \nmore slots and make child care more affordable for parents and \nbusinesses alike, but it will help literally bring care closer to more \nparents.\n  In closing, let me emphasize that this bill is an investment in our \nnation's future. It is a statement by the federal government that there \ncan be no greater cause--no more noble a purpose than providing for our \nchildren. How a nation raises its youth and the value it places on \ngiving children a chance to grow up safe, happy, and healthy speaks \nvolumes to its greatness. This legislation won't make decisions easier \nfor parents but it will ensure that they have a full range of options \navailable to them as they seek to do the very best they can for their \nchildren. That's why I'm proud to be here today and that's why I will \nwork hard to ensure the passage of the Caring for Children Act. Thank \nyou.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Coats, Mr. Faircloth and Mr. \n        Ashcroft):\n  S. 1578. A bill to make available on the Internet, for purposes of \naccess and retrieval by the public, certain information available \nthrough the Congressional Research Service web site; to the Committee \non Rules and Administration.\n\n\n               CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to introduce a bill that will \nmake Congressional Research Service Reports, Issue Briefs, and \nAuthorization and Appropriations products available on a web site to \nthe American people. Senator Coats, Senator Faircloth, and Senator \nAshcroft are original co-sponsors to this bill. Additionally, \nRepresentative Shays will be introducing a companion bill over in the \nHouse.\n  The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has a well-known reputation \nfor producing high-quality reports and issue briefs that are unbiased, \nconcise, and accurate. Many of us have used these CRS products to make \ndecisions on a wide variety of legislative proposals and issues, \nincluding Amtrak, the Endangered Species Act, the Line Item Veto, and \nU.S. policy in Zambia. Also, we routinely issue these products to our \nconstituents in order to help them understand the important issues of \nour time.\n  This fiscal year, the American taxpayer will pay $64.6 million to \nfund the Congressional Research Service. Newspapers, such as the San \nJose Mercury-News and the Austin American-Statesman, and watchdog \ngroups, such as the Congressional Accountability Project, have recently \nasked the Congress to allow the public access to CRS resources. The \nAmerican people have paid for these valuable resources and have a right \nto see that their money is being well spent.\n  Congress can also serve two important functions by allowing public \naccess to this information. First, public access to these CRS products \nwill mark an important milestone in opening up the federal government. \nOur constituents will be able to see the research documents which \ninfluenced our decisions and understand the trade-offs and factors that \nwe consider before a vote. This will give the public a more accurate \nview of the Congressional decision-making process to counter the \nprevailing cynical view of Members of Congress selling their votes to \nthe highest campaign contributor.\n  Also, these CRS reports will serve an important role in informing the \npublic. Members of the public will be able to read these CRS products \nand receive a concise, accurate summary of the issues that concern \nthem. As elected representatives, we should do what we can to promote \nan informed, educated public. The educated voter is best able to make \ndecisions and petition us to do the right things here.\n\n  The Internet provides an ideal way to inform the public while not \ndistracting CRS from its primary mission to serve Congress. The \nDirector of CRS can simply post CRS products on a web site, and then \nvoters can look up information without any extra effort by CRS \nresearchers. The public will not be allowed to write responses or \nresearch requests to CRS, so that valuable CRS time will not be \ndiverted from helping us to do our jobs. Confidential requests by \nMembers of Congress will not be released to the public. It is my intent \nthat CRS establish a separate web site that will serve the public \nwithout otherwise causing CRS to do anything drastically different from \nits current operations when it posts CRS products on the web site \naccessible to Members of Congress.\n  I recognize that there have been a few questions about this bill. \nThere are concerns disseminating CRS material via the Internet will \nremove its protection under the Speech and Debate Clause. At present, \nno court case has directly addressed this issue. However, the Supreme \nCourt acknowledged in its concurrence to Doe versus McMillan that a \nlegislator's function in informing the public concerning matters before \nCongress should be protected by the Speech and Debate Clause, similar \nto communications which relate directly to the legislative process. \nFurthermore, my bill gives the CRS Director discretion to not release \nmaterial that he determines is confidential. This aspect of my bill has \nbeen upheld in similar circumstances where the U.S. District Court \nmaintained the confidentiality of the underlying research used to \ncreate reports by Congressional support agencies. I am including in the \nRecord a letter by Mr. Stanley M. Brand, a former General Counsel to \nthe House of Representatives, who agrees that my legislation will not \nthreaten CRS' protection under the Speech and Debate Clause.\n  I am also aware of potential copyright concerns if the CRS \ninformation is made accessible to the public. For example, CRS has \ninformed me that it does not have a copyright agreement that will allow \nit to make the maps used in CRS products available electronically. I \nbelieve we can work out an equitable solution to resolve any copyright \nconcerns that would prevent any CRS Report, Issue Brief, or \nAuthorization or Appropriations product from being electronically \ndisseminated to the public.\n  Another concern has been raised about the 30 day delay between the \nrelease of CRS material to Members of Congress and their staff and its \nrelease to the public on the web site. This delay will make sure that \nCRS has carried out its primary statutory duty of informing Congress \nbefore releasing information the public. Also, it will allow CRS to \nverify that its products are accurate and prepare them for public \nrelease in order to protect CRS from liability problems and the \nAmerican people from being misinformed.\n  I would like to stress that opening up these select CRS products to \nthe public will in no way compete with existing commercial information \nservices. The public will have access to selected CRS products that are \ncurrently available only to Members of Congress and their staff.

John McCain and Daniel Coats,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senators McCain and Coats: We happily endorse your \n     draft legislation to put Congressional Research Service (CRS) \n     reports and products on the Internet, including CRS Issue and \n     Legislative Briefs, and Authorization and Appropriation \n     products.\n       CRS products are some of the finest research prepared by \n     the federal government. They are a precious source of \n     government information on a huge range of topics. In a recent \n     editorial, Roll Call described CRS reports as ``often the \n     most trenchant and useful monographs available on a \n     subject.'' Citizens, scholars, journalists, librarians, \n     businesses, and many others have long wanted access to CRS \n     reports via the Internet.\n       We believe that taxpayers ought to be able to read the \n     research that we pay for. But citizens cannot obtain most CRS \n     products directly. Instead, we must purchase them from \n     private vendors, or engage in the burdensome and time-\n     consuming process of requesting a member of Congress to send \n     CRS products to us. Often, citizens must wait for weeks or \n     even months before such a request is filled. This barrier to \n     obtaining CRS products serves no useful purpose, and damages \n     citizens' ability to participate in the congressional \n     legislative process.\n       James Madison aptly described why the public needs \n     reliable, accurate information about current events: ``A \n     popular Government, without popular information, or the means \n     of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; \n     or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: \n     And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm \n     themselves with the power which knowledge gives.''\n       Your bill falls squarely within the spirit of Madison's \n     honorable words.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing to amplify the comments \n     that I recently made to the press concerning applicability of \n     the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 6, cl. \n     1, to certain CRS products which your bill would, if enacted, \n     make available on the Internet. Juliet Eilperin, Memo Claims \n     That McCain Legislation to Put CRS Reports Online Could Have \n     Constitutional Problems, Roll Call, January 15, 1998, p. 8.\n       First, as General Counsel to the House of Representatives I \n     litigated virtually scores of cases involving the Speech or \n     Debate Clause, including a landmark case before the Supreme \n     Court reaffirming the central function of the clause in \n     protecting the legislative branch from judicial and executive \n     branch interference, United States v. Helstoski; 442 U.S. \n     477, Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U.S. 500 (1979); see also, \n     Vander Jagt v. O'Neill, 699 F.2d 1166 (D.C. Cir. 1983); In Re \n     Grand Jury Investigation, 587 F.2d 589 (3d Cir. 1978); United \n     States v. Eilberg, 507 F. Supp. 267 (E.D. Pa. 1980); Benford \n     v. American Broadcasting Co., 98 F.R.D. 42 (D. Md. 1983), \n     rev'd sub nom. In Re: Guthrie, 735 F.2d 634 (4th Cir. 1984). \n     Many of these cases which I litigated were cited in the CRS \n     memorandum as supporting their conclusion that publication on \n     the Internet would adversely affect the Speech or Debate \n     Clause privilege.\n       I believe that the concerns expressed in the CRS memorandum \n     are either overstated, or the extent they are not, provide no \n     basis for arguing that protection of CRS works will be \n     weakened by your bill. I also want you to know that I was, \n     and remain, a strong advocate for vigorous assertion and \n     protection of the Speech or Debate Clause privilege as a \n     great bulwark of the separation of powers doctrine that \n     protects the Congress from Executive and Judicial branch \n     encroachment.\n       The CRS memorandum states ``extensive involvement by CRS in \n     the informing function might cause the judiciary and \n     administrative agencies to reassess their perception of CRS \n     as playing a substantial role in the legislative process, and \n     thereby might endanger a claim of immunity even in an \n     instance in which CRS was fulfilling its legislative \n     mission.''\n       This fear is simply unfounded. While the courts have \n     consistently relegated the so-called ``informing function'' \n     to non-constitutionally protected status, they have also \n     steadfastly refused to permit litigants to pierce the \n     privilege for activities that are cognate to the legislative \n     process despite later dissemination outside the Congress. So, \n     for example, in McSurely v. McClellan, 553 F.2d 1277, 1286 n. \n     3 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (en banc), the Court refused to allow a \n     litigant to question Senate aides about acts taken within the \n     Committee, even though acts of dissemination outside the \n     Congress were subject to discovery. Publication of a CRS \n     product on the Internet would no more subject CRS employees \n     to questioning about the basis for their work, consultations \n     with colleagues or the sources of that work, than would be \n     the case if the same CRS product were obtained by means other \n     than the Internet. Indeed, the fact that House and Senate \n     proceedings are televised does not alter the applicability of \n     the clause to floor speeches, committee deliberations, staff \n     consultation, or other legislative activities. Even certain \n     consultations concerning press relations are protected though \n     dissemination to the media is not protected. Mary Jacoby, \n     Hill Press Releases Protected Speech, Roll Call, April 17,\n\n[[Page S125]]\n\n     1995, p. 1 (the Senate Legal Counsel argued that because a \n     legislative discussion is embedded in a press release doesn't \n     entitle a litigant to question staff about the substance of \n     the legislation); see also Tavoulareas v. Piro, 527 F. Supp. \n     676, 682 (D.D.C. 1981) (court ordered congressional deponents \n     to merely identify documents disseminated outside of Congress \n     but did not permit questions regarding preparation of the \n     documents, the basis of conclusions contained therein, or the \n     sources who provided evidence relied upon in the documents), \n     Peroff v. Manual, 421 F. Supp. 570, 574 (D.D.C. 1976) \n     (preparation of a Committee witness by a congressional \n     investigator is protected because ``facially legislative in \n     character''). Under this line of caselaw, it is difficult to \n     foresee how the mere dissemination of a CRS product could \n     subject any CRS employee to inquiry concerning the \n     preparation of such a product. In short, because ``discovery \n     into alleged conduct of [legislative aides] not protected by \n     the Speech or Debate Clause can infringe the [legislative \n     aides'] right to be free from inquiry into legislative acts \n     which are so protected,'' McSurely v. McClellan, 521 F.2d \n     1024, 1033 (D.C. Cir. 1975), aff'd en banc by an equally \n     divided court, 553 F.2d 1277 (1976) courts have imposed the \n     Clause as a bar to any inquiry into acts unrelated to \n     dissemination of the congressional reports.\n       In Tavaulareas v. Piro, 527 F. Supp. at 682, the court \n     ruled ``[t]he fact that the documents were ultimately \n     disseminated outside the Congress does not provide any \n     justification'' for piercing the privilege as to the staff's \n     internal use of the document. Accord McSurely v. McClellan, \n     553 F.2d at 1296-1298 (use and retention of illegally seized \n     documents by Committee not actionable); United States v. \n     Helstoski, 442 U.S. 477, 489 (1979) (clause bars introduction \n     into evidence of even non-contemporaneous discussions and \n     correspondence which merely describe and refer to legislative \n     acts in bribery prosecution of Member); Eastland v. United \n     States Serviceman's Fund, 421 U.S. at 499 n. 13 (subpoena to \n     Senate staff aide for documents and testimony quashed because \n     ``received by [the employee] pursuant to his official duties \n     as a staff employee of the Senate'' and therefore ``. . . \n     within the privilege of the Senate''). See also United States \n     v. Hoffa, 205 F. Supp. 710, 723 (S.D. Fla 1962), cert, denied \n     sub nom Hoffa v. Lieb, 371 U.S. 892 (wiretap withheld by \n     defendant by ``invocation of legislative privilege by the \n     United States Senate'').\n       In the Tavoulareas case, in which I represented the House \n     deponents, part of the theory of plaintiff's case against the \n     Post was the reporter ``laundered'' the story through the \n     committee ``as a means of lending legitimacy'' to the stories \n     and information provided by other sources, Tavoulareas v. \n     Piro, 93 F.R.D. at 18. In pursuance of validating this \n     theory, the plaintiff sought to prove that the committee \n     never formally authorized the investigation, but rather that \n     the staff merely served as a conduit and engaged in no bona \n     fide investigation activity. The court ruled that ``although \n     plaintiffs have repeatedly suggested that the subject \n     investigation was not actually aimed at uncovering \n     information of valid legislative interest . . . it is clear \n     that such assertions, even if true, do not pierce the \n     legislative privilege.''\n       As a practical matter, therefore, a litigant suing or \n     seeking to take testimony from a CRS employee based on \n     dissemination of a report alleged to be libelous or \n     actionable may be unable to obtain the collateral evidence \n     needed to prove such a claim--a serious impediment to \n     bringing such a case in the first place.\n       Even in the case of Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S.C. 306 (1973) \n     relied on by the CRS memorandum to support its narrow view of \n     the Clause's protection, the Court of Appeals on remand \n     stated: ``Restricting distribution of committee hearings and \n     reports to Members of Congress and the federal agencies would \n     be unthinkable.'' 566 F.2d 713, 718 (D.C. Cir. 1977). It \n     would be similarly unthinkable to subject CRS to broad \n     ranging discovery simply because its work product was made \n     available on the Internet.\n       The CRS memorandum raises the specter that litigants might \n     even seek ``the files of CRS analysts'' in actions \n     challenging the privilege. It is beyond peradventure of \n     doubt, however, that publication of even alleged defamatory \n     or actionable congressional committee reports does not \n     entitle a litigant to legislative flies used to created \n     in preparing such a report. United States v. Peoples \n     Temple of the Disciples of Christ, 515 F. Supp. 246, 248-\n     49 (D.D.C. 1981) In re: Guthrie, Clerk, U.S. House of \n     Representatives, 773 F.2d 634 (4th Cir. 1984), Eastland v. \n     United States Servicemen's Fund, 421 U.S. at 499, n. 13. \n     Given the foregoing caselaw, I fail to see a realistic \n     threat that CFS employees will be subjected to any \n     increased risk of liability, or discovery of their files. \n     Of course, nothing can prevent litigants from filing \n     frivolous or ill-founded suits, but their successful \n     prosecution or ability to obtain evidence from legislative \n     files seems remote and nothing in your bill would change \n     that.\n       The CRS memoranda even goes so far as to suggest that \n     claims of speech or debate immunity for CRS products might \n     lead to in camera inspection of material, itself an incursion \n     into legislative branch discretion. Yet in the very case \n     cited to by CRS memo, no court ordered in camera inspection \n     of House documents. In Re: Guthrie, supra, involved no camera \n     inspection of legislation documents. These cases are \n     typically litigated on the basis of the facial validity of \n     the privilege and few, if any, courts of which I am aware \n     have even gone so far as to order in camera inspection. See \n     United States v. Dowdy, 479 F. 2d 213, 226 (4th Cir. \n     1973)(``Once it was determined, as here, that the legislative \n     function. . .was apparently being performed, the proprietary \n     and motivation for the action taken as well as the detail of \n     the acts performed, are immune from judicial inquiry''). \n     Under the Clause, courts simply do not routinely resort to in \n     camera review to resolve privilege disputes. Given the now \n     highly developed judicial analysis of the applicability of \n     the Clause to modern legislative practices it rarely occurs. \n     In one recent celebrated case cited to by the CRS, the Court \n     upheld a claim of privilege for tobacco company documents \n     obtained by Congress even though they were alleged to have \n     been stolen, without ever seeking in camera review. Brown & \n     Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Williams, 62 F.3d 408, 417 (D.C. \n     Cir. 1995) (``Once the documents were received by Congress \n     for legislative use--at least so long as congressmen were not \n     involved in the alleged theft--an absolute constitutional ban \n     of privilege drops like a steel curtain to prevent B from \n     seeking discovery'').\n       In an abundance of caution, and to address CRS' concerns, \n     you might consider adding the following language to the bill: \n     ``Nothing herein shall be deemed or considered to diminish, \n     qualify, condition, waive or otherwide affect applicability \n     of the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, or any other \n     privilege available to Congress, its agencies or their \n     employees, to any CRS product made available on the Internet \n     under this bill.''\n       I appreciate the CRS sensitivity to subjecting its \n     employees, or their work product, to searching discovery by \n     litigants. Based on the very good caselaw protecting their \n     performance of legislative duties and the strong \n     institutional precedent in both the House and Senate in \n     defending CRS against such intrusions, I do not believe your \n     bill creates any greater exposure to such risks that already \n     exists.\n       I hope my views are helpful in your deliberations on this \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stanley M. Brand.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona in introducing legislation directing the \nCongressional Research Service to make available, on-line, CRS Reports, \nIssue Briefs, and more comprehensive CRS reports on federal \nauthorizations and appropriations.\n  CRS is funded with over $64 million in taxpayer money every year and \nproduces perhaps the most prolific and quality research available on \npolicy and legislative issues. In making available information and \nmaterials that are used every day by Members and their staffs in \ndeveloping policy initiatives and legislation, we will be opening a \nmore informed relationship between the American people and the Congress \nthat serves them.\n  Beyond the tremendous value of informing the American people on the \nissues before their Congress, this legislation will help to shine some \nlight on the federal government, allowing the American people to see \nthe documents which influence the decision-making process.\n  Mr. President, FDR once said that, ``The only bulwark of continuing \nliberty is a government strong enough to protect the interest of the \npeople, and people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain \nits sovereign control over its government.'' At a time when public \ncynicism about government is at an all-time high, when government has \nencroached upon virtually every aspect of our daily lives, this \nstatement is particularly poignant.\n  As I have stated, CRS information briefs play a critical role in \nassisting Members of Congress in policy development and the legislative \nprocess. By making these products readily available to the American \npeople, who pay for them, we hold out the promise of demystifying a \nlegislative process that has become so complex and arcane that many \nAmericans have simply tuned out.\n  Mr. President, more than ever, information is power. It is my hope \nthat the effect of this legislation will be to give a better informed \npublic more power over their government.\n\n[[Page S126]]\n\n  My intention today is to keep my remarks short. As this legislation \nmoves through the process, I will ask my colleagues to indulge me with \nmore time to discuss the bill in detail. I would like to commend \nSenator McCain for his leadership on this issue, and to ask my \ncolleagues for their support in this effort to make the Congress more \naccessible to the people. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Frist, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Reed, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Bingaman):\n\n  S. 1579. A bill to amend the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to extend the \nauthorizations of appropriations for such Act, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               THE REHABILITATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1998\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, on September 17, 1997, as a member of the \nSenate Labor and Human Resources Committee and as Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Employment and Training, I introduced S. 1186, the \nWorkforce Investment Partnership Act. This legislation represents a \ntremendous effort to reshape our country's job training system, \neliminate its fragmented and ineffective programs, and prepare it for \nthe new demands of the next century.\n\n  Today, in the same spirit, I introduce the reauthorized \nRehabilitation Act and am very pleased to be joined by Senators \nJeffords, Kennedy, Wellstone, Harkin, Frist, Collins, Reed, and Chafee.\n  The Rehabilitation Act is the country's only Federally funded job \ntraining program for individuals with disabilities. If we are to truly \nreshape the country's job training programs--and begin to create a \nseamless system--we must bring all the programs, including vocational \nrehabilitation, in line with each other. We must link their efforts to \ntrain and place individuals. And we must ensure cooperation and \nawareness among their personnel.\n  Reauthorizing the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 gives us the perfect \nopportunity to ensure that the vocational rehabilitation (VR) system \ndoes just that.\n  It links the VR system to the states' new job training systems under \nthe Workforce Investment Partnership Act.\n  It streamlines the VR system, and eliminates unnecessary and wasteful \nrequirements on state agencies.\n  It improves the provision of services that lead to more jobs and \nbetter jobs for individuals with disabilities.\n  And it reauthorizes the Rehabilitation Act for 7 years, to mirror the \nreauthorization schedule of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act.\n  Linking the VR system to states' new workforce systems should not be \nconfused with compromising the integrity of the VR system. Under no \ncircumstances, proposed either in this reauthorization or in S. 1186, \nwill funding for VR be jeopardized or diluted. However, no one should \nunderestimate the importance of cooperation and awareness between the \ntwo systems, and the strong statutory links that are necessary to \nensure such cooperation.\n  Mr. President, let me elaborate on some of the links included in this \nreauthorization.\n  First, one member of a state's State Partnership, under S. 1186, \nwould also be a member of a state's State Rehabilitation Council. State \nRehabilitation Councils are responsible for advising state VR agencies \nand helping them develop the state plan for implementing rehabilitation \nservices. Input from a State Partnership will help assure that the \nprograms do not duplicate each other's efforts.\n  Second, a state's VR agency is required to develop cooperative \nagreements with other components of the state's workforce investment \nsystem. These agreements should include: Arrangements for interagency \nstaff training; arrangements to share data electronically regarding \nlabor market information and information on specific job vacancies; \narrangements to use common intake procedures, forms, and referral \nprocedures; agreements to share client databases; and arrangements for \nresolving interagency disputes.\n  Third, the Rehabilitation Services Agency Commissioner, who is \nrequired to submit a report to Congress and the President on the \nactivities carried out under the Rehabilitation Act for a fiscal year, \nmust now include in his report the same information required in the \nWorkforce Investment Partnership Act.\n  Linking the reporting requirements helps assure that VR and the state \nworkforce systems will be evaluated on the same results, including \nstatistics on job placement, job retention six and twelve months after \nplacement, and on how many did or did not complete their training.\n\n  Finally, the bill clearly states that its purpose is to ``assist \nstates in operating statewide comprehensive, coordinated, effective, \nefficient, and accountable programs of vocational rehabilitation, each \nof which is an integral part of a statewide workforce investment \nsystem.''\n  After establishing significant links between state workforce systems \nand state vocational rehabilitation systems, my second objective in \nthis bill is to streamline the existing VR system. For example:\n  First, the duplicative and wasteful requirements to develop state \nplans were removed. For example, the entire concept of a ``strategic \nplan'' requiring states to develop already existing or required goals \nand standards elsewhere is eliminated. In addition to saving time for \nstate administrators, this means that states would no longer have to \nspend 1.5% of their Federal allotment on the ``strategic plan.'' In \nOhio, this means a savings of close to 3 million dollars--savings the \nstate of Ohio could now spend on providing services and getting people \njobs.\n  Second, eligibility procedures also have been simplified. Under this \nreauthorization bill, an individual could demonstrate eligibility for \nVR services based on information attained from another program with \neither the same or higher eligibility criteria. Therefore, state \nagencies would not longer have to reinvent the wheel to determine \neligibility for individuals who can already demonstrate it.\n  Mr. President, in addition to linkages and streamlining, we have \nvastly improved the VR system in several ways.\n  First, all individuals eligible for VR programming would now receive \nat least basic services. Current law allows states under an ``order of \nselection'' to ignore eligible individuals who have come for job \nassistance if they do not meet the state's definition of ``most \nseverely disabled.'' Now, even those disabled individuals who would not \notherwise be served must receive at least evaluative services, job \nplacement information, and referral services. A state may opt to \nprovide additional services to these individuals, but not everyone will \nhave access to basic assistance and information.\n  Second, individuals' roles in developing their own ``Individualized \nRehabilitation Employment Plans'' have been strengthened. Individuals \nwith disabilities, who will always have the opportunity of working as a \nteam with a VR counselor, will also have more choice as to what their \nplan will provide.\n  Third, the dispute resolution process between clients and state \nagencies has been vastly improved, ensuring real due process for all \nparties. No longer will a state VR administrator be allowed to review \ndecisions in which the state agency is always a party. Under this \nreauthorization bill, it is a state's option to have an administrative \nreview of an initial decision, but this review must be conducted by \nsomeone not affiliated with the state VR agency.\n  If a state does not have such a review, any appeals from an initial \nhearing proceed directly to civil court.\n  Furthermore, assuming both parties agree, mediation is now an option \nfor either the state VR agency or the individual.\n  Finally, one of the most positive changes emphasizes the value of \nself-employment as a possibility for individuals with disabilities. \nIndividuals with disabilities, together with their VR counselors, can \ndevelop plans in which their goal is to be self-employed. It is a step \nthat gives VR clients more choice in how they will live their lives and \nbecome more independent members of their communities.\n  Before I conclude, Mr. President, I would like to point out the broad \nbipartisan support for this bill and its link to the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act enjoys. Members from both sides of the \naisle, the Department of\n\n[[Page S127]]\n\nEducation, and many interest groups worked together in a very open \nnegotiation to produce this legislation--one that will truly improve \nthe lives of millions of people.\n  I thank the Chairman of the Labor Committee, Senator Jeffords; the \nRanking Member of the Committee, Senator Kennedy; the Ranking Member of \nthe Employment and Training Subcommittee, Senator Wellstone, and my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin for all the work they and their \nstaffs put into this process. I also would like to thank my colleague \nfrom Tennessee, Senator Frist and his staff for his contribution not \nonly in the 105th Congress, but also for his contributions to \ndeveloping links to our previous workforce bill in the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful the Senate will approve this legislation \nsoon. Passage of this bill will create a system that will improve the \nlives of individuals with disabilities and provide opportunities for \nmore jobs. This bill would streamline the VR system, making it more \nefficient and effective, and couple the vocational rehabilitation \nsystem's job training efforts with states' workforce systems' efforts \nto develop a seamless system of job training.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

While the rate of increase for white \n     Americans is 3.2 percent, the rate of increase for racial and \n     ethnic minorities is much higher: 38.6 percent for Latinos, \n     14.6 percent for African-Americans, and 40.1 percent for \n     Asian-Americans and other ethnic groups. By the year 2000, \n     the Nation will have 260,000,000 people, one of every three \n     of whom will be either African-American, Latino, or Asian-\n     American.\n       ``(2) Rate of disability.--Ethnic and racial minorities \n     tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately \n     high rate. The rate of work-related disability for American \n     Indians is about one and one-half times that of the general \n     population. African-Americans are also one and one-half times \n     more likely to be disabled than whites and twice as likely to \n     be significantly disabled.\n       ``(3) Inequitable treatment.--Patterns of inequitable \n     treatment of minorities have been documented in all major \n     junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As \n     compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-\n     American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system \n     is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a \n     larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without \n     being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training \n     than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is \n     spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.\n       ``(4) Recruitment.--Recruitment efforts within vocational \n     rehabilitation at the level of pre-service training, \n     continuing education, and in-service training must focus on \n     bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in \n     order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role \n     models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly \n     changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.\n       ``(b) Outreach to Minorities.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For each fiscal year, the Commissioner \n     and the Director of the National Institute on Disability and \n     Rehabilitation Research (referred to in this subsection as \n     the `Director') shall reserve 1 percent of the funds \n     appropriated for the fiscal year for programs authorized \n     under titles II, III, VI, and VII to carry out this \n     subsection.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenators DeWine, Kennedy, Wellstone, Harkin, Frist, Collins, Chafee, \nand Reed in introducing the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. We \nbegan the process of drafting this bipartisan, consensus-based \nlegislation shortly after completing the reauthorization of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Just as we sought \nthe assistance of the disability community and professionals who serve \nindividuals with disabilities in determining the direction we took in \ndrafting the IDEA legislation, so we did with this bill. Just as we \nwelcomed the assistance of the Administration in drafting the IDEA \nlegislation, so we did with this bill.\n  As a result, this legislation will open up more employment \nopportunities to individuals with disabilities. It will also provide \nState vocational rehabilitation agencies and others who provide \nemployment-related assistance to individuals with disabilities with the \ntools they need to provide appropriate, timely help to individuals with \ndisabilities who want to work. The combination of the 1997 \nreauthorization of IDEA and this reauthorization brings us closer to a \nseamless system in which parents of children with disabilities will \nenvision and expect greater opportunities for their children to have \nproductive and satisfying lives as adults.\n  The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1997 will increase opportunities \nfor individuals with disabilities to prepare for, secure, maintain, and \nregain employment by linking vocational rehabilitation services to \nthose services that are available under current State workforce systems \nand those that will be available under the Workforce Investment \nPartnership Act of 1997. It will simplify access to vocational \nrehabilitation services and streamline the administration of the \nvocational rehabilitation program. It makes additional improvements in \ndiscretionary\n\n[[Page S169]]\n\nprograms related to personnel training, research, and demonstration \nprojects and consumer-controlled Centers for Independent Living. It \nprovides greater access to information technology. The reauthorization \nwill extend through fiscal year 2004.\n  The bill includes extensive links between vocational rehabilitation \nagencies and State workforce systems. For example, amendments related \nto linkage are found throughout the bill in sections pertaining to the \nfindings and purposes of the legislation, definitions, program \nadministration, reports, information dissemination, and State plan \nrequirements, including those concerning data reporting. Complementary \nand parallel provisions to promote linkage between vocational \nrehabilitation agencies and State workforce systems also are included \nin the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1997.\n  The bill makes important changes in title I of the Act. The State \nplan requirements have been rewritten to simplify administration of the \nvocational rehabilitation program and reinforce its intent, helping \nindividuals secure employment. The amendments reduce the 36 State plan \nrequirements in current law to 24 and require the submission of one \nState plan, with amendments thereafter under certain circumstances. The \nbill allows, when a State is operating under an order of selection, for \ncore services to be available to individuals with disabilities who do \nnot meet a State's criteria for full services from the vocational \nrehabilitation agency. The legislation gives vocational rehabilitation \nagencies the ability to secure financial support from other entities \nwho could or should pay for certain services needed by an individual \nwith a disability, who is being assisted by the vocational \nrehabilitation agency to prepare for or secure a job. The bill requires \nState vocational rehabilitation agencies and State Rehabilitation \nCouncils to jointly develop and conduct a comprehensive needs \nassessment every three years. Based on such an assessment, they will \nannually set and report on progress in achieving employment goals set \nfor individuals with disability. The bill simplifies procedures for \nestablishing eligibility, by requiring consideration of existing \nevaluating information in determining an individual's eligibility for \nvocational rehabilitation services. The bill strengthens eligible \nindividuals' roles in developing their individualized rehabilitation \nemployment plans. Such individuals will be given greater flexibility in \nhow they develop their plans. The amendments give all States dollars \nfor inservice training, and State allotments for training dollars will \nincrease with increases in the Consumer Price Index. The bill requires \nthat voluntary mediation be available for resolving disputes between \nvocational rehabilitation agencies and individuals with disabilities.\n\n  The bill selectively amends other titles in the Rehabilitation Act. \nTitle II, which authorizes the National Institute on Disability and \nRehabilitation Research, is amended to require that all funding \npriorities of the Institute be derived from a five-year plan that will \nbe subjected to public comment and then submitted to Congress. The bill \nexpands the authority of the Institute to allow funding of initiatives \nrelated to the quality assurance of assistive technology and the \neffectiveness of alternative medicine when used to treat individuals \nwith disabilities. The legislation streamlines and updates title III of \nthe Act, which authorizes training and demonstration activities, by \nclearly delineating funding priorities, simplifying the notification of \ninterested parties about upcoming grant opportunities, and permitting \nfunding for training of personnel in one-stop centers so that they will \nbe more able to appropriately and effectively assist individuals with \ndisabilities seeking employment-related assistance through such \ncenters.\n  With guidance from Senator Dodd, we strengthened the provisions in \ntitle V of the Act pertaining to the accessibility of electronic and \ninformation technology for individuals with disabilities by designating \nthat the Access Board to write regulations and by requiring the Office \nof Management and Budget to oversee Federal agencies' compliance with \nsuch regulations. The legislation amends title VI of the Act by adding \na new initiative, Projects in Telecommuting and Self-Employment for \nIndividuals with Disabilities, and by permitting Projects with Industry \nto assist eligible individuals without waiting for referrals or \neligibility status determinations from vocational rehabilitation \nagencies and to provide training and/or placement services.\n  These amendments build on and complement those that were enacted in \n1992. The 1992 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act had a significant, \npositive effect in my State, Vermont.\n  There, one out of every eight residents is disabled. The Division of \nVocational Rehabilitation has enabled many Vermonters with disabilities \nto exercise the choices the 1992 amendments triggered, to become \nemployed, and to live successfully in their communities. In 1996, \nVermont's vocational rehabilitation program provided an array of \nservices to almost 5,000 Vermonters, while directly assisting 850 \nindividuals with disabilities to become successfully employed.\n\n  The benefits of Vermont's efforts are many. Most important is the \nfact that Vermont consumers of vocational rehabilitation services who \nsecure employment enjoy an average increase in income exceeding $8,000 \nper year. Seventy-three percent of these individuals enter the \nworkforce earning more than minimum wage. Seventy-eight percent of \nthose Vermonters who were assisted by the Vermont Division of \nRehabilitation in 1996 remain employed today. In addition, the Vermont \nConsumer Choice Project, made possible by the 1992 amendments, has \nallowed my State to create organizational structures, policies and \npractices that have resulted in a greater degree of informed choice for \nindividuals seeking and receiving vocational rehabilitation services.\n  The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 truly reflect a team effort \nby committed Senators, their staff, Federal officials, individuals with \ndisabilities, rehabilitation professionals and others who know through \nexperience that for individuals with disabilities, as for other \nindividuals, having a job and liking it are the bottom line. Through \nthese amendments we have secured and extended that bottom line for \nindividuals with disabilities--more jobs, better jobs--into the next \ncentury.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was proud to be a sponsor of the \nRehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, and I am proud to support the \ncurrent reauthorization. I commend Senator Jeffords, Senator DeWine, \nand Senator Wellstone for their leadership in expediting our \nconsideration of this important legislation. And I commend all the \nstaff members for their skillful work in making this a successful \nbipartisan consensus bill. I especially thank Senator Tom Harkin for \nhis leadership and continued commitment to individuals with \ndisabilities in this country.\n  The Rehabilitation Amendments of 1992 developed the foundation for a \nrehabilitation system which recognizes competence and choice, and which \ngives individuals with disabilities the services and support they need \nto live, work and participate as fully as possible in their \ncommunities. For millions of individuals with disabilities, vocational \nrehabilitation has meant the difference between dependence and \nindependence, between lost potential and productive careers.\n  Most important, the vocational rehabilitation in this country \nprovides the necessary skills and support to keep the promise of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act--so that all individuals with \ndisabilities, especially those with significant disabilities, will have \nthe opportunity to achieve their full potential and be part of the \nmainstream of American life.\n  The bill being introduced today builds on the gains of the past two \ndecades, by strengthening employment possibilities, encouraging self-\nemployment, providing better outreach to underserved populations, and \nstreamlining the role of the government. This bill also establishes a \nstronger linkage between vocational rehabilitation and the larger \nstatewide job training system.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to enact \nthis important legislation, so that the talents, strengths, competence \nand interests of all individuals with disabilities will be recognized, \nenhanced, and fairly rewarded in communities and workplaces across the \nnation.\n\n[[Page S170]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in co-\nsponsoring the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. I particularly \nwish to thank my Republican colleagues, Senators DeWine and Jeffords, \nfor developing this bill in a bipartisan manner. The bill that we \nintroduce today represents the work of Republicans, Democrats, and the \nAdministration. I am pleased that our work together continues the long \nhistory of bipartisanship in developing legislation that addresses the \nneeds of persons with disabilities.\n  The State Vocational Rehabilitation Service Program provides $2.2 \nbillion in formula grant assistance to States to help individuals with \ndisabilities prepare for an engage in gainful employment. Since \nestablished by the Smith-Fess Act 75 years ago, state vocational \nrehabilitation programs have served some nine million people. This \nprogram promotes economic independence for persons with disabilities, \nand the numbers reflect that:\n  The percentage of individuals who reported that their income was \ntheir primary source of support increased from 18% at the time of \napplication to 71% at the time of exit from the program;\n  The percentage of individuals with earned income of any kind \nincreased from 22% at application to 93% at program exit; and\n  The number of individuals working at or above the Federal minimum \nwage rate increased from 18% at application to 86% at closure.\n  In 1992, Congress made major changes to the Act, namely, increasing \nconsumer participation, streamlining processes, and reducing \nunnecessary paperwork. In the bill we introduce today, we have built on \nthe `92 amendments. The bill preserves and strengthens the themes of \nthe `92 amendments while fine-tuning and aligning the Act with other \nworkforce reforms so that individuals with disabilities can benefit \nfrom them.\n  This bill strengthens the role of the consumer throughout the \nvocational rehabilitation process, particularly in the development of \nthe individual's employment plan. It reduces unnecessary burdens on \nState VR agencies by streamlining the State plan. The bill also \nrefocuses the State plan on improving outcomes for individuals with \ndisabilities by requiring States to develop, jointly with the State \nRehabilitation Council, annual goals and strategies for improving \nresults.\n  The due process protections provided in the State Grant program to VR \napplicants and clients are strengthened by eliminating State VR agency \nreview of decisions by impartial hearing officers. The bill would also \nrequire States to provide for voluntary mediation (modeled on the \nprovisions in IDEA) as another mechanism to resolve disputes.\n  Access of Social Security beneficiaries to VR services if \nfacilitated, and unnecessary gatekeeping is eliminated, by making SSI \nand SSDI beneficiaries presumptively eligible for services under the VR \nState Grants program. This change would eliminate the need for the VR \nagency to determine on a case-by-case basis whether these individuals \n``require'' VR services in order to gain employment.\n  Of particular interest to me and to Senator Dodd are the changes to \nSection 508 of the Act which pertain to electronic and information \ntechnology accessibility. This bill strengthens the provisions \nregarding procurement by Federal agencies of technology that is \naccessible to individuals with disabilities.\n  I am pleased to co-sponsor this bill and look forward to its passage.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. I am pleased to join the Chairman of the \nEmployment and Training Subcommittee, Senator DeWine and the Chairman \nof the Labor and Human Resources Committee Senator Jeffords in \nintroducing the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. I am grateful \nfor their strong leadership in drafting this important legislation.\n  The vocational rehabilitation program was begun in 1921 to help \ndisabled war veterans obtain rehabilitation and employment assistance. \nToday it is a major source of employment assistance for many \nindividuals with disabilities, including individuals with severe \ndisabilities. Vocational rehabilitation programs, although operated by \nState vocational rehabilitation agencies are located throughout a \nState. These programs help about a million individuals with \ndisabilities a year, about 20 percent of whom enter the competitive \nlabor market within 12 months. The average cost per person aided is \nabout $2,500.\n  The Tennessee Vocational Rehabilitation Program provides one example \nof what can happen when the focus of an agency is clear--getting people \nwith disabilities jobs. In 1996, this program in my State served 26,032 \nindividuals with disabilities of which 81 percent were severely \ndisabled. Of the individuals served 5,820 were successfully employed \nwith 90.4 percent of them working in the competitive labor market. The \nannualized income of these 5,820 individuals, once they entered the \nwork force increased from $8.732 million to $64.233 million. I am proud \nof this record, while realizing that more can and should be done.\n  The main goal of the reauthorization, which has previously been \ndiscussed in detail today by Senators DeWine and Jeffords is to \nincrease opportunities for individuals with disabilities to prepare \nfor, secure, maintain, and regain employment. There is also a great \neffort to simplify access to vocational rehabilitation services, while \nreducing costs and increasing effectiveness through streamlining the \nadministration of the vocational rehabilitation program.\n  Also included in this reauthorization is the effort that I began as \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy in the 104th \nCongress, the linking of vocational rehabilitation programs to a new \nstate system of work force development. The intention is to create a \nseamless system of increasing employment assistance for individuals \nwith disabilities with a new state workforce system. The \nreauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act includes this important goal \nby linking vocational rehabilitation services to those that will be \navailable under the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1997.\n  I would like to acknowledge the bipartisan effort brought forth to \nbuild the consensus that is evident by this bill. I am pleased to see \nthe tradition of bipartisanship corporation on disability policy issues \ncontinued through this effort. I would especially like to recognize \nAaron Grau with Senator DeWine, and Dr. Patricia Morrissey with Senator \nJeffords for their hard work and dedication which has made legislation \na reality.\n  I am confident that the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 will \ntake this seventy-seven year old program into the next century as a \nstrong and integral part of providing opportunities for individuals \nwith disabilities to prepare for, secure, maintain, and regain \nemployment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues as one of the original cosponsors of the Rehabilitation Act \nAmendments of 1998. The Rehabilitation Act, originally adopted almost \n80 years ago, has developed during succeeding years into one of this \ncountry's most important efforts assisting disabled persons in \nachieving their potentials for employment.\n  This law authorizes programs helping persons with disabilities attain \ntheir full employment potential as self-supporting, contributing \nmembers of society. It provides supported employment services for \npersons who cannot work independently and offers the services disabled \npersons need to lead independent lives even if an individual is not \ncapable of working. Through the Rehabilitation Act, federal-state \nprograms provide comprehensive services that help persons with physical \nand mental disabilities become employable, achieve independence, and \nparticipate more fully in society.\n  The Rehabilitation Amendments of 1998, which we are introducing \ntoday, reaffirm the commitment of the federal government to its \ndisabled citizens and continues the progress we have seen in previous \nreauthorizations. This bill advances Federal-State rehabilitation \nefforts in numerous ways. This morning I want to mention three of the \nchanges I believe are the most significant: first, the linking of \nvocational rehabilitation services to other workforce investment \nprograms; second, the authorization of core services to individuals not \neligible for services under an order of selection; and third, the \nsimplification of access to vocational rehabilitation services.\n\n[[Page S171]]\n\n  This bill, which will be incorporated into the S. 1186, the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act, will be functionally linked to the state \nworkforce, job training, and vocational and adult education systems \nauthorized by S. 1186. The Rehabilitation Act will thereby become part \nof the effort by Congress to replace a fragmented array of programs \nwith an integrated federal system of workforce development without \nsacrificing the integrity and effectiveness of the vocational \nrehabilitation program. This process is already underway in Maine \nthrough the Maine Department of Labor's one stop career centers. This \nlegislation will make it easier for Maine and other states to create a \nseamless system of employment assistance for our disabled citizens.\n  The second improvement is the authorization of core services to all \neligible disabled persons. Because the Rehabilitation Act requires the \nstates to serve the most severely disabled individuals, large numbers \nof individuals with lesser disabilities have been cut off from \nservices. The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 will permit a state \nto provide core services to those individuals who are not eligible for \nfull services under the state's criteria for order of selection. Under \nthis provision of the law the states may provide individualized \ncounseling and guidance, individualized vocational exploration, \nsupervised job placement referrals, and assistance obtaining reasonable \naccommodations even if the individual does not qualify for actual \nrehabilitation services. This will extend important and highly \neffective services to a large, deserving population and should greatly \nenhance these individuals' success in obtaining employment.\n  A third advance is the simplification of the procedures by which \neligibility for rehabilitation is established. Under these amendments, \nindividuals receiving Supplemental Security Income or Social Security \nDisability Income are presumed to be eligible for services providing \nthey intend to seek employment and have an impediment to employment \ncaused by their disability.\n  In addition to these significant changes that directly affect the \nclients of the vocational rehabilitation program, this act makes \nimportant changes that will make the administration of the vocational \nrehabilitation program more efficient and reduce a state's \nadministrative burden. One example of this is the coordination of a \nstates vocational rehabilitation plan with the submission of the other \njob training plans submitted under the Workforce Investment Partnership \nAct. This will help to eliminate duplicative provisions, submissions \nand reports.\n  Another is the requirement for cooperation and collaboration through \ncooperative agreements among the state's vocational rehabilitation \nagency and other components of a state's workforce investment system. \nWhile these agreements will be most visible as they affect access and \ndelivery of services, they will also bring about coordination of \ninformation and financial management systems leading to simplified and \nimproved management of a state's job training efforts.\n  I am proud to cosponsor the reauthorization of an act which has \nhelped so many disabled individuals achieve employment and independent \nlives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n\n       S. 1580. A bill to amend the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to \n     place an 18-month moratorium on the prohibition of payment \n     under the medicare program for home health services \n     consisting of venipuncture solely for the purpose of \n     obtaining a blood sample, and to require the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services to study potential fraud and abuse \n     under such program with respect to such services; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            The Medicare Venipuncture Assessment Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 took \nimportant steps to begin to combat the financial problems that have \nplagued the Medicare system for some time. However, the BBA included a \nprovision that may disqualify Medicare beneficiaries who receive home \nhealth care stemming from their need for venipuncture services. Many \nAlabamians who rely on the Medicare home health care program have \ncontacted me expressing their concern with this provision. Much of the \nconcern has resulted from a lack of information as to the true effects \nof this provision.\n  Therefore, I rise today to offer the Medicare Venipuncture Assessment \nAct of 1998. This legislation will provide an eighteen month moratorium \non the venipuncture provision included in last year's BBA, and direct \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a study to \ndetermine what the specific effects will be of doing away with \nvenipuncture as a qualifying skill for home health care.\n  In addition, this legislation provides a window of time for Congress \nto address any problems found by HHS, and craft an appropriate solution \nthat protects the seniors who receive home health care, without \nperpetuating fraud and abuse in the system. But perhaps the most \nimportant aspect of the Medicare Venipuncture Assessment Act is that it \nwill provide much needed piece of mind to many of our seniors. Mr. \nPresident, we owe it to our constituents to separate fact from fiction \nwith regard to this matter, and fully inform them of the effects of the \nvenipuncture provision contained in last year's BBA.\n  If administered correctly, home health care can be a cost effective \nalternative to nursing home and hospital based care. This legislation \nprotects the Medicare home health care system by providing specific \nstatutory action to root out fraud and abuse in the program, while \nensuring that the seniors who truly need home care receive it. I \nstrongly encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort by \ncosponsoring the Medicare Venipuncture Assessment Act of 1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. McConnell and Mr. \n        Leahy):\n\n  S. 1581. A bill to reauthorize child nutrition programs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n            THE CHILD NUTRITION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize those child nutrition provisions expiring in 1998. The \nchild nutrition programs have been critically important in helping meet \nthe nutritional needs of our children. Although not all child nutrition \nprograms need to be reauthorized, this process gives us the opportunity \nto review all programs under the National School Lunch Act and the \nChild Nutrition Act of 1966.\n  As an Indianapolis school board member and the city's mayor in the \nlate 1960's and early 1970's, I saw firsthand the need to provide \nnutritional assistance to children. Since that time, the child \nnutrition programs have changed in many ways. Today's programs have \nbeen successful in ensuring that our nation's children have access to \nnutritious foods, providing a critical safety net for children. \nAlthough the programs may need some fine tuning, the programs have \nensured that America's school children, in a country of abundance, have \na chance to eat. This is fundamental and something we must preserve.\n  Some of the larger programs that must be reauthorized include: 1) the \nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, \noften referred to as the WIC program; 2) State Administrative Expenses, \na program which provides grants to states to help cover general \nadministrative costs associated with child nutrition programs; 3) the \nWIC Farmers' Market program which allows states and tribal \norganizations to offer special WIC vouchers to buy fresh produce; 4) \nthe Summer Food Service program which provides reimbursements for meals \nserved to children in summer programs operated in lower-income areas; \nand 5) the requirement to use certain funds to purchase commodities to \nmaintain commodity assistance for child nutrition programs. In \naddition, there are a few other expiring provisions that must be \nreauthorized. This bill extends all expiring programs through 2003. \nAlthough it is not necessary to reauthorize the National School Lunch \nand Breakfast Programs, we hope to review and improve those programs \nduring this reauthorization process.\n  The child nutrition programs continue to successfully feed our \nnation's children to help them prepare for the future. In 1997, \napproximately 89,000 schools enrolling 46 million children participated \nin the National School Lunch program. Although participation in the \nschool breakfast program is\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\nnot as large as that in the school lunch program, it has continued to \ngrow. Since 1994, school breakfast participation has increased about \n13% so that now over 70% of schools operating a school lunch program \nalso operate a school breakfast program.\n  The WIC program, which provides nutritious foods and other support to \nlower-income infants and children (up to age 5), and pregnant, \npostpartum, and breast-feeding women, has been successful at reducing \nthe number of low-birth-weight babies. Its success has led to strong \nsupport over the years. In 1997, average monthly WIC participation was \n7.4 million persons. In many states, the program has reached the long \nsought after goal of full funding. This year as we reauthorize the \nprogram, we will look to see if there are ways to make this successful \nprogram run even better.\n  Senators Harkin, McConnell and Leahy have joined with me today to \nintroduce this important bill. I wish to stress that this bill is a \nstarting point for debate on child nutrition reauthorization. I am sure \nthat the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee as well as the \nChairman and Ranking Minority Member of the subcommittee have \nadditional ideas to improve these programs. Nutrition programs in the \nCongress have a long history of bipartisan support and cooperation and \nI am certain that we will continue that tradition. I look forward to \nworking with them and other members of the Agriculture Committee, on \nboth sides of the aisle, to craft a thoughtful and sensible bill to \nreauthorize the child nutrition programs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in full \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1581\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n               SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \njoin Chairman Lugar, Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy in introducing \nlegislation to reauthorize several programs, primarily relating to \nnutrition assistance for children, whose authorizations are set to end \nthis year. These programs are vitally important to our nation, and I \napplaud the introduction of this legislation as a clear demonstration \nof our strong support for them in the Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry Committee and our commitment to reenacting authorizing \nlegislation this year.\n  The bill introduced today is a simple extension of expiring \nauthorizations, without amendments or modifications, and thus only \nmarks the beginning of the legislative process. As Chairman Lugar has \nindicated, the Committee will complete the normal child nutrition \nreauthorization process, as in past years, allowing for full discussion \nand consideration of the programs requiring reauthorization as well as \nthose having permanent authorizations. I look forward to working with \ncolleagues on the Committee, in this body, and in the House of \nRepresentatives on this very important legislation.\n  An essential part of our work on this reauthorization bill involves \nexamining the child nutrition programs to ensure they are functioning \nwell, particularly in responding to changing circumstances and new \ndemands. Another, no less important, part of our efforts must focus on \nmaking the programs more effective by finding better ways to address \nlongstanding unmet needs and reach individuals who are not adequately \nserved by the programs in their present form. Of course, we must always \nbe alert to opportunities for streamlining, paring paperwork and \nreducing administrative burdens. A number of thoughtful proposals for \nimprovements and modifications have already been made, and I know that \nwe will receive more of them as work on the legislation proceeds.\n  All of the programs involved in this reauthorization are important, \nbut I want to mention specifically a few of my priorities. We should \nstrengthen the school breakfast program in order to reach students who \nneed school breakfasts but do not currently have access to them. We \nalso should improve the child nutrition programs in ways that enhance \ntheir effectiveness in helping families obtain quality child care. And \nwe need to ensure that the summer food program is adequately serving \nkids who without it are quite vulnerable once school is out for the \nsummer. In addition to reauthorizing the Iowa and Kentucky child care \nnutrition pilot project, we ought to examine its positive results for \nguidance in shaping our national approach to child care nutrition \nassistance. With respect to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program \nfor Women, Infants, and Children, it is important to continue an \neffective competitive bidding system for\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\ninfant formula and to extend and strengthen the WIC farmers market \nprogram.\n  Nothing is more important to the future of our nation than its \nchildren, and nothing is more important to children than the sound \nnutrition they need each day. It is beyond dispute that good nutrition \nis critical to physical growth, intellectual development and lives that \nare healthy, productive and happy. Trying to educate children who are \nhungry or malnourished is just as foolish as trying to build a house on \na crumbling foundation. Federal child nutrition programs constitute \ninvestments in the future--of our children and our nation. This \nlegislation will ensure that we continue to reap the immeasurable \ndividends of those wise investments.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Child \nNutrition Reauthorization Act of 1998 being introduced today by the \nChairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Senator \nLugar; Ranking Member Harkin; and Ranking Member Leahy, of the \nResearch, Nutrition, and General Legislation and myself as Chairman of \nthat Subcommittee.\n  In the past, nutrition programs under the jurisdiction of the \nAgriculture Committee have been fashioned in a bipartisan manner. \nToday's introduction of legislation to reauthorize those child \nnutrition programs expiring in 1998, is a starting point.\n  Our Child Nutrition Programs have played an essential role in \npromoting the long-term health of our children. These programs provide \na vital link between diet and health, ensuring that our children have \naccess to nutritious food.\n  Mr. President, Chairman Lugar has described the programs that must be \nreauthorized and the critical importance these programs serve in \nproviding a safety net for children. While, I agree that these programs \nmust be reauthorized, we must not overlook the opportunity to review \nthe existing structure of these programs, review priorities, and \ndetermine if improvements and streamlining can enhance their \neffectiveness.\n  One area of particular interest to me is a provision expiring under \nthe National School Lunch Act which required a two state pilot project \nfor for-profit day care centers in the Child and Adult Care Food \nProgram. The two states were Kentucky and Iowa. In Kentucky, 242 for-\nprofit child care centers participate in the demonstration project, \nproviding meals to over 10,500 children each day.\n  Many of these child centers are in rural areas or in lower income \nmunicipalities. Without the demonstration project, fees would increase \nplacing a greater financial burden on parents and some smaller centers \nmay be forced to close. This demonstration project provides needed \nnutritional assistance to financially disadvantaged children. I believe \nthat continued operation and possible expansion of this type of \ndemonstration project is essential as we consider policies to help \nworking families with children.\n  I am sure Members will have many ideas and changes to improve these \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, everyone agrees how critical good nutrition is to our \nchildren's ability to learn. This reauthorization represents our \nopportunity to work together to craft a thoughtful bill that will be \nthe building block to our children's successful learning so they can \nhave a healthy and productive future.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues on \nthe Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, as I have done many \ntimes before on nutrition issues, to introduce a bill that begins the \nchild nutrition reauthorization process.\n  For many years on the Committee, when I was Chairman, and later \nRanking Member, we always tried to make our nutrition efforts consensus \nbills--agreed to by all members of the Committee. Now as Ranking Member \nof the nutrition subcommittee I look forward to working with the \nCommittee to report out a strong child nutrition reauthorization bill.\n  The bill I cosponsor today extends existing programs but does not \ninclude improvements which I will discuss with other Committee members \nand the Secretary in the near future.\n  Last November, I introduced the ``Child Nutrition Initiatives Act'' \nwhich contained a number of changes that I will discuss with my \ncolleagues. That was not a reauthorization bill but rather an effort \nthat I hope will be carefully looked at by my colleagues in the Senate \nand in the House.\n  I intend to meet with representatives of the various nutrition \nprograms as I work with other Members to help craft a good bill. I look \nforward to meeting with Under Secretary Shirley Watkins who has a \nnumber a great ideas to improve our child nutrition programs. In \naddition, I will carefully review Senator Johnson's school breakfast \nbill which has been strongly endorsed by many groups at that national \nand local level.\n  I will also gain input from Vermont nutrition leaders, Vermont \nprogram directors, community leaders and program participants.\n  My November 13 statement explains the basis for my bill--I am hopeful \nthat many of those provisions will be supported by the Committee and \nthe Senate as a whole.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB:\n\n  S. 1582. A bill to provide market transition assistance for quota \nholders, active tobacco producers, and tobacco-growing counties, to \nauthorize a private Tobacco Production Control Corporation and tobacco \nloan associations to control the production and marketing and ensure \nthe quality of tobacco in the United States, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                   THE TOBACCO MARKET TRANSITION ACT\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, on behalf of many tobacco growers with whom \nI have worked, I rise today to introduce the Tobacco Market Transition \nAct. The comprehensive tobacco settlement announced on June 20 of last \nyear simply did not include provisions for tobacco growers. This \nprovision is designed to fill that void.\n  This legislation is truly the result of a grassroots effort and \nelaborates the concepts I discussed in the Chamber on November 3. \nTobacco-dependent regions realize that their lives will be directly \naffected by comprehensive tobacco legislation and they want to prepare \nfor that future.\n  Key members of my staff and I have worked with tobacco growers, \nleaders in tobacco growing communities and members of the public health \ncommunity to develop legislation which will provide a soft landing to \nthose regions that have so long depended on the production of tobacco.\n  In short, because Government action is about to erode the value of \nquota, there would be a buyout of existing quota at $8 a pound. A \nprivatized tobacco program limiting supply would be reinstituted, \nproviding growers with a license to grow tobacco based on historical \naverage production for that grower. To provide long-term economic \nsecurity in tobacco communities, $250 million will be provided annually \nfor economic development. Finally, a transition payment would be \noffered to growers as the system changes from its present form to a new \none.\n  Tobacco quota, Mr. President, represents the amount of tobacco \nallowed to be produced domestically. Over the years, individuals have \naccumulated the right to grow a certain proportion of that total quota. \nThis individual quota, this right to produce, has liquid value that can \nbe bought or sold or leased. Many have acquired quota over the years \nand planned to retire or in some cases have retired on the funds \nreceived from selling or leasing quota. When the Government depresses \ndemand for tobacco, it depresses the value of that asset.\n  The legislation I am introducing recognizes the value of that quota \nasset by paying quota holders $8 a pound for the quota they own over 5 \nyears. Once the quota holder has been made whole, a new supply-limiting \nprogram would be instituted giving licenses to grow tobacco to actual \nproducers of tobacco. Unlike the present system, those licenses would \nnot cost money to acquire. Eliminating the crushing cost of quota, \nwhich adds 40 cents a pound to the cost of producing flue-cured \ntobacco, will allow these growers to become more competitive even as \ndemand declines in the United States as a result of any comprehensive \nbill that we pass. By becoming more competitive with imported tobacco, \nU.S. growers could keep the demand for their\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\nproduct from declining as steeply as demand for cigarettes and other \nfinished products if we pass comprehensive legislation.\n  The legislation also provides a transition payment for existing \ntobacco producers as we move into the new system and provides $250 \nmillion annually to tobacco-growing communities for economic \ndevelopment. These economic development funds can be used for local \ncommunities to improve education, enhance transportation, promote small \nbusiness incubators or develop high technology infrastructure. In \nshort, these economic development funds will help keep these \ncommunities from exporting their most valuable asset, and that is their \nchildren.\n  Finally, this proposal recognizes the benefits of a supply-limiting \nprogram for tobacco. A supply-limiting program is absolutely essential \nto stabilize the income of tobacco farmers and to protect tobacco-\ngrowing communities from the utter destruction that would follow if the \nprogram is totally eliminated.\n  A supply-limiting program is also appropriate in the unique \ncircumstance of tobacco. Unlike other commodities where we are trying \nto lower the cost to consumers, pending Federal legislation is designed \nto do just the opposite. Every comprehensive tobacco proposal I have \nseen would increase the cost of tobacco products to lower demand. \nIndeed, the President said last night that he would approve something \nup to $1.50 a pack.\n  There has been much healthy discussion in tobacco growing communities \nabout whether to retain the current Federal tobacco program or to avoid \nthe annual battles that threaten it and privatize the program, allowing \ngrowers and others to operate it.\n  This is an important debate. The Federal program has served tobacco-\ngrowing communities well for over 60 years, and it is my judgment--and \nthe judgment of many, many with whom I have consulted--that it should \nnot be dismantled cavalierly.\n  The question we face is how best to maintain a supply-limiting \nprogram that protects tobacco communities. If we could guarantee that \nthe Federal program would remain intact for the next 25 years, that may \nbe the best way to proceed. But I have detected a great deal of unease \nabout whether we can keep the program, and I think many on both sides \nof this issue are growing tired of annual fights which, if we lose, \nwill destroy many tobacco-growing regions.\n  That is why this legislation contains provisions to privatize the \ntobacco program. For those who have questions about how this program \nwill work, I invite them to assist in answering those questions and \nimproving this legislation. For those who are nervous about such a \nchange, I can say I appreciate their apprehension. It is easier to \nunderstand the world as it is rather than how it could be. But I \nbelieve this offers us the best opportunity to retain a supply-limiting \nprogram over the long term.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass legislation that \nwill protect the communities that will be devastated if we fail to act, \nand will, in the words of the President, make growers and their \ncommunities ``whole.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation as well \nas the section-by-section summary be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1582\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

From the funds generated as a result of comprehensive \n     tobacco legislation, the trust fund would receive $3.5 \n     billion for the first five years, and $265 million each \n     succeeding year.\n       Section 201. Compensation to Quota Holders for Loss of \n     Tobacco Quota Asset Value.\n       A quota holder would receive $8/pound based on the average \n     tobacco farm marketing quota established for the 1995 through \n     1997 marketing years for the farm owned by the quota holder \n     on January 1, 1998. The payments would be made in 5 equal \n     annual installments beginning in 1999.\n       Section 202. Transition Payments for Active Tobacco \n     Producers.\n       Tobacco producers who grew tobacco in 1997 would be \n     eligible to receive 40 cents/pound for five years based on \n     the average number of pounds of tobacco quota established for \n     a farm for the 1995 through 1997 marketing years for which \n     the grower was the actual producer of tobacco on the farm.\n       Section 203. Tobacco Loan Associations.\n       To extricate the federal government from the tobacco \n     program and assist tobacco loan associations make the \n     transition to the privatized program, this section forgives \n     various loans made to the associations by the Department of \n     Agriculture, transfers title to the loan associations of \n     tobacco held in inventory by the Department of Agriculture, \n     and transfers to the loan associations the funds held in the \n     No Net Cost Tobacco Fund and the No Net Cost Tobacco Account \n     held on behalf of the associations.\n       Section 204. Tobacco Community Economic Development Grants.\n       The Corporation will award $250 million annually to \n     tobacco-dependent counties to aid community development \n     efforts. The funds can be used for various purposes, \n     including education, small business incubators, technology \n     infrastructure enhancement, transportation improvements and \n     water projects.\n       Section 205. Tax Treatment of Tobacco Quota Holder \n     Compensation and Transition Payments.\n       Compensation funds to quota holders and transition payments \n     to tobacco producers will not be taxed if placed in a \n     qualified retirement account or if used to retire debt \n     directly associated with tobacco production incurred prior to \n     January 1, 1998.\n       Section 301. Tobacco Production Control Corporation.\n       This section creates the privatized Tobacco Production \n     Control Corporation, which will undertake the duties \n     previously performed by the federal government. These duties \n     will include:\n       Governing the production, marketing, importation, \n     exportation, and consumer quality assurance for each kind of \n     tobacco;\n       Offering crop insurance;\n       Establishing a quality assurance system that provides for \n     the inspection and grading of tobacco marketed in the U.S., \n     determines and describes the physical characteristics of \n     domestic and imported tobacco, and ensures the physical and \n     chemical integrity of domestic and imported tobacco; and\n       Creating a licensing system to limit the production of \n     tobacco, replacing the current quota system. Licenses would \n     be issued by the Corporation at no cost to the producer and \n     no tobacco could be sold without a license. Initially, \n     licenses would be issued to active tobacco producers and \n     would be surrendered to the Corporation if the producer \n     ceases growing tobacco. Licenses could not be sold, leased or \n     transferred except to a licensee's spouse or children \n     actively engaged in the production of tobacco.\n       Section 302. Tobacco Loan Associations.\n       This section requires the Corporation to enter into \n     agreements with producer-owned loan associations for each \n     kind of tobacco to make price support available, carry out \n     the licensing system, arrange for financing and \n     administration of price supports and handle any domestically \n     produced tobacco received as collateral for a price support \n     loan.\n       Section 303. Tobacco Price Support Levels.\n       For the 1999 crop year, the price support shall be the \n     simple average price received by\n\n[[Page S179]]\n\n     producers for the preceding 5 years less the average return \n     to quota for 1994 through 1998 crops. This eliminates from \n     the price of tobacco an amount equal to the previous cost of \n     acquiring quota.\n       Section 304. Penalties.\n       This section sets forth the penalties for those who sell \n     tobacco without a license or in violation of a license, and \n     for those who purchase tobacco which is not licensed or \n     violates a license.\n       Section 305. Program Referenda.\n       This section allows producers to vote periodically on \n     whether to retain the new privatized program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Mr. President, President Clinton's nomination \nfor the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Judge Ann \nAiken, came before this body this afternoon. Mr. President, I was \nunavoidably absent for the vote, but I would like the record to reflect \nthat I would have voted ``no.''\n  I commend my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Mike Enzi, for closely \nscrutinizing this nomination and reporting to us some alarming rulings \non the part of Judge Aiken which illustrate flaws in her judicial \nphilosophy. For example, as Senator Enzi has noted, Judge Aiken, while \na Oregon state court judge, sentenced a 26-year-old man convicted of \nthe first degree rape of a 5-year-old girl to a mere ninety days in \njail. Ninety days? A petty thief gets more than ninety days. This man \nraped a little girl. According to local papers, Judge Aiken justified \nher minimal sentence by citing a lack of treatment programs for sex \noffenders in Oregon's state prisons.\n  Mr. President, this case, along with a history of similar rulings, \nreveals a grave misunderstanding in Judge Aiken's judicial outlook and \na proclivity to side with criminals. Once again, the President has \noffered this body a judicial nominee more interested in defending the \nrights of criminals than protecting those of victims. How much longer \nwill he continue to nominate Federal judges who ignore the safety and \nwell-being of our communities?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S181-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S181-S182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF ART VanELSLANDER\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, today I rise to join Catholic \nschools across my home state of Michigan and the country as they \ncelebrate Catholic Schools Week. This year marks the twenty-third \nanniversary of the annual event, and its theme is an important one, \n``Catholic Schools: Restoring Faith in Education.''\n  Since the founding of our great nation, Catholic schools have been \nintegral to its growth and prosperity. Among the first schools in the \ncountry, Catholic schools educated countless individuals throughout the \nnation and provided an early first step toward creating a literate \npopulace. Today, the role of Catholic schools is just as important. \nStrong academics partnered with a values-based education offers a \ntremendous option for children across the country. From rural areas to \nthe inner city, the opportunities afforded by Catholic schools are \nimmeasurable. They provide an important choice for parents and students \nwho seek the best possible learning environment.\n  In the State of Michigan, Catholic schools are elemental in providing \nchildren of all ages with a solid education. Spread throughout \nMichigan's seven Catholic dioceses, over 96,000 students are enrolled \nin 355 schools. These schools play a critical role in adding to the \nrich diversity of American education. I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to congratulate the many Catholic schools in Michigan and \nthe United States for the high quality of education they \nprovide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S182-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S182-S183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, 1998 marks the fiftieth \nanniversary of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations. On January 28, 1948, the Senate adopted \na resolution converting the Special Committee to Investigate the \nNational Defense Program (better known as the ``Truman Committee'' for \nits first chairman, Missouri Senator Harry Truman) into a permanent \nsubcommittee. The special committee looked into charges of waste and \nabuse in defense contracting during the Second World War. After its \nfirst chairman resigned to become Vice President and then President of \nthe United States, the Committee continued to investigate fraud and \ncorruption in the postwar years. Its many successes convinced the \nSenate of the need to retain an ongoing mechanism to combat wrongdoing \nand to keep government honest. Today, we celebrate a half century of \nthese endeavors.\n  As Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I wish \nto pay tribute to all of the Senators who have served on the \nSubcommittee, and to offer a brief survey of the highlights of the \nSubcommittee's activities over the years.\n  Senator Ralph Owen Brewster of Maine chaired the ``Truman Committee'' \nduring the Republican Eightieth Congress, but when the Senate \ntransferred the functions of the special committee to the Committee on \nExpenditures in the Executive Departments--a precursor of Governmental \nAffairs Committee--Senator Brewster was not a member of that committee \nand could not chair the new subcommittee.\n  The Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Branch already had a \nsubcommittee to Investigate Surplus Property Disposal, chaired by \nMichigan Senator Homer Ferguson. Senator Ferguson, a former judge, had \nalso been a member of the Truman Committee, and had occasionally served \nas its acting chairman. Assuming the leadership of the new \nsubcommittee, which was to be called the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, Ferguson inherited the special committee's authority, \nfunctions, and powers. He merged its staff members with those from his \nsubcommittee to Investigate Surplus Property Disposal. Notably, he \nretained the Truman Committee's chief counsel William Rogers (who later \nserved as Secretary of State) and its chief clerk, Ruth Young Watt (a \nMaine native who served as chief clerk from the Subcommittee's \nbeginning until her retirement in 1979). While technically reduced to a \nSubcommittee of a standing committee, the Permanent Subcommittee \nexercised authority almost as a separate entity, selecting its own \nstaff and determining its own investigatory agenda.\n  Senator Homer Ferguson's Chairmanship ended with the election of \n1948, which changed the Senate's majority and made Senator Clyde Hoey, \na North Carolina Democrat, Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations. The last U.S. Senator to wear a long frock coat and \nwing-tipped collar, Mr. Hoey was a distinguished southern gentleman of \nthe old school. During his leadership, the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations won national attention for its investigation of the \n``five percenters,'' Washington lobbyists who charged their clients \nfive percent of the profits from any federal contracts they obtained \nfor them. The ``five percenters'' investigation raised allegations of \nbribery and influence-peddling that reached right into the White House \nand implicated some members of President Truman's staff.\n  When Republicans regained the Senate's majority in 1953, at the \nbeginning of the Eisenhower administration, Wisconsin's junior Senator, \nJoseph R. McCarthy, took over as Chairman of the Permanent \nSubcommittee. Two years earlier, as Ranking Minority Member, Senator \nMcCarthy had removed from the Committee another Republican Senator, \nMargaret Chase Smith of Maine. Senator Smith had issued a ``Declaration \nof Conscience'' against those who made unfounded charges and used \ncharacter assassination against their political opponents. Although \nSenator Smith had not named a specific offender, her remarks were \nuniversally recognized as criticism of Senator McCarthy's accusations \nthat Communists had infiltrated the State Department and other \ngovernment agencies. Senator McCarthy retaliated by eliminating Senator \nSmith from his Subcommittee and replacing her with the newly elected \nsenator from California, Richard M. Nixon.\n  When Senator McCarthy became Subcommittee Chairman, he staged a \nseries of highly publicized anti-communist investigations, culminating \nin an inquiry into communism in the U.S. Army, which became known as \nthe Army-McCarthy hearings. During the latter portion of these \nhearings, in which the Committee examined the Wisconsin Senator's \nattacks on the army, Senator McCarthy recused himself, and South Dakota \nSenator Karl Mundt served as Acting Chairman of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations. Gavel-to-gavel television coverage of \nthe hearings raised public concern about Senator McCarthy's treatment \nof witnesses and his irresponsible use of evidence. In December of \n1954, the Senate censured Senator McCarthy for unbecoming conduct, and \nthe following year the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations adopted \nnew rules of procedure that better protected the rights of witnesses. \nThese actions vindicated the courageous stand of Maine Senator Margaret \nChase Smith.\n  In 1955, Senator John McClellan of Arkansas began eighteen years of \nservice as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. \nSenator McClellan appointed the young Robert F. Kennedy as the \nSubcommittee's Chief Counsel. That same year, Members of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations were joined by Members of the Senate \nLabor and Public Welfare Committee on a special committee to \ninvestigate labor racketeering. Chaired by Senator McClellan and \nstaffed by Robert Kennedy and other staff members of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, the special committee directed much of \nits attention to criminal influence over the Teamsters Union, calling \nTeamsters' leaders Dave Beck and Jimmy Hoffa to testify. The televised \nhearings of the special committee introduced Senators Barry Goldwater \nand John F. Kennedy to the nation, and led to passage of the Landrum-\nGriffin Labor Act.\n  After the special committee completed its work, the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations continued to investigate organized \ncrime. In 1962, the Subcommittee held hearings in which Joseph Valachi \noutlined the activities of La Cosa Nostra, or the Mafia. Robert \nKennedy, by then Attorney General, used this information to prosecute \nprominent mob leaders and their accomplices. The investigations also \nled to passage of major legislation against organized crime, most \nnotably\n\n[[Page S183]]\n\nthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) provision of \nthe Crime Control Act of 1970. Under Chairman McClellan, the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations also investigated fraud in the purchase \nof military uniforms, corruption in the Department of Agriculture's \ngrain storage program, securities frauds, and civil disorders and acts \nof terrorism. From 1962 to 1970, the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations conducted an extensive probe of political interference \nin the awarding of government contracts for the TFX (``tactical \nfighter, experimental''). In 1968, the Subcommittee also looked into \ncharges of corruption in U.S. servicemen's clubs in Vietnam and \nelsewhere around the world.\n  Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson, a Democrat from Washington, replaced \nSenator McClellan as Chair of the Permanent Subcommittee in 1973. \nSenator Jackson continued most of the Subcommittee staff but added \nHoward Feldman as Chief Counsel. During these years, Chief Clerk Ruth \nYoung Watt noted that the Subcommittee's Ranking Minority Member, \nSenator Charles Percy, an Illinois Republican, was even more active on \nthe Committee than was the Chairman, who was balancing his Chairmanship \nof the Interior Committee and his active role on the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  It had not been uncommon in the Subcommittee's history for the \nChairman and Ranking Minority Member to work together closely despite \ntheir partisan differences, but Senator Percy was unusually active in \nthe minority--even chairing one investigation of the hearing aid \nindustry. Senator Percy continued to work in tandem with Senator Sam \nNunn, who succeeded Senator Jackson as Chairman of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations in 1979. As Chairman, Senator Nunn \ncontinued the Subcommittee's investigations into the role of organized \ncrime in labor-management relations and also investigated pension \nfrauds.\n  The regular reversals of political fortunes in the 1980s and 1990s \nsaw Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn alternate the Chairmanship with Delaware \nRepublican William Roth. Senator Nunn Chaired the Subcommittee from \n1979 to 1980 and again from 1987 to 1995. Senator Roth served as Chair \nfrom 1981 to 1986, and again from 1995 to 1996. Senator Roth led a wide \nrange of investigations into commodity investment fraud, offshore \nbanking schemes, money laundering, airline safety, child pornography, \nand computer security. Senator Nunn pursued federal drug policy, the \nglobal spread of chemical and biological weapons, abuses in the federal \nstudent aid programs, and health care fraud. Senator Nunn also \nappointed the first woman counsel, Eleanore Hill, who served as Chief \nCounsel to the Minority from 1982 to 1986 and then as Chief Counsel \nfrom 1987 to 1995. Ms. Hill is now the Inspector General at the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  In January 1997, I became the first freshman and woman to Chair the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and I appointed Timothy Shea \nas Chief Counsel. During the first session of the 105th Congress, the \nSubcommittee held hearings into Medicare fraud and penny stock fraud, \nas well as an oversight review of the Office of the Inspector General \nat the Treasury Department that led to the resignation of the Inspector \nGeneral.\n  Now we have reached the Subcommittee's fiftieth anniversary, which \nmarks another significant milestone. Unlike most standing committees of \nthe Senate, whose previously unpublished records open for scholarly \nresearch after a period of twenty years has elapsed, the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, as an investigatory body, may close its \nrecords for fifty years to protect personal privacy and the \ninvestigatory process. Over the past half century, scholars have \nstudied and written about many of the Subcommittee's investigations by \nusing its voluminous public hearings, newspaper accounts, oral \nhistories, and the personal papers of the Senators who served on the \nSubcommittee, but they have also expressed keen interest in examining \nthe Subcommittee's own historical records. With this fiftieth \nanniversary, the Subcommittee's earliest records, housed in the Center \nfor Legislative Archives at the National Archives and Records \nAdministration, will begin to open seriatim. The records of our \npredecessor committee--the Truman Committee--were opened by Senator \nNunn in 1980. I trust that the new scholarship that emerges from these \nrecords will further national awareness of the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations' role and its numerous accomplishments.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations does not intend to rest \non its historical laurels. As Chair, I pledge a continuation of the \nSubcommittee's mission of vigilant exposure of government malfeasance, \nsocial and economic wrongdoing, and serious violations of the public \ntrust. We will focus on problems that affect the American people in \ntheir daily lives so that our work will help and protect the people of \nMaine and Americans across the nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a list of all the \nChairmen, Ranking Minority Members, and Chief Counsels of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations over the past fifty years.\n  The list follows:\n\n\n         Chairs of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations\n\n     Homer Ferguson (R--Michigan), 1948-1949\n     Clyde R.

PINTO, SUPERINTENDENT OF MIDDLETOWN SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on January 31st, friends and \ncolleagues will gather to honor Michael S. Pinto, who has served \nMiddletown public schools for 36 years, and is retiring as \nSuperintendent.\n  Michael Pinto built his career in Rhode Island, just as he received \nhis education in our state. He received degrees from Providence College \nand Rhode Island College, and pursued additional studies at the \nUniversity of Rhode Island, Brown University, and Salve Regina \nUniversity.\n  For seven years, Superintendent Pinto worked with students as a \nclassroom teacher, then as Supervising Principal for sixteen years. He \nserved as both Coordinator of Elementary Education and Assistant \nSuperintendent before being appointed as Superintendent of Middletown \nSchools in 1994.\n  Michael has amassed an impressive record of public service. His work \nin the Middletown public school system is well known. But, he has also \nbeen involved with the Easter Seals Society, the YMCA, the Middletown \nLions Club, the Rhode Island Senate Drug Advisory Committee, and many \nother worthy organizations.\n  Mr. President, no one has worked harder or has shown more persistence \non behalf of the Impact Aid program than Michael Pinto! Barely a month \ngoes by without a letter from Superintendent Pinto reaching my desk, \nadvocating the Impact Aid program and its importance in Middletown \nschools.\n  Recently, a Newport Daily News article described Superintendent Pinto \nas an easy-going and amiable administrator.'' In fact, in the spirit of \ntrue compromise for the good of education and the community, \nSuperintendent\n\n[[Page S184]]\n\nPinto has said, ``[I'll] tell the School Committee that I'm not \ninterested in a lot of 3-to-2 votes. I'll give up something for a 5-to-\n0 vote.'' It is that quality--doing what it takes to reach a \nconsensus--that has made him a successful leader.\n  As Michael prepares for his private life away from the duties of his \nterribly demanding job, I want to congratulate and thank him for all \nthat he has given to his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S183-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM RUSSELL KELLY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay homage to William \nRussell Kelly. This giant of the office staffing industry recently \npassed away after a hard fought battle with cancer. Russell Kelly's \nlegacy, however, will long remain a symbol of efficiency, quality, and \nintegrity.\n  First begun in 1946, through hard work and determination, Kelly \nServices has grown into a Fortune 500 company. Providing temporary and \nsupplemental staff, the company proved to be a tremendously successful \nventure, and soon the phrase ``Kelly Girl'' became synonymous with \nquality and professionalism. Employees identified themselves with pride \nand the term became a mark of distinction in a rapidly growing \nindustry. Today, Kelly Services is composed of more than 750,000 men \nand women who offer a wide variety of professional and technical \nsupport around the world. What began as a small company supporting \nlocal businesses in Detroit has proven itself to be an asset to \nliterally thousands of companies worldwide.\n  Last year, Kelly Services celebrated its 50th anniversary. Amid the \ncelebrations, an individual inquired how Russell Kelly wanted to be \nremembered. He replied, ``I want to be remembered as a pioneer.'' Mr. \nPresident, I am proud to say Russell Kelly met that goal. He was a \npioneer who, through determination and perseverance, left his imprint \non the world. Through his efforts, the way companies do business was \nrevolutionized.\n  During this most difficult time, my thoughts and prayers go out to \nRussell Kelly's family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S184-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO GEORGIAN PRESIDENT EDUARD SHEVARDNADZE\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a world \nstatesman and one of the most heroic figures of this century on the \noccasion of his 75th birthday. Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze, the President \nof Georgia, celebrated his birthday this past weekend and I know each \nof my colleagues join me in wishing him health, happiness and many \nyears of success.\n  Mr. President, as I advance in years I become increasingly aware that \neach additional birthday is a milestone of sorts. However, when one \nlooks at the dramatic changes in both the world and the man over the \npast 75 years of Eduard Shevardnadze's life, it is more than a mere \nbirthday that is celebrated. I would suggest we should recognize his as \na life of dignity, service and commitment to fighting for principle. \nHis has been a life ``in the arena''--one richly deserving of honor.\n  President Shevardnadze has enjoyed a wide range of experiences in \npublic life. Most Americans became aware of his remarkable abilities \nwhen he held the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet \nUnion from 1985 until 1991.\n  With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, he left the Communist \nParty, resigning in protest against the anticipated military \ndictatorship. It was at this time, as a private citizen, that President \nShevardnadze returned to his homeland of Georgia. Here he found a \nnation in complete disarray, struggling to shake off the years of \nSoviet domination. Faced with this challenge what was he to do? He did \nwhat comes naturally to him, Mr. President--he chose to lead.\n  Beginning in March 1992, he led the State Council. In October 1992, \nhe was elected Chairman of the Parliament of Georgia from which he was \nelected head of State. Finally, in November 1995, he was elected \nPresident of Georgia with over 70% of the vote. This completed a \nhistoric personal and governmental transition.\n  Mr. President, since his election, I have had the distinct honor of \nworking with President Shevardnadze on a variety of issues. I can say \nwithout fear of embellishment that I find him to be one of the true \nheroes of the 20th century. His vision for a free, prosperous and \ndemocratic Georgia is one I support and believe him to be uniquely \nqualified to deliver. Further, he is one of the principal architects of \nthe Post Cold War world, and for that we should all give thanks.\n  While many leaders in this part of the world are consumed by their \nown position and power, President Shevardnadze has demonstrated his \ncommitment to his nation in a unique way--he has consistently \nappointed, selected and surrounded himself with exceptionally talented \nmen and women half his age. President Shevardnadze's legacy is the \ndetermined leadership he not only has shown, but the team of leaders he \nhas cultivated and supported--leaders who will secure Georgia's bright \nand independent future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S184-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S184-S185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NAVAL SURFACE WARFARE CENTER'S CARDEROCK DIVISION\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe Naval Surface Warfare Center's Carderock Division in Montgomery \nCounty, which will celebrate its Centennial Anniversary on January 30, \n1998.\n  For 100 years, the NSWC's Carderock Division, widely known as the \nDavid Taylor Research Center, has played a pivotal role in the design \nand construction of Navy ships, submarines and advanced craft. This \nCenter has been described--accurately, in my view--as the ``First \nStop'' for Navy ideas in new ship and submarine concepts. Through the \nbasic and applied research conducted at this center the Navy has been \nable to develop new, innovative hull designs, ways to significantly \nlower the costs of submarine and ship construction, and has made \nsignificant advances in reducing electromagnetic signatures and \nunderwater accoustics--to name only a few of its accomplishments. Its \nteam of scientists, engineers, technicians and support staff at \nCarderock and formerly Annapolis, have spearheaded the development of \nsurface ship and submarine system technologies to ensure that the U.S. \nfleet remains the best in the world. Since its inception, the Carderock \nDivision has been charged with the unique dual mission of supporting \nnot only the Navy, but also our maritime sector as a whole and I think \nit is important to point out how much the research conducted at David \nTaylor and the technology it has transferred to the private sector has \nbenefitted the nation's entire maritime industry. From having the \nlargest number of patents issued to employees in the entire division, \nto being the first DOD/Navy and second government organization to \nreceive ISO 9001 (International Organization for Standardization) \nCertification--as well as receiving Vice President Gore's coveted \nHammer Award--the David Taylor Center's achievements are truly second \nto none.\n  Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work closely with a \nnumber of individuals at the Carderock Division and I can personally \nattest to the high caliber, quality and commitment of its workforce. \nIndeed, the many accomplishments of the David Taylor Research Center \nhave only been possible through the professionalism, dedication, \nimagination and energy of its employees.\n  One of the projects on which I worked very closely with the Navy was \nCarderock's new, state of the art Ship Materials Technology Center \nwhich we dedicated last year. With this new center and other \ndevelopments which are underway, Carderock not only has best personnel, \nbut also some of the finest, most-advanced facilities and resources to \nensure that the Navy's Research and Development Program stays on the \ncutting edge of technology into the 21st Century.\n  We take great pride in the accomplishments of the Carderock division, \nin the people who work there and in having this outstanding facility \nlocated in Maryland. I commend the David Taylor Center for its 100 \nyears of success and remarkable achievements and am confident that, \nwith its new lab facility, the Carderock division and our nation will \ncontinue to be on the frontier of Naval research and development for \nhundreds of years to come.\n\n[[Page S185]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S184-3", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S184-S185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NAVAL SURFACE WARFARE CENTER'S CARDEROCK DIVISION\n\n Mr. SARBANES.

Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise \nto recognize two extraordinary groups of young people in my home state \nof Rhode Island. These individuals of the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts \nhave distinguished themselves as leaders in their communities.\n  Since Baden Powell founded the Boy Scouts in 1910 and Juliette Gordon \nLow established the Girl Scouts in 1912, many youth have chosen to make \nnew friends, develop leadership skills, assist their communities, and \nexplore new ideas by participating in these two fine organizations.\n  In a world where it is sometimes said that role models no longer \nexist, these young men and women are shining examples to their peers. \nThe skills they have learned while camping, doing service work, and \nwithin their individual groups, are the skills they will need to help \nthe world become a better place.\n  In order to attain the Eagle Scout award, Boy Scouts must earn 21 \nmerit badges, complete a service project in their community, hold a \nnumber of leadership positions in their troop, and finally, pass an \noral-administered exam which can last for several hours. The Silver \nAward is given to Girl Scouts in junior high school after the \ncompletion of a service project. The highest honor in Senior Girl \nScouting is the Gold Award, which is earned at the culmination of a \nmajor service project.\n  We also owe thanks to the Scouts' parents and families, their \nleaders, and the organizations themselves which have guided these young \npeople, and helped them achieve so much. Without this worldwide network \nof adults teaching children and serving as role models, scouting would \nnot exist. These adults turn the young boy and girls of today into the \nmen and women of tomorrow who will lead us through the 21st Century.\n  Mr. President, it is a privilege to submit to you the list of \noutstanding young men and women who have earned these awards. I ask \nthat this list of future leaders be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  The List Follows:\n\n                1997 Girl Scout Silver Award Recipients\n\n\n                             barrington, ri\n\n       Carly DeWitt; Adina Downing; Lauren Lubrano; Rachel Sockut; \n     Caitlin Wood; Kelly Josephson.\n\n\n                              bristol, ri\n\n       Eliza Burnham; Beth Chianese; Pamela Raposa.\n\n\n                            charlestown, ri\n\n       Jessica Furmanick; Amber MacDonald.\n\n\n                              cranston, ri\n\n       Melissa Chalek; Nicole Hopkins; Melissa Lau; Courtney \n     O'Hara; Emily Shumchenia.\n\n\n                           east greenwich, ri\n\n       Mary Ellen Hoban; Sarah Longenbaker.\n\n\n                               exeter, ri\n\n       Jessica George; Julie Jette; Danielle Lima; Kara \n     Littlefield; Erin Sherman; Erica Steckert.\n\n\n                                hope, ri\n\n       Courtney Mckenna.\n\n\n                             hopkinton, ri\n\n       Marissa Cherenzia.\n\n\n                              johnston, ri\n\n       Andreana Paolella.\n\n\n                              kingston, ri\n\n       Martha Bibb.\n\n\n                             middletown, ri\n\n       Jaclyn Richardson.\n\n\n                            narragansett, ri\n\n       Megan Dyer.\n\n\n                            n. scituate, ri\n\n       Katyanne Klitz.\n\n\n                           n. smithfield, ri\n\n       Amy Cavedon; Rebecca Corriveau; Nicole White.\n\n\n                             pawtucket, ri\n\n       April Silva; Tammy Tenney; Julee Thomas.\n\n\n                             portsmouth, ri\n\n       Kali Crocker.\n\n\n                             providence, ri\n\n       Meghan Brown; Elizabeth Frutchey; Emily Markovits.\n\n\n                              rehoboth, ma\n\n       Meghan Thibeault.\n\n\n                             riverside, ri\n\n       Amy Amerantes; Laurie Bone; Eliza Holtzman; Rochonda Ives; \n     Christine Lowell; Meagan Orris; Andrea Salvo.\n\n\n                              rumford, ri\n\n       Melissa Perry; Michelle Perry.\n\n\n                             smithfield, ri\n\n       Carey Stipe.\n\n\n                              tiverton, ri\n\n       Patricia Byrne; Li Erin Probasco; Kristen Zeiser.\n\n\n                             wakefield, ri\n\n       Erin Barry; Jacquelyn Bertrand; Kelly Dolan; Allison Fagan; \n     Leah Garvey; Caitlin Higgins; Cassandra Meyer; Erica \n     Sweitzer.\n\n\n                               warren, ri\n\n       Jennifer Potvin; Lauren Swift.\n\n\n                              warwick, ri\n\n       Dawn Armitage; Melanie Carrazzo; Stephanie Demirjian; \n     Bonnie-Marie Dufresne; Jeniece Fairbairn; Tiasa Loignon; \n     Katie Marseglia; Maegan McCauley; Shannon McCormick; Ann \n     O'Donnell; Jessica Rice.\n\n\n                           west greenwich, ri\n\n       Tarsha Bellville; Melissa Breene; Allyson Hawley; Nina \n     Lennon; Megin Longway; Tricia Parkinson; Holly Tift.\n\n\n                            west warwick, ri\n\n       Amy Lancellotta; Nicole Petrarca.\n\n\n                              westerly, ri\n\n       Samantha Blanck; Leigh Hanson; Sara McGrath; Alexandra \n     Mochetti; Amy Parise.\n\n\n                        wood river junction, ri\n\n       Laura Brusseau\n\n                 1997 Girl Scout Gold Award Recipients\n\n\n                             Barrington, RI\n\n       Amanda Macomber.\n\n\n                              Cranston, RI\n\n       Sara Carnevale; Louise Humphrey; Stacey Lehrer.\n\n\n                             Cumberland, RI\n\n       Kerri Ayo; Sarah Billington; Jennifer Bonner; Amanda \n     Condon; Kerry Donaldson; Shannon Goodwillie; Catherine Jones; \n     Kelly McElroy; Kristen O'Neill; Nikki Parness; Rebecca \n     Silverman; Marcy Trocina; Gina Zollo.\n\n\n                             Pawtucket, RI\n\n       Christal Desmarais.\n\n\n                             Peace Dale, RI\n\n       Bethany Lardaro.\n\n\n                             Portsmouth, RI\n\n       Emily Lyons; Rebecca Richard.\n\n\n                             Riverside, RI\n\n       Stephanie Santos.\n\n\n                              Warwick, RI\n\n       Sarah Walsh.\n\n\n                           West Kingston, RI\n\n       Jennifer Perkins.\n\n                 1997 Boy Scout Eagle Award Recipients\n\n\n                              ashaway, ri\n\n       Michael J.

PINTO, SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS, MIDDLETOWN, \n                              RHODE ISLAND\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMichael S. Pinto, Superintendent of Schools in Middletown, Rhode \nIsland. After 36 years, Superintendent Pinto is leaving the school \nsystem where he began his career, bound for a well-deserved retirement.\n  During his tenure in Middletown, Superintendent Pinto has held almost \nevery possible position one can hold in the field of education. He has \nbeen a teacher, a principal, a business manager for the school \ndistrict, an assistant superintendent, and, most recently, the \nsuperintendent.\n  Over the years--even when I represented Rhode Island's neighboring \nCongressional district in the House of Representatives, I was \nprivileged to have the advice of Superintendent Pinto on a variety of \nissues related to education, from school choice to educational \nstandards. Indeed, I could always count on hearing from Superintendent \nPinto about Impact Aid. He is the program's number one advocate.\n  His commitment to Impact Aid underscores his overall dedication to \nMiddletown's schools and students and the cause of education. A measure \nof his commitment was shown in a recent news article which reported \nthat in the last fifteen years he has had no more than seven \nconsecutive days off.\n  As superintendent, Mr. Pinto has presided over a number of successful \ninitiatives including the fundamental repair of two schools, a new \nsystem of measuring student learning, and an optional all-day \nkindergarten. Superintendent Pinto has consistently sought to share the \nprofessional accolades he has received with his colleagues in \nMiddletown. His emphasis on team work has earned him the admiration and \nrespect of those who have worked with him.\n  I thank Superintendent Pinto for his tremendous dedication and \ncongratulate him for all that he has done for Middletown. While the \nMiddletown school system will miss Michael Pinto, I am sure that even \nin retirement he will continue his work to improve education and better \nhis community.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Chafee today in saluting \nSuperintendent Pinto and wishing him the best in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S186-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S186-S187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THOMAS M. BELODEAU\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the text of the eulogy I gave for my friend, Thomas M. \nBelodeau, on November 10, 1997.\n  The eulogy follows:\n\n       Mrs. Belodeau, Michael; Ann, Tommy's sisters Patricia and \n     Mary; his brothers Leo, James, Joseph, and Larry, to all his \n     relatives, and to his brothers from Vietnam--particularly Del \n     Sandusky from Illinois and Gene Thorsen from Iowa--his \n     crewman on PCF 94--to the Doghunters and to all of Tommy's \n     friends and extended family.\n       A number of us thought once foolishly that we brothers of \n     Vietnam had gotten used to saying goodbye to our friends \n     before their time. But Tommy is proving us dangerously wrong. \n     We will never get used to it--and well we should not.\n       So now the question is, how do you say goodbye to a man \n     whose steady hand and courageous heart helped keep you alive? \n     How do you say goodbye to a man who shared the most \n     challenging and terrifying moments of your life?\n       First, you should all know that we are saying goodbye to a \n     hero. We are saying goodbye to the genuine article--a \n     patriot--a young kid fresh out of Chelmsford High who in \n     difficult times saw his duty and who did it. Tommy was one of \n     America's children who went to war against a people he knew \n     precious little about in a land he'd never been to--for \n     reasons never honestly stated--and he was, like so many, \n     forever changed.\n       It is hard for me to convey to you the full measure of what \n     that means in 1997, particularly here, today. But in 1966, \n     Tommy and I unwittingly became brothers in the great, \n     divisive, confusing enterprise called Vietnam. We were both \n     class of `66--he from high school and me from college. Though \n     we came from different backgrounds, we didn't in the sense \n     that we both believed in service to our country. We both \n     chose to go into the Navy. We both volunteered for Swift \n     boats in Vietnam. We met when we were thrown together as a \n     crew after his first skipper got hit in an ambush.\n       I inherited Tommy and the rest of his seasoned crew, and it \n     was the best thing that ever happened to me.\n       Many of you may have read Tom's obituary the other day. It \n     said he had won a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star with Combat \n     V for serving in Vietnam. That only told you part of the \n     story--and no one here would be surprised that Tommy never \n     told you the rest.\n       He also won the Navy Commendation medal:\n       Let me share with you what Admiral Zumwalt said in awarding \n     it to Tom:\n       ``For heroic achievement while serving with friendly \n     foreign forces engaged in armed conflict against North \n     Vietnamese and Viet Cong communist aggressors in the Republic \n     of Vietnam on 5 July, 1968. Seaman Belodeau was serving as a \n     crewman on board Patrol Craft 27 which was blockading the \n     beach in the vicinity of air strikes on an enemy platoon near \n     the village of My Lai, Quang Ngai Province. Observing a Viet \n     Cong suspect run from the enemy position, Seaman Belodeau's \n     Patrol Craft fast moved in to attempt a capture and was \n     immediately taken under enemy fire. Seaman Belodeau, ignoring \n     the enemy fire around him, calmly moved into the open to make \n     the capture. He helped pull the suspect from the water and \n     got him aboard his boat. Seaman Belodeau's courageous actions \n     in capturing a Viet Cong suspect under enemy fire were in the \n     highest tradition of the United States Naval Service.''\n       Seaman Belodeau is authorized to wear the Combat ``V''. \n     That was just a day that happened to be notice, sandwiched \n     between many more like it or worse, that were not. That was \n     the measure of the man I inherited on my crew.\n       From the day we came together, we gelled as a crew. And it \n     was the way it ought to be. The crew didn't have to prove \n     themselves to me. I had to earn my spurs with them. When \n     the Chief Petty Officer, Del Sandusky--known as ``Sky'', \n     who came from Illinois to be with Tom today, finally gave \n     me the seal of enlisted man's approval, Tommy was the \n     first to enthusiastically say: ``I told you so, Sky, he's \n     from Massachusetts!!\"\n       You have to understand that we lived together as closely \n     and as intensely on 50 feet of floating armament as men can \n     live. And we learned all there is to learn about each other.\n       Sometimes it was a funny learning process, as when Mike \n     Medeiros exhibited a hard time understanding Tommy. ``Are you \n     from Brooklyn?'' he would ask. Tommy would respond with pride \n     and impatience: ``Nah: I'm from Boston.''\n       There was the time we were carrying special forces up a \n     river and a mine exploded under our boat sending it 2 feet \n     into the air. We were receiving incoming rocket and small \n     arms fire and Tommy was returning fire with his M-60 machine \n     gun when it literally broke apart in his hands. He was left \n     holding the pieces unable to fire back while one of the Green \n     Berets walked along the edge of the boat to get Tommy another \n     M-60. As he was doing so, the boat made a high speed turn to \n     starboard and the Green Beret kept going--straight into the \n     river. The entire time while the boat went back to get the \n     Green Beret, Tommy was without a machine gun or a weapon of \n     any kind, but all the time he was hurling the greatest single \n     string of Lowell-Chelmsford curses ever heard at the Viet \n     Cong. He literally had swear words with tracers on them!\n       There was, of course, the moment in February, 1969 when he \n     was positioned in the very bow of the boat--in the totally \n     exposed peak tank--with more than half his body just sticking \n     up exposed to the enemy, when 3 boats turned toward the river \n     bank and Tommy found himself staring straight into an ambush \n     20 yards ahead. He never flinched as he charged the beach and \n     routed the enemy--not just once, but twice. For Seaman \n     Belodeau's devotion to duty, courage under fire, and \n     exemplary professionalism, in the highest tradition of the \n     Navy he was awarded the Bronze Star with Combat V.\n       I cannot adequately convey or describe to you the measure \n     of this man at war--standing in his peak tank in the bow, \n     screaming up a river in the dead of night, no moon, 50 yards \n     from Cambodia literally bouncing off the river bank, waiting \n     for a mine to go off or a rocket to explode--and always \n     steady, always dependable, always there for the rest of the \n     crew.\n       All Belodeaus, Chelmsford, Massachusetts, and the United \n     States should be proud of this warrior.\n       But, perhaps the greatest reason for pride as we bid our \n     Tommy goodbye, is not what he did, but who he was.\n       In many ways, Tommy walked in the footsteps of Emerson and \n     Thoreau. He was a man who wanted to walk quietly to his own \n     tune--never with any in your face attitude. He just quietly \n     wanted to be, and was, his own man.\n       From what I know, he always had this special quiet quality. \n     His expression spoke for\n\n[[Page S187]]\n\n     him. As many of you know, he was not a man of many words. So \n     he'd just give you a look. And the look would tell it all-\n     fierce determination; rollicking good fun; profound sadness. \n     I know you can see his expression for any mood he had. My \n     favorite look of all was his bemused, ``What the hell does \n     the skipper think he's doing now?\"\n       Tom would join a great group of veterans who had been \n     involved in my `84 campaign called the Doghunters. We would \n     gather irregularly for a black tie dinner and each time \n     everyone would eagerly await Tom's non-speech. He was clearly \n     the most beloved member of our group despite his distaste for \n     saying anything in public.\n       In his reticence to draw attention to himself or speak in \n     public lies the true measure of this great friend. Because in \n     1984, and again in 1996, it was his passionate, personal \n     commitment, his driving sense of loyalty, that against all \n     his other instincts drew him again into the line of fire. I \n     will never forget the brilliance and eloquence with which he \n     stood up to fight for me and for the honor of our service.\n       Again and again, Tom proved the real value of friendship. \n     For all of us here in this extended family, it will never be \n     the same. No campaign of the future will be the same without \n     you, Tom. No Doghunters' dinner will be complete without your \n     knowing smile and blushing non-speech.\n       None of this in any way suggests that it was all peaches \n     and cream for Tommy. We know it wasn't. His family and his \n     friends could see the sadness in his eyes that some say \n     changed with Vietnam.\n       There were times when all us of us around Tommy knew he \n     needed a lift: but try as one could, his sense of self \n     reliance and pride gave him a sixth sense that something was \n     up and he would quietly find an excuse to slide away or just \n     tell you things were going fine even when they weren't. Joey \n     tells me that stubborn streak came from their father. But \n     always he was the most generous in any group, ready to help \n     another.\n       So Michael, today, we his friends want to reaffirm to you \n     what you must know: your father was enormously proud of you--\n     loved you dearly--and knew that sometimes his own sense of \n     pride about what he wanted for you prevented him from always \n     living up to his own expectations. But nothing that he did or \n     thought ever diminished his joy in who you are and his trust \n     in what you will grow to be.\n       For everyone who knew and loved him here today, there is a \n     special sorrow; because we all sensed that in his recent \n     return to Massachusetts, Tommy had found a peace and purpose \n     which had liberated him from any demons. He enthusiastically \n     joined in telephoning friends for Chris Greeley's engagement \n     party. He looked happy and engaged. I saw him about 4 weeks \n     ago and he seemed more energized and happy than in some time. \n     There was a gleam in his eye and we promised to get together \n     soon. As Chuck Tamulonis who took such care of him and meant \n     so much to him told me yesterday, ``He was filling the \n     refrigerator with no-fat food, coming home early, and even \n     cooking the meals.''\n       Last year when our crew came together as a whole at \n     election time for the first time in 27 years, we departed \n     with the expectation that we were hooked up and on the road \n     to growing old together. But God had other plans. And of all \n     people we should not be surprised. We have always said at our \n     Doghunter dinner that one thing we learned in Vietnam was \n     Grace of God, every day beyond Vietnam was extra. Tommy had a \n     lot of extra days and for that we are grateful.\n       So today, as we say goodbye, joined with his family and \n     those he grew up with, what we, his friends, celebrate above \n     all in Tommy's life is his special, gentle decency--a loyal, \n     loyal friend of enormous heart who was generous in spirit \n     beyond expectation and sometimes beyond understanding.\n       To Radarman Seaman, Thomas M. Belodeau, to our friend \n     Tommy: until we meet again, may you have fair winds and \n     following seas. And may we all leave here reminded of the \n     words of the poet William Butler Yeats:\n       ``Think where man's glory most begins and ends. And say, my \n     glory was, I had such friends.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/28/senate-section/article/S186-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S.

As the \nreport explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.\n  The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content \nof extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.\n  This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between \nthe law enforcement communities of both countries, and thereby make a \nsignificant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. It \nis the first extradition treaty between the two countries.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.
