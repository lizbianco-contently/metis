Mr. President, a number of us this morning want to visit \nabout the issue of tax cuts. We are having a debate--I was going to say \na dispute, but it is more a debate--in Congress, between the House and \nthe Senate and between Members of both parties, about how taxes should \nbe cut. It is clear now from the votes in the House and the Senate that \nthere will be a tax cut. We do have bills in conference that call for a \ntax cut in a number of different ways--cuts in the income tax, cuts in \nestate tax, cuts in capital gains and a range of other areas. But there \nis substantial debate about who gets what.\n  Mr. President, the debate is not idle, and it is not just political. \nI suppose there is some partisanship involved in this as well, but when \nyou say that the Federal Government has the capability of reducing \ntaxes for the American people, the question then is, for whom and by \nhow much and with what purpose? The stakes are fairly large because we \nare talking about a fairly substantial tax reduction, and the question \nis how to divide that.\n  There has been a dispute on the floor of the Senate about what the \nnumbers show and who puts together a chart that shows what part of the \npopulation will get how much in tax relief. There have been editorials \nwritten about that in the Washington Post, New York Times, and others \nand a substantial amount of analysis of these charts.\n  One thing to me is certain, however. There are impulses in Congress \nto define how we provide a tax cut in a narrow way in order that the \ntax cut ends up providing substantially greater benefits to those at \nthe upper end of the economic ladder than those at the lower end of the \neconomic ladder. I happen to come from a part of the country that \nlargely believes that the economic engine in this country comes from \nwork, from people who go out and work and toil all day. That represents \nthe economic engine that keeps this country going. They earn a wage and \nthey have a view about the future in this country.\n\n  If their view is optimistic, if their view is positive, then they \nmake decisions with the money they have earned. They perhaps buy a \nwasher or dryer, buy a car, buy a home, take a vacation. If their view \nis pessimistic or if their outlook is less than positive, they make \ndecisions to defer those purchases. They don't buy a washer or dryer. \nThey defer it. They don't buy a\n\n[[Page S7880]]\n\ncar. So our economy really rests on a cushion of confidence.\n  You can talk to all the economists in the world, you can talk to the \nbest trained people in this country in the field of economics, and it \ndoesn't matter what they say. What matters is that the American economy \nrides on a pillow of confidence. If it exists, the American economy \ndoes well; if it doesn't, the American economy retracts.\n  People in this country generally feel pretty good today. The economy \nis generally moving in the right direction. Unemployment is down, \ninflation is down, the deficit is down, way down. People feel pretty \ngood. Economic growth is up. The result is we have more revenue coming \nin to the Federal coffers, and the decision by Congress is to give some \nback in the form of tax cuts. Then the question is, to whom?\n  I come from a town of about 400 people, when I left. It is now 300 \npeople. If, in my hometown making this decision, a local community \ndecision, we had proposed what is proposed in terms of the distribution \nnow in Congress of this tax cut, I think it would cause some real \nconsternation.\n  Let's think just a moment about my hometown of 400 people. When there \nis a meeting, they put a little sign in the middle of Main Street, \nbecause there is not that much traffic and the sign won't be knocked \ndown, that says, ``Meeting tonight, 8 o'clock, the Legion Hall.'' Then \nfolks come to the meeting.\n  So they come to the Legion Hall, and 400 of them would come and we \nwould say, ``All right, now we have some money we want to distribute \nhere, and it comes from you because you pay taxes. The question is, How \nshall we give it back?'' And someone in the back of the room stands up \nand says, ``I have an idea. Why don't we give 60 percent of this money \nto those four people sitting up in the front row. Out of 400, we will \ntake 4 of them. That is 1 percent. One percent of the people, those \nfour people we propose should get 60 percent of what we are going to \ngive back.''\n  Gosh, I think that would cause real trouble in that room. Let's \nassume they are all working now, all working, all paying taxes, but we \nsay, ``Let's have the four people up in front get 60 percent of the tax \ncut.''\n  Then we say, ``Let's take the bottom 20 percent, let's take 80 people \nwho make the least money in town. They are working, but they make the \nleast money in town, the lowest wages. They are having the toughest \ntime. Let's take those 80 people and have them move their chair over to \nthe left side of the building, and we are going to give them one-half \nof 1 percent of the tax cut.'' Gosh, I don't think that is a decision \nmy hometown would make in a million years, not if they are all working.\n  Yet, that is what is at the root of the proposals in Congress. It is \nto say, if we are going to give a tax cut, let's give it back only on \nthe basis of taxes paid, sufficient so that we say let's have a child \ntax credit of $500 per child, but you don't get it if you don't make \nenough money. It's true if you are working, in two-thirds of the cases, \nthe American workers are paying more in payroll taxes, yes, to the \nFederal Government, more in payroll taxes than they are paying in \ntaxes. But those in the bowels of this decisionmaking process say, \n``Payroll taxes don't count. We don't want to measure payroll taxes \nthat you pay in terms of whether or not you should get a tax cut; it is \nonly taxes.''\n  The result is this family. Lashawn Buckman is from Washington, DC. \nShe works downtown as an administrative assistant in a hospital. She is \nexpected to earn about $25,000 this year. She has a child aged 3 and a \nchild aged 7. She will pay about $3,250 in income and payroll taxes \nthis year, and under the bill that was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, despite the fact that it advertises a $500-per-child \ntax credit, she will get no income tax cut. She will get no tax cut at \nall, because she doesn't quite earn enough money. She pays a \nsubstantial amount of payroll taxes, works hard, but she is defined as \nineligible.\n  To those of us who think she ought to be eligible, we are told by \nthose who oppose it that we are proposing welfare. No, we are proposing \ngiving some taxes back to someone who works who pays substantial \npayroll taxes.\n  Here is another family. Elisa Garcia lives in Fairfax County, VA, and \nworks for a technology firm. She makes about $10 an hour, works 40 \nhours a week. She works hard. She expects to earn about $20,800 this \nyear. She has three children --George, Samantha, and Liz. They are 6, \n10, and 15 years of age. She pays about $2,200 in taxes and payroll \ntaxes, and under the tax bill passed both by the House and the Senate, \nshe will receive no tax reduction. She works hard, she pays taxes, but \nbecause of the way we have defined it, we say it doesn't count. Unless \nyou are paying a specific amount of income tax and unless you are in a \nspecific income category, it doesn't count, you don't count as a \ntaxpayer and, therefore, when it comes time to provide some tax relief, \nyou don't get any.\n  The reason I mention this is we have a lot of occupations in this \ncountry. This is from Parade magazine describing the incomes of people \nthat just get left out. This would not happen in my hometown, I don't \nthink. I think if everybody came to a meeting in that town, and 400 \npeople said, ``Let's decide how to divide up the tax cuts,'' they would \nsay, ``Everybody is working and paying taxes, so let's have everybody \nget something back from this tax cut.''\n  Here is a store owner, $25,000. They are not going to get anything. \nThey don't make enough money. A preschool teacher, $11,000; a medical \ntechnician, $13,000; an assistant store manager, a nurse, a policeman, \nthey do not make enough money. They pay payroll taxes, but they do not \nmake enough money to get a tax cut. I am sorry, that is wrong. And we \nhave a chance to correct it.\n  The opportunity to correct it exists right now in that conference \ncommittee, the opportunity to say to this country that it is wrong to \nprovide 60 percent of the tax cut to the top 1 percent of the American \npeople.\n  It is right to decide that we ought not continue to decide that we \nshould tax work and exempt investment. It is right to decide that we \nought to have a fair distribution of the tax cuts so that all of the \nAmerican people who are out there working are benefited by this \nproposed cut in taxes.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from New Jersey is here, and I appreciate \nhim coming to the floor today to speak about this same subject. Let me \nyield the floor to him for as much time as he may consume.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague, the \nSenator from North Dakota, for his persistence on this issue and on \nissues of fairness altogether. His leadership on so many issues has \nbeen, frankly, the motivator for many here to take up causes that he so \nably leads. And in this case, once again, he has indicated how \nimportant it is for us to be a fair society.\n  Mr. President, I was one of those privileged to be part of the \nnegotiating team. I say ``privileged''--some days I am not sure--\nbecause the decisions were tough ones. But as we review the tax cuts \nthat are going to be made in the reconciliation bill, the bill to put \ninto place the elements of the budget that we prescribed as a \ndirection, I want to talk about the importance of ensuring that any tax \ncuts that we make be principally targeted to ordinary middle-class \nfamilies and that we not permit an explosion of the deficit in the \nfuture as a result of tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, we are coming off of a really good period for America. \nThe economy is strong. People are working, inflation is down, and we \nare assured by the comments yesterday of the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve that inflation still looks like it is going to stay down. It is \nthe kind of scene that almost a writer could produce in terms of what \nyou would like to see in an ideal world.\n  Our deficit was $290 billion when President Clinton took over, now \npredicted to be $45 billion for this fiscal year ending September 30. \nAnd it is believed that in the year 1998, if things continue as they \nare, that we will actually be at a zero deficit or perhaps even have a \nsurplus in the 1998 year. That is a wonderful thing to be able to think \nabout because one of the things that we want to do is relieve the \nburden from our children, our grandchildren in the future to have to \npay off debts and\n\n[[Page S7881]]\n\nto pay the debt service that incurs with deficits.\n  But, Mr. President, despite all of the good news--and I come out of \nthe corporate world. I spent 30 years of my life building a business. \nAnd I know lots of people who have been successful in business, and I \nstill talk to them. And I have learned in my informal polling that lots \nof people who have been successful, corporate leaders, CEO's, chief \noperating officers, chief financial officers, marketing managers, they \nwill say to me in public, ``Frank, I don't need a tax cut. What I need \nis an America that's going in the direction that it is going, that \npeople can count on jobs, where people can believe that inflation and \nthat deficit growth will not be a burden to their children.'' That is \nhardly the legacy that we want to leave.\n  As I heard one CEO I had occasion to meet over this weekend describe, \nwho runs a giant, giant company, with over 30,000 employees, he said, \n``I don't need a capital gains tax cut and I don't need an income tax \ncut. We don't pay enough,'' he said--this is a corporate executive--\n``We don't pay enough in this country for the benefits we get out of \nthis Nation of ours.''\n  And so as we talk about our tax cut, we know where we have to direct \nit. It has to go to the middle-class families. It has to go to the \npeople who find that two of them have to work in order to do what one \nwas able to do in the past, that they pay the price in many ways for \ntheir two-job requirements. They neglect their children, not \nintentionally, not the kind of neglect that comes with abuse, but they \njust do not have the time or the energy to put into their families when \nmother works and dad works and they meet only as they pass through the \ndoor.\n  I had occasion to meet with one of the service organizations across \nthis country that does mentoring where they tie an adult and child and \nmake sure that child has someone to answer to, someone to converse \nwith. And I asked them about the profile of the children that they see. \nA lot of them are obviously from poor families, but not all. They said \nto me a lot of the kids that they are seeing are kids whose families \nare so beset with the need to earn a living that they do not have time \nfor them. And the kids resort to strangers' encouragement to just get a \nlift and to get some attention.\n  So as we discuss these tax cuts, I plead with my colleagues, make \nsure that we put them in the hands of the middle class so people can \ntalk to their kids about their education in the future and know very \nwell that they have a chance to get out of the economic difficulties \nthat they may see their parents in, that they can get the education \nthey need, they can get the skills that they need.\n  These families love their children. They do not see them much. And \nthey want to plan for their future. And we can help them, Mr. \nPresident. We can help them by directing these tax cuts primarily to \nthe middle class so that they can help their kids with their education \nand provide for their own retirement. These are the people who need the \ntax relief.\n  But, unfortunately, these are not the people who are going to get the \nbulk of the relief in the House and the Senate tax bills. Those bills \nprovide roughly 45 percent of their tax cuts to the top 10 percent of \nincome earners in the country. And it is just not right. There is a \nbetter way, Mr. President. And President Clinton has shown us how. His \nplan provides many of the same types of tax cuts that are included in \nthe Republican plan, and the total amount of tax relief is roughly the \nsame but the provisions in the President's plan are structured \ndifferently to give most of the benefits to ordinary hard-working \nAmericans.\n  Under the President's plan, the middle 60 percent of income earners \nreceive two-thirds of the tax cuts, the middle 60 percent get two-\nthirds of the tax cuts. By contrast, under the Senate and House plans, \nthe middle-income working families receive only one-third of the \nbenefits--one-third.\n  The President's plan provides a $500 tax credit for children, but \nunlike the Senate and the House plans, it makes the credit available \nfor working families with little or no tax liability. In fact, the \nSenate and the House plans deny the child tax credit to millions of \nhard-working families who pay taxes and earn less than $30,000 a year, \nthe subject that the Senator from North Dakota was addressing just \nmoments ago.\n  Some in Congress are claiming that providing tax breaks to teachers \nand police officers, firefighters somehow amounts to welfare. It is \nridiculous and it is an insult to millions of hard-working American \nfamilies.\n  The President's plan cuts capital gains taxes. It cuts estate taxes, \nand it provides new incentives for savings. But the President does it \nin a fair way that benefits primarily the middle class. And that is the \nkey difference. Another advantage of the President's tax plan is its \ncosts do not explode in the outyears, the years after those that we are \ntalking about with our budget prescription now.\n  The Senate and House bills include several provisions with costs that \nincrease substantially in the future. Why should we give a tax break \ntoday and have to pay for it doubly in the 5- to 10-year period after \nthis?\n  Yesterday, the Treasury Department released an analysis showing that \nthe House's capital gains rates balloon from $35 billion in the first \n10 years to almost $200 billion in the subsequent 10 years--from $35 to \n$200 billion. And that is an exploding tax cut if there ever was one. \nThere is no way for us to function.\n  Mr. President, I have heard it argued there is no way to cut taxes \nwithout disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. Some serious people \nmake that argument, but it is an absurd argument. Surely, if we can \nplan to get to Mars and do all the great things that this country has \nthe capacity to do, we can find a way to target tax cuts to the middle \nclass. It does not take a rocket science. It is much simpler. It does \ntake, however, a commitment not only from the head but from the heart \nas well. And President Clinton's plan proves it can be done.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to continue working with all of my \ncolleagues to make the tax bill as fair as possible. I would like to \ncut the taxes for the middle class and working Americans, the people \nwho need it the most. And I would like to see it done in a fiscally \nresponsible way that does not burden future generations with the \nexploding deficits in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I have come this morning to join my colleagues in talking about the \nissue of tax fairness that this Congress is now working toward in the \nconference committee between the Senate and House, working with the \nWhite House, to move us toward the final parts of the budget \nreconciliation and tax package.\n\n  First of all, I want to say it is really incredible to me that I \nstand here today in the summer of 1997 talking about a tax cut. When I \ncame to the Senate, back in 1992, I came at a time when we had a $300 \nbillion deficit. And I remember campaigning back in that year, when \nRoss Perot was running around the country showing us his charts of the \nexploding deficit, and for all of us who were elected in that year and \nsince that time our No. 1 goal has been to come here to balance the \nbudget.\n  As one of those people who came here in 1992, with a $300 billion \ndeficit, I have continually told my constituents, the families that I \nrepresent, the people that I work for, that my No. 1 goal here is to \nget to a balanced budget, and that although I agree that tax cuts are a \ngood thing to have, that we need to do it in a rational way and we \nshould not do it until we get to a balanced budget.\n  I remember back in 1993, when we passed our first budget here, it was \na budget that we all remember well, that passed by one vote here in the \nSenate, that began us on the road today to where we are now in the \nsummer of 1997 able to talk about a tax cut because we made a tough \ndecision 4 years ago to work us toward that balanced budget.\n  We now have a deficit that is less than $70 billion. And in fact, \nsome predict that without Congress doing anything, we will be at a \nbalanced budget within a year because of the tough votes that we have \ntaken over the last 5 years. Because of the Members here\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\nwho were willing to say no to many of the special interests who came to \nus and wanted more and more, we were able to say no. And we have worked \nvery, very hard to get ourselves to this point.\n  Having said that, I am a member of the Budget Committee. I have \nworked very hard since the beginning of this year to put together the \nbudget reconciliation package, to work with my fellow members on the \nBudget Committee, to work with the White House, to work through the \nconference, to get to the point of having a balanced budget to present \nto this country.\n  As part of that agreement, we do have a tax cut package. Because I \nhave worked hard on that, because I am committed to the reconciliation \npackage that the Budget Committee agreed to, I did vote for the tax cut \npackage that came out of the Senate.\n  That tax cut is now being debated by the conference committee again \nbetween the Senate and the House and the President, the White House, \nand I think the most important thing we can do at this point as we work \nto the final negotiation of this package is make sure we do the right \nthing for this country.\n  When I fly home to my State of Washington 2,500 miles away from here, \nevery weekend I spend time attending town hall meetings, going around \nto small communities in my State. Where I get the best input is when I \ngo to the grocery store on Sunday afternoons with my family and people \nwalk up to me and talk to me about what they are hearing about what is \nhappening in Congress. Time and time again I have young people coming \nto me--a young teacher this past Sunday, a policeman, a young family--\nand their question is the same as every other American: What am I going \nto get out of the tax cut? What will I get? I hear the Members of this \nSenate and this body asking the same question as well: What am I going \nto get out of this tax cut?\n  I think the important question is not what am I going to get out of \nthis tax cut, but what will this tax cut do to strengthen the America \nthat we all worked so hard here for, and what can we do so that 10, 15, \n20 years from now we are not having another Ross Perot run around the \ncountry with charts and graphs showing a deficit that is out of \ncontrol.\n  As I talk to my constituents around my State, what I hear most often \nis that if we invest in our young people, invest in our children, we \nwill do the right thing for the country's future. When I look at this \ntax package, those are the questions I ask. Are we doing the right \nthing so that young children, as they grow up and get out and start \ntheir own families, have the money they need to make sure that their \nchildren get a good education, that they have access to health care, \nthat they are able to send their children to college. That is how we \nare going to make our country strong.\n  So when I look at this tax package that we are now debating, I see \nthat the President's tax package will actually do the most for those \nyoung families, for that young teacher, for that young policeman, for \nthat young law clerk, for that family that is just starting out, for \nthose families who are earning less than $30,000 or $40,000 a year. \nThat is why I believe so strongly that the refundable tax credit has to \nbe part of this package.\n  I see my colleague on the floor, Senator Landrieu, who is new here, \nfrom Louisiana, who has worked very hard to ensure that the tax cut is \nrefundable. Yet, I hear this being debated, I hear it characterized as \nthe people who are on earned income tax credit, those who are earning \nless than $25,000 or $30,000 a year, if we give them a tax credit, it \nis giving tax credits to people who are on welfare. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. These are working families. They go to work \nevery day. They are struggling to make ends meet. They are paying for \nday care. They are working to make sure they have nutritious food on \nthe table. They are trying to save a few dollars for their children to \ngo on to higher education so they can contribute to our economy. Those \nare the people we need to help. Those are the people that the \nPresident's tax cut really goes to, and that is what we have an \nobligation as a Senate and a Congress today to make sure that we take \ncare of in the future.\n  We will do the wrong thing if we pass a tax cut that merely inflates \nthe income of those at the top, that gives away tax dollars to people \nwho are already able to send their children to college, who are already \nable to take vacations in exotic places, who are already able to ensure \nthat their family has a good home and a safe neighborhood to live in. \nWe will do the right thing if we make sure that the tax cuts we pass \nhelp those young families who are struggling today, because if we lift \nthem up and make sure that their children are healthy and well-educated \nand secure and that they have a good quality of life, then this country \nwill be stronger in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to step back from this big debate about who is \ngoing to benefit and how the tax package will be put together, and say, \nwhat do I want this country to look like 10, 15, 20 years from now? Do \nI want to see it strong? Do I want to see a lot of young people with \nhope in their eyes who know they will be able to go to college? Do I \nwant to see young families who are saying, I can save enough to buy a \nhome and feel secure? Do I want to see a country where children have \nthe nutrition that they need, that have the health care that they need? \nIf that is the country we want, we will ensure that we move toward the \nPresident's tax cut, that we have a refundable tax credit in here, that \nwe put our tax cuts where they will make the most difference.\n  That is why I support the President's tax cut plan and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am happy to be here this morning to join my colleague from \nWashington State and so many of our colleagues to talk about the issues \nregarding this tax package and the budget that we are debating.\n\n  I will be setting up in just a moment a picture of a family, Mr. \nPresident, from Shreveport, LA, the Meyers family. It is Lois and Scott \nMeyers, their son, Clayton, and Jessica, their daughter, who is 17. \nTheir son Clayton is 5, the same age as my son Connor. This family \nworks very hard, Mr. President. They only make, however, $17,000 a \nyear. She, Mrs. Meyers, has a master's degree, but she works at a \nhomeless shelter as a counselor. He has a $7-an-hour job. Of course, it \nis not full-time, but he also is a counselor and does not work a full \n40 hours, but under contract has a flexible schedule. They are \nstruggling hard to raise these two children.\n  If we do not make this change that so many of us have talked about, \nexpanding this $500 tax credit, this family in Louisiana, the Meyers \nfamily, and so many families like them in your State, in the State of \nWashington, in Texas, in South Carolina, will simply be left out. I \nbelieve, as so many of our colleagues do, that everyone in America, \nfrankly, deserves a tax break. I really believe that, and I believe \nthere are ways for us to provide tax breaks for those at the higher \nend, for those at the middle end, and for those working hard and \nstruggling to make ends meet at the lower income levels. This family is \nnot a welfare family. They are a hard-working, lower income family.\n  In Louisiana, 95 percent of the people in my State--95 percent--make \nless than $75,000. Ninety-five percent of the households in Louisiana \nmake less than $75,000. As their Senator, it is my job to argue that \nall of them, I believe, deserve some sort of tax relief. If we do not \nmake this child credit stackable against the earned income tax credit, \nfamilies like this, the Meyers family, will simply be left out. I just \nthink that is not right. I believe they need to have tax relief.\n  Now, this family, at $17,000 income, is frankly not going to be able \nto take much advantage of the capital gains tax relief, although I \nsupport capital gains tax relief. They are not going to take advantage \nof the estate tax relief. Their estate is not anywhere close to \n$600,000 in assets. They will be able to take advantage of, hopefully, \nthe HOPE scholarship for Jessica as she gets ready to go into college, \nbut if they don't get the $500 tax credit, they will not be a part of \nthis tax plan.\n  Now, it is true that they did only pay $200 in income tax last year \nbecause of the earned-income tax credit. They received a credit of \nabout $1,200, but this\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\nfamily paid approximately $1,300 in payroll taxes, and that is what is \nimportant--for them to get this child tax credit against their payroll \ntaxes, as well as the credit against the income tax.\n  The President is fighting very hard, along with many, many of the \nDemocrats. I hope some of the Republicans will join us in saying that \nwe want tax relief for these families.\n  In other States, the average schoolteacher salary, preschool and \nkindergarten teacher, is $18,700. The average sales occupation in \nAmerica today is $24,000. Bookkeepers and accountants make on an \naverage $20,000. Dental assistant, about $18,000. If this tax credit is \nnot corrected in the way we believe it should be in conference, all of \nthese families that I have mentioned--firefighters, bookkeepers, \nteachers, and this Meyers family--will not get the tax relief I think \nthey deserve.\n  I am here this morning to speak for them. They are not able to speak \non this floor. They are only able to write letters and to call in. I am \nhere this morning, along with many of my colleagues, to speak for these \nfamilies, to say, ``Let's make this tax package fair.''\n  We also need, as you know, Mr. President, and so many of our \ncolleagues, to make sure that we move toward a balanced budget, that we \ndo it in a fair way, by giving tax relief broadly in the ways that we \ncan, also cutting back where we can to make sure that we are running \nthis Government in a very fiscally responsible way that promotes \ngrowth, that promotes job development, but also promotes fairness.\n  When we can give a tax cut, let's give it to the families that \ndeserve it. This is a hard-working family. They are not on welfare. \nThey never have been on welfare, and they deserve a break today.\n  Another subject of the tax bill that is important to me and so many \non both sides of the aisle is the provision for a tax exemption for the \nState-sponsored savings plans. Florida has an extensive plan: 450,000 \nfamilies have been able to join the Florida prepaid tuition plan. \nSenator Graham has been very supportive of this provision.\n  In Louisiana, before I was elected to the Senate, as State treasurer \nI helped to institute a Start Smart plan, where families of all incomes \nup to $100,000--which includes just about everybody in Louisiana--would \nbe able to set aside a small amount of money, as much as they were able \nto, sometimes as little at $10 a week, into a savings plan, and in our \nState, our general fund in Louisiana matches. For every $1 that a \nfamily is able to put up--it can be a parent, a guardian, a \ngrandparent, a corporation can set up a savings plan for a child so \nthey could go to college--whatever amount they are able to save, the \nState general fund matches that savings. For those at the lower income \nlevel, as the Meyers family, $18,000 to $20,000, the State makes a \ngreater match, but the State gives some help or match to families \nmaking up to $100,000 on a progressive scale.\n\n  The bottom line, in our conference, we have a possibility, which I \nunderstand the President supports--and I hope the American people will \nsupport this, too--to give tax-exempt status to those savings plans. We \nwant more children, Mr. President, to be able to go to college. We want \neveryone to have the education they need to compete in a world very \ndifferent than the world we grew up in. They need those technical \nskills. If they are not able to go to a 4-year college or a 2-year \ncommunity college to at least get the technical training, post high \nschool--12 years of education is no longer what is required. They need \nto go the extra 2 or 4 years to get the education they need to compete. \nFamilies need to be able to save.\n  One of the other great provisions in this tax bill, but it is not a \ndone deal yet, another great provision, which will cost about $1 \nbillion, but it will be the best $1 billion we will ever spend, is \nleveraging the great will and great hope and great aspiration that \nfamilies have to be able to have their children and grandchildren do \nbetter than themselves, to enable them to set up these savings \naccounts. I hope we will urge the President and urge the Republicans \nand Democrats to support this one provision in this tax bill that will \nmake these savings plans tax exempt, encourage more States outside of \nFlorida and Louisiana--and only a few others have set up these \nprograms--urge them to set them up.\n  This is supported by the National Treasurers Association, which has \nbeen a very strong advocate for this savings plan. This is not a \nhandout, Mr. President. This is a handup. This says to families, if you \nare willing to set aside $10 a week or $50 a month or even $100 a \nmonth, we will match that effort, we will allow that fund to grow, tax \nexempt, so you will have that money.\n  Mr. President, $500 a year, $17,000 a family would be able to save, \nalmost $30,000 under a savings plan, even a modest savings plan, which \nis a good amount of money, actually a very large amount of money to be \nable to have that young person attend school. Also, this is for adults \nwho set up in Louisiana this savings plan which allows them to go back \nto school to get the degree they need to have a higher salary and a \nmore productive income level.\n  So, besides the $500 tax credit that we on this side feel so strongly \nabout making fair, this provision that allows and actually encourages \nfamilies to save and increases the savings rate of America--which any \neconomist and any person that is involved in the financial sector will \ntell you, America's savings rate is too low. It is not good for our \ncountry.\n  So we do two things at once. We help families do the right thing by \nsaving for their children. We also increase the savings rate for \nAmerica, which helps our business to have more capital to invest. It is \na win-win for everyone. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthe change in the $500 child tax credit, as well as the provision for \nthe statewide savings plans which would be so helpful to thousands, \nmillions, of American families.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the next few days could make the \ndifference between every working family getting the benefit of the \nchild care tax credit in the budget--or the benefit of the child credit \nonly going to families earning more than $30,000. The next few days \ncould make the difference between whether or not more than 25,000 West \nVirginia families get the benefit of child tax credit or not. \nNationwide we're talking about almost 5 million families who could get \nleft out if we don't make the child credit fairer to all families. \nDemocrats want all hard working families to get the benefit of the \nchild credit--under the tax bills that passed the House and Senate they \nwon't. As congress and the President try to wrap up the bipartisan \nbudget deal and its family tax cuts, we need to improve the child tax \ncredit so it helps American families that need it most.\n  The average family in West Virginia has an income of $27,500. What \nthat means is that about 25,000 West Virginia families won't benefit \nfrom the Republican child credit plans under consideration unless we \nchange the tax bills so that all working families share in the benefits \nof the child tax credit just like middle income families do. The \nPresident has a child tax credit proposal that benefits all working \nfamilies.\n  We should adopt it as part of our tax cut package or too many West \nVirginians and lower-middle income families across the country will be \nleft out.\n  For the average hard-working American family to get a direct, real \nbenefit from this year's budget agreement, we need to make sure that \nall working families get the benefit of the $500 child tax credit.\n  Average American families don't have multi-million dollar estates, \nand they're not playing the stock market. They don't have enough money \nto invest in IRA's. They go to work every day, often both parents work \nfull time, and they have a tough time paying their bills, putting food \non the table, making the mortgage, and seeing to it that their kids \ngrow up safe and healthy. Those are the families who I think this \nbudget agreement should deliver for first and foremost--before we give \nthe wealthy a chance to save tax-free, benefit a handful of the \nwealthiest Americans with big estates, or provide a capital gains tax \ncut.\n  Extending health care coverage to the children of working families \nwho don't qualify for Medicaid is the other major benefit of this tax \nbill for working families.\n  Right now, we don't know if these families will get real health care \ncoverage from the final agreement, with\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\nhealth care benefits they can count or not. That is another major issue \nwhich could be decided in the next few days. I am here to tell my \ncolleagues and the American people that there is simply no choice but \nfor us to stand up for hard working American families and give them the \nfamily tax credit they were promised, and the health insurance coverage \ntheir children need.\n  It defies common sense to allocate $85 billion in net tax cuts--as \ncalled for under the bipartisan budget agreement--and leave out the \nworking families who need it most. The President's proposal directly \nbenefits families who work and who pay taxes--it is not welfare--it is \nthe helping hand they need.\n  These families deserve to share in the benefits of the tax cut. These \nfamilies are the families of a rookie cop in West Virginia, a public \nschool teacher, a bank teller, or a fireman. Middle class families \ndeserve a break, so do families who are lower-middle class, and we \ndon't have to choose between them. Working families all can benefit \nfrom the child tax credit as it is constructed in the President's child \ntax credit proposal. It would treat the children of all working \nfamilies equally--all the families who are working hard and pulling the \nproverbial wagon should benefit from the child tax credit.\n  The Children's Commission unanimously endorsed this kind of child tax \ncredit. This tax bill is where we can deliver.\n  I am here to report that in the next few days or over the next few \nweeks as we complete our work on this historic budget agreement, I will \nnot stop fighting for the families in West Virginia who deserve a child \ntax break, who deserve health care coverage for their kids, and who \ndeserve our help, now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7879-6", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7884-S7885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FAIR TAX RELIEF FOR WORKING AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Clinton administration and the \nconferees on the tax cut bill work out their differences, we need to do \nall we can to guarantee that fair tax relief is delivered to the \nAmerican people. The last thing Congress should do is enact a tax \nrelief bill that offers plums to the wealthy and crumbs to everyone \nelse.\n  Who deserves the tax relief? Is it the average hard-working family on \nMain Street, or the wealthy millionaire on Wall Street? Is it the \nrookie policeman walking the beat? Or is it the heirs of fortunes worth \nmillions of dollars? Is it the nurse trying to raise a family on \n$27,000 a year? Or is it the financier buying and selling stocks and \nbonds?\n  That is what is at stake this week and next week, nothing less. There \nare two key questions: will Congress target the scarce funds available \nfor tax cuts to working Americans in blue-collar shirts or to tycoons \nin designer suits? Will the amount of tax relief be responsible, or \nwill it explode in the out-years and unbalance the budget we are trying \nso hard to balance?\n  Everyone at the negotiating table now agrees that $85 billion is a \nrealistic figure for tax relief over the next 5 years. The debate is no \nlonger about how much tax relief we should enact for that period. Now \nthe debate is over who should benefit from that tax relief, and how \nmuch they should benefit.\n  Our Republican friends want to target the vast majority of the \nbenefits of tax relief on those who have already benefited the most \nfrom the Nation's soaring economic growth--the wealthiest individuals \nand corporations in our society.\n  Clearly, this tax bill cannot close the widening income gap in our \nsociety. But just as clearly, it should not make the gap wider.\n  Over the last two decades, the rich have gotten richer, and everyone \nelse has fallen behind. During the 1950's and 1960's, all income groups \nin the population participated in the economy's growth. We all advanced \ntogether. But, in the 1980's and 1990's, we grew apart. The benefits of \neconomic growth have tilted heavily toward the rich.\n  Instead of reducing this inequality, the Republicans would add to it. \nTheir tax cuts are weighted heavily to the rich. According to the \nTreasury Department, the House Republican tax plan would give two \nthirds--two-thirds--of its benefits to the richest fifth of the \npopulation.\n  And that estimate is conservative. Citizens for Tax Justice included \nthe estate tax cuts and corporate tax cuts in their analysis and \ncalculates that the richest fifth would get 80 percent of the benefits.\n\n  By contrast, under the President's proposal 83 percent of the tax \ncuts would go to working families and the middle class, and only 10 \npercent would go to the wealthy.\n  The largest tax breaks in the Republican plan are the lower tax rate \non capital gains, the indexing of capital gains for inflation, the \nestate tax cuts, and the expansion of IRAs and other tax-preferred \nsavings accounts. All of these provisions benefit the wealthy, not \naverage Americans.\n  In addition, the Republican proposal opens the way for more tax \nloopholes and other special interest tax breaks. The changes to the \ncorporate alternative minimum tax alone will make it easier for large \ncorporations to earn billions of dollars in profits but pay little or \nno taxes.\n  The most unbalanced giveaway in the Republican bill is the capital \ngains tax cut. Under the Republican bill the rich will see their \ncapital gains tax rate cut in half. The lowest bracket taxpayers will \nonly see a reduction of one-third.\n  The Republican tax break on capital gains will be worth all of $6 to \nthe average family with median income. But it will be worth over $7,000 \nto those in the top 1 percent of the population.\n  By contrast, under the President's proposal, everyone will get the \nsame tax break of 30 percent on their capital gains. The President's \nproposal ensures that the same breaks granted to the rich are also \ngiven to every taxpayer. It is simple fairness that everyone should \nreceive the same treatment.\n  Another unbalanced provision in the Republican proposal is the estate \ntax reduction. The Republican provisions are aimed at the top 2 percent \nof all estates. They help those who have done extremely well in recent \nyears. Median income taxpayers will see no tax reduction at all from \nthese provisions.\n  The Republicans claim that they are helping families with the $500 \nchildren's tax credit. But most families earning under $30,000 will not \nbe eligible to receive the full benefits of the credit under the \nRepublican plan, and many of these hard-working, tax-paying Americans \nwill receive no benefit from the credit at all. The President's \nproposal is far fairer in enabling these families to take advantage of \nthe credit.\n  Furthermore, no tax bill can be considered fair if it does not \naddress the needs of low and moderate income families for affordable \nhealth insurance coverage for their children. Ninety percent of \nuninsured children are members of working families. These parents work \nhard--40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year--but all their hard work does \nnot buy the insurance their children need for a healthy start in life.\n  The Senate bill offered a downpayment on this problem by providing \n$24 billion to help such families purchase affordable coverage. This \ncoverage was financed, in part, by a 20-cent-per-pack increase in the \ncigarette tax. Whether to include this cigarette tax increase, and the \nadditional $8 billion in funding for child health insurance it will \nbuy, in the final tax bill is now in dispute. In view of the immense \ncosts that smoking inflicts on society and the critical need for \nchildren's health insurance for low and moderate income families, it \nwould be a travesty if big tobacco prevails and eliminates these \nprovisions from the final legislation.\n  Finally, the Republican proposal has serious defects in the long run \nthat make it irresponsible and that will cause the deficit to explode \nin future years. According to the Center for Budget and Policy \nPriorities, the Republican proposal will increase the deficit by $500 \nbillion to $600 billion in the 10 years after 2007.\n  We went down this deficit road once before, with the excessive Reagan \ntax cuts of the 1980's. We should learn from that history, not repeat \nit. It is a pyrrhic victory if the budget is in balance in 2002, and \nthen grossly unbalanced in the years that follow.\n  Democrats are proud to stand for responsible tax relief that is fair \nto the American people. The Republican alternative flunks the test of \nfairness, and it flunks the test of responsibility. The choice is clear \nand the people will judge Congress by how we respond.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7885]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7884-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7885-S7886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   A TAX CUT FOR PEOPLE WHO PAY TAXES\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I understand our Democratic colleagues have \nbeen out today to proudly unfurl the banner proclaiming ``redistribute \nthe wealth.'' They have been looking at the tax cut that has passed the \nHouse and Senate, and they have discovered something that, to them, \nseems miraculous. I would like to take a few minutes this morning to \naddress the issue. Our Democratic colleagues have discovered that the \nbottom 20 percent of all income earners in America do not get a tax cut \nunder the tax bill that passed the U.S. Senate with 80 votes, and \nfurther that the top 20 percent of all income earners get a substantial \ntax cut. Our Democratic colleagues believe that this is grossly unfair \nand they want to do something about it.\n  Well, let me first set the record straight. It is true that, in our \ntax bill--at least the version that passed the House--the bottom 20 \npercent of income earners in America do not get much of a tax cut. It \nis also true that the top 20 percent of income earners will get a \nsubstantial tax cut.\n  But as Paul Harvey would say, let me tell you the rest of the story. \nThe rest of the story is that, as a group, the bottom 20 percent of \nincome earners in America pay no income taxes. The top 20 percent of \nincome earners in America pay 78.9 percent of all the income taxes paid \nin America. So I do not understand why our Democratic colleagues are so \nshocked to learn that people who do not pay income taxes do not get an \nincome tax cut when we are cutting income taxes. Nor can I understand \nwhy they are so shocked to learn that when 20 percent of the workers in \nAmerica are paying 78.9 percent of all income taxes, it is that 20 \npercent which will benefit from a tax cut when we are talking about \ncutting income taxes.\n  Now, what our colleagues on the left would like to do, in following \nthe President's proposal, is to take the tax cuts away from a working \ncouple, both of them working full time, making a total of $54,000 a \nyear, and instead give it to people who do not pay any income taxes. \nTheir argument is, if you are a working couple in America and you make \na total of $54,000 year, then you are rich and, therefore, you ought \nnot to get a tax cut. Our colleagues on the left believe that we ought \nto take away your tax cut and give it to people who pay no income \ntaxes.\n  I reject that. I reject it because it is not fair. It is not fair \nbecause a tax cut is for taxpayers. If you do not pay income taxes, \nthen when we are cutting income taxes you should not expect to get a \ntax cut. Let me make it clear that I have voted for a lot of programs \nthat provide benefits to people--over the past 15 years, we have \nsubstantially increased benefits to the very group that our Democratic \ncolleagues have argued on behalf of here today. Let me just give you \nsome figures. In 1981, the average payment that we were making to low-\nincome workers--we actually give them money to work--was $285. Today, \nthat figure has risen to $1,395. This is relevant because the last time \nwe cut taxes on working families was in 1981. So our Democratic \ncolleagues who have been out this morning talking about redistributing \nwealth say, look, we ought to take the tax cut away from families \nmaking $54,000 a year as a joint income, and we ought to raise this so \ncalled earned income tax credit.\n  My point is that the last time working families who pay taxes got a \ntax cut, the earned income tax credit, on average, was just $285.\n  Today the average beneficiary of this so-called earned income tax \ncredit is getting $1,395. In other words, we have had almost a 500-\npercent increase in subsidies for low-income workers since the last \npenny of tax cuts was provided for people who actually pay income taxes \nin America. The best data we have on the refunded portion of the earned \nincome tax credit and after-tax income of taxpaying families is the \nfollowing: Since 1986, the paid out portion of what we call earned \nincome tax credit, a direct Government subsidy to low-income workers--\nwhich, by the way, I have supported--has risen by 860 percent since \n1986.\n  Do you know what has happened to the after-tax income of working, \ntaxpaying families since 1986? It has fallen .2 percent--from $28,302 \nto $28,249. So, while this subsidy to low-income workers has exploded--\nthe paid-out portion has risen by 860 percent in the last 11 years--we \nhave not had a tax cut in the last 11 years for taxpaying families, and \nduring that time the after-tax income of working families has actually \ngone down.\n  What we have heard all morning is that we should take money away from \ntaxpayers and give more subsidies to people who are not paying income \ntaxes.\n  I believe that it is not unreasonable once every 16 years to have a \nbill that helps people who pay income taxes. What we are trying to do \nis to give a modest tax cut--$85 billion in a $7 trillion economy--and \nwe are trying to give it to people who are actually paying income \ntaxes.\n  I can not think of a more reasonable proposition.\n  Finally, let me say that we have this game going on where the White \nHouse wants to make everybody appear richer than they are so that in \nthe process they can claim that it is only rich people who they would \ndeny the tax cuts. Let me tell you how it works.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation and according to the \nCensus Bureau, the top 20 percent of income earners have a threshold \nincome of about $54,000 per family. But what the administration has \ndone is they have inflated that income by over 70 percent. You think \nyou are making $54,000 a year, but the administration says, ``Now, wait \na minute. Do you not live in your own home? And you know, if you did \nnot live in your own home, you could move out, live in a tent, and rent \nthat house out.'' So they take what you could rent it for, and they add \nthat to your income. They take unrealized gains, the cash buildup of \nyour insurance policy, the value of your retirement program, private \nretirement programs, and they add all of that to your income. So your \npaycheck says, when you add yours and your wife's, that you made \n$54,000. You did not feel too rich, quite frankly, making $54,000. You \nare working hard to make ends meet. But the administration says your \nincome is not $54,000. They say if you moved out of your house and \nrented it out, and if you looked at the buildup of your life insurance \npolicy, if you looked at the internal buildup value of your retirement \nprogram, you would have found that actually your income was over \n$93,000, and that you are actually rich. Then they say, because you are \nrich, you do not deserve a tax cut so we are going to take it away and \ngive it to someone who does not pay taxes.\n  Let me make two more points because I see several of my colleagues \nhere who want to speak.\n  This whole debate pains me. I do not understand why, in America, \nanyone would try to pit people against each other based on their \nincome. There is nothing more un-American, in my opinion, than trying \nto divide people up in classes based on how much money they make. We \nprobably provide more generously than any society in history for people \nwho are incapable of earning a living or people who are having trouble \ndoing it. We are not debating those issues today.\n  What we are debating is when we finally, for the first time in 16 \nyears, can afford to give reductions in income taxes, should those \nreductions go to people who pay income taxes, or do we have to pay \ntribute every time we try to help working families who pay income taxes \nby taking part of their tax cut and giving it to people who are not \npaying income taxes? That is the real debate.\n\n  Final point: If you are making $54,000 a year, husband and wife \nworking, maybe somebody at the White House thinks you are rich. Maybe \nthere are people in Congress who think you are rich. But basically we \nare talking about middle-class, working Americans struggling to make a \nmortgage payment, struggling to pay for food and shelter, struggling to \ntry to lead a quality life. It is just outrageous and\n\n[[Page S7886]]\n\ntotally unacceptable for us to be talking about taking that working \nfamilies' tax cut away to give more subsidies to people who are not \npaying income taxes.\n  To me, that is what this whole issue is about. It never ceases to \namaze me when we look at these polls to see that people believe that \nthe President is right, and that, in fact, we are talking about \nredistributing wealth to the wealthy.\n  The Tax Code in America is more progressive today than it was the day \nRonald Reagan was elected President. Higher income Americans are paying \na larger percentage of the tax--bearing more of the burden of taxes \ntoday than they were the day Ronald Reagan became President. Lower \nincome Americans are bearing a lower share of the tax burden.\n  For those who want to complain about payroll taxes, let us remember \nwho made a proposal 3 years ago to almost double payroll taxes to pay \nfor national health insurance. It sure was not me. I am happy to count \nmyself among the number who killed that proposal. That proposal was \nmade by the same President who today laments the burden of payroll \ntaxes when in fact 3 years ago he wanted to almost double it.\n  I do not like engaging in these kinds of debates, I do not think they \nare very productive. We should be talking about creating wealth rather \nthan redistributing it. But since some of our colleagues spent an hour \nthis morning talking about redistributing wealth, I felt obliged to \ncome out and join others in trying to set the record straight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during the last several weeks, I have \ntaken the floor to discuss my concerns about the approach the \nDepartment of Justice has taken on mergers among and between large \ntelecommunications companies.\n  I was particularly disappointed with the decision of the Department \nof Justice to approve the Bell Atlantic/NYNEX merger without any \nconditions.\n  Today, I take the floor to congratulate the Federal Communications \nCommission for doing what the Department of Justice was unwilling to \ndo. This weekend the FCC announced that it had concluded an 11-page \nletter of agreement with Bell Atlantic and NYNEX on pro-competitive \nconditions for its merger.\n  While I continue to question the underlying competitive merit of the \nBell Atlantic/NYNEX combination, the efforts of the FCC certainly \nmitigate the decision of the Department of Justice to approve the \nmerger. It is only unfortunate that the Department of Justice had not \ndemonstrated the same commitment to competition.\n  The FCC negotiated a 4 year pro-competitive agreement with Bell \nAtlantic and NYNEX which includes the use of forward looking costs for \ncompetitive interconnection agreements, the use of uniform interfaces \nfor interconnection, greater reporting requirements, access for \ncompetitors to efficient operating support systems, and performance \nguarantees. These commitments hold the promise of giving competition a \nchance to take root.\n  The use of forward looking costs within the 13 States which make up \nthe Bell Atlantic/NYNEX region is especially significant in light of \nthe Friday decision of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to bar the \nFCC from setting interconnection prices. A nation grew from 13 \ncolonies, perhaps a telecommunications revolution can grow from 13 \nStates.\n  I applaud the FCC and Chairman Hundt for showing independence and a \ncommitment to competition. The course of action chosen by the \nCommission highlights the importance of the FCC's political \nindependence. As an independent regulatory body, the Commission was \nable to use its authority to protect the public interest to win pro-\ncompetitive concessions from Bell Atlantic and NYNEX, notwithstanding \nthe failure of the Department of Justice to do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to give this case careful study as the Congress \nconsiders telecommunications policy. In the coming weeks and months, \nthe Congress will consider confirming four new members of the Federal \nCommunications Commission. At stake is whether the Congressional vision \nof competition and universal service which brings more choice, more \ninvestment, more jobs, and lower prices to the telecommunications \nmarket is fulfilled or not.\n  The success or failure of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 depends \nalmost entirely on a new team of regulators at the Department of \nJustice and the FCC.\n  To succeed, they must have an unrelenting commitment to competition \nand universal service. Without that commitment, the act is doomed to \nfailure. The result will be higher prices, greater consolidation and \nfewer choices.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the FCC for its action in this case. The \nCongress must assure that the new members of the FCC have the same \ncourage to exercise their independence, as this Commission has done to \nprotect the public interest.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7886-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7886-S7888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning after \nhearing some of my colleagues earlier talking and debating about the \nproposed tax cuts that is now in conference. The question is always: \nWho qualifies for the tax cut? How much is that tax cut going to be? \nWho is going to receive what share of that tax cut?\n  I would like to start out by saying that it is kind of ironic to hear \nsome on the floor arguing about these tax cut packages because these \nare the same individuals who, along with President Clinton, just 4 \nyears ago were on this floor arguing for the largest tax increase on \nAmericans in history.\n  When we look at this major tax increase of just 4 years ago, I would \nlike to relate to the comments made by the minority leader, the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, earlier this week when he argued that the $77 \nbillion tax cut was not fair. That is what we have heard here this \nmorning on the floor--it is not fair. While I don't believe it was fair \nin 1993 to raise the largest tax increase in history on Americans, they \nsay, ``Well, it was only aimed at the rich.'' But let me tell you.\n  Let me remind my colleagues what happened in 1993. After campaigning \non middle-class tax relief in 1993, President Clinton turned around and \nthen raised taxes by $263 billion, again making that the largest tax \nincrease in history. But he said it was only for the rich. But \neverybody paid more, including $114 billion in new income taxes, $24 \nbillion in new gasoline taxes, $35 billion in new business taxes, and \n$30 billion in new payroll taxes. Then you add on top of that nearly \n$25 billion more in Social Security taxes. In other words, if you work, \nif you are retired, if you drove a car, if you owned a business, or if \nyou paid any kind of income tax, you paid for the 1993 income tax \nincrease.\n  I heard also this morning that what we are talking about today in \nthis tax package is that about $77 billion so far of net tax relief is \n``substantial'' tax relief. Well, when you get back only $1 on every $4 \nthat was raised in 1993, I don't call this ``substantial.'' This is a \nmeager tax package that we are talking about. The reason that it is not \nfair, in my opinion, is because there is not enough in this tax package \nto go around.\n  It does not take a mathematician also to calculate that if taxes \nraised were $263 billion 4 years ago and you get $77 billion back now, \nthat is not a good deal. If you look at since the tax reduction that \neverybody blames for the deficits, and that is the Ronald Reagan tax \ncut in 1981, they say since that tax cut it has resulted in all these \ndeficits: We have these deficits today because of the Ronald Reagan tax \ncut. In fact, we have had 10 tax increases since 1981--10, over $850 \nbillion in new tax increases since 1981. And now we are talking about \n$77 billion. This is less than $1 on every $10 of tax increases over \nthe last 10 years.\n  We also hear about, well, who is going to be getting these tax \nbreaks?\n\n[[Page S7887]]\n\n The top 20 percent, they say, are going to get over 60 percent of the \ntax cut. And as we just heard the Senator from Texas say, the top 20 \npercent of wage earners in this country, which is $60,000 and over--and \nmost people do not consider making $60,000 rich, but they pay 80 \npercent of income taxes in this country today.\n  I also heard about a couple of instances--and I did not have time \nthis morning to bring to the floor pictures of families, but let me \nread a couple that were mentioned here today. They showed pictures of a \nyoung family making about $25,000 a year, and they said under the \nRepublican tax plan they were going to get no tax cut this year. But \nfor that family making $25,000 a year, they pay total, with two \nchildren, about $3,000 in income taxes and payroll taxes, but they \nreceive $1,100 in EITC. EITC, that is earned income tax credit, an \nearned income tax credit that was passed in 1986, increased in 1993. So \nthis family making $25,000 a year does receive a tax refund, a tax \nrefund of $1,100, not zero but $1,100.\n  What they want to do is to add to that. Now, I will talk about that \nlater. They also spoke about and had the pictures of a young family \nmaking $20,000 a year, and they said, under the Republican plan, they \nwould get no tax refunds this year. But in fact that family making \n$20,000 a year will pay this year about $1,800 in payroll and income \ntaxes, but they will receive a refund under EITC of over $2,150. So \nthat family, granted, a hard-working middle-class family, but they are \nreceiving some tax relief under the current system.\n  Let us go to the family making $31,000 a year. Say the husband is \nmaking $9 an hour, the wife $6, or vice versa, they are working 40 \nhours a week trying to raise a family of two children, have to pay \nchild care, et cetera. And what does this family get? They are going to \npay this year about $4,300 in payroll and income taxes and they receive \nzero under EITC. Now, those two children will not get, under this plan, \nany tax relief if they are 13 or 14 years old. So who is not getting \nthe relief here?\n  And when they talk about making it fair, we do want to make this \nfair, but we want to make sure that those families making $31,000 to \n$60,000 a year are also going to join and also receive some kind of tax \nrelief today.\n  Now, I would like to see every family get a $500 per child tax credit \nrefund. That would be great. But if we are going to talk about fairness \nwhat we are going to have to do is make this pie larger. The $77 \nbillion is not enough to make sure that all families will enjoy some \nkind of tax relief. Now, if we want to start talking about class \nwarfare, and that is what we hear in the Chamber all the time, that is, \nwe are going to give it to the rich but not the poor, that is not true. \nWe want to make sure that all families are going to get some kind of \ntax relief.\n  So along with the tax relief already in the system under the earned \nincome credit, we also need to expand that so other working families \nalso are going to receive some kind of tax relief this year. Everybody \nneeds to share, not only the low income but also middle-income working \nfamilies. If my colleagues are serious, let us enlarge the tax cut.\n  When we talk about the $77 billion that is in this package, if you \nwant to spread that over what this economy is going to generate over \nthe next 5 years, a $7 or $8 trillion a year economy and we are saying, \nwell, we are going to have this substantial tax package, it would be \ncomparable to looking for a new car and the car dealer said, well, this \nis the sticker price, but I am going to take a penny off from that and \nI am going to make you a real deal on this car.\n  That is exactly about what the $77 billion is equal to when you put \nit into context of what this economy is going to do over the next 5 \nyears. You are going to get a penny back on the purchase of a new car. \nSo what makes the entire debate over what is fair and equitable in this \ntax relief package so ridiculous is that Washington is not willing to \ngive up more of the money.\n  So I just wanted to come to the floor and talk a little bit about how \nwe do not want to make this a class warfare issue, that we want to make \nsure all Americans receive some kind of tax relief. And again, as I \nsaid, since 1981, American families have seen their taxes go up 10 \ntimes--$850 billion in new tax increases in the last 16 years. Now we \nare talking about tax relief, and we want to make sure that tax relief \nis fair and it is broad based, and that those families making between \n$30,000 and $60,000 a year will also have an opportunity to share in \nsome reduction in their tax burden.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in part to join my colleagues' \nreflections on what we heard this morning from the other side of the \naisle and what we have been hearing basically as a definitional \nexercise from the White House in their attempts to define the \ncongressional tax relief proposal and the congressional balanced budget \nact proposal.\n  I am encouraged in that it does appear we are making very rapid \nprogress with regard to these two historic bills--a balanced budget \nact, which if signed by the President will be the first time in about \n30 years, and the tax relief act, which if signed by the President \nwould be the first in over a decade and a half. And, as has been noted \nhere this morning, that following massive tax increases over the last \n10 years.\n  To put this in some sort of historical perspective, I have only been \nhere a short period of time, as has the Presiding Officer, and it has \nbeen a rather dramatic 4 years. Half the time was under the \ncongressional leadership of the other side and half the time has been \nunder our side, 2 years each, and they make an interesting comparison.\n  In the first 2 years under their side, we fought and lost the largest \ntax increase in American history. I remember the night very vividly. \nThe Chair of the evening was Vice President Gore, who cast the vote to \nsecure the victory for this huge tax increase, which was characterized \nby the Senator from Minnesota. The following year was spent, Mr. \nPresident, defending the Nation from Government-run health care which \nwould have been the single largest expansion of Government in the \nhistory of the world. It would have surpassed the size of Social \nSecurity in 24 months, become the largest entitlement in the history of \nthe world.\n  Well, the American people prevailed and by the narrowest of margins \nthat was defeated.\n  So those 2 years were filled with large tax increases, large \nexpansion of Government, and the view that Government was the ultimate \nsolution and resolution to all America's needs and woes.\n  Now we come to the last 2 years. The leadership changed, and the \ndiscussion has been about balancing our budget, lowering the economic \nburden on American workers and families and restraining the size and \ngrowth of the Federal Government. And we are making progress, because \nwe now have a President who has said the era of big Government is over \nand he has said he wants to support a balanced budget act and a tax \nrelief act. And we have agreed on the general premises. We are getting \nvery close now to crossing the ``t'' and dotting the ``i.''\n\n  I hope the President will come forward in a spirit of cooperation \nthat was exemplified by what happened on these measures in the U.S. \nSenate. To watch the leadership of both parties vote for a balanced \nbudget act and a tax relief act, to watch the leadership of the \ncommittees of jurisdiction on both sides, the Finance Committee and the \nBudget Committee, all vote for the balanced budget act and the tax \nrelief act, and then, in almost unprecedented behavior, to have 73 of \nour 100 colleagues vote for the Balanced Budget Act and 80 join hands \nand vote for the Tax Relief Act--in all this debate about whether or \nnot it is a fair form of tax relief, I would suggest the empirical \nevidence that it is is the fact that the leadership of both parties in \nthe Senate and that 80 Members of the Senate could vote for this \nsubstantive piece of policy. It is just inconceivable, given that \nbipartisan, broad, huge majority, that the legislation could be \nanything less than fair. It almost demonstrates its broad nature and \nevenhandedness, to secure that kind of support. The President should \ntake note of this.\n  The country needs to balance its budgets and American workers need \nrelief. An average family in my State,\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\nand I would say across the country, makes in the range of $40,000, \noften with both parents working, and after they pay their direct taxes \nand their cost of Government and their share of higher interest rates \nbecause of the huge national debt, because we have not had balanced \nbudgets, they have barely half of their paychecks left to provide for \ntheir families. If the Founding Fathers were here today and discovered \nthat Government in America had come to the point that it was taking \nover half the wealth of our workers away from them, they would be \nstunned. And I think they would be angered.\n  What this boils down to is that we are taking about $8,000 a year out \nof every average family's checking account, and we are making it very \ndifficult for them to provide their fundamental responsibilities, which \nare getting the country up in the morning and raising it and getting it \nready for stewardship. They can barely get that done because of \nGovernment policy removing those resources. This legislation goes in \nthe right direction. It does not go as far as it should, I agree with \nthe Senator from Minnesota, but it goes in the right direction. It \nequates to a refund of that last tax increase of about a third of it. \nWe tried to refund all of it last year, but the President vetoed that. \nSo he has now agreed to refunding about a third of it, and that is good \npolicy. I am very hopeful that the White House will not politicize, \n``partisanize,'' seek political gain and advantage over this policy for \nwhich so many on both sides of the aisle have come to agree in the \nCongress.\n  This is the right thing to do for America, and this is the time to do \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nKentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7886-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have never professed to be \nclairvoyant, but I was able to predict 8 months ago and subsequently \nauthored an op-ed piece to this effect: that obfuscation and diversion \nwould be the damage control strategy of the Clinton White House and its \nallies in Congress. They would be engaged in that kind of activity, Mr. \nPresident, in seeking to avoid the fallout from the Clinton campaign-\nDNC fundraising malfeasance in the last election.\n  This damage control strategy was to be expected from this White \nHouse, as wave upon wave of scandal has lapped up on the White House \nlawn these past 4 years. President Clinton's aides have become highly \nskilled at putting out press fires, lest, of course, the President be \nsinged. I had hoped for better from Democrats here in the Congress \nembarrassed--I should hope mortified--by the evidence and admission of \nillegal conduct by the Clinton campaign-DNC fundraisers.\n  I thought my Democratic colleagues would step up to the plate, seek \nthe truth and let the chips fall where they may.\n  A disappointing spectacle it has been to witness this collusion in a \ndisingenuous effort to blur the truth, smear the innocent and protect \nthe guilty, by saying everyone does it, and even trying to drag \ninnocent private citizens before the committee.\n  We are all victims of the system, they say. What we need, they say, \nis campaign finance reform. Well, in fact, Mr. President, what we need \nis an independent counsel. That has been clear for a number of months--\nan independent counsel to remove the investigation from an obviously \npoliticized Justice Department.\n  Bearing in mind the Attorney General's indefensible refusal to \nappoint an independent counsel, and the Justice Department's outrageous \nconduct in the past few weeks in which it has injected itself into \npartisan maneuvering regarding the granting of immunity for low-level \nbut key witnesses, the inexplicable and entirely inappropriate action \nby a Justice Department political appointee to distance the \nadministration from United States intelligence agency findings that the \nChinese Government plotted to influence United States elections, Mr. \nPresident, there is simply no other recourse to ascertain the truth in \na nonpartisan manner but to appoint an independent counsel.\n  That is why this law was passed some 25 years ago, for precisely \nthese kinds of situations, in which you had a highly political \ninvestigation affecting covered employees--for example, the President \nor the Vice President--where it could be suspected that the Attorney \nGeneral would be reluctant to pursue alleged claims of wrongdoing.\n  This episode over the last few months is precisely the fact situation \nwhich brought about and argued for the passage of the independent \ncounsel statute.\n  Now, Mr. President, the truth is going to come out sooner or later. \nNo one here should want to be seen in a position of trying to keep the \ntruth from coming to the public. So the point I would like to make this \nmorning very briefly once again, the Attorney General would appoint an \nindependent counsel to investigate the fundraising abuses of the 1996 \nelection, the violations of existing law that may have occurred--\ncontributions from foreigners, money laundering, raising money on \nFederal property, all violations of existing law. The Attorney General \nof the United States is responsible for enforcing existing law, and in \nsituations such as this when a clear conflict of interest is apparent, \nthere is no other logical recourse other than the appointment of an \nindependent counsel.\n  I call upon the Attorney General one more time, Mr. President, to \nappoint an independent counsel to complete this investigation.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming, Senator Thomas, has \nthe time until 11 o'clock.\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, I intend between now and 11 to be joined \nby several of my colleagues to talk about, I think, two of the issues \nthe Senator from Georgia has talked about. One of them that is most \nimportant for us, tax relief--I appreciate his comments. The other \ncurrently is the hearings that are being held with respect to the \nillegal contributions for campaigns. These, I think, at least at the \nmoment, are two of the most important issues that face the Congress, \ntwo of the most important issues, obviously, that face the American \npeople.\n\n\n                               Tax Relief\n\n  First, in terms of tax relief, which has been talked about, it just \nseems to me that we have the opportunity for the first time in 16 years \nto have meaningful tax relief for Americans who are the ones who pay \nthe taxes that support the Government. That is fairly simple. That is a \nfairly simple concept. And I wish, frankly, we could make it a little \nmore simple. Obviously, in this place whenever there are issues, the \ntechnique is to make them as difficult as possible, to make them as \ndetailed as possible, to make them kind of hard to identify. This one \nreally isn't very hard to identify. The issue here is between having \nmore Government and more revenue and more spending as opposed to the \nidea of seeking to reduce the size of Government, to reduce the \nspending, to reduce the burden on the taxpayers. And those things do go \ntogether.\n  We talk a lot, importantly, about the idea of balancing the budget. \nBut I think we have to keep in mind you can balance the budget in a \ncouple of ways. One of them is to have the highest tax increase in the \nhistory of the world and continue to grow in spending. The other is to \nseek to reduce spending, to seek to involve the States, to seek to \nreturn more government to local government and, therefore, reduce the \nsize of government and the demands on taxpayers. Frankly, I think that \nis what we have tried to do in the last couple of years. I am very \nproud of the record of the Congress in the last 2 or 3 years, simply \nbecause we have changed the debate 180 degrees.\n  Three years ago we were talking about not how to reduce spending, not \nhow to balance the budget, but simply, what new programs do we need? \nWhat do we need to do to continue spending? We were talking, then, \nabout increasing taxes and did, in fact, increase\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\ntaxes--the largest that has ever been done. Now we are talking about \nhow do you reduce the size of Government. There is no debate about \nbalancing the budget. It is just, how do you do it? When do you do it? \nThat is a complete turnaround. That is a complete change. We are \ntalking, now, more about how do you block-grant to the States so they \ncan make the decisions as to how best spend the money that goes there. \nSurely, the concept of the closer to the people served that government \nis, the more effective it will be, is correct--is correct.\n  So I am very delighted that we have turned that thing around. Even \nthough we continue to hassle, even though there will continue, always, \nto be debate about it, because, frankly, there is a legitimate \ndifference of point of view. There are those who believe more \nGovernment is better. That is a legitimate point of view. It is not one \nthat I subscribe to and I think, fortunately, not one that is \nsubscribed to by the majority of the Members of Congress, but it is a \nlegitimate viewpoint and it will continue to be argued--and it should \nbe.\n\n\n                     Illegal Campaign Contributions\n\n  The other thing, it seems to me, that is very important currently is \nthe debate that goes on about illegal campaign contributions. Here \nagain, it seems to me when you are out in Wyoming and you are listening \nto the TV or you listen to radio, you kind of get the notion that the \nwhole thing is about campaign finance reform. In the broad sense, it \nis. But the fact is, there is a difference between reforming campaign \nfinances on the one hand and talking about illegal contributions on the \nother. Those are two different things.\n  I think the Congress has a responsibility to have oversight hearings. \nThe Congress has a responsibility to look into allegations of illegal \ncontributions, and that is what the Thompson committee is primarily \nassigned to do. There is a difficulty in doing it, as we have seen take \nplace here.\n  The idea of having the Justice Department involved makes it more \ndifficult. Their unwillingness to give immunity to witnesses to testify \nso you can arrive at the facts has been a completely difficult issue. \nAnd I understand. One reason for the idea of the Congress doing this \noversight is that, obviously, agencies have allegiance to the people \nwho have appointed them and they become very edgy when you get into \nthis whole wilderness of allegations of wrongdoing on the part \nof people who are affiliated to the people you work for. I understand \nthat. That is the reason for having Congress do it. That is the reason \nfor having independent counsels do it. As the Senator from Kentucky a \nfew moments ago mentioned, it is clear there is a reluctance on the \npart of Justice to get into what they perceive to be a political kind \nof activity.\n\n  That is their task. The way they do it is to appoint an independent \ncounsel. For some reason, the Attorney General has refused to do that. \nSo what we are talking about, then, is having a hearing in which the \ntruth about those allegations can be determined. I think that is, \nindeed, a responsibility of the Congress. It is something that we ought \nto be responsible to the American people to do, and I am delighted that \nit is happening. I only wish that it were less inhibited. I wish there \nwere less constraints being imposed by the minority in this particular \ncommittee, less constraints being imposed by the Justice Department. We \nought to know what the truth is, in these instances.\n  I happen to be chairman of the subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific \nrim. Yesterday, we had a hearing for the nomination of the Assistant \nSecretary for the Asia-Pacific area, which we need very much, and a \nvery learned person has been nominated whom I am sure we will support. \nBut just to give you some idea of the involvement there, with regard to \nthis investigation, of course the activities with respect to China \ninfluencing elections, foreign policy, has been talked about. President \nClinton has said:\n\n       [I]t would be a very serious matter for the United States \n     if any country were to attempt to funnel funds into one of \n     our political parties for any reason whatsoever.\n\n  Likewise, the Secretary of State said that, if true, the allegations \nthat China had launched a major effort to illegally influence United \nStates elections ``would be quite serious.''\n  I asked that question yesterday of the Secretary: Do you agree? And, \nof course, he said yes. The follow-up question, then, was both \nRepublican and Democrat members of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nagree that there was Chinese involvement and a plan to move money into \ncongressional elections.\n  So I asked, I think quite legitimately, what is the plan, then? How \ndoes this affect our foreign policy with respect to China? And the \nanswer was, well, we just don't know whether these are true. We don't \nknow whether that's there. We haven't made any accommodation, which \nonly leads me to believe that it is even more important for this \ncommittee to arrive at what the facts really are. If these allegations \nare true, what will it do to our policy? It ought to have some impact \non policy, certainly. But, yet, the response from the administration \nis, well, we just don't know.\n  We don't know either, but we ought to find out. And that is what the \nsystem is about. That is what the hearings are about. That is why there \nis such concern about the obstacles placed in the way of the committee \nby the Justice Department, by the Attorney General, by the \nadministration--frankly, by our friends on the other side of the aisle, \nas to how we come to those decisions.\n  So, I think we are involved in a very serious issue here. It is \nserious because it has to do with process. It has to do with the \nobligations of the Congress to determine if, in fact, in this case, \nthere were illegal activities carried on. That's our job.\n  Mr. President, I now am joined on the floor by the Senator from \nArizona. I am very pleased to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \nobtaining time this morning to speak on this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7888-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, the confidence of the American people in the \nAmerican political system, in our Government here in Washington has \nbeen eroding in recent months, a subject that numerous pollsters and \npundits have been writing about. One of the reasons that I believe this \nexists is that they believe people in high places can get away with \nthings and they are, in effect, above the law, unlike the average \nAmerican citizen, and that neither the Congress nor the administration \nhas the ability, under that circumstance, to adequately track down \nperpetrators of crimes and pursue them to appropriate conclusion.\n  One of the aspects of this that is most troubling to me right now has \nto do with the Justice Department's purported investigation of people \nand events surrounding various contributions, allegedly illegal \ncontributions, to the Democratic National Committee, to the \nPresidential and Vice Presidential campaigns. Attorney General Reno \nhas, after numerous requests, steadfastly refused to appoint an \nindependent counsel to look into these matters, and I had literally \nhundreds of requests from constituents to make the point to Attorney \nGeneral Reno that they think this is wrong, or questions asked by \nconstituents as to how this could be when there is such an obvious \nconflict of interest, at least to the average American citizen.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I joined in an effort with \nother members of the committee to follow a statutory procedure of \nwriting to the Attorney General, asking her to either appoint an \nindependent counsel or explain to us the reasons why she could not do \nso. She refused to make the appointment and gave her reasons. At the \ntime, I thought they were relatively unconvincing. But since that time, \nirrespective of whether it has been appropriate up to now, Mr. \nPresident, a\n\n[[Page S7890]]\n\ncouple of events have occurred that I think has made it crystal clear \nthat the time has come for the Attorney General to appoint an \nindependent counsel, because the integrity of her office is literally \nin question as a result of actions taken in connection with the \nCongress' investigation of these same matters.\n  In June, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee announced its \nintention to grant immunity to 18 witnesses. They are very low-level \nwitnesses against whom no prosecution is believed ever to be pursued or \nwill be pursued. They were the straw donors who contributed money to \nthe Democratic National Committee and were reimbursed by others, \nincluding one Charlie Trie, who apparently has fled the country and is \ncurrently hiding in China. Charlie Trie is a very close friend and \nfundraiser for President Clinton, who appointed Trie to membership on a \ngovernmental commission on U.S. Pacific trade and investment policy.\n  Fifteen of these eighteen witnesses that the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee wanted to grant immunity to were Buddhist clerics who have \ntaken vows of poverty and yet contributed funds to the Democratic \nNational Committee at fundraisers in substantial amounts.\n  One was a Buddhist fundraiser in Los Angeles attended by Vice \nPresident Gore, who, of course, is a covered person under the \nindependent counsel law; in other words, one of the people with whom \nthere may be a conflict of interest as a result of which the Attorney \nGeneral is supposed to appoint an independent counsel.\n  Since June, the committee has announced its intention to immunize two \nadditional witnesses in connection with these Buddhist fundraisers. \nMost of the 17 Buddhist witnesses have had immunity requests pending \nwith the Justice Department since March of this year, and yet the \nJustice Department has not been able to visit with these people--most \nof them--or to take proffers of evidence from them or declare them for \nimmunity for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  The Justice Department's policy on this is clear. Their policy is not \nto prosecute low-level people such as this, low-level straw donors or \nconduits who merely launder campaign contributions at the requests of \nothers. So the Justice Department should have had no problem in quickly \nclearing immunity for these witnesses, the 18 original witnesses and \nthe 2 additional ones.\n  On Wednesday, June 11, the day before the markup at which the \ncommittee was to vote on this immunity request, both the minority and \nthe majority counsel on the committee spoke with Justice Department \nofficials who were conducting this probe, and these officials expressed \nno objection to granting immunity for 17 of the 18 witnesses. But the \nnext morning, June 12, the New York Times had a front-page story \ndeclaring that Vice President Gore had knowledge about this temple \nfundraiser.\n\n  Just a little bit later that morning, at about 10:30, the Senate \nminority leader held a press briefing in which he said all of the \nminority members on the committee would oppose the granting of immunity \nduring the markup later in the day. Of course, since it takes two-\nthirds of the committee to grant immunity, without some Democratic \nsupport, at least two Democrats on the committee, the Republican \nmajority would never be able to get immunity for a witness.\n  Shortly after the minority leader made his statement, the committee \nminority counsel informed the majority counsel that he, the minority \ncounsel, had spoken with the Justice Department and it now objected to \nimmunizing 15 Buddhist clerics. You had a direct connection here \nbetween the minority counsel on the committee and the Justice \nDepartment as a result of which the Justice Department flip-flopped.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Arizona yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to make sure I understand this. What you are \nsuggesting is, prior to this story in the New York Times that Vice \nPresident Gore knew, was involved and had knowledge, of this \nfundraising activity, that the Justice Department was not objecting to \nallowing witnesses to come and be granted immunity before the \ncommittee, and there seemed to be a recognition that these people were \nnot the target of the investigation--they were called conduits--and, as \na result, should be able to come to the committee and testify under \nimmunity; that was the state of play before this article.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Pennsylvania is entirely correct, Mr. \nPresident. That is the exact chain of events, according to the \ncommittee's majority counsel, whose word has never been questioned on \nthis. It was only after the front-page story.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. After the front-page story that morning, the story that \nimplicated the Vice President with respect to knowledge of the \nfundraising scheme, Senator Daschle came forward and said, ``You're not \ngoing to get any support for allowing these people to testify under a \ngrant of immunity,'' and then what? The Justice Department changed its \nmind overnight.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct. And there is an \nadditional factor that makes this even more troublesome, and that is \nthat it was the committee's minority counsel, not in conjunction with \nmajority counsel, which is the normal way----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Democratic counsel; minority counsel is the Democrats' \ncounsel.\n  Mr. KYL. That is right, minority counsel represents the Democratic \nmembers of the committee; majority counsel represents Republican \nmembers of the committee. In the past, they had dealt with the Justice \nDepartment together as counsel for the committee. On this occasion, the \nminority counsel, the Democratic counsel, made contact with the Justice \nDepartment, immediately after which the Justice Department position was \nannounced as having been changed----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Your sense of the timing of the Democratic counsel's \ncontact with the Justice Department was after the New York Times \narticle----\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Once they understood that the Vice President could be \nimplicated in this testimony, he called the Justice Department, not the \nJustice Department called him; is that your understanding?\n  Mr. KYL. The minority counsel apparently made contact with the \nJustice Department.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And the Justice Department, as a result, I assume, of \nthis conversation changed its mind as far as allowing these witnesses \nto testify under a grant of immunity.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct, and as a direct \nresult of that, the Democratic members of the committee denied immunity \nto the witnesses. Only one of the Democrats on the committee supported \nimmunity for two of the witnesses, but none of the witnesses, the \nremaining witnesses, was granted immunity because of the solid vote of \nthe Democratic members of the committee.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Did the Justice Department give any other rationale for \nchanging its mind, other than the fact that what we know is the Vice \nPresident was implicated in this, directly now implicated, with \nknowledge of this fundraising scheme at this Buddhist temple?\n  Mr. KYL. I have to say to the Senator from Pennsylvania that I am not \naware of all of the conversations that members of the Justice \nDepartment may have had with people regarding the position that they \nhave taken. Publicly, there have been a couple of different points \nmade: One, that it takes a long time to visit with all of these people. \nWell----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Wait a minute. The Justice Department said it was OK to \ngive immunity. The only thing we are aware of, that has been talked \nabout, intervening between the Justice Department saying yes to 17 of \nthe 18 monks to be able to come up here and testify and then \ncountermanding that was information then presented to the public that \nthe Vice President had knowledge of what was going on at that event?\n\n  Mr. KYL. Well, Mr. President, if I can say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, there is an old Latin phrase that is used in law, ``post \nhoc, ergo propter hoc,'' meaning ``after this, therefore because of \nthis.''\n\n[[Page S7891]]\n\n  It seems fairly obvious that if, on June 11, the Justice Department \nhas no objection to granting of immunity, and then there is a big \nheadline in the newspaper on the following morning, and immediately \nafter that the minority leader announces that all of the Democrats will \noppose immunity--now, there obviously had to be some kind of a meeting \nat which this was discussed or he could not have confidently spoken of \nhow the minority members would react--and then a minority counsel talks \nto the Justice Department and announces that their position has been \nchanged, the only conclusion that one, I think, can legitimately draw \nfrom this is that the intervening events caused the change of policy at \nthe Justice Department. If that is true--and, of course, none of us \nknow whether it is true--but if that is true, that clearly injects \npolitics into this investigation in a way which makes it crystal clear \nthat the Attorney General does not have the credibility to continue the \ninvestigation of this matter and must appoint an independent counsel. \nThe law requires in a conflict of interest that that be done.\n  What I am saying here this morning is that this chain of events \nclearly suggests that result. There is no other explanation that has \nbeen proffered. To the Senator from Pennsylvania, I say your questions \nare right on the mark in trying to get to the bottom of this entire \nmatter.\n  Mr. President, I know time is short. Might I ask how much of the \nremaining time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Fine. Let me then continue with another aspect of this that \nis important. Again, just to summarize this, it is not at all uncommon \nin law enforcement in order to be able to make the case against the \npeople who are masterminding a crime, for example, to get the little \nfish to talk. And the way you do that is to say, ``We will not \nprosecute you if you will tell us under oath everything you know and \nthat information is useful in our ability to make a case against the \nbigger fish.'' That is the way it works in law enforcement.\n  With respect to these Buddhist nuns and monks who have taken vows of \npoverty, it is clear that nobody wants to prosecute them. They were \nused. They were abused in this process. I don't think anybody thinks \nthey were criminals or that they had criminal intent. But what is \nalleged to have occurred is that somebody brought a lot of money in and \ngave it to them and said, ``Now, tomorrow, when the Vice President is \nhere, we want you to write a check in this same amount to the Vice \nPresident or to his campaign.'' That is called laundering money.\n  The way you make the case against the people who were behind that is \nto get the people who were the conduits to talk. That is why the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee wants to grant immunity to these people, \nto bring them forward so that the American people can see what has \nhappened here, and the law enforcement people can get on with their job \nabout getting these prosecutions completed.\n  So far we hear nothing from the Justice Department. Mr. President, \nnone of us want to jeopardize prosecutions, and when the Attorney \nGeneral came before the Judiciary Committee, I accepted her explanation \nthat, in effect, she was saying, ``Trust me, we have professional \ninvestigators pursuing criminal prosecutions and we will do that to the \nappropriate end.''\n  I can do nothing but trust the Attorney General when she makes that \nkind of statement, and none of us want to jeopardize prosecutions. But \nwhat I am saying this morning is that the chain of events now appears \nto be raising questions that are so serious that unless they are \nadequately publicly answered by the Attorney General, her credibility \nto continue this investigation on her own without the appointment of a \nspecial counsel is called into such serious question that I believe \nthat the Senate of the United States could not adequately continue its \npublic investigation and the American people would rightly question \nwhether or not the administrative branch of Government, the embodiment \nof the Attorney General and the Justice Department, is not improperly \ninvolved in the investigation and hearings of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee of the U.S. Senate. I think that conclusion is inevitable.\n  It would be a shame for that conclusion to be reached, and, as a \nresult, Mr. President, to clear it all up, to get to the bottom of \neverything and to avoid the conclusion that the Justice Department is \nimproperly involving politics in this matter, once again, we call upon \nthe Attorney General of the United States to call for the appointment \nof an independent counsel in these fundraising matters.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Arizona yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is my understanding that in addition to this \napparent flip-flop on granting immunity to witnesses to testify before \nthe committee, there was another instance where the Justice Department \ninjected itself into the investigation in an apparent partisan move \nthat showed very clear favoritism.\n  Can you explain how that occurred?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I know time has expired.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Pennsylvania be given 5 \nminutes to continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could respond then to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, he is absolutely correct. There is a second event which \nagain calls into question the objectivity of the Justice Department and \nI think requires us to add a second element to this request for the \nappointment of a special counsel.\n  On July 11, Assistant Attorney General Andrew Fois, who is a \npolitical appointee running the Office of Legislative Affairs, and who \nfrankly is very unlikely to have access to the classified information, \nthe sensitive information on which Chairman Thompson based his opening \nstatement about the influence of Chinese money in American Government \non, this individual, this Assistant Attorney General, sent a letter \nasserting that the chairman's statement did not represent the views of \nthe executive branch.\n  Now, this is important for the following reason. Recall that when \nChairman Thompson began the Governmental Affairs hearings, he announced \nthat the committee had sensitive information implicating the Chinese \nGovernment for its efforts to involve itself illegally and improperly \nin American political campaigns.\n  Some people in the media and in the minority questioned whether \nChairman Thompson could legitimately make that claim. His response \ncould only be that it had been cleared with the FBI, of the Department \nof Justice, and the CIA. He could not go any further because \ninformation was classified and highly sensitive. So he was in effect \ndefenseless, Mr. President, to further explain his position. But he had \nto rely upon people's reliance upon his statements.\n  Then comes this letter from the Justice Department casting doubt on \nChairman Thompson's assertions saying, no, they had not cleared the \ncontent of his statement. That is the Department of Justice, that is \nsupposed to be engaged in an independent investigation of these \nmatters, clearly undercutting the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. When in fact the chairman has said--and I think it has \ncome out since then, that the FBI and CIA in fact cleared that \nstatement and in fact had made some changes, I think one change in one \nword, is my understanding, one change in one word to the statement that \nthe chairman read, and that they cleared that statement, that this \nletter was in fact erroneous, that this letter was put forward by \nsomeone who I think you suggested probably had no knowledge of what was \nright or wrong.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could respond to that direct point by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. You and I know, all our colleagues know, how long it \ntakes to get a letter cleared downtown. It takes a long time. A \nlegislative liaison cannot quickly get a letter out without a lot of \nhigher-ups signing off on it. So I have no doubt in my mind that this \nwas not a rogue act of an Assistant Secretary, but it had to have been \napproved at high levels of the Justice Department.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Who knew otherwise, knew that the FBI--part of the\n\n[[Page S7892]]\n\nJustice Department--had cleared this statement, had signed off on that \nstatement.\n  Mr. KYL. Precisely. And that is confirmed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What would be the possible reason why someone at a high \nlevel of the Justice Department would sign off on a letter which they \nknow would be untrue to basically call into question Chairman \nThompson's assertion that the Chinese had some plot to influence \nAmerican elections?\n  Mr. KYL. To respond to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I am not going \nto attribute motives to anyone, but it did cast doubt on the claims of \nthe chairman of the committee. Yet a couple of days later, both the \nranking minority leader and Senator Lieberman made the point they \nreviewed the FBI information and they agreed that Chairman Thompson's \nallegations were entirely supported.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So in the end everyone agreed that the chairman's \noriginal statement was correct, and that really the sole voice of \ndissent was a Justice Department letter which was intended really just \nto muddy the waters and cast doubt.\n  Mr. KYL. Again, to conclude then, and to answer the Senator from \nPennsylvania, I cannot ascribe a motive to anyone, but it seems mighty \ncoincidental that at a very critical moment in the committee's \ndeliberations and public hearings great doubt would be cast upon the \nchairman by the Justice Department of the United States, which is \nsupposed to be conducting an independent, objective----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And apolitical investigation.\n  Mr. KYL. And apolitical investigation. And that I say is the second \nreason why we believe at this time events warrant the Attorney General \nto request the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \nthese matters.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7889-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the great success of our Nation is rooted \nin the labors of millions of Americans who work every day to make \nAmerica a better place. I'd like to take a moment to recognize one such \nAmerican--a fellow Oklahoman, Denise Bode, who has dedicated most of \nher adult life to making our Nation a better place through her work in \nthe public and private sector. Soon she will begin a new chapter of \nservice to the people of Oklahoma. For this reason, I am very proud to \ntake this opportunity to recognize her contributions over the past \nseveral years.\n  Denise Bode became involved in Government right after she graduated \nfrom the University of Oklahoma, serving as an adviser to my former \nSenate colleague David Boren who was the Governor of Oklahoma. When \nDavid Boren was elected to the Senate, Denise became a member of his \nU.S. Senate staff and developed an expertise in energy and tax \npolicies. Even though she was working full time, she somehow found time \nto take courses at night and earn both a law degree and a masters of \nlaw in taxation, and devote time to her son Sean as well as be a \nhelpmate to her husband John Bode, who was an Assistant Secretary of \nAgriculture in the Reagan Administration.\n  For the past 6 years she has served as president of the Independent \nPetroleum Association of America, an organization founded in 1929 in \nOklahoma and which today is the Nation's largest membership association \nrepresenting America's oil and natural gas producers. She was the first \nand so far the only woman to head a major energy trade association.\n  All of us who have worked with Denise over the years in Washington, \nregardless of party affiliation, whether in the public or private \nsector, know her to be a tireless advocate for Oklahoma and always \nlooking out for the best interest of our Nation. She is the type of \nperson who will fight tirelessly for what she believes in. In the \nprocess, she has made a difference.\n  She returns to Oklahoma next month to serve, at the request of \nGovernor Frank Keating, on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which \noversees both the interest of the consumers in the State and key \nindustries. Ask Denise why she's going back to her native State and \nshe'll say it's because she wants to make a difference; she wants to \nmake Oklahoma an even better place.\n  We in Washington often talk about devolution, giving more power and \nresponsibility to the States. I certainly believe that is the proper \ncourse of action. Knowing that Denise and other extremely capable \npeople are leading the way in the States gives me added confidence in \nthis policy. And once again, Denise is going where her beliefs lead \nher.\n  I wish her well in this endeavor and feel very confident that she \nwill give to this new position the same dedication and commitment she's \ngiven throughout her years of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7892-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7892-S7893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MARY FRANCES BURNS, 1909-1997\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on July 14, 1997 Mary Frances Burns died in \nGallatin, MO. She was born there, a daughter of a farmer and stockman \nand a sister to four brothers and two sisters. She married Russell \nBurns in 1931 and they farmed just northwest of Gallatin all of their \nlives.\n  Mom was so typical of the farm women of the American prairies. She \nwas wife, partner, mother, homemaker, field hand, and gardener. She \ncould coach younger girls in 4H, teach a Sunday School class, attend a \nschool board meeting, cook all three of the daily meals, keep an old \ngas powered Maytag wash machine going, and still have time to play an \nactive role in Democratic Party politics.\n  She and her husband were married 61 years until dad died in 1992. \nThey navigated this family through the droughts of the 1930's and the \nGreat Depression. Yet through it all, she maintained a great sense of \nfaith and humor. The times were hard in the Depression as anybody who \nlived in that era could attest. The actions and conversations of mom \nand dad were always of hope and optimism in the American dream, of the \nAmerican system, and their dream of a better life.\n\n[[Page S7893]]\n\n  It was the time when America was being tested again and again was \nabout to cast into a great world war. They witnessed husbands, sons, \nbrothers, and a few daughters leave for war and they were there to \nwelcome them home. As a family, we cried and prayed with the families \nwho lost loved ones to that terrible war and we celebrated with the \nones who came home heroes. We helped them to put their lives back \ntogether again and America was whole again.\n  They skimped and saved and worked. Mom never had much but was never \ndenied. She made a very happy home. Christmas was an orange, home made \ntoy, and home made clothes. All holidays meant good cooking with a \nspecial little twist for her family and relation in times of \nunbelievable stress and uncertainty.\n  Memories will always remain of the wonderful smells and aromas \nemanating from mother's kitchen. It was there she cooked for harvest \nand hay hands over an old wood range during the hot humid days of \nsummer. Those same smells were even better after chores on a cold \nwinter day.\n  The badge of authority to the woman of the prairies and a true symbol \nof womanhood was the apron. It was worn everyday. It was made of \nanything from feed sacks to the finest cotton. There were those for \neveryday and those for Sunday or welcoming unexpected callers. Company \nwas always welcome if at meal time, never left unfed.\n  Mom could gather the eggs, pick the garden, move baby chicks and \nkittens. The apron was used to haze milk cows to the barn, run \nwandering livestock out of her garden--along with some colorful \nlanguage--wipe the tears from a crying child, dust from a husband's \neye, and sweat from a working brow.\n  It was spotted and stained from ripe strawberries, black berries, an \noverly excited pup, and grease from a spark plug out of the old wash \nmachine. It had the smells of newly picked sweet corn, fresh baked \nbread, lye soap, and once in a while, the light scent of perfume.\n  She was the center of our home and was a part of a generation that \nunderstood love, life, and death. She understood the value of honesty \nand openness, a healthy fear and love of God, and the core values of \nthe American Midwest.\n  She was the daughter of this land. The soil that she loved and \nsustained her has now received her back. We are the benefactors of her \nqualities and teachings. We, as a nation, are what we are because of \nher and the millions of women like her of the American prairies. She \nwas one of the silent builders of the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7892-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 748\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration S. 1033, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1033) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1998, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Appropriations Committee staff members and intern be granted \nfloor privileges during the consideration of this bill, S. 1033: \nRebecca Davies, Martha Scott Poindexter, Rachelle Graves-Bell, Galen \nFountain, Carole Geagley, and Justin Brasell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I add to that unanimous consent request, at the \nsuggestion of the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, to ask \nunanimous-consent they be granted floor privileges during the votes, if \nany, that may occur in relation to S. 1033.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present for the Senate's \nconsideration today S. 1033, the fiscal year 1998 Agriculture, rural \ndevelopment, Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies \nappropriations bill. This bill provides fiscal year 1998 funding for \nall programs and activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with \nthe exception of the Forest Service, the Food and Drug Administration, \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and expenses and payments of \nthe farm credit system.\n\n  As reported, the bill recommends total new budget authority for \nfiscal year 1998 of $50.7 billion. This is $3.2 billion less than the \nfiscal year 1997 enacted level, and $1.6 billion less than the \nPresident's fiscal year 1998 budget request.\n  Reductions in mandatory funding requirements account for the overall \ndecrease below the fiscal year 1997 enacted level, principally \nreflecting lower Food Stamp and Child Nutrition Program costs due to \nthe enactment of welfare reform. Even with these reductions, $38 \nbillion, or approximately 75 percent of the total $50.7 billion \nrecommended by this bill, will go to funding the Nation's domestic food \nassistance programs in fiscal year 1998. These include the Food Stamp \nProgram; the national school lunch and elderly feeding programs; and \nthe special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and \nchildren [WIC].\n  Including congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-\nyear spending actions, this bill recommends total discretionary \nspending of $13.791 billion in budget authority and $14.039 billion in \noutlays for fiscal year 1998. These amounts are consistent with the \nsubcommittee's discretionary spending allocations.\n  The committee continues to place priority on increasing food safety \nto ensure that American consumers continue to have the safest food in \nthe world.\n  The bill provides $591 million for the Food Safety and Inspection \nService, $17 million above the fiscal year 1997 level. This will enable \nthe Food Safety and Inspection Service to maintain the current \ninspection system and to provide the needed investments required to \nimplement the new hazard analysis and critical control point [HACCP] \nmeat and poultry inspection system.\n  In addition, the bill provides the increased funds requested as part \nof the President's $43 million governmentwide food safety initiative. \nThis include the full $1.1 million proposed for the Food Safety and \nInspection Service, the $4 million increase proposed for Agricultural \nResearch Service food safety research, and $24 million in addition \nfunds for food safety initiatives of the Food and Drug Administration.\n  For agriculture research, the bill provides total appropriations of \n$1.6 billion, approximately $37 million below the fiscal year 1997 \nlevel. Included in this amount is a reduction of $62 million, \nreflecting termination of funding for buildings and facilities of the \nCorporate State Research, Education, and Extension Service; and a $27 \nmillion total increase for agriculture research and education \nactivities.\n  The total amount provided for the Agricultural Research Service \ncontinues funding for most of the agency's current research activities, \nand approves nearly $24 million of the increased funding requested to \nmeet priority research needs, including research focusing on human \nnutrition, food safety, emerging diseases, and genetics resources. This \nadditional\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\namount includes $5 million for the survey of food intakes by children \nand infants required in response to the Food Quality Protection Act of \n1996.\n  The recommended funding for the Cooperative State Research, \nEducation, and Extension Service includes a $2 million reduction in \nfunding for special research grants, an increase of $1.8 million for \npesticide clearance, and $100 million, a $6 million increase above the \n1997 level, for the National Research Initiative competitive grants \nprograms. Appropriations for formula programs, including the Smith-\nLever and Hatch programs, are maintained at 1997 levels.\n  For farm credit programs, the bill funds an estimated $2.9 billion \ntotal loan program level, including $460 million for farm ownership \nloans and $2.4 million for farm operating loans.\n  Total funding of $912 million is recommended for the Farm Service \nAgency, $44 million less than the 1997 level. The Department has worked \nin 1997 to achieve program efficiencies. As a result, we are assured \nthat the funding recommended in this bill will prevent further \npersonnel reductions during fiscal year 1998.\n  The committee also has given increased attention to the need to \nprovide affordable, safe, and decent housing for low-income individuals \nand families living in rural America.\n  Estimated rural housing loan authorizations funded by this bill total \n$3.5 billion, a $60 million net increase above the fiscal year 1997 \nappropriations level. This includes funding to support $1.0 billion in \nsection 502 low-income housing direct loans and $129 million in \nsection 515 rental housing loans. In addition, a total appropriations \nlevel of $541 million is recommended for the rental assistance program. \nThis is the same as the requested level and $48 million more than the \n1997 appropriation.\n\n  The budget also proposed that an additional $52 million be provided \nto convert Housing and Urban Development Agency [HUD] section 8 rental \nassistance to USDA-financed rental assistance. While this proposal may \nhave merit and yield long-term savings, the committee was not able to \nafford this further increase within its discretionary spending \nallocation. As an alternative, we would encourage the administration to \nwork to fund this proposed conversion through the section 8 housing \nprogram.\n  For USDA conservation programs, total funding of $828 million is \nprovided, $57 million more than the 1997 level. This includes $730 \nmillion for conservation operations, and $47.7 million for the resource \nconservation and development program.\n  USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service is funded at a level of $136.7 \nmillion, and a total program level of $1.1 million is recommended for \nthe Public Law 480 program.\n  The bill also provides a total level of $2.1 billion for rural \neconomic and community development programs. Included in this amount is \n$644 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program authorized in \nthe 1996 farm bill, consolidating funding for 12 existing rural \nhousing, utilities, and business cooperative programs of the Department \nof Agriculture.\n  The bill, as recommended, also appropriates $3.9 billion for the WIC \nProgram and provides up to $12 million for the farmers market nutrition \nprogram. The recommended WIC appropriation level is $122 million above \nthe 1997 level and will be sufficient to maintain the current average \nWIC Program participation level in fiscal year 1998. Also included in \nthe bill is a provision to ensure the continuation of infant formula \nWIC Program rebate savings, and to provide the authority requested by \nthe administration to give the Secretary of Agriculture discretion in \nallocating WIC funds.\n  Further, the bill restores funding for the Pesticide Data Program, \nand provides the increased funds needed in fiscal year 1998 to conduct \nthe Census of Agriculture.\n  It also includes the full $202 million required to pay agents' sales \ncommissions under the crop insurance program. Under current law, this \nshifts these costs from the mandatory to the discretionary side of the \nledger beginning in fiscal year 1998. This places an added demand on \nthe limited discretionary dollars available to the subcommittee. We \nhave accommodated this new requirement, in part, through a limitation \non the export enhancement program. This is a short-term fix. I am \nhopeful that this will not become a permanent burden on discretionary \nspending, and that a long-term legislative solution will be found to \npay for this expense.\n  For those independent agencies funded by the bill, the committee \nprovides the budget request level of $60.1 million, an increase of $5.0 \nmillion above fiscal year 1997 level, for the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission. It provides a $34.4 million limitation on administrative \nexpenses of the Farm Credit Administration, as requested in the budget. \nAnd, it recommends total appropriations of $913 million for the Food \nand Drug Administration, $25.5 million more than the fiscal year 1997 \nlevel. This increase includes the full $24 million requested for FDA \nfood safety initiatives and the $1.5 million increase requested for FDA \nbuildings and facilities requirements.\n  Only 27 percent of the total funding recommended by this bill is \ndiscretionary, subject to the annual control of this subcommittee. As I \nindicated previously, this bill accommodates increased funding required \nfor such programs as WIC, crop insurance delivery expenses, rural \nhousing, food safety, and other pressing program needs.\n  Mr. President, arriving at these funding recommendations always \nrequires a number of difficult decisions. I would like to thank the \ndistinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Bumpers, as \nwell as all other members of the subcommittee for their support and \ncooperation in putting together this bill.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill represents a balanced and \nresponsible set of funding recommendations within the limited resources \navailable to the subcommittee, and I hope Senators will support it.\n  Mr. President, for the information of Senators, this bill is \nconsistent with the allocations under the Budget Act that have been \nmade to this subcommittee. We have worked very hard to identify the \npriorities that Senators have suggested and were in hearings on the \nbudget proposals submitted by the President during the last several \nmonths.\n  This has been an effort which has involved the distinguished ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, Mr. Bumpers, all of the members of our \nsubcommittee, and our staffs. And all have contributed very \nsubstantively to the work that has led to the presentation of this bill \ntoday.\n  We have increased funding for some of the areas where we thought \nthere was justification for doing more in discretionary spending to \nhelp improve the services provided by the Government, such as in food \nsafety, in agriculture research to make our farms more efficient and \nfarming more profitable. We have increased funding to maintain the \ncurrent participation caseload in the WIC Program, for example. And \nthere are other areas.\n  But I mention those three to illustrate that the committee has \nidentified priority areas where we have provided increases. But \noverall, this bill reflects a reduction in spending from last year's \nlevel and a reduction in proposed spending for the next fiscal year \nbelow the request submitted in the President's budget.\n  So we are trying to do our part to reduce the deficit and to control \nspending and to make those hard choices that are necessary if we are to \nin fact balance the budget. We think that the bill reflects a fair and \nthoughtful balance among the various needs that are sought to be met in \nthis appropriations bill.\n  We hope that Senators who do have suggested amendments will come to \nthe floor soon during the consideration of this bill so that we can \ncomplete action on the legislation today. The leader has suggested that \nvotes will probably not occur before 4 o'clock so that if there are \namendments which require votes we are going to ask unanimous consent \nthat those votes be stacked to occur beginning at 4 o'clock. And it is \nmy hope that at the same time we can vote for final passage on the bill \nat that time or following votes on amendments.\n  So with that in mind, I am very happy to yield the floor for the \npurpose of any amendments that Senators may have or for any comments \nany Senator,\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\nand especially the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, the ranking \nmember of the committee, might have.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I first want to extend my sincere thanks \nto my distinguished colleague, the chairman of this subcommittee, who \ncrafted this bill. He has done a magnificent job. He has always been \nunfailingly polite, courteous and thoughtful in the process.\n  I do not want to take up the Senate's time by going into a full \ndetailed statement of what we provided and what we did not provide. But \nI do want to say a few things that I have said in the committee and I \nhave said in speeches in the last couple months regarding what I \nbelieve is a serious lack of funding for research in the area of \nagriculture.\n  We have provided well over $1 billion in this bill for agriculture \nresearch, but it pales by comparison. And in spite of that commitment, \nI think I have a commitment to express my concern about the \ncomparatively small amounts we provide for agriculture research.\n  We live in a world with an ever-growing population. We live in a \nnation with an ever-increasing demand on our natural resources, \nincluding the conversion of arable land for urban growth, for highways, \nand shopping centers. We live in a world where our very survival is \npremised on our ability to produce more food with fewer inputs on fewer \nacres and with fewer risks to public health and the environment.\n  In the face of all these challenges, it is inconceivable that we \nwould not place a much higher premium on investments in the research \nvital to human survival, simply put, the research of how we are going \nto feed ourselves.\n  We live in a nation that is blessed with abundant natural resources. \nWe live in a nation blessed with a bounty of agricultural products \ncurrently capable of feeding ourselves and a good part of the rest of \nthe world. We live in a nation that has lapsed into a complacency \ncaused by the fact that our next meal has always been as close as the \ncorner supermarket. It would not take many days spent in the back \ncountry villages of Latin America, the ravaged countryside of Central \nAfrica, or the weathered, tortured steps of Mongolia to witness the \nlack of what we daily take for granted. I constantly admonish high \nschool and college groups who are going out into the world to remember \nto count their blessings more often and their money less.\n  Mr. President, do not misunderstand me. I fully support the efforts \nof Senator Cochran in providing the funds contained in this bill for \nagriculture research, but I am constantly dismayed and perplexed at \nCongress' willingness to spend 30 times more on weapons research than \nwe do on guaranteeing our future food supply. We spend twice as much \nevery year just on the space station as we do on agriculture research.\n  I have often felt that truly meaningful agriculture reform is only \none good famine away. But I also continue to hope that such a cataclysm \nwill not be the event that brings us to our senses.\n  Senator Cochran has done an excellent job with this bill within the \nfiscal constraints that bind all of us. He has properly balanced the \nneeds of the research community with the other demands to which we must \nanswer. This Nation looks to Congress, and I admonish Congress that we \ndo not have forever to come to grips with the train wreck that is on \nthe horizon and is absolutely certain to occur. We must begin laying \nthe groundwork for an agricultural policy that allows our producers all \nthe scientific advances we can develop if we are to grow more with \nless. We know that certainly we will need more and we will have less if \nwe don't.\n  One other comment I make regarding the need to bolster agricultural \nresearch. Just 1 year ago, this Congress ended most of the support \nprograms that historically protected American farmers from the market \nforces that often were marshaled to their disadvantage through either \nthe plagues of weather, the domain of foreign policy, or forces beyond \ntheir control. Now they are left with the tattered safety net that has \nbrought prices declining, as they are now doing, and there is little \nbreak to their fall.\n  One of the safety net remnants in hand is our agricultural research \nstructure. As the cost of farm inputs skyrocket, we must find ways to \nreduce their application. As threats to the environment increase, we \nmust find cost-effective protections. If we expect to continue spending \nless on food than any other developed nation on Earth, we must find \nways to make its production cost less.\n  More than simply a producer, there is not a better steward of the \nEarth than the American farmer. The farmer knows that his livelihood is \ndirectly tied to his care for the soil and water. This bill contains \nfunding for programs designed to help the farmer continue what he \npractices naturally--conservation. For the first time in many years, \nthis bill places no limitations on the mandatory conservation programs \nestablished in the farm bill. These include the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram, the Conservation Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, and many others established to help farmers protect \nour natural environment.\n  In the area of rural development, important areas of spending are \nprotected and, in some instances, provided an increase. The Water and \nSewer Grants Program, one near and dear to my heart, increased this \nyear from the budget request of $438 million to $491 million. I want to \nespecially thank Senator Cochran for engineering that. The section 502 \nSingle-Family Housing Program was returned to a program level of $1 \nbillion. In addition, the Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural \nAreas Program, one I am happy to say is housed at the University of \nArkansas, important for the sustainable agricultural prices and \nproducts, is increased to $1.5 million.\n  The bill provides nearly $4 billion for the WIC Program. We all know \nthat is the program that provides a healthy diet for poor pregnant \nwomen and thereby increases the protein diet and the brain count of the \nfetus. This amount is an increase of nearly $200 million above the \nlevel we provided in the fiscal year 1997 bill. Noninclusive is the $76 \nmillion we put in the recent supplemental appropriations bill. Included \nin the fiscal year 1998 WIC appropriation is $12 million for the WIC \nFarmers Market Nutrition Program. That helps provide fresh produce for \nWIC participants. In other words, WIC participants can buy produce at \nthe roadside vegetable stand, just as everybody else can, with their \nvouchers.\n  For the Food and Drug Administration, this bill provides an increase \nabove last year--an increase--and includes a 1-year extension of the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act and a Mammography Quality Standard Act. \nFees collected from these two authorities will provide an additional \n$105.2 million for the FDA. These funds are vital to protect Food and \nDrug supplies and to ensure the safety and efficacy of our \npharmaceutical and medical devices.\n  Mr. President, just as we too often take for granted the availability \nof food, we too often take for granted the safety of that food. It only \ntakes a single outbreak of E. coli in fruit juice, or similar strains \nin other food products, to quickly bring us short as to how fragile our \nhealth can become in the hostile world of bacteria and microorganisms. \nVisit with one mother of a child who has known the horror of a food-\nborne illness and what it can do, and you will never take the safety of \nour food for granted again. The Food and Drug Administration, along \nwith the Food Safety Inspection Service, stands as a guardian to \nprotect our food supplies and the public health. This bill serves to \nhelp those agencies carry out those very important missions.\n  The bill provides $14.5 billion to complete phase 2 for the FDA's \nNational Center for Toxicological Research. This important facility is \non the front-line of helping protect the health of American consumers. \nOnce complete, this facility will be a cornerstone of the FDA's \nstreamlining efforts to make Government more efficient and cost \neffective.\n  There were several initiatives included in the administration's \nbudget request, many of which included funding in this bill. The food \nsafety initiative, vitally important to protect our food supply and \nhelp bolster consumer confidence in all meat, poultry and\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\nother products, has provided nearly full funding. The human nutrition \ninitiative, though not completely funded, gets a substantial boost.\n\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by restating, I am again most grateful \nto Senator Cochran for his unfailing courtesy and consultations and for \nthe fine job he and his excellent staff have done in crafting this \nbill. To expedite matters, let me simply say we are all grateful for \nhis fair and open consideration of all requests. I gladly join him in \nbringing this bill to the Senate floor and urge the support of all \nSenators in its passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very grateful for the generous \ncomments by the distinguished Senator from Arkansas about our work \ntogether on this bill and my contributions to the effort. It has been a \ngenuine pleasure working with him. I have considered it one of the \nhighlights of my career in the Senate of getting to know him personally \nand serving with him on the Appropriations Committee, as we have for \nthese last 18 years.\n\n\n                  corrections to senate report 105-51\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to reflect for the record the following \ncorrections to Senate Report 105-51 accompanying S. 1033, the fiscal \nyear 1998 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act.\n  The table on page 36 of the report should properly reflect that the \ncommittee recommends a $200,000 Federal administration grant to the \n``Center for Human Nutrition (Maryland)'' rather than the ``Center for \nHawaiian Nutrition (Maryland).''\n  On page 37, the first paragraph should reflect a total recommendation \nof ``$47,525,000'' for special research grants under Public Law 89-106 \nrather than ``$46,525,000''.\n  In the table on pages 42-43 of the report, the committee recommended \ntotal for ``Agricultural quarantine inspection'' under ``Pest and \ndisease exclusion'' should be ``26,747'' rather than ``28,547'', making \nthe subtotal for agricultural quarantine inspection ``126,747''; and \nthe committee recommended total for ``Biological control'' under ``pest \nand disease management programs'' should be ``6,090'' rather than \n``6,290'', making the subtotal for pest and disease management \n``96,281''.\n  And, on page 76, delete ``the University of Colorado Health Science \nCenter telemedicine project, Colorado,'' from the list of rural \nbusiness enterprise grants which the committee encourages the \nDepartment to consider.\n  Further, I would like to clarify that the $275,100 in the first \nparagraph on page 24 of the report for the University of Hawaii \nInstitute of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources for the \ncollaboration work on developing and evaluating efficacious and \nnontoxic methods to control tephritid fruit flies is the net amount \ncurrently going to the location, rather than the gross amount.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there are several amendments which have \nbeen brought to our attention that we know will be offered by Senators. \nWe invite those Senators to come to the floor now and present their \namendments for the consideration of the Senate. Some of them we expect \nto recommend approval; others we will have to oppose. We hope that we \ncan begin that process soon so we can complete action on all amendments \nso that we can have votes on those amendments and final passage of the \nbill at 4 o'clock this afternoon. That is our goal. We need the \ncooperation and assistance of all Senators in order to achieve that \ngoal.\n  Let me say, in connection with the provisions of the bill, some of \nwhich the Senator from Arkansas mentioned specifically, I am \nparticularly pleased we were able to continue funding for a lot of the \ntraditional programs of the Department of Agriculture, which, because \nthey are not new, because they do not seem innovative, are often \noverlooked or taken for granted. One that comes to mind is the \nExtension Service. We have seen a lot of changes in the Extension \nService over the years, and we have tried to give that service the \nfunds they need to carry out what many consider to be services and \nbenefits that are not often applauded or recognized.\n  We have seen so many new developments in technology and in modern \nscience that we are able now to utilize in our rural communities and on \nour farms that have really elevated the standard of living in rural \nAmerica to a point that is really quite impressive. We need a lot of \nthings done that have not been done, but that is one of the agencies \nthat, in my judgment, has done a great deal to help make life more \nlivable, more enjoyable, and enrich the lives of many people every day \nbecause of the work that has been done.\n  Another area that seems to me important to mention is the protection \nof our environment, our soil and water resources. The funds for \nconservation programs are increased because of the growing importance \nof developing new technologies, new ways to deal with pests and other \nproblems in production of agriculture in an environmentally sensitive \nway. All of that is reflected in this legislation--those ambitions, \nthose goals, and the importance of protecting the safety and health of \nthose who live in rural America.\n  We think the research activities done by the Agricultural Research \nService also merit special mention. There are a lot of new things being \nundertaken by agricultural research scientists that offer great promise \nin terms of food safety, in reducing the necessity for using some \nproducts on our farms that many consider to have the potential for \nharming health and human safety. We are trying to make these changes \nand these improvements in agriculture possible through the development \nof new discoveries and new applications of science in agriculture. That \nis the agency that the Federal Government has charged with the \nresponsibility of concentrating in that area.\n  We also are developing, in concert with the legislative committees in \nthe House and Senate, a level of funding of over $100 million for a \ncomprehensive research effort that is new and recently authorized in \nthe farm bill that was passed 2 years ago. We are hopeful that this \nwill mean a more coherent approach to research and a more effective \napproach. Some worry about our spending too much money for so-called \nbasic research and not enough money for applied research. The line \nbetween those two efforts has been blurred, and, in some cases, it is \nhard to distinguish between one kind and another. We appreciate the \ninput we have received from those throughout the country who have \npresented information and have made their views known to the committee \non that subject.\n  This bill reflects an effort to bring together the best suggestions \nthat we have had on that subject to have a more effective and more \nsuccessful research effort for the betterment of our country.\n  With the hope that other Senators will come to the floor and present \namendments or suggested changes or comments on this legislation, I am \nprepared to yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to commend Subcommittee Chairman \nCochran for his work on the Agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 1998. This bill provides funding for all the activities under the \njurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture, except for the U.S. \nForest Service. It also funds the activities of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Farm \nCredit System.\n  This has been one of the most difficult years to date and I \ncongratulate Senator Cochran and his staff in working through the \ndifficult decisions in crafting this bill.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Rob Mangas and \nJim Low of my staff be granted the privilege of the floor during \nconsideration of S. 1033.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7893-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7897-S7898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n                  CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, very soon, Senator Murkowski will submit \nfor himself, for me, and for Senator Gorton and Senator Helms, a \nresolution condemning the Government of Canada for its failure to \nprotect the right of innocent passage of the Alaska ferry Malaspina in \nthe Canadian territorial sea. The Malaspina entered the Port of Prince \nRupert on Sunday morning and was blockaded by, we are told, about 200 \nCanadian fishing vessels and was prevented from leaving that port.\n  On Sunday, at the request of the State of Alaska, a Canadian court \nissued an injunction against the blockaders. The governments of Canada \nand British Columbia ignored the court's directions to enforce that \ninjunction. The Malaspina was finally able to leave Prince Rupert on \nMonday evening, only when the Canadian fishermen agreed to end the \nblockade.\n  In my judgment, through its inaction, the Government of Canada has \nexhibited a disregard for its own domestic laws, for international law, \nand for what I would call the concept of being a good neighbor to our \ncountry, the United States.\n  Mr. President, over the past 3 years the Government of Canada has \nshown a pattern of complacency--and, in some cases, complicity--in the \nharassment and illegal treatment of United States vessels and our \ncitizens.\n  In 1994, Canada charged an illegal transit passage fee to United \nStates fishing vessels proceeding from the Seattle area north to \nAlaskan waters. Following that, at my request, Congress directed the \nState Department to reimburse these United States fishermen and to seek \nrepayment from Canada for the illegal fees that were imposed upon our \ncitizens. To date, Canada has not repaid and, as a matter of fact, has \nignored the request for reimbursement to the United States for these \ncosts.\n  The Government of British Columbia continues to seek to prevent use \nby the United States of an underwater missile testing range that is \ncritical to NATO activities, at a place called that Nanoose Bay. I \nfound that to be unacceptable, Mr. President. To have one NATO partner \nuse land that has been made available under NATO for leverage on a \nfisheries issue is unprecedented.\n  The United States vessels have also periodically been harassed by the \nGovernments of Canada and British Columbia under the guise of \nenforcement of Canada's customs laws. My colleague and I are here today \nto call on the Government of Canada to put a stop to these actions. We \nask that the President of the United States now take action to ensure \nthat harassment of our citizens comes to an end.\n  The measure my colleague will submit condemns the Government of \nCanada for its failure to protect United States citizens from these \ntypes of illegal actions and harassment while our people exercise their \nabsolute right for innocent passage through these Canadian territorial \nwaters. They are international waters under international law and \navailable to our people just as our inside passage in southeast Alaska \nis available to and used by the Canadian people.\n  Our resolution calls on the President to ensure that this pattern of \nharassment will not continue. We ask that the President use assets of \nthe United States to protect our citizens if necessary, and, also his \nauthority to prohibit the importation of Canadian products into this \ncountry until Canada agrees to protect our citizens.\n  We also believe the President should find a way to provide financial \nsupport to those who were damaged by the blockade of the Malaspina.\n  Mr. President, there were, I am told, over 300 people on board that \nvessel, and many had to be removed and transported by air to Alaska. In \naddition to that, it is my information that the Malaspina carries the \nUnited States mail. It is absolutely unheard of for the Government of \nCanada to interfere with the delivery of United States mail.\n  I hope that Congress will consider favorably the resolution that my \ncolleague will introduce, and we intend to consider other measures as \nwell.\n  We have already passed a bill and sent it to conference with the \nHouse that will deny funds for the environmental cleanup of defense \nsites that were used by Canada and the United States during the cold \nwar period because of the action of British Columbia authorities to try \nto discontinue our use of Nanoose Bay. That, Mr. President, is \nessential to our testing program for torpedoes. It has been a joint \nventure between our Canadian neighbors and our Nation in defense \nefforts for many years. I am really saddened by that in terms of our \nrelationship for our mutual defense. But we believe that we should \nassure that Canada will protect our citizens as they exercise their \nright of innocent passage through Canadian waters, and we believe very \nsincerely that Canada or its citizens should repay those people that \nhave been damaged by the illegal blockade of the Malaspina.\n  We also call on Canada to repay the United States the illegal transit \nfees that were charged to our fishing vessels in 1994. And, further, we \nplead with Canada and its citizens to match the good-faith efforts of \nthe United States to continue to negotiate and renew the Pacific salmon \ntreaty.\n\n  Mr. President, it is a time for leadership in these matters. We risk \ngetting more and more rhetoric involved. I have tried to be restrained \ntoday. I think Alaskans share this point of view, but we are pushed to \nincrease the stakes.\n  Our people are most upset. They are even more upset by the act of \nburning our U.S. flag. I think for a neighbor that shares such a long \nborder to allow citizens to burn a flag of this country is really \nuncalled for. I don't know really how to express our deep concern about \nthat. To my knowledge, there has been no action at all taken with \nregard to that. We have a flag-burning issue here in our own country. \nBut to see it done as an act of defiance by people illegally blocking \nthe ferry owned by our State is upsetting. That vessel is owned by the \nState of Alaska, and it is part of the trek for people who come from \nall over the world. Many take a ferry up to Canada. Then they take a \nCanadian ferry from Vancouver Island to Prince Rupert. They take the \nAlaska ferry on up into Alaska. It is a right of all vessels to have \ninnocent passage through the waters of a neighboring country.\n  This blockade of our vessel on top of the harassment and seizure of \nour fishing vessels is too much, Mr. President.\n  I don't know. We are few in number in Alaska. If this happened to \nCalifornia, there would be 54 Members of the House talking about it. We \nhave one. And, unfortunately, right now he is recovering from a very \nserious operation.\n  But, Mr. President, the rights of American citizens should be \nprotected by our Federal Government. We have heard nothing really yet \nfrom our National Government in response to these measures. I think \nthat it is high time that this Government stands up to Canada and \nexplains once again what the role of good neighbors really must be.\n  I do not want to get to the point where we really have to start \nretaliating and raise the level of this rhetoric even further. But, \nclearly, those people who say, ``Well, now, just let it cool off,'' \ndon't understand. We cooled off after 1994 when they put our people in \njail and charged them fees. Congress agreed, and we paid the fishermen \nback for the fees they paid to the Government of Canada. Now we see our \nvessel with 300 Americans on board held up for more than 2 days, denied \nthe right to keep their schedule and go on to Alaska according to the \nferry schedules.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate and the Congress will view this \nmatter with as deep concern as we do and will assist Alaska in assuring \nthat we have the same rights of all Americans as we try to pursue our \nright of innocent passage through the territorial sea of our \nneighboring country.\n  I urge the support of the measure prepared by Senator Murkowski. This \nhappens to be the part of our State that Senator Murkowski came from. \nHe knows Ketchikan very well, and he is proud about his heritage and \nabout the area he comes from. He has transited these waters down to \nSeattle many times.\n  I sincerely believe there must be some recognition by the Government \nof Canada and the Government of the United States of this trespass on \nthe rights of Alaskans and other Americans that were on board the \nMalaspina.\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7897-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7898-S7911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment relating \nto Department of Agriculture rural housing programs. I would like to \nexpress my appreciation to Chairman Cochran and Ranking Minority Member \nBumpers for their consideration of this amendment and their continued \ncommitment to providing affordable housing for our Nation's rural \nAmericans.\n  The Department of Agriculture has a number of successful housing \nprograms under the auspices of its Rural Housing Service [RHS]. \nAlthough operated by the Department of Agriculture, rural housing \nprograms are under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. As \nchairman of the Banking Committee, I respectfully request the \nconsideration of this much needed amendment.\n  This amendment contains provisions which will permit important \nhousing programs to continue in an uninterrupted and cost-efficient \nfashion. It includes 1-year extensions of housing programs which have \nexpired or will expire in the near future. Specifically, the RHS \nSection 515 Rural Rental Housing Program, the RHS Section 538 Rural \nRental Housing Loan Guarantee Program, and the RHS Underserved Areas \nProgram would be extended until September 30, 1998.\n  Due to the uncertainty of final passage of housing reauthorization \nlegislation this year, these short-term extensions are essential. In \naddition, the amendment would alter the section 515 loan term and \namortization schedule. This provision would change the loan term from \n50 to 30 years, but allow the borrower to have the loan amortized for a \nperiod not to exceed 50 years. This statutory change incurs no cost to \nthe American taxpayer, and is necessary to ensure that budget authority \nprovided will support the administration's proposed fiscal year 1998 \nsection 515 program level.\n  The need for affordable housing in rural areas is severe. According \nto the 1990 census, over 2.7 million rural Americans live in \nsubstandard housing. In my home State of New York, 76 percent of \nrenters are paying 30 percent or more of their income for housing. \nApproximately 60 percent of New York renters pay over 50 percent of \ntheir income for rent.\n  The section 515 and section 538 programs are some of the few \nresources available to respond to this serious unmet housing need. \nSince its inception in 1962, the section 515 rental loan program has \nfinanced the development of over 450,000 units of affordable units in \nover 18,000 apartment projects. The program assists elderly, disabled, \nand low-income rural families with an average income of $7,200. The \nalteration of the section 515 loan term and amortization schedule will \nprovide over 500 additional units. The section 538 program is a \nrelatively young loan guarantee program which has already proven to \nhave widespread national appeal. With a proposed subsidy rate of \napproximately 3 cents per $1, it is an example of cost-effective \nleveraging of public resources.\n  I thank the Appropriations Committee for its recognition of the great \nneed for these important rural housing programs and its steadfast \ncommitment to\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\nensuring that every Federal dollar appropriated serves the greatest \nnumber of our low-income rural Americans. I support immediate passage \nof this amendment. Thank you.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment \nconcerning rural housing reauthorizations for the Rural Housing Service \nof the Department of Agriculture. I want to commend Chairman Cochran \nand Ranking Member Bumpers for their tireless efforts and cooperation \nin bringing the Agriculture Appropriations Act of 1998 to the floor for \nSenate consideration.\n  Given the uncertainty of housing reauthorization legislation this \nyear, I have joined with Banking Committee Chairman D'Amato to request \nthe inclusion of an amendment that would reauthorize several rural \nhousing programs in the 1998 Agriculture appropriations bill. This \namendment will allow the section 515 and section 538 rural rental \nhousing programs to continue providing multifamily housing developers \nwith direct loans and loan guarantees to build or rehabilitate \naffordable rental housing.\n  In addition, this amendment reauthorizes for 1 year the nonprofit \nset-aside which reserves 10 percent of section 515 funds for nonprofit \napplicants, as well as the Underserved Areas Program which targets \nfunds to the 100 most underserved rural communities. This amendment \nalso changes the section 515 loan term from 50 to 30 years, while \nallowing the loan to be amortized over a 50-year period. This change \npermits the administration's proposed program level in the budget of \n$150 million to be supported by almost 15 percent less in budget \nauthority.\n  Without these housing programs targeted to very-low and low-income \nrural residents, there exists few resources in rural America to help \nalleviate the shortage of affordable rental housing. Rural areas still \nlack adequate access to commercial credit to finance affordable \nmultifamily housing. The direct benefits to rural communities from the \nsection 515 and section 538 programs includes increased jobs and local \ntaxes in addition to attracting and maintaining businesses. This is a \ndirect and vital link to the overall health and stability for rural \ncommunities.\n  While the Rural Housing Service has done much to bring decent, safe, \nand affordable housing to rural America, many rural families are still \nin need of assistance. Rural renters experience housing problems such \nas overcrowding, cost overburdens, and substandard facilities. There \nare 1.6 million rural households that live in housing without adequate \nplumbing, heating, or kitchen facilities. Nearly 2.5 million are paying \nmore than 50 percent of their incomes for housing costs, and another 3 \nmillion pay between 30 and 50 percent. As we encourage families to move \nfrom welfare to work, it is even more essential that we build on the \nvital housing programs that provide the safety net which will give the \nworking poor an opportunity to live in affordable, decent housing.\n  Again, I would like to thank Chairman Cochran, Ranking Member \nBumpers, and the rest of my colleagues for their swift action to ensure \nthat essential rural rental housing programs receive authorization to \ncontinue serving low-income families for another year. I urge the \nadoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no objection to this amendment. \nIt has been cleared. We recommend that it be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The amendment (No. 963) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 961\n\n (Purpose: To withhold $4,000,000 of appropriated funds from the Risk \n  Management Agency until the administrator of the agency issues and \nbegins to implement a plan to reduce administrative and operating costs \n                    of approved insurance providers)\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 28, line 19, before the period at the end of the \n     sentence, insert the following: ``: Provided further, That, \n     of the amount made available under this sentence, $4,000,000 \n     shall be available for obligation only after the \n     Administrator of the Risk Management Agency issues and begins \n     to implement the plan to reduce administrative and operating \n     costs of approved insurance providers required under section \n     408(k)(7) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1508(k)(7))''.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, prior to discussing the amendment, I want \nto take this opportunity to associate myself with the most pertinent \nremarks stated by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, the \nchairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, and the \ndistinguished ranking member, the Senator from Arkansas. Chairman \nCochran and the ranking member, Senator Bumpers, have demonstrated \ncontinued leadership and tireless efforts to make it possible for the \nAmerican farmer and rancher to continue to feed this country and a \ntroubled and hungry world.\n  Senator Cochran said in his earlier remarks that all have \ncontributed. I would also like to extend my congratulations to the \nstaff, both of Mr. Cochran and to Mr. Bumpers, and I would point out to \nthe American consumer, all taxpayers as well as our farmers and \nranchers about what is at stake here. It is just not the eighth or \nninth appropriations bill we are considering in this Chamber, albeit \nthat is important. We are talking about the fact that the American \nconsumer today spends only 10 cents of the disposable income dollar for \nthat so-called market basket of food.\n  Every housewife in America should pay attention to the fact that that \nfrees up 90 cents for hard-pressed families today to spend on education \nor housing or the other essentials. And so we want to say thank you to \nSenator Cochran and Senator Bumpers for providing the funds to continue \nthis vital responsibility of feeding America.\n  Senator Bumpers mentioned food safety. Now, we have heard a great \noutcry in regard to E. coli, salmonella, and other challenges we face, \nbut as Senator Bumpers pointed out we have, hopefully, adequate funds \nto address that problem. So this bill deals with food safety. And I \nmight point out that since we have the best quality of food at the \nlowest price, the American consumer today apparently cares more about \nconvenience and the safety of their food supply rather than price. That \nis unequaled in regard to any country. And so this bill does address \nthat.\n  I could go on about the trade aspects of the bill and our balance of \npayments and jobs. I could point out we all live longer as a result of \nthe efforts of agriculture and farmers and ranchers and the investment \nwe are making in this bill. Simply put, we do have the best quality \nfood at the lowest price in the history of the world, and I think a lot \nof people do take agriculture for granted. The first obligation of any \ngovernment is to provide its country an adequate food supply. Who is \nresponsible for this? Many are, but two particular individuals, one the \nchairman of the committee and the other the ranking member. And I again \nwish to thank them.\n  As a matter of fact, I can recall several months ago that the \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Cochran, and I were privileged to \njoin Senator Stevens on a trip to the Russian Far East and to South \nKorea and to North Korea. We were the first congressional delegation \nallowed into North Korea. And in North Korea, the former leader of that \ncountry, if I can refer to that person as a leader, Kim Il-song, called\n\n[[Page S7900]]\n\nthe ``Magnificent Leader,'' by the way, has written a veritable tome of \nbooks about that kind of government. It is a very repressive and \ntotalitarian government. But the first book--and I read it the evening \nwe were there--starts out with agriculture and says the first \nobligation of any country is to be able to feed its people.\n  So while we were there we were working on the four-party peace talks, \nand we were trying to be a positive influence, and Senator Cochran has \na great deal of expertise in regard to disarmament. He had this other \nidea; he insisted in regard to Senator Stevens, myself and others, we \nvisit this collective farm. And the Senator made a good point. We went \nout and we visited it outside the capital city of Pyongyang, and we \nfound a farm that had farming practices back in the 1930's, largely \nresponsible, I might add, for the famine in that country.\n  I really think, if you stop to take a look at it, we ought to count \nour blessings in the fact we have outstanding individuals in the Senate \nsuch as Senator Bumpers and Senator Cochran responsible for the \ninvestment in American agriculture to allow us to do the things we do. \nI have been through what, five or six farm bills, having had the \nprivilege of serving in the other body. Those are the authorizing \ncommittees. I also wish to thank Senator Cochran in particular for the \nway that he has handled the obligations and responsibilities of the \nappropriators. It is a difficult task to try to fit together our \nspending priorities with the policy objectives of the authorizers, and \nI must say in all candor, unlike the other body, Senator Cochran has \nclosely cooperated with the authorizing committee, has done so with \nfairness, with tolerance and with respect and comity and also \nunderstanding and effective leadership. I think we have quite a team on \nthe appropriations subcommittee involving agriculture appropriations, \nand I again wish to thank them. I thank Senator Bumpers and Senator \nCochran on behalf of every farmer, every rancher, and every consumer in \nAmerica. I think they have done an outstanding job.\n  Mr. President, I regret that I must offer this amendment. Quite \nhonestly, it pains me to have to even suggest this course of action, \nbut my responsibility to the farmers of America certainly compels me to \ndo so. The purpose of this amendment is twofold. First, it allows this \nbody to recognize that the Risk Management Agency--that is the outfit \nthat administers the USDA's Federal Crop Insurance program--has failed \nto comply with the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1994. That is 3 years \nago.\n\n  Second, as a result of the Risk Management Agency's unwillingness to \nsubmit and implement a plan to reduce administrative and operating \ncosts of approved insurance providers as required under the 1994 act, \nthis amendment would withhold--I am not trying to cut, just withhold--\nfunding of $4 million of funding from the RMA appropriation unless the \nplan is implemented by September 30, 1998.\n  Mr. President, farmers have always needed crop insurance in order to \nmake ends meet, in order to work, but for too many years it was always \neither too expensive or provided too little coverage depending on what \nregion you came from and what commodity. But we passed the 1994 Crop \nInsurance Act and privately developed crop insurance products surfaced \nas a replacement, very long needed replacement, to the old USDA-\nsponsored insurance programs. Now, while crop revenue coverage, or what \nwe call CRC, is widely regarded as a revolutionary new risk management \ntool in farm country, we are providing farmers the capability, the \ntools, if you will, to manage their downside risk when prices fall. It \nis not like the old insurance products. The CRC protects both against \nprice and yield risk. It is expensive, that is true, but it is worth \nthe price for farmers who want adequate protection for their farm and \ntheir family. But, unfortunately, too often the USDA has taken an \nadversarial position to the development of these private crop insurance \nprograms.\n  Too often the department has tried to compete with the private sector \nin the development and marketing of these products.\n  A few weeks ago, a crop insurance agent from Luray, KS, population \nabout 500, came into my office and said: ``Senator Roberts, I really \nwant to continue selling crop insurance because I know the farmers in \nour community need it, that our town depends on the farm economy for \nits survival. But, Senator, all the paperwork and redtape involved has \nforced me to hire additional people just to push the paper around. \nUnless the regulatory burden subsides, I am afraid I will have to stop \nselling crop insurance entirely.''\n  This amendment is all about that crop insurance agent and small town \nAmerica. This amendment is all about the farmer, who tries to feed this \nvery troubled and hungry world, who will invariably face higher crop \ninsurance premiums as a result of USDA's intransigence. We cannot let \nthis unfortunate situation threaten the viability of our crop insurance \nprogram and our farmers, the exciting new tools for the farmers to \nmanage their downside risk.\n  I urge support for this amendment. I simply ask the risk management \nagency to do what the Congress and the President required of them back \nin 1994. We made that arrangement. We lowered the payments that went to \nthe crop insurance companies in exchange for regulatory reform.\n  I don't know how many times I have asked the RMA folks, officials \ndown there, where is the report? In 1994, no report; 1995, no report; \n1996 no report; 1997--it's time. This is going to give them clear up to \nSeptember 30, 1998. But this ought to at least open some eyes down at \nUSDA that we need regulatory reform. That's what we asked for, that's \nwhat we required in the 1994 act. I ask consideration of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have looked at the amendment proposed \nby the distinguished Senator from Kansas. I must say, it is targeted to \na very narrow issue, and it seeks to withhold only $4 million of a $64 \nmillion account which is appropriated or recommended for appropriation \nin this bill for the administration of the Risk Management Agency that \nhas a responsibility for administering the crop insurance program.\n  I am not going to oppose this amendment. I sympathize with the goal. \nI sympathize with the effort to get the attention of the administration \nto do something that was required of them in the 1994 act of Congress. \nI am hopeful the Senate will approve the amendment and that this will \nhelp achieve the goal of the distinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  Let me also say, too, I am very grateful for his generous comments \nabout the work of our subcommittee and the efforts we have made to \npresent a bill that reflects the needs of our country in connection \nwith agriculture and agricultural production and all of those other \nactivities that are funded in the legislation. He is very kind to point \nout that we have worked hard. He has been a big help, too, in certainly \nhelping us understand the provisions that were contained in the last \npassed farm bill, which he had a great deal to do with writing as \nchairman of the House Agriculture Committee. We are lucky to have him \nin the Senate, and we appreciate his continued advice and counsel and \nassistance in these matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me echo the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, Chairman Cochran. I subscribe \nto everything he said. I also want to especially thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas for his very, very kind, laudatory \ncomments.\n  Having said that, let me just say I am not going to object to the \namendment either. I think, in a way, it is a little bit of a \nsledgehammer approach. But, by the same token, the Senator is entitled \nto the report he requested a very long time ago. It is a legitimate \nrequest, and the Department should have responded to it much sooner.\n  The Department objects to the amendment, but I am going to, on behalf \nof this side of the aisle, say I will accept the amendment and I \nstrongly encourage the Department to respond, so, possibly by the time \nwe get to conference, we can deal with this amendment. But let the \nDepartment know in advance that unless there is a very firm commitment \nmade, the Senator's\n\n[[Page S7901]]\n\nrequest will be honored and the amendment will wind up in the \nconference committee report.\n  So, I am going to clear this amendment for this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 961) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand that Senators are \nconsidering offering amendments. Let me say this is a good time to come \nto the floor and do that. We expect amendments to be offered. We hope \nto wind up consideration of all amendments so we can stack votes and \nhave those votes at 4 o'clock this afternoon, and then final passage of \nthe bill. To do that, we need the cooperation and participation of \nSenators. We invite that at this time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed as in morning business for no more than 2 minutes for the \npurpose of introducing a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns pertaining to the introduction of S. 1056 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield back any time remaining. I thank \nthe chairman of the ag appropriations bill for his courtesy.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 964\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the conditions for issuance of cotton user \n                        marketing certificates)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk which has \nbeen cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself and \n     Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered 964.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new provision:\n       Sec.   . Effective on October 1, 1998 section 136(a) of the \n     Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 U.S.C. 7236(a)) is \n     amended--\n       (a) in paragraph (1)\n       (1) by striking ``Subject to paragraph (4), during'' and \n     inserting ``During''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``130'' and inserting \n     ``134'';\n       (b) by striking paragraph (4); and\n       (c) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (4).\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Bumpers. This amendment contains two \ntechnical changes to the competitiveness provisions of the domestic \ncotton program. This amendment has been scored by the Congressional \nBudget Office as having no cost. I am informed that the chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee has no objection to the amendment.\n  The original provisions in the law were designed to ensure that U.S. \ncotton is competitive in both domestic and overseas markets. The \nprogram has worked well, but changes made to the program in 1991 and \n1996 have had unintended consequences.\n  The amendment I am offering would address those problems by doing two \nthings. First, it makes it possible for the various components of the \nprogram to work simultaneously to ensure that we do not rely too much \non cotton import quotas to make domestic cotton competitive. Second, it \nslightly increases a ceiling that unduly restricts the availability of \nthe step 2 certificate program. By capping loan rates in the 1996 FAIR \nAct, Congress unintentionally restricted the operation of the cotton \ncompetitiveness program. The amendment eases the restriction slightly, \nbut would not affect loan rates.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment that has been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle. I know of no objections to it. I know of no \nSenators who want to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 964) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    arkansas communications project\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the senior Senator \nfrom Mississippi in a colloquy.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I would be pleased to join the senior Senator from \nArkansas in a colloquy.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this bill includes the Rural Community \nAdvancement Program which provides flexibility to tailor financial \nassistance to applicant needs. Through this program rural business \nenterprise grants are made available.\n  As you are very well aware, I have pursued funding for the Arkansas \ncommunications project since March 1992. This project will provide a \nstatewide communications and education network that will eventually \ninclude all Arkansas publicly funded 2- and 4-year institutions of \nhigher learning, research and extension centers, cooperative extension \ncounty offices, many rural hospitals, and State and Federal Government \noffice buildings. The network will include compressed video, TV/video \nproduction, and data networking. When completed, the project will serve \nthe large rural population of Arkansas as well as provide linkages and \neducational support to our more urban areas.\n  This committee first voiced its support for the project in the fiscal \nyear 1993, and the committee has continued to note its support every \nyear since. Unfortunately, the University of Arkansas Divisions of \nAgriculture, which is sponsoring this project, has endured mixed \nresults in getting the Department of Agriculture to honor the wishes of \nthis committee. Promises were made and broken until the project came to \nthe attention of Under Secretary Thompson and her staff in Rural \nDevelopment. She and they have offered invaluable assistance, and I am \npleased to note that the division received funding for the first phase \nof the project earlier this year and is actively seeking funding for \nthe second and third phases. I should also note that the division has \nalready committed sizeable non-federal resources to the project while \nreducing the total cost by nearly one-third. Am I correct in noting \nthat the committee still strongly supports completion of this project?\n  Mr. COCHRAN, The ranking member is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And am I correct in noting that the committee will \ncontinue to actively monitor the progress of the Department toward \nfully funding the Arkansas communications project in a timely manner?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The ranking member is again correct. The committee notes \nits strong approval of the Department for actively working to fund this \nimportant project from existing resources. The committee reserves the \nright to revisit this project next year should the Department fail to \ncontinue its laudable efforts.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chairman. Let me also note that the \nDepartment of Agriculture offered to assist the division in seeking \ncommunication funds from other Departments as well. The division \nrecently submitted a grant request to the Department of Commerce and it \nis my expectation that the Department of Agriculture will follow \nthrough with their offer of assistance and support.\n  In addition to the Arkansas communications project, the Arkansas \nEnterprise Group has been trying to provide assistance for rural \ncommunities and smaller companies in Arkansas so that\n\n[[Page S7902]]\n\nthey can join the increasingly global and international environment. \nHowever, the small companies which the Arkansas Enterprise Group is \ntrying to help grow do not meet the criteria required to move unaided \ninto the export market. They also fall between the cracks for other \nprograms that aid companies to export products. Am I correct in noting \nthat the committee supports the Arkansas Enterprise Group in their \nbusiness international exporting loan fund?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The ranking member is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is it also the Senator from Mississippi's understanding \nthat if State allocations are not sufficient to meet any States needs \nthat a national reserve is available.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The ranking member is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 965\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of appropriated funds to provide or pay \nthe salaries of personnel who provide crop insurance or noninsured crop \n   disaster assistance for tobacco for the 1998 or later crop years)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Gregg, and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 965.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 66, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       Sec. 728. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to provide or pay the salaries of personnel who \n     provide crop insurance or noninsured crop disaster assistance \n     for tobacco for the 1998 or later crop years.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, one of the most common questions asked of Members of \nthe House and Senate at town meetings or in casual conversations across \nAmerica is the following: ``Senator, if the Federal Government tells us \nthat tobacco is so dangerous for Americans, why does the Federal \nGovernment continue to subsidize tobacco in America?\n  A variety of answers are given to that question. These answers \nreflect, in some ways, our wishes and, in some ways, misinformation, \nbut the honest answer is, there is no answer. It is almost impossible \nto explain to America's taxpayers why we are subsidizing the growth of \na product which we tell every American is dangerous when consumed.\n  How did we get in this predicament where we are subsidizing the \ngrowth and cultivation of tobacco in America? I would like to give a \nlittle history.\n  In the midst of the Great Depression in 1933, Congress responded to \nthe plight of farmers facing declining prices by passing the \nAgricultural Adjustment Act of 1933. This was part of the New Deal \nlegislation. When that legislation did not help halt the devastation \nspreading throughout the vast rural areas of our Nation, Congress in \n1938 passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, and in that act, \ntobacco price support programs were born. The legislation also created \nfarm programs for a wide variety of other crops.\n  Over the years since then, we have changed and, in effect, totally \noverturned those supply control programs for almost every crop. Only a \nfew crops continue to enjoy a program that looks like the 1938 bill. \nOne of those select crops is tobacco.\n  The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 also created the Federal Crop \nInsurance Corp. By 1945, tobacco and a number of other program crops \nenjoyed Federal crop insurance to protect farmers from unexpected crop \nlosses. The Crop Insurance Program has gone through many changes over \nthe years. The modern version of the program began in 1981, with a \nmajor reorganization, which I was part of, in 1994.\n  This year, for a farmer who has a typical crop insurance policy \ncovering up to 65 percent of the crop's anticipated revenue, the \nFederal Government, the taxpayers, will pay 41.7 percent of the total \npremium. That is the direct subsidy to the Crop Insurance Program. In \naddition, the administration of the program is subsidized.\n  Finally, if losses exceed what is anticipated, the Federal Government \nis, in fact, the insurance company of last resort, paying, for most \ncrops, the difference. This subsidy may make sense for many crops. It \nhelps bring some stability to the production of food and fiber that \nAmericans rely on. But this is the most important element.\n  Tobacco is not like any other crop in America. Tobacco is neither \nfood nor fiber. Tobacco is the only crop grown in America with a body \ncount. It is time we consider the health effects of tobacco in deciding \nwhether our Federal Government should continue to subsidize insurance \nfor this crop.\n  How different is tobacco? The tobacco crops that receive Federal \nassistance are processed into cigarettes and smokeless spit tobacco \nproducts that kill more than 400,000 Americans every year of cancer, \nheart disease, and a variety of other illnesses. These products also \ndisable hundreds of thousands of other Americans with emphysema and \nother respiratory illnesses.\n  Many of my colleagues will argue, ``Why do you single out tobacco? \nFor goodness sakes, these farmers are growing crops just like other \nfarmers.'' These are not crops like other crops. Tobacco is different. \nEvery day, 3,000 children in America become regular smokers for the \nfirst time. During their lifetime, around 30 of these 3,000 kids will \nbe murdered, around 60 will die in a car crash, and around 1,000 of \nthese kids, one in three, will die of smoking-related diseases.\n  Supporters of the tobacco program will argue that cutting off Federal \ncrop insurance isn't going to stop kids from smoking. Well, that is \ntrue, but the issue really goes beyond children and smoking. We have a \nproduct here that has no benefit to human health. None. Not even if \nused in moderation. Every other crop insured by the taxpayers of this \nNation and subsidized by this Government offers benefits, nutrition, \nprotein, calories, fiber, every other crop except tobacco.\n  We are talking here about a product that the owner of one of our \nNation's cigarette companies finally admitted this week under oath is \naddictive. Bennett LeBow, owner of the Liggett Group, admitted--finally \nadmitted--that smoking causes cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and \nsmoking is addictive.\n  This is not a news flash for most Americans, but we all remember, \nwith a sense of shame, the seven tobacco company executives testifying \nbefore the U.S. House of Representatives, standing under oath saying \nthat their product was not addictive.\n  Well, we have come a long way. Because tobacco and the nicotine in \ntobacco is addictive, many tobacco users find it almost impossible to \nquit. They are then set on a path for life that often ends in death.\n  So the issue before us today is: Should the Federal Government be \nsubsidizing this crop? Should we, with our tax dollars, subsidize \ntobacco?\n\n  Last year, the Government spent $97 million on a variety of taxpayer-\nsupported tobacco subsidies. This chart illustrates the Federal tobacco \nsubsidies. When my colleagues argue there is no Federal subsidy, they \nshould consider the real evidence before us.\n  In 1993, Federal taxpayers gave $65 million of Federal tax money to \nthe growers and cultivators of tobacco.\n  In 1994, the figure was $60 million.\n  In 1995, $51 million.\n  In 1996, $97 million.\n  And it is estimated this year that we will spend $67 million to \nsubsidize tobacco. At a time when we are gripped in a national debate \nabout the devastation this product causes, we continue, through our \nFederal Treasury, to send millions of dollars to the tobacco growers. \nAt a time when we are cutting back on basic education and health \nprograms in the name of balancing the budget, for some reason, we can \nfind the wherewithal and the political strength to divert $67 million \nto the cultivation and growth of tobacco.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the tobacco-related \nexpenditures for the current fiscal year will be about $67 million. \nWhat does this consist of? Thirty-nine million dollars is for crop \ninsurance losses; $9 million for crop insurance administration. That is \na $48 million crop insurance subsidy for tobacco.\n\n[[Page S7903]]\n\n  So that you understand, the tobacco growers pay premiums for crop \ninsurance, and then when they have a bad year and they file their \nclaims saying, ``Our crops didn't come in as we expected,'' the \npremiums they pay are insufficient to cover their losses. Any other \ninsurance company would go out of business at that point. Not the \nFederal Government. We step in and say, ``Let's open the Treasury; \nlet's make up the difference.''\n  This chart tries to demonstrate specifically, when it comes to crop \ninsurance subsidies, what we have been paying, what the net crop \ninsurance losses have been each year, and you will see that these \nlosses are substantial.\n  The administration of the program is also expensive ranging from \nabout $5.5 million a year to over $11 million a year, money paid by \ntaxpayers to subsidize crop insurance for tobacco.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office has produced an official estimate \nthat ending access to the crop insurance program and the noninsured \ncrop disaster assistance program for tobacco would save us at least--at \nleast--$34 million for the next year, and beyond that perhaps even \nmore.\n  I am offering this amendment today with my colleague, Republican \nSenator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. Tobacco issues have always been \nbipartisan issues, as they should be. Our amendment will prohibit the \nFederal Government from providing crop insurance for tobacco.\n  For consistency, the amendment also prohibits payments for tobacco \nunder the noninsured disaster assistance program, a new, surrogate risk \nmanagement program created in the 1996 farm bill.\n  Federal taxpayers paid around $80 million in net tobacco crop \ninsurance costs in 1996, including premium subsidies and overhead \nadministrative costs. These costs have exceeded $29 million in every \nyear since fiscal year 1993.\n  There are all the speeches given by all of the Members of Congress of \nboth political parties protesting what the tobacco companies are doing \nand how tobacco is devastating the American population, notwithstanding \neach year we fork over millions and millions of dollars to promote the \nproduct that causes all this death and disease.\n  Now, who supports our effort with this amendment? It has been \nendorsed by a wide variety of health groups and spending watchdog \ngroups, including the Action on Smoking and Health, the American Cancer \nSociety, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, \nFriends of the Earth, the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, Public \nCitizen, Taxpayers for Common Sense, and the U.S. Public Interest \nResearch Group.\n  The most common response from the tobacco side is, ``You got it all \nwrong, Senator. You just don't understand. Tobacco pays its own way.'' \nThe so-called no-net-cost program was for many years tobacco's defense \nwhenever we would raise these issues. This program, the so-called no-\nnet-cost tobacco price support program, is in fact the no-net-cost \nprogram by and large.\n  Our amendment does not touch the program, so this program will \ncontinue. Those farmers who can and want to participate in it will be \nallowed to do so, at their own expense, not at the taxpayers' expense.\n  In each of the last several years, the Department of Agriculture \nspending on tobacco-related programs has cost about $50 million.\n  We want to make certain that, as we get into this program, the facts \nare clear. There are some who will say, ``Why are you picking on \ntobacco? We insure a lot of crops in the United States.'' You know, \nthat is a fact. Here is a list, a partial list--we think there may be \nsome more--of about 67 crops that are covered by Federal crop \ninsurance. They run the gamut from almonds to wheat. Corn, of course, \nis in there, and soybeans, and so many other products which are used by \nAmericans nationwide. We have decided, as a nation, that for these 67 \ncrops, we will provide crop insurance.\n  The defenders of tobacco crop insurance will say, ``Well, wait a \nminute. If you're going to provide crop insurance for all these crops, \nwhy don't you provide it for tobacco?'' I have tried to make the public \nhealth case here that tobacco is different. But just to put in \nperspective the fact that there are many things grown, cultivated and \nraised in America in the name of agriculture and aquaculture which are \nnot insured, I would like to offer the following charts of crops not \ncovered by Federal crop insurance.\n  Forgive me if I do not read them because, honestly, we do not have \nthe time. But as you can see in chart after chart--I am going to run \nout of space here if I am not careful--chart after chart, we have lists \nof crops grown by farmers across the United States for which there is \nno crop insurance.\n  In fact, these farmers are on their own. If they should happen to be \ngrowing seeds, as we have in this one chart here, or shrubs, for that \nmatter, and they have a bad year, there is a drought or a flood, it is \ntheir own luck, maybe their own bad luck.\n  The final chart here wraps it up. Trust me. There are about 1,600 \ndifferent crops ranging all the way from watermelons to sod and shrubs \nand so many other things that are not insured by the Federal \nGovernment. Among the more than 1,000 commodities not eligible are \nhoney, broccoli, watermelon, cantaloupes, squash, cherries, cucumbers, \nsnow peas, even livestock for that matter.\n  Our crop insurance restriction does not single out tobacco for unique \ntreatment. It says that tobacco will not be in that special category of \n67 insured crops but will be in the other category of about 1,600 crops \nand other things raised by America's farmers and ranchers which are not \nprotected, and I think for good reason.\n  There is also a complaint that I am hurting small tobacco farmers \nwith this amendment. Not a single farmer will lose a job because of \nthis bill. This legislation does not affect crop insurance policies for \nthe current crop year. The legislation does not affect the tobacco \nprice support program or Federal extension services. Farmers will still \nbe eligible to participate in the program at their own expense and sell \ntobacco to their customers.\n\n  Tobacco farming--and we will hear a lot about small tobacco farmers \neking out a living--is one of the most lucrative forms of agriculture \nin America. Gross receipts for tobacco are around $4,000 per acre. We \nwill be told about little mom and pop operations scraping by for \ngrocery money raising tobacco. I am sure that can be the case, but keep \nin mind that people who are growing tobacco are netting per acre \nsubstantially more than any other legal crop grown in America.\n  For an acre of corn, you are lucky to bring out gross receipts of \n$300 to $400; for tobacco, $4,000. For an acre of wheat, gross receipts \nof $200 or less; for tobacco, $4,000 per acre. Data from the USDA \nindicates that net receipts from an acre of tobacco averaged between \n$450 and $1,100 per acre. According to one of my colleagues, farmers \ncan get $1,844 in net profit from a net acre of tobacco compared to \n$100 for soybeans.\n  The value of the Federal crop insurance subsidy to tobacco farmers \naverages less than $100 per acre. So the question is, if a farmer is \ngoing to get $1,800 in profit off tobacco per acre, will he go out of \nbusiness with a new additional cost of $100? I think not.\n  Can farmers replace this insurance? There is the private insurance \nmarket that they can turn to. It is not offered now because the Federal \nGovernment subsidizes crop insurance for tobacco. But insurance \ncompanies have never shied away from potentially lucrative new markets. \nWe do expect, though, that farmers will have to pay their own way. \nTobacco farmers will have to pay premiums which will match their \nlosses. But this amendment, in ending the Federal subsidy for tobacco \ncrop insurance, does not end the opportunity to buy insurance.\n  There has been an argument made that this will hurt minority farmers \nwho will not be able to get loans to grow tobacco if they do not have \ncrop insurance. This amendment will merely put these tobacco farmers in \nthe same position as all of the farmers who currently grow crops not \ncovered by crop insurance. The private insurance market will be \nexpected to step in and provide this insurance.\n  Furthermore, in May 1997, the USDA published a study of ``limited-\nresource farmers,'' which includes many minority farmers. According to \nthis report:\n\n       Results of the research indicate that socially \n     disadvantaged, small, and limited-opportunity operators tend \n     not to purchase\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\n     crop insurance nor to participate in insurance-type programs \n     operated by the USDA.\n\n  Some will argue we should not be doing this today because there is a \ntobacco settlement that is being debated. This settlement, I hope, is \ngoing to be enacted this year. But it may not be this year, it may be \nnext year, it may be even longer.\n  As currently written, the proposed settlement does not address the \ncrop insurance issue or any other issues related to tobacco subsidies. \nThe farmers were not at the table--and I am sure this will be pointed \nout by one of my colleagues--during this negotiation for the tobacco \nsettlement.\n  This amendment is outside the scope of the proposed settlement, and \nwe can address this issue separately without getting into the complex \nissues raised by the proposed settlement.\n  Another argument is this will open the floodgates for foreign tobacco \nif we do not continue to provide this Federal subsidy, that the \ndomestic tobacco market will suffer and foreigners will come in to take \ntheir place.\n  This amendment will not put domestic tobacco farmers out of business. \nIt will not significantly raise the price of tobacco, which makes only \na small part of the cost of a pack of cigarettes. The value of tobacco \nin a pack of cigarettes is estimated to be 10 cents. You know what \npeople pay for those things? Two, three dollars and more per pack. So \nthere is no reason to expect tobacco companies to change in any way the \namount of tobacco they purchase from U.S. farmers.\n  Furthermore, we currently have a tariff rate quota in place for \ntobacco which restricts the amount of tobacco that can be imported. \nPrevious Congresses have already prohibited USDA funding for tobacco-\nrelated research and export assistance.\n  This legislation takes another important step to make our \nagricultural policies more consistent with our health policies \nregarding tobacco. I called this amendment for a vote last year in the \nHouse of Representatives, and it came within two votes of passage. It \nis my understanding it will be offered again this year. In 1992, \nhowever, the House voted 331-82 to add an amendment to the ag \nappropriations bill to prohibit the use of Market Promotion Program \nexport assistance for tobacco. This amendment was accepted by the \nSenate and became law.\n  In 1993, the ag appropriations bill extended this policy to all \nexport assistance programs. In 1994, the same bill extended the \nprohibition on tobacco assistance to USDA's research program.\n  This legislation adds crop insurance and noninsured crop disaster \nassistance to the list of programs for which tobacco assistance is \nexcluded.\n  Mr. President, I know that this amendment is controversial. Every \ntobacco issue that I have raised in the House and the Senate has been \ncontroversial. But I believe this is the right thing to do. If we make \nthis decision today, we will be able to go back to our States and \ndistricts and in good conscience say to the voters that we got the \nmessage, that we have on the one hand said that tobacco is dangerous \nfor Americans and we have on the other hand said our subsidy will be \nended.\n  Putting an end to this Federal subsidy for tobacco reflects the \nreality of the national debate today. I believe that this amendment \nwhich Senator Gregg and I have offered is a step in the right direction \nto make our tax policy and our subsidy policy consistent with our \npublic health policy.\n  At this point I will yield for a question to my cosponsor of the \namendment, Mr. Gregg, or if he would like to seek time on his own, I \nwill yield back the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator from Illinois yielding and \ncongratulate him on this amendment, on which I join him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Illinois yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be joining with my \ncolleague from Illinois today in this amendment to correct what is an \nobvious inconsistency, to put it in conservative terms, in American \npublic policy.\n  I think there is a general consensus now in this Nation that the use \nof tobacco is unfortunate, that we wish to discourage its use, \nespecially amongst young people, and that as a government we are trying \ndesperately to inform people of the harm of tobacco to their health and \nthe addictive nature of tobacco and the fact that there is very little \npositive that comes from smoking tobacco.\n  We have had innumerable Surgeon Generals, including the great Surgeon \nGeneral Dr. Koop, point out this problem as a matter of Federal public \npolicy. We now have a commitment by this administration, and I believe \nby this Congress, to try to change the manner in which tobacco is \nmarketed in this country, especially to the young people, so that we \ncan lessen the impact of this harmful addiction on America and \nespecially on our young.\n  Yet at the same time that we are doing this, at the same time that as \na matter of Federal policy, as presented by the Surgeon General, as \npresented by the Congress, as presented by the administration, at the \nsame time that we are pointing out as a matter of Federal policy that \nthe use of tobacco is harmful and bad and it has a deleterious effect \non health and a very dramatically negative impact on the financial \nsituation of this Nation because of its costs in the area of health \ncosts, at that same time we are subsidizing the capacity of the product \nto be grown. It makes no sense at all.\n  This amendment will save $34 million, but it is hardly the money that \nis important here. It is the statement of public policy that is \nimportant. The fact is that, if this Government is going to subsidize \nthe growing of tobacco at the same time it is claiming tobacco is a \nscourge on the health of this country, we are sending two messages \nwhich are totally inconsistent and inappropriate.\n  Now, the insurance program, as it is presently structured, is a \nprogram which basically puts the grower of tobacco in a unique \nposition, the position where essentially there is a no-loss situation \nwhere the Federal Government comes in and assures that the grower, \nwhether tobacco grows or not, whether tobacco is brought to market or \nnot, is able to recover the value of the tobacco.\n  This type of a fail-safe situation makes little sense for any \ncommodity, but it certainly does not make any sense for a commodity \nwhich has already been declared a detriment to the health of America \nand especially to the health of children. More importantly, it is not \nneeded. It is not even needed.\n\n  Tobacco is a very lucrative crop. In fact, compared to other crops, \ntobacco is dramatically more profitable than other crops. I have a \nchart which reflects that fact, which I will not subject you to because \nthis floor gets enough charts, but essentially tobacco crops as a cash \ncrop per acre generate approximately $3,700, whereas wheat, for \nexample, on a per acre basis generates about $134 and corn on a per \nacre basis represents about $322. So tobacco is generating 10 times the \nvalue of corn and many times the value of wheat.\n  It hardly seems a crop which is so lucrative would need to have a \nFederal insurance program to guarantee it, but we do have that program, \nand that program costs about $34 million a year. Thus, this amendment, \nwhich will put an end to that type of an insurance program, which is, \nfirst, not needed because the crop itself is viable on its own, \nregrettably, but it is viable on its own at such high value that it \nshould not be protected by this type of insurance program; but, second, \nan insurance program which flies in the face of the public policy of \nthe Government generally, especially public policy as stated by the \nSurgeon General, the President, and this administration, that that type \nof program should be ended.\n  So this amendment ends it. It is about time we did that. It is \ncertainly consistent with the direction which this Congress is moving \nand this Government is moving and the American people are moving \nrelative to the use of tobacco and the harm that it is causing in the \narea of health in this country.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Illinois for bringing forward this \namendment. I am happy to join him in it, and I hope that the Members of \nthe Senate will support it.\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, there is no time agreement on this \namendment, as I understand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. And there will not be for a while.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of tobacco bashing going on and I \nunderstand that better than anybody in this Chamber. An agreement that \nhas been negotiated--and my good friend from Illinois, even though we \ndisagree on this, we are friends, understands--that negotiation is \ncontinuing and we will be called upon to make the ultimate decision as \nto whether that negotiated package will fly, will be passed, worked \nout, whatever.\n  Many parts of that negotiated agreement take care of everything that \nhas been said by my two colleagues, except the farmer. The farmer was \nnever at the table. You say you will hear a lot about protecting \nfarmers, the little farm. You are darn right; you will hear a lot about \nit. They were not at the table, they were not considered, and so \ntherefore, here we come, bashing the farmer again.\n  You say it is a lucrative crop. Well, let's look at something here. \nKentucky's average farm size is 159 acres. The average farm size of \nIllinois is 370--that is the difference. Kentucky's average gross \nincome per farm is $42,000 and the net to that farm is $11,000. The \nIllinois average gross income per farm is $128,000, three times what \nKentucky's average farm income is, and their gross profit is more than \ndouble, $25,000 net profit. That is an Illinois farm compared to a \nKentucky farm.\n  We talk about the gross net profit from one crop which is about an \nacre, 1 acre, you get $1,800. But the farmer has to be considered. The \npackage has not. I am trying to figure out a way that I can be flat so \nwhen the steamroller comes, it won't hurt. But it is another attack on \nthe tobacco farmer, even though there is no tobacco subsidy--no tobacco \nsubsidy, and I underscore that.\n  Tobacco farmers participate--and my friend from Illinois said it--\nparticipate in a price support system that is completely paid for. In \nfact, tobacco farmers are unique in that they actually contribute \nmillions of dollars each year toward deficit reduction--$31 million \nlast year. There is not another crop or another farmer that is assessed \nto pay money into the general fund for deficit reduction.\n  Last year, the tobacco farmer alone paid over $31 million. I hear \nyour loss is only 34--maybe it is only 3, because the farmer is paying \nalmost all of that in an assessment for every pound he sells, and that \nis deducted from his check before he gets it, before he goes to the \nbank to pay his loan. Crop insurance is not a subsidy. It is not a \nsubsidy. It is not unique to tobacco. The Durbin amendment does not hit \nthe tobacco companies.\n  We hear all about the health. This amendment will not stop one person \nfrom smoking. What it will do is ensure that tobacco farmers will \nslowly but surely go out of business. That is what they want. Tobacco \nis a culture and it will take a while.\n  Before we became a nation, if you want to read history, it said that \nMr. Jones came for his spring planting, his seed for his spring \nplanting, and he paid for it with some of the finest tobacco I have \never seen. Tobacco was money. Referring to the Mother State, Virginia, \nthe pages of Virginia history are splattered with tobacco juice. So \ntobacco has been here for a long, long time.\n\n  Over 60 percent, Mr. President, of every acre farmed in the United \nStates is covered by crop insurance, and the number is higher for \nindividual crops. Corn: 85 percent of every acre is covered by crop \ninsurance. Sugar beets: 89 percent of every acre grown is covered. \nWheat: 90 percent of every acre grown is covered by crop insurance. \nCotton: 94 percent is covered by crop insurance.\n  Farmers will tell you what tobacco farmers know--all of these farmers \nwill. Without crop insurance, there is no farm. That is because without \ncrop insurance, banks will not make loans to growers for their farming \noperations. Farmers in my State do not just borrow money to grow \ntobacco, they borrow money to grow other crops. Their average income is \n$25,000, and their net profit is $11,000. But they would not have that \nif they could not get the crop insurance to lay down to the banker to \nsupport the loan.\n  No legitimate lender--and I say that, legitimate lender--will take \nthe risk of lending to an uninsured operation. You cannot even borrow \nmoney on a house without an insurance policy, and there will not be a \nprivate-sector substitute for crop insurance, either. Talk about \nprivate sector. One of the reasons the USDA extends crop insurance to a \nparticular crop is because a private-sector alternative does not exist. \nYou say, ``Go out and get insurance.'' Well, you can't go out and get \nit; it doesn't exist. You can get hail insurance on tobacco at 7 \npercent of the loss. That is all you get from private carriers. I used \nto do it, I understand it.\n  This is what the American Association of Crop Insurers say:\n\n       Privately, underwriting multiple peril insurance has been \n     tried in the past and it has failed miserably. This is true \n     for tobacco, as well. Hail, the only peril wholly privately \n     underwritten, accounts for less than 7 percent of crop losses \n     in tobacco-growing States. The private sector would be \n     incapable of insuring the remaining 93 percent risk of loss \n     on a multiple peril universal base without some form of \n     catastrophic reinsurance from the Government, but while there \n     is no farm without crop insurance, discriminating against \n     tobacco farmers won't do anything to reduce tobacco use.\n\n  Won't do anything to reduce tobacco use.\n  Crop insurance doesn't promote increased use of tobacco any more than \nautomobile insurance promotes an increase in car sales. The bottom line \nof the Durbin amendment is this: American farmers go out of business \nand whole communities in the South die. The big tobacco companies \ncontinue to make and sell cigarettes. While communities die, the \nmanufacturers continue to make and sell cigarettes. If we are going to \ntalk about making changes to the crop insurance system, it should not \ntarget the family farmer.\n  Before we get through, I will have a second-degree amendment to the \namendment of the Senator from Illinois. My second-degree amendment \nwould reform the crop insurance to make sure it supports family farms, \nnot corporate farms. Let me repeat that. My second-degree amendment \nwould reform the crop insurance to make sure it supports family \nfarmers, not corporate farms. I'm prepared to fight this battle. If we \nare going to be changing crop insurance, I am prepared to offer second-\ndegree after second-degree to make sure the changes are comprehensive \nand don't single out a commodity or a single type of farmer, because \nthat is what the Durbin amendment does: It singles out one commodity \ngrown in one part of the country by one type of farmer, a small family \nfarmer.\n  Now, Mr. President, we just heard my friend from Illinois talk about \nthe loss from tobacco insurance. Well, stand back. Here are all the \nlosses from other crops. Wheat, since 1984, $288.7 million lost to the \nFederal Government--a subsidy to wheat farmers. I don't believe you \nwould vote today to do away with crop insurance for the wheat farmer, \nbecause you say it is health. Well, everything Kentucky farmers or \nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, or Tennessee farmers grow--\neven Wisconsin farmers grow tobacco--they get insurance. But they \nborrow money and insure other crops. Think about almonds. That was the \nvery first one the Senator said--almonds. Almost $50 million in loss to \nthe Federal Government. That is a lot more than tobacco. We could go \ndown the list. Grain sorghum. I don't know where grain sorghum comes \nfrom--maybe from Illinois, maybe Wyoming, I don't know. But they lost \n$36.1 million. So we can get into even sunflowers lost, which is $22 \nmillion.\n\n  These are losses to other crops, and my friend would not vote to \nreduce the loss on wheat or almonds or barley or grain sorghum or these \nothers, but he would on tobacco because he says tobacco is dangerous.\n  I am trying to help. I am trying to work out a package. I am trying \nto help negotiate. I have listened in every meeting. I have been to \nevery meeting and we even had one group yesterday that the only thing \nthey want in the negotiated agreement is some way to eliminate the \naddiction. That is fine. The biggest argument in the tobacco negotiated \npackage will be what percentage of that package the trial lawyers are \ngoing to get. That will be most\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\ncontentious. It is not in there. That is to be negotiated yet.\n  The result of this elimination of the ability to secure crop \ninsurance will be devastating to the farmers in my area. Yet, this is \nnot the biggest loss to agriculture crop insurance. Mr. President, I \nhave a letter from the Department of Agriculture addressed to Senator \nThad Cochran, chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations, \nand I read just a couple of items. There were 89,000 tobacco growers--\n89,000 tobacco growers--with crop insurance policies in 1996. Tobacco \ngrowers in three States--North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia--\nreceived $77.8 million in indemnities for losses due to back-to-back \nhurricanes that hit the east coast last year. These funds helped \ncommunities recover from disaster and were paid for in part by the \nproducers themselves.\n  The significance of a program that encourages producers to assess \ntheir individual risk management needs and allows them to pay part of a \ncost for coverage must not be lost at a time when fewer dollars--fewer \ndollars--are available for other types of assistance. Elimination of \ntobacco crop insurance would place a greater burden on other sources of \nrelief. So when you take it away from one place, you place the burden \non other sources in case of a hurricane or tornado or flood.\n  But if you have insurance, that lifts the burden from these other \nareas that hasn't been offset in your figure here yet. The $77 million \npaid last year in three States hasn't been offset from the $34 million. \nSo it makes a little bit of difference, I think, when you look at it in \nthe true light. This idea of me crying crocodile tears for the small \nfarmer, if that's what it takes, I will give you 30 minutes to draw a \ncrowd to stop this amendment. This amendment is absolutely no different \nand the speech is no different than it was in 1992 or 1993 or 1994, or \nwhenever it was.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will understand that, yes, we \ngrow tobacco in Kentucky, yes, we grow a little corn, a little \nsoybeans, a little wheat. We do the things that other small farmers do. \nI want you to remember that the farms in Illinois are almost three \ntimes as large as my average farm, and the net income to the farmer in \nthe State of Illinois is more than twice what my farmers' net income \nwould be. Yet, they do grow tobacco.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor soon so my colleague \nfrom Kentucky can have some time. But I want to make one final point. \nThe distinguished Senator from Illinois said that all these other crops \nare not covered. I think about 1,600, something like that. First, they \nhaven't petitioned the Federal Government for it. They haven't asked to \nparticipate. A lot of them have private insurance. So you have to be in \na position of requesting it before the Government will consider it. I \ndon't believe they have petitioned. So it's a little bit unusual.\n  We don't get anything in tobacco as it relates to the farm bill--not \na dime. Corn gets crop insurance, and we have lost over $288 million. \nYet, they get a check every year as a subsidy. They don't even have to \ngrow it. That is what we call back in Kentucky a mailbox job. Just go \nout to the mailbox and get your check. Everybody lost that. So for \nevery acre that they have and they signed up, they get a check every \nyear for so much per acre, whether they grow it or not. The tobacco \nfarmer doesn't get that.\n  So there is a bit of fairness here, I think, that ought to be given. \nAs we work through the problems of the tobacco industry, we need to be \nsure that we understand that those who grow tobacco are just as human, \njust as religious, just as American, just as needy, just as hard \nworking as the farmers that grow wheat or corn or granola or whatever. \nThey are good Americans. I can take you anywhere in my State, in any \ntown where we have a circle with a courthouse. Usually, on that \ncourthouse is a monument of some kind to those tobacco farmers who gave \ntheir lives for this country in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and \nthe Persian Gulf.\n\n  So, let's try to work through this and understand that the people I \nrepresent have no control, basically, over what we are doing here. We \nare after the manufacturers, but we are getting at the farmer. Somehow, \nsome way, we ought not make a farmer in my State who will net $1,800 \noff of an acre, which is labor intensive, to $4,000, and about half of \nthat is expense. There is not as much work in corn, soybeans, or \nothers. The weather works on all of them. But my people are just as \nhard working, just as sincere and, I think, need to be helped and \nlooked after just as anybody else.\n  This amendment, according to the Secretary of Agriculture, would have \na particular detrimental effect on thousands of small farmers in \ntobacco-producing States, not to mention the toll it would take on the \neconomic stability of many rural communities. Just let me read that one \nsentence again. This amendment would have a particularly detrimental \neffect on thousands of small farmers in tobacco-producing States, not \nto mention the toll it would take on the economic stability of many \nrural communities.\n  An overwhelming majority of crop insurance policies in this area are \nsold to small farmers. It seems to me, rather than to cut the cord of \neconomic stability on the farmer to get after something else, we ought \nto be sure that that farmer has an opportunity, and we will get around \nto others.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I congratulate my friend and colleague \nfrom Kentucky, Senator Ford, for his statement on behalf of the tobacco \ngrowers of our State.\n  Mr. President, the Durbin amendment is not directed at the tobacco \ncompanies; it's directed at the tobacco farmer. We don't have many big \nfarmers in my State. We have about 60,000 tobacco growers in 119 of our \n120 counties. They are everywhere. And the average base in Kentucky, \nMr. President, is about an acre.\n  The profile of a typical tobacco farm family in Kentucky:\n  The husband probably works in the factory, the wife probably works in \na cut-and-sew plant. They tend to their 1 acre of burley tobacco, and \nthey sell it in the November and December auction, which provides for \nChristmas money and, for a lot of families, a lot more than Christmas \nmoney--Christmas plus a lot of other things they need for their \nfamilies during the course of the year.\n  Now, the Durbin amendment seeks to drive these tobacco farmers out of \nbusiness, as if somehow, if you drove the tobacco farmers out of \nbusiness, there would not be any more tobacco grown. Of course, it \nwould be grown. It would just be grown by others. It would be grown in \nbig corporate farms of hundreds of thousands of acres under contract \nwith the companies.\n  So bear in mind, my colleagues, you do nothing to terminate the \ngrowth of tobacco by driving the little tobacco grower out of business. \nIt serves no useful purpose. Tobacco is going to be grown. It is going \nto be grown in this country, overseas, and already is grown in \nvirtually a great many countries in the world. It is going to be grown, \nand nobody is proposing to make it illegal. The only issue before us, \nMr. President, is who grows it? Who grows it? The tobacco program, \nwhich the tobacco growers themselves and the companies pay for at no \nnet cost to the Government, guarantees that the production is in a \nwhole lot of hands. In the case of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, it is \nin over 60,000 hands.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment prohibits tobacco farmers from obtaining \nFederal crop insurance, as well as disaster payments. That is clearly \ndirected at the farmer, the grower, not at the companies. The companies \nare going to get their tobacco, Mr. President. They are either going to \nget it from large corporate farmers under contract, or they will get it \noverseas. But they will get their tobacco, even if the 1-acre burley \ngrower in Kentucky that Senator Ford and I represent is out of business \nand a whole lot poorer.\n  Currently, 1,500 crops are eligible for disaster payments under the \nnoninsured assistance program. These are crops that are already \neligible for traditional crop insurance. Therefore, if Senator Durbin's \namendment passed, in a natural disaster most small tobacco farmers \nwould simply not be able\n\n[[Page S7907]]\n\nto recover their losses, putting them out of business. That is why I \nsay--and as Senator Ford has said--this is an amendment directed at the \nfarmer and not at the companies.\n  We have been plagued in Kentucky this year by natural disasters, as \nmany other areas have as well, and with every other unpredictable \nelement that farmers have to deal with--disease, labor, incredibly high \nexpenses. Imagine that we would take away their only meager defense \nagainst Mother Nature just because they farm a legal commodity. It is \nsimply unfair.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Illinois prevents many small- and \nmedium-sized farmers from receiving protection against what could be \ncatastrophic risks. Farmers may invest up to $2,800 per acre growing \ntobacco. Many of them do. A natural disaster--a loss of this \nmagnitude--simply could not be overcome. So we are talking here about \nfarmers who depend on their income from this crop.\n  Additionally, it is important to note that banks and lending \ninstitutions will find it difficult to approve loans for farmers who \ncannot obtain crop insurance. So we come down to the real issue here.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment unfairly singles out tobacco farmers and \ntobacco-farming communities who grow a legal crop simply to try to get \nat the tobacco companies. Eliminating crop insurance for tobacco \nfarmers does nothing to stop growing of tobacco or punish cigarette \ncompanies. The only individuals injured are those who can least afford \nit, those closest to the poverty level, and those most likely to be \nunable to find or afford alternative private insurance.\n  There is a lot of discussion about alternative private insurance. I \ndon't think my typical grower with a 2,500-pound base is going to be \nable to afford to do that and still purchase that, and still grow the \ncrop profitably. This amendment is not going to stop people from \nsmoking. It will only hurt U.S. tobacco growers for whom tobacco pays \nthe bills--not the big companies.\n  Tobacco farming, as we all know, is the starting point of over $15 \nbillion that goes to Federal, State, and local governments in tax \nrevenue, and contributes an additional $6 billion to the U.S. balance \nof trade. That is a $6 billion positive balance of trade.\n  By ignoring the need for disaster relief for the tobacco farmers, the \nprecedent is being set for the elimination of crop insurance for other \nmajor commodities.\n  In 1994, we passed a law to end ad hoc disaster programs and have \ncrop insurance be the primary risk management tool for farmers.\n  By ignoring the need for disaster relief for just one set of \nfarmers--tobacco farmers who suffer natural disasters in the same \nmanner that corn, wheat, soybean, and other farmers do--a precedent is \nbeing set to eliminate crop insurance for other commodities.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Ford has pointed out, Secretary Glickman is \nopposed to this amendment. The Farm Credit Council is opposed to this \namendment. And the American Association of Crop Insurers is opposed as \nwell.\n  Crop insurance is to protect families. That is what crop insurance is \nabout: Helping to minimize the financial interruptions to their plans \nand lifestyles due to crop losses.\n  These are families who usually work two jobs, as I suggested earlier. \nIn my State, these are not rich farmers. We are talking about people \nwho cultivate about an acre of tobacco on the side, in addition to \ntheir normal sources of income. These farmers aren't in a business \nwhere they have excess amounts of money in savings. Everything is \ncalculated, and income from tobacco is relied upon. By having crop \ninsurance, it gives farmers, bankers, and communities peace of mind \nthrough income stability and minimizing risk.\n  Crop insurance also provides farm lenders with collateral that helps \nminimize liens on other assets, obviously avoiding or reducing a \nfarmer's needs to rely on credit.\n  As I believe my colleague from Kentucky pointed out, Secretary \nGlickman said:\n\n       I am determined that everyone will have access to crop \n     insurance, large farmers and small farmers alike, especially \n     those with limited resources--minorities and producers--in \n     all areas of the country.\n\n  That certainly describes the 60,000 tobacco growers of Kentucky.\n  This amendment would have a particularly detrimental effect on \nthousands of small farmers in States like my own. An overwhelming \nmajority of crop insurance policies in this area are sold to small \nfarmers. Therefore, eliminating crop insurance for tobacco will not \nfulfill the Secretary's promise to poorer farmers. Rather, this \namendment is squarely in opposition to the Department's stated policy \nof fighting discrimination against minorities and economically \ndisadvantaged farmers.\n  Let me sum it up again. This amendment is directed at the farmer who \nis growing a legal crop. To the extent that this small farmer finds it \ndifficult to acquire crop insurance, the potential for disaster for \nthese small farm families is greatly enhanced.\n  The Durbin amendment does nothing to fight smoking. It does nothing \nto punish the companies. In fact, it is directed at the heart of the \nfarming areas in the southeastern part of the United States.\n  I repeat: The average grower in Kentucky has about 2,500 pounds. That \nis about 1 acre. You push that fellow out of business, and tobacco will \nstill be grown. It is going to be grown by big corporate farms. They \nare not going to be particularly concerned about this crop insurance \nissue. They do not have any trouble paying for it.\n  This amendment serves no useful purpose. If you want to fight \nsmoking, this amendment is only directed at low- and medium-income \nfarmers in places like the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Santorum]. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nAmerican Association of Crop Insurers, addressed to Chairman Ted \nStevens and Ranking Member Robert C. Byrd, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       American Association of\n\n                                                Crop Insurers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member: It has come to \n     our attention that an amendment may be offered to the Fiscal \n     Year 1998 Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Bill that would eliminate crop \n     insurance or any other form of government-supported disaster \n     aid for tobacco. We are writing to express the American \n     Association of Crop Insurers' (AACI's) opposition to such an \n     amendment as well as to dispel a principal myth underlying \n     the amendment.\n       AACI's membership consists of private insurance companies \n     who deliver Federally reinsured multiple peril crop insurance \n     to America's farmers as well as several thousand independent \n     agents and adjusters affiliated with those companies. All \n     AACI member companies are also involved in the private crop \n     hail insurance business as well. AACI member companies and \n     their affiliated agents collectively wrote over 80% of the \n     Federal crop insurance sold by private companies in 1996.\n       Providing risk management protection to American crop \n     producers is the sole reason that AACI member companies are \n     in the crop insurance business. As long as data are available \n     from which an actuarially sound insurance program can be \n     developed, the insurance industry does not discriminate \n     against crops that are insured nor the producers who grow \n     those crops. If Congress were to discriminate against tobacco \n     producers by denying them any form of Federal assistance \n     related to their risk management needs, we believe that the \n     economy of both the producers and the rural communities in \n     which they live could be placed at severe risk that one \n     disaster could substantially devastate. In addition, the \n     economic health of several of our members who have \n     considerable books of business in tobacco growing states \n     would also be put at risk.\n       While it is true that the number of crops covered by \n     Federal crop insurance is limited when compared with the \n     total number of crops grown in the country, most if not all \n     of the crops not currently insurable are covered by the \n     noninsured disaster assistance program or NAP administered by \n     the Farm Service Agency. However, both under existing law and \n     under the proposed amendment, tobacco would be ineligible for \n     such protection. This isolation among crops leaves the crop \n     and its producers totally exposed to the uncontrollable risk \n     of weather.\n       Some believe that this exposure could be covered by the \n     private sector without assistance from the Federal \n     Government. That is\n\n[[Page S7908]]\n\n     not true for several reasons. First, the main reason the \n     Federal Government is involved in crop insurance is due to \n     the catastrophic nature of crop disasters and the inability \n     of the private sector to bear that magnitude of loss. \n     Privately underwritten multiple peril insurance has been \n     tried in the past and it failed miserably. The inability of \n     the private sector to bear the risk of loss from multiple \n     perils is true for tobacco as well. Hail, the principal peril \n     wholly privately underwritten, accounts for less than 7% of \n     crop losses in tobacco-growing states. The private sector \n     would be incapable of insuring the remaining 93% risk of loss \n     on a multiple-peril, universal basis without some form of \n     catastrophic reinsurance from the government.\n       Second, if tobacco farmers were to bear the full cost of \n     the current policies, that cost would escalate from \n     approximately $54 an acre to over $125 per acre--a more than \n     100% increase--when administrative costs are added, risk-\n     based premium subsidies are removed, and some reinsurance \n     costs are included. There would be many producers who could \n     not afford those rates, especially the over 53,000 producers \n     holding catastrophic policies for which they paid a total of \n     $50, not $50 per acre.\n       Third, even if a private multiple peril tobacco policy was \n     developed, private companies would be unable to make it \n     universally available. Aside from it not being affordable to \n     a large number of producers, the catastrophic nature of the \n     risk would prevent companies from making it available to all \n     producers. Individual risks would have to be underwritten and \n     some risks would be denied insurance either directly or \n     through cost-prohibitive rates. This is unlike the Federal \n     program where companies must accept all insureds no matter \n     what the risk without any individual adjustment of rates \n     since the government sets the rates.\n       Providing risk management products to tobacco producers and \n     producers of other crops in tobacco growing states \n     constitutes a considerable source of income to a number of \n     rural crop insurance agents and crop adjusters in those \n     states. If crop insurance for tobacco were eliminated, that \n     may actually threaten the ability of these agents and \n     adjusters to stay in business thereby affecting insurance \n     availability for producers of other crops as well. This is \n     not to mention the impact on the rural community where the \n     agents, adjusters, and their support staff live and work.\n       As long as it is legal to grow a crop in this country and \n     there are actuarially sufficient data to provide insurance, \n     AACI members do not believe that the crop or its producers \n     should be discriminated against. Due to the inability of the \n     private sector to offer an affordable, universally available \n     private multiple peril insurance product on tobacco, there \n     remains a proper role for government involvement. We \n     encourage you to continue that role by rejecting any \n     amendment that may terminate that responsibility.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John E. Sheeley,\n                                                          Counsel.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I would like to put in the Record at this \npoint a letter from the Secretary of Agriculture to the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Senator Cochran, and \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Thad: I am writing concerning an amendment to the \n     fiscal year (FY) 1998 Agriculture Appropriations Act offered \n     by Senator Richard Durbin, which would prohibit the use of \n     funds to pay the salaries of personnel who provide crop \n     insurance or noninsured crop disaster assistance for tobacco \n     for the 1998 and later crop years.\n       The Department of Agriculture (USDA) opposes this \n     amendment. Crop insurance and noninsured crop disaster \n     assistance programs comprise the principal remaining ``safety \n     net'' for farmers suffering crop losses from natural \n     disasters, since the elimination of ad hoc disaster aid. The \n     adoption of this amendment will effectively end our ability \n     to provide crop insurance and noninsured assistance payments \n     for tobacco growers.\n       Crop insurance is an essential part of the producer \n     ``safety net'' envisioned by the Administration's \n     agricultural policy. There were some 89,000 tobacco growers \n     with crop insurance policies in 1996, of which 69,000 \n     actually planted the crop for the year. More than 550,000 \n     acres were insured with liability exceeding $1.15 billion. \n     Tobacco producers paid more than $20 million in premiums to \n     insure their crops in recognition of the need to provide for \n     their own risk management at a time when the Government is \n     providing fewer and fewer farm subsidies.\n       Tobacco growers in three States (North Carolina, South \n     Carolina, and Virginia) received $77.8 million in indemnities \n     for losses due to back-to-back hurricanes that hit the East \n     Coast last year. These funds helped communities recover from \n     disaster and were paid for in part by the producers \n     themselves. The significance of a program that encourages \n     producers to assess their individual risk management needs \n     and allows them to pay part of the cost for coverage must not \n     be lost at a time when fewer dollars are available for other \n     types of assistance. Elimination of tobacco crop insurance \n     would place a greater burden on other sources of relief when \n     disaster strikes.\n       This amendment would have a particularly detrimental effect \n     on thousands of small farmers in tobacco producing States, \n     not to mention the toll it would take on the economic \n     stability of many rural communities. An overwhelming majority \n     of crop insurance policies in this area are sold to small \n     farmers.\n       I urge you and your colleagues to vote against this \n     amendment when it is considered by the Senate. Please contact \n     me if you should need further information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Glickman,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 966 to Amendment No. 965\n\n      (Purpose: To limit Federal crop insurance to family farmers)\n\n  Mr. FORD. I send an amendment in the second degree to the Durbin \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 966 to amendment numbered 965.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     LIMITATION OF CROP INSURANCE TO FAMILY FARMERS.\n\n       Section 508(a) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1508(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) Crop insurance limitation.--\n       ``(A) In general.--To qualify for coverage under a plan of \n     insurance or reinsurance under this title, a person may not \n     own or operate farms with more than 400 acres of cropland.\n       ``(B) Definition of person.--The Corporation shall issue \n     regulations--\n       ``(i) defining the term `person' for purposes of \n     subparagraph (A): and\n       ``(ii) prescribing such rules as the Corporation determines \n     necessary to ensure a fair and reasonable application of the \n     limitation established under subparagraph (A).''.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, what I have done here, as I said earlier, is \nto try to make crop insurance more comprehensive. So what this does is, \nit says that any farm with more than 400 acres that can be farmed not \nbe eligible for crop insurance. The idea here is to let the corporate \nfarmers pay for themselves, and try to protect the small farmer.\n  So I think that this amendment will make it fairer. It protects the \nsmall farmers. The corporate farmers, then, the big farmers, those over \n400 acres of land that can be farmed--by the way, this does nothing out \nWest as far as grazing land. It doesn't touch that part of it at all. \nIt is land that can be farmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this may surprise my colleague from \nKentucky. I may support his amendment.\n  When I was chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, I was considered by many to be pretty tough on the Crop \nInsurance Program, even though, as the Senator from Kentucky has noted, \nI come from a corn-growing State, a State with soybeans, a State which \navails itself very much to a great extent in the Crop Insurance \nProgram. I don't disagree with anything that my colleague from Kentucky \nsaid about the Crop Insurance Program. There are indefensible subsidies \nin this program.\n  I think, if he is going to address an overall reform of crop \ninsurance, he may be surprised to find me as an ally. I had an \namendment which I offered 1 year in the appropriations subcommittee. If \nI recall it correctly, it said that if you have sustained losses in 7 \nout of the last 10 years on your crop, you would be ineligible for crop \ninsurance. I have this basic theory that if you couldn't grow a crop \nfor 7 out of 10 years, God was telling you something about your land, \nthat crop, or your talent, and that Uncle Sam and the Federal \nGovernment shouldn't be talking back to God in this instance and saying \nwe will continue to insure the crop.\n\n[[Page S7909]]\n\n  There were a lot of people critical of my amendment because they had \nworked out a very sweet deal where they would plant crops that could \nnever grow. It wasn't a sufficiently long growing season. But the crop \nwas eligible. They would make their application. Lo and behold, the \ncrop would fail again, and the Federal taxpayers would be asked to make \nup the difference.\n  So, if the Senator from Kentucky is suggesting some basic reform of \nthe Crop Insurance Program, I think I might be his ally. And if he is \ntalking about limiting crop insurance to smaller farms, I think he \nmight be surprised to find that we can work on that as well. But I \nthink, in all honesty, that this amendment might never have been \noffered if I had not started an amendment on tobacco crop insurance.\n  That is what this is about. It is not about reform of the crop \ninsurance. It is about tobacco. And the two Senators from Kentucky, \nwhom I respect very much, in defense of their State and its crop, have \nstood up and said, ``Why are you picking on us? Why do you single out \ntobacco?'' As one Senator from Kentucky said, tobacco is perfectly \nlegal. That is true. But tobacco is also perfectly lethal. Tobacco is a \nkiller. You have to eat an awful lot of corn and soybeans to die. But \nyou start smoking, get addicted, the chances are 1 out of 3 that it is \ngoing to kill you.\n  So, to the farmers who are growing it, who, for all intents and \npurposes and all appearances, look like any other farmer, what they are \nharvesting and what they are selling is devastating. For us to turn our \nbacks on it and to say it is just another crop is to ignore the \nobvious.\n  Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today--No. \n1. Sure, we are concerned about AIDS. Certainly we are concerned about \nhighway fatalities. Of course, we are concerned about violent crime. \nBut if you want to save American lives, the first stop is tobacco. Take \na look at what it does to us.\n  For my colleagues to stand up and say, ``It is just another farmer, \nit is just another agricultural product, why do you single us out,'' it \nis because it is the only crop, when used according to the \nmanufacturer's directions, will kill you. You can't smoke in \nmoderation. You start this addiction, and you will end up generally as \na statistic.\n  So, when I bring this amendment to the floor to talk about crop \ninsurance for tobacco, I can understand my colleagues from tobacco-\nproducing States. I can understand it completely. I have represented a \ncongressional district and a State which has its own interests, and I \nhave try to defend those interests. I think that is part of my \nresponsibility.\n  But I say to my colleagues who are viewing this debate and making up \ntheir own mind: Make no mistake, tobacco is not just another product. \nCrop insurance for tobacco is a blatant contradiction that we would \npiously pronounce through the Surgeon General's office and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that this crop is a killer, \nthat these tobacco products are claiming lives--even innocent victims \nlike these flight attendants who are now suing down in Florida who \nhappened to be exposed to secondhand smoke. Their lives were in \njeopardy, too. We know this. We concede this. We advertise this. We \nspend millions of dollars to police this industry because we know what \nthey are doing. They are addicting our children, and they are killing \nour fellow citizens.\n\n  That is why it is totally inconsistent for us to be in a position \nwhere year after year we are plowing millions of taxpayer dollars \ncollected from people across the United States into the subsidy--\nunderline the word ``subsidy''--of tobacco growers.\n  I just marvel when my colleagues get up. We can argue a lot of this \non the merits. But it takes my breath away to hear these colleagues \nstand up and say that there is no tobacco subsidy.\n  Let me go back to this Federal tobacco subsidy chart.\n  There is this tobacco subsidy: $65 million in 1993; $60 million in \n1994; $51 million in 1995. In 1996, when I first took on this issue, \nthey estimated our losses would be about the same--$50 million. They \nwent to $97 million, and then in 1997 the estimate was $67 million.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. FORD. I am sure he will be able to answer this and make me look \nbad. But this is just on crop insurance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is on crop insurance and administering the program.\n  Mr. FORD. Administration of the program.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think there are two or three other small, related \nareas.\n  Mr. FORD. This is just tobacco.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is true.\n  Mr. FORD. What about the $77 million that went to the hurricanes in \nNorth and South Carolina and Virginia that was paid and helped the \ncommunities or they would have taken the money out of some other fund \nas it relates to disasters?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't believe that these figures include any national \ndisaster assistance of that nature. It is strictly related to crop \ninsurance.\n  Mr. FORD. Is the money in the premiums in your figures here paid by \nthe farmer--deducted, and this is the net?\n  Mr. DURBIN. What this represents is the net cost to the Federal \nTreasury.\n  Mr. FORD. Just for that. And what about the overall loss from other \ncrops?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Oh, it is substantial.\n  Mr. FORD. Substantial.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I can recall, 1 year it was $240 million, all crops \nincluded.\n  Mr. FORD. Here you are damaging the farmer that is beginning to feel \nthe pinch anyhow and hoping that we could negotiate some kind of an \nagreement. He is left out. You still want to eliminate this part of his \neveryday life.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to eliminate crop insurance for tobacco. I will \nconcede to my colleague that the overall subsidy for crop insurance, as \nI said at the outset, is an issue well worth addressing. The fact that \nwe would spend--perhaps the Senator from Mississippi has more current \nfigures--we would spend in the neighborhood of $200 million subsidizing \ncrop insurance in America is an issue which I will happily join with my \ncolleague from Kentucky and other States to address.\n  But lest we forget, this debate started on the issue of tobacco, and \nalthough many of my colleagues want to raise a variety of other issues, \nwe still have to face the reality that when this debate is over, we are \ngoing to face this question time and again when we go home: Senator, \nwhat's going on here? I can't pick up a newspaper, a news magazine, \nturn on the radio or television and I am not being told how bad tobacco \nis for America. Why do you keep plowing millions of my tax dollars into \nthe subsidy of this tobacco crop? How can you justify it?\n  I cannot. That is why I am offering the amendment. And I would say to \nmy colleagues from the tobacco producing States, it is time to accept \nreality. And reality will tell you this. The day when the Federal \nGovernment rushed to the rescue of tobacco is over. I do not know if I \nwill succeed with this amendment today, but tobacco's days in the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture are numbered. They know it, the tobacco \nfarmers know it, and the tobacco companies know it. They know full \nwell, as they have watched the course of events over the last 5 or 6 \nyears, that each year we have eliminated another Federal program \nrelative to tobacco--research, export assistance, market promotion \nprogram. We have closed those doors, and those doors have remained \nshut.\n  The tobacco growers and industry realized long ago that if they \nwanted an allotment program that gives them the advantage of making the \nkind of money we are talking about, they would have to pay for their \nown program. And they did it. And yet now we are in a part of this \ndebate where they are saying we want to hang onto this last Federal \nsubsidy.\n  Make no mistake; this second-degree amendment offered by my \ncolleague, the Senator from Kentucky, does not just reform crop \ninsurance. It strikes our prohibition before inserting his addition. So \nhe is not adding to my amendment. He wants to get me out of the way. He \nwants to talk about crop insurance programs. He does not want to talk \nabout tobacco. That is a delicate subject. But it is a delicate subject \nI have been talking about for 10 years.\n  And I want to tell you, too, I think the tide of history is on my \nside. I hope I am around to see that tide hit the\n\n[[Page S7910]]\n\nshore. I hope I am still standing when it does. But a little over 10 \nyears ago, I offered the first amendment in my long and checkered \ncareer on this issue to ban smoking on airplanes--10 years ago. Every \nleader in the House of Representatives, Democrat and Republican, \nopposed me, every committee chairman, and we went to the floor. They \nsaid we were meddling with tobacco, and they did not care for it, and \ntobacco lobbied. Folks, I want to tell you, the monsters of the midway \nare not the Chicago Bears. The monsters of the midway are the tobacco \nlobbyists in this town. They came down like a ton of bricks on this \namendment. But you know what. We won. By 5 votes we won, 198 to 193, \nand I was the most surprised Member of Congress standing in the Chamber \nof the House when it happened.\n  What it told me then and tells me now is that we are going to win \nthis battle--maybe not today. I hope we do. Maybe not today, but we \nwill. And the tobacco growers and tobacco companies have to accept the \nreality that if their product is to remain legal, if it is to remain \nlegal, they have to change the way they do business. They have to stop \nasking for this Federal subsidy. They have to stop selling tobacco to \nour kids.\n  If they do not agree to those two things, they are going to continue \nto face this kind of opposition year in and year out, and it will \ncontinue unabated. Those who are here in the Chamber, my colleagues, \nand some who are in the gallery who have taken the time to tour this \nbeautiful building--and it is magnificent. I am very proud to be a \nMember of the Senate and to be able to practice my profession in this \nbuilding--they will take a look around at the columns as they walk \nthrough the corridors and they will find at the top of these columns a \ncurious leaf.\n  What could it be? Well, you know what. Many of these columns are \nadorned with tobacco leaves. It tells you something about the history \nof the United States of America and the history of this Congress. When \nthe President of the United States comes for an address to the Joint \nSession of Congress, State of the Union Address, for example, he stands \nin front of a wooden podium. Carved in the side of that wooden podium \nare tobacco leaves. It is part of America and it is part of our \nhistory. And there are some people who do not want to give up on that \npiece of history. They want to hang in there one more year for tobacco: \nOh, we can do it. We can survive. We can offer perfecting amendments. \nWe are going to fight for 1 more year.\n\n  But the tide of history is not on their side. It was not that long \nago, even in my lifetime, when doctors used to advertise the healthiest \ncigarettes to smoke. It has not been that long ago that you could have \na smoking and nonsmoking section on an airplane and create the fiction \nyou were protecting people, knowing full well that you were not.\n  Those days are over. And as these tobacco companies come in here \nready to negotiate, not because of a guilty conscience, because of \ntheir additional efforts to make money, we can see the tide changing. \nAnd yet we hang onto this vestige of the old school, this relic of \nhistory which for 60 years has said that the Federal taxpayers will \ndefend and subsidize tobacco. That has to come to an end, and it has to \ncome to an end sooner rather than later.\n  Let us take the money we save with my amendment and use it for \nvaluable, positive things that will help all of rural America. Let us \nuse it for programs that are beneficial, health assistance to everyone \nacross this Nation. The amendment that has been offered by my colleague \nfrom Kentucky is an amendment which seeks to win this battle today, put \nit off, at least the overall issue, for another day. But that is not \ngood for America. It does us no good as a nation to turn our back on \nthis reality.\n  I say to my colleague as well, although he may question this, I will \ntell him in all sincerity, I understand his concern for his farmers. I \ngive him my word now as I have in previous debates that if he is \nprepared to offer an amendment as part of this tobacco agreement to \nhelp his farmers, either phaseout of tobacco growth, move in other \nareas, I will be there, I will help him. Tobacco companies owe a great \ndeal to the American tobacco growers, and I don't run into too many \ntobacco farmers who defend them, incidentally, because they know full \nwell these same tobacco companies haven't treated America's tobacco \nfarmers very well. They continue to import cheaper tobacco from \noverseas. They turn their backs on the very farmers whose tractors and \nskirts they have hid behind for decades. It was not fair the tobacco \ngrowers were not at the table.\n  If the Senator from Kentucky or anyone on that side of the debate \nwants to suggest a change in this overall agreement to provide \nassistance to those tobacco growers so that they can phase in to a \ndifferent type of production or phaseout of tobacco growth, I am happy \nto join him in that effort. My war is not with those farmers. My war is \nwith what they are growing in their fields, because what they grow in \nthose fields is deadly. It is lethal. It is something that can't be \nignored or swept aside as just another agricultural issue.\n  I can recall during past debates on this people have stood up and \nsaid you can't single out tobacco when it comes to America's export \npolicy, and yet we have done it. People have said you cannot single out \ntobacco when it comes to research. Basically, we have done it. People \nhave said time and again that you cannot separate tobacco as a crop. \nBut I believe the American people know the difference. They know the \ndifference between a bushel of corn that may be used for a variety of \npositive things. They know the difference between a bushel of soybeans \nthat may be used for a variety of things, positive for American \nfamilies, or a bail of cotton. You cannot say the same thing about \nthese tobacco leaves.\n  So, Mr. President, I oppose this amendment, not because of its \nunderlying wisdom but because it is offered only, exclusively, solely \nfor one reason--push the tobacco debate off for another day. I believe, \nand I believe my colleagues will join me in this belief, that you \ncannot wait another day. You have to move forward with this debate and \naddress this issue now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this has been a very vigorous and \ninformative debate, in my judgment. I have no parochial interest in \nthat our State does not grow tobacco. We have no program for tobacco, \nfor any of the producers of agricultural commodities in our State, but \nI am persuaded by the arguments that have been made by the Senator from \nKentucky about the economic consequences of this amendment, and that is \nbolstered by the letter the distinguished Senator from Kentucky [Mr. \nFord], mentioned that had been received by me today from the Secretary \nof Agriculture which points out the detrimental effect that the \namendment offered by the Senator from Illinois would have on \nagriculture producers in the United States if it were to be passed by \nthe Senate.\n  So I am constrained to oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois, but I am also troubled very much by the second-degree \namendment that has now been offered by my good friend from Kentucky \nwhich limits the application of the crop insurance program to farmable \nacreage of less than 400 acres. And that is troubling because so many \nof our farmers in my State and elsewhere throughout the country have \nmore than 400 acres under cultivation, and this would be discriminatory \nin a different kind of way. So I am troubled by that amendment and I do \nnot want to see that passed.\n  So I am in a position and I think the best course of action for me as \nmanager of the bill is to move to table the underlying amendment. If \nthat motion to table passes, then it takes both the underlying \namendment and the second-degree amendment with it as I understand it.\n  So at this point, knowing that debate has been occurring for a little \nover an hour now and with the knowledge that we will set this aside, \nnot to vote on it now but at a time to be determined later, I now move \nto table the underlying amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe motion to table be set aside and to\n\n[[Page S7911]]\n\noccur at a time to be established later in the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 109, which \nwas submitted earlier today by my colleague, Senator Stevens, as well \nas myself and other Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 109) condemning the Government of \n     Canada for failing to accept responsibility for the illegal \n     blockade of a U.S. vessel in Canada and calling on the \n     President to take appropriate action.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this resolution expresses the sense of \nthe Senate that the Government of Canada failed to act responsibly to \nquickly restore order and the rule of law during the recent blockade of \nthe Alaska State ferry, the motor vessel Malaspina. I am pleased to be \njoined in this measure by the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator \nStevens, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nHelms, and the senior Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton.\n  Mr. President, the amendment responds to this illegal blockade, in \nwhich a large number of Canadian fishing vessels joined forces to \nprevent the Malaspina from departing from Prince Rupert, BC, from \napproximately 8 a.m. Saturday morning until approximately 9 p.m. on \nMonday.\n  The actions of these Canadian fishermen was a clear violation of \ninternational law which provides for the right of free passage, and \ncontinued Monday in violation of a Canadian court order against the \nblockade, issued on Sunday. Obviously, Canadian authorities had a \ndifficult task, but the reality is that they failed to take timely \naction to disperse this illegal demonstration. Indeed, they delayed \neven serving their own Canadian court's injunction against the \nblockaders.\n  This incident caused distress, financial harm, and inconvenience to \nsome 300 passengers, primarily American passengers, on board the \nvessel, and to the State of Alaska that operates the system, and to \ncompanies which had consigned freight shipments to the vessel. While \nthe Canadian fishermen claimed their action was in response to a \nfishing dispute, the blockade of this vessel went far beyond any \nfishing dispute into a very dangerous area, and created an \ninternational incident.\n  There is little difference, in reality, between this blockade and the \ninterruption of traffic on a major international highway such as New \nYork's Route 81 to Montreal. The Alaska Marine Highway System is part \nof our U.S. Interstate Highway System. Operating money for the \nMalaspina and other vessels in the system receive funding through \nISTEA, our national highway legislation. Any vehicles that can traverse \nthe interstate highways of Alaska can be accommodated in the MV \nMalaspina. It carries approximately 105 cars, vans--you name it. So, it \nis an official part of the U.S. National Highway System. Moreover, Mr. \nPresident, this ship was also carrying the U.S. mail.\n  This resolution will put the Senate on record in opposition to this \nand future illegal attacks on the U.S. transportation network, and \nspecifically the Alaska Marine Highway System. It calls upon the \nPresident to do whatever is necessary and whatever is appropriate to \nensure that the Government of Canada takes steps to guarantee that \nillegal actions against American citizens will not be allowed. It also \ncalls on the President to assist American citizens who were harmed by \nthis illegal action to recover damages from those responsible and/or \nfrom the Canadian Government.\n  Yesterday I spoke with Canada's Ambassador to the United States. He \napologized for the burning of the U.S. flag by one of the fishing \nvessels--an unfortunate incident. On the other hand, even at that time, \nmore than 2 days after the beginning of the blockade, the Ambassador \nwas not able to confirm to me that his government had the necessary \ncommitment to take appropriate steps that may be necessary in such \nillegal actions. He indicated that he would attempt to find out what \naction would be considered if the vessels didn't voluntarily depart the \narea.\n\n  I am still awaiting the call, although the issue has since been \nresolved. Ultimately, it was the fishermen themselves who decided to \nremove that blockade, not any formal action of the Canadian Government \nin enforcing, if you will, the Canadian court order. Indeed, the \nCanadian Minister of Fisheries, who met with the fishermen yesterday, \nwas quoted in the press as saying he would not even ask the fishermen \nto cease the blockade.\n  I know emotions run high. I very much value our relationship with our \nCanadian neighbors. But an unlawful act such as this, where United \nStates commerce is affected, United States mails are affected, the \norderly transportation of United States citizens is affected, and the \nCanadian and the British Columbian justice systems fail to take \nimmediate action to terminate the illegalities, was very disappointing \nto those of us in Alaska and the United States.\n  I know the administration views this matter seriously. I know they \nhave under consideration certain steps that may be necessary to protect \nU.S. interests. I believe the Senate should show its support for the \nPresident in this matter and that is exactly what the resolution does.\n  It specifically encourages using United States assets and personnel \nto protect United States citizens exercising their right of innocent \npassage through the territorial seas of Canada from such illegal \nactions or harassment, until such time as the President determines the \nGovernment of Canada has adopted a long-term policy that ensures such \nprotection. That could include escort by the U.S. Coast Guard, if \nnecessary.\n  Second, it says we should consider prohibiting the import of select \nCanadian products until such time as the President determines that \nCanada has adopted a long-term policy that protects United States \ncitizens exercising the right of innocent passage through the \nterritorial seas of Canada from illegal actions or harassment.\n  Third, it suggests the possibility of directing that no Canadian \nvessel may anchor or otherwise take shelter in United States waters off \nAlaska or any other State without formal clearance from United States \nCustoms, except of course in the case of storms or other emergencies.\n  Fourth, it reflects that the President might find it appropriate to \nsay that no fish or shellfish taken in sport fisheries in the Province \nof British Columbia may enter the United States.\n  Last, it suggests enforcing U.S. laws with respect to all vessels in \nDixon Entrance, including the waters where jurisdiction is disputed. It \nis my hope these actions will not be necessary, and that we will get \nthe necessary assurances from the Canadian Government.\n  Many say this is a fishing issue. Mr. President, the fishing issue is \nparamount but that can only be resolved through negotiations. It is \nfair to say of the last negotiation, that the Canadians saw fit to walk \nout and have not been back since. It is my hope those negotiations will \nresume soon, but that takes two parties to begin.\n  In any event, I ask my colleagues for support on the Senate \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, It is my intention, with the permission of the floor \nmanager, to ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I assume we could, perhaps, arrange for a rollcall \nvote around 4 o'clock, or stacked with the other votes that are \npending, if that is in agreement with my friend?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the Senator will yield, I am prepared to make a \nunanimous-consent request to that effect, if that is satisfactory to \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the floor and I thank the Presiding Officer \nand my colleague.\n\n[[Page S7912]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senate \nResolution 109, the Murkowski-Stevens resolution, be temporarily set \naside and a vote occur on the adoption of the resolution at 4 o'clock \np.m. today, to be immediately followed by the vote on the Cochran \nmotion to table the Durbin amendment, No. 965. I finally ask consent \nthat there be 2 minutes, equally divided, for debate prior to the \nsecond vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We now have \ntwo votes that have been set to occur beginning at 4 o'clock this \nafternoon.\n  There are, to our knowledge, at least two more amendments that are \ngoing to be offered that will probably require rollcall votes. What we \nwould like to do is to stack votes on those amendments immediately \nfollowing the votes that have now been ordered, and then have final \npassage of the bill.\n  To do that, we need to have the cooperation of all Senators who are \ninterested in the passage of this bill and those who have amendments to \nthe bill. We hope they will come to the floor as soon as possible to \noffer their amendments.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I want to commend the chairman, \nSenator Cochran, and the ranking Democratic member, Senator Bumpers, \nfor their efforts in putting together this Agriculture appropriations \nmeasure. They have put a lot of work into crafting a bill that stays \nwithin the subcommittee's allocation while seeking to satisfy many \ncompeting demands for funding. I have appreciated very much working \nwith them and with their staffs in the subcommittee on this bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 968\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for tobacco and nicotine enforcement \n    activities of the Food and Drug Administration, with an offset)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Overall, I believe it is an excellent bill and one I \nwholeheartedly support. However, there is in this bill, I believe, a \nglaring shortfall relating to the level of funding provided for the \nFood and Drug Administration's enforcement and outreach efforts to \nprevent smoking by America's children.\n  The budget request for FDA includes $34 million for this purpose, but \nthe reported bill provides only $4.9 million. The amendment that \nSenator Chafee and I will be offering will provide FDA the full $34 \nmillion it needs to implement a nationwide effort in all 50 States to \nhelp our kids avoid the deadly trap of tobacco. The needed funding is \ntruly a drop in the bucket compared to the $50 billion or more our \nNation spends each year on medical costs attributable to smoking.\n  Everyone, including even the tobacco companies, claims to be against \nunderage smoking. But those assertions are just empty words if we fail \nto provide the necessary resources to carry out the FDA rules \nspecifically designed to prevent sales of tobacco to children.\n  With this amendment, the rubber really meets the road. It presents \nthis body with a clear choice whether we are really serious about \nattacking underage smoking.\n  In discussing our amendment, I hope that Members of the Senate will \nnot lose sight of what is really at stake. Disease, suffering, and \ndeath caused by smoking and nicotine addiction is clearly at horrendous \nproportions in our Nation. With a death toll of more than 400,000 each \nyear, smoking kills more Americans than AIDS, alcohol, motor vehicles, \nfires, homicides, illicit drugs and suicide all combined.\n  Here is a chart, Mr. President, that shows that in graphic detail: \nThe comparative causes of annual deaths in the United States. Here we \nsee 30,000 in AIDS deaths, 105,000 from alcohol, and those from \nhomicides, illicit drugs, suicides. Here is smoking, 418,000 per year. \nThere are more deaths caused by smoking than all of the rest put \ntogether.\n  This is truly an epidemic, an epidemic that begins with underage \nsmoking. Mr. President, 4.5 million kids aged 12 to 17 are smokers \ntoday. Almost 90 percent of adult smokers began at or before the age of \n18. The average youth smoker begins at age 13 and becomes a daily \nsmoker by the age of 14\\1/2\\. Thousands of our kids are drawn into \nsmoking every day. It is no longer even an arguable point that they \nhave been targeted for recruitment into a deadly habit. Today, just \nlike every day, 3,000 young Americans will begin\n\n[[Page S7913]]\n\nsmoking and 1,000 of them will die from it. At current rates, 5 million \nAmerican kids under 18 who are alive today will be killed by smoking-\nrelated disease.\n  The upward trend in teenage smoking is even more frightening. Smoking \namong high school seniors is at a 17-year high. Mr. President, again, \nhere is a graph that shows it in detail. The smoking rates among high \nschool seniors are at a 17-year high. These are the trends of cigarette \nsmoking among high school seniors, 12th grade, 1980 to 1996. Look what \nhas been happening since about 1991, 1992. This graph is going off the \ncharts--a 17-year high.\n  The statistics on smoking among young women and girls are just as \nshocking. Smoking among eighth grade girls--yes, I said that correctly, \neighth grade girls--jumped over 60 percent from 1991 to 1996, with \nrates of smoking now higher for 8th- and 10th-grade girls than for \nboys. And smoking among black children of this age nearly doubled \nduring this time period.\n  Our children are our future, as we all know. But thanks to smoking, \nmillions of American kids will not be leading long and fulfilling \nlives. Instead, they will be filling hospital beds and coffins long \nbefore their time.\n  The epidemic of teenage smoking is a crisis that is beyond \npartisanship. Responding to it should lift us up above everyday \npolitics. That is why I am so proud to have the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, as a cosponsor of this bipartisan \namendment.\n  Unquestionably, Mr. President, a key factor in youth smoking is that \nit is far too easy for kids to buy tobacco. Not only is it far too \neasy, but we now know that the tobacco companies, through the use of \nslick advertising, through the use of Joe Camel, through the use of the \nMarlboro Man and Virginia Slims and all of the fancy advertising that \nthey have done, have targeted kids with Marlboro gear, the Camel \ncoupons you can redeem for Camel gear and for beach wear and radios and \ncassette players, jackets and all the things that teenagers like to \naccumulate. We know that the tobacco companies have targeted teenagers \nfor smoking with their advertising.\n  When you combine that targeting of the advertising with the easy \naccess for kids to buy tobacco, that is why you have teenage smoking at \na 17-year high. I believe that this recent rise is due to the \ntremendous amount of advertising targeted to our youth and the ease \nwith which youth can buy tobacco.\n  A review of numerous studies has shown that children and adolescents \nwere able to buy tobacco products successfully 67 percent of the times \nthat they tried. Over 60 percent of kids who smoke say they buy their \nown. One study showed that over 75 percent of underage high school \nstudents who had bought cigarettes in a store or a gas station in the \npast 30 days said they were not asked to show proof of age.\n  It has been demonstrated that enforcement of youth access laws can \nsuccessfully reduce tobacco sales to minors and reduce youth smoking \nrates. That just makes good common sense and that is exactly the basis \non which the FDA acted.\n  Let me describe the FDA initiative that our amendment funds. In \nAugust of 1996, FDA issued rules specifically designed to reduce the \nnumber of kids who start smoking. The most important of the rules set a \nnational legal age of 18 for the purchase of tobacco products and \nrequire retailers to check photo ID's of consumers seeking to purchase \ntobacco who appear to be younger than 27 years of age. Those rules went \ninto effect in February of this year.\n  Now, some might say, is this necessary that we have this photo ID \nrule with a cutoff of 27 years of age? Well, I ask you, Mr. President, \nand other Senators to look at this picture. Which one is age 16? Is it \nMelissa here on the left or is it Amy here on your right, both coming \nup to the counter to buy cigarettes? Can you tell which one is 16? If \nthey walked into a store, would the clerk know which one was under age \n18? Well, to eliminate the guesswork, FDA requires retailers to card \nanyone, to have proof of ID for anyone who appears under 27. In case \nyou are wondering, Melissa here is 16 and Amy here is 25. That is the \nproblem we have. And that is why FDA acted.\n  The public overwhelmingly supports putting a stop to illegal sales of \ntobacco to minors. A new poll shows that 92 percent of Americans agree \nthat young people should be required to show a photo ID to buy tobacco \nproducts. Eighty-seven percent agree with the FDA rule setting a \nnational minimum age of 18 for buying tobacco mandating ID checks of \nall tobacco purchasers appearing to be under the age of 27.\n  FDA needs $34 million for enforcement and outreach that will help all \n50 States carry out the minimum age and photo ID rules. There is no \nquestion that the States need help in the area of enforcement. Despite \nthe fact that it is against the law in all 50 States to sell cigarettes \nand smokeless tobacco to minors, our young people purchase an estimated \n$1.26 billion--billion--worth of tobacco each year. The FDA initiative \ndirectly addresses these enforcement problems. It will keep tobacco out \nof the hands of children.\n  Of the $34 million, $24 million will go to enforcement and \nevaluation, with the vast majority of that going out to the States \nthrough contracts. And $10 million of the $34 million will go to \noutreach efforts for educating retailers and the public about complying \nwith the rules.\n\n  The point of the initiative is to prevent our kids from buying \ntobacco illegally and to help our small businesses and our retailers to \ncome into compliance with the law. The FDA initiative is not a new, big \nFederal regulatory program. The bulk of the money will go directly to \nsupport State and local efforts. Without this funding, the States will \nnot have the resources they need for their efforts against illegal \ntobacco sales to kids. By the end of fiscal year 1997, FDA expects to \nhave contracted with the first 10 States. The increased funding will \nallow a comprehensive national enforcement effort with contracts in all \n50 States.\n  Now, Mr. President, it is true that the tobacco industry has \nchallenged FDA's tobacco regulation in court. Well, they went to court. \nThey had their day in court. However, the authority of FDA to carry out \nthe minimum age and photo ID rules was fully upheld in April by the \nFederal district court in Greensboro, NC. The $34 million request in \nFDA's budget, which our amendment would provide, would be used for \nactivities that the Greensboro Federal court gave the green light to. \nThat decision did not reduce the need for fully funding the FDA \ninitiative.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from Secretary of Health and Human \nServices Shalala supporting this point. I ask unanimous consent to have \nit printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, \n         Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \n         Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you approach your subcommittee's \n     consideration of the Fiscal Year 1998 budget request for the \n     Food and Drug Administration, questions have been raised \n     about FDA's ability to spend the funds for the youth smoking \n     initiative requested by the President.\n       Earlier this year, the Federal District Court in \n     Greensboro, North Carolina, upheld the FDA's assertion of \n     jurisdiction as well as all of the access and labeling \n     provisions of FDA's 1996 regulations. The Court kept in place \n     the age and photo ID provisions that have been in effect \n     since February 1997 and stayed the effective date of the \n     remaining provisions. Finally, it overturned the advertising \n     restrictions. FDA has appealed this portion of the ruling.\n       The President requested $34 million in funding to enforce \n     the tobacco rule, which will be used to implement the \n     provisions upheld by the Court. Indeed, this funding is vital \n     to oversee the age and photo ID requirements already in \n     effect. There are approximately 500,000 retailers who sell \n     tobacco products in the United States. Each year, more than \n     $1 billion in illegal sales to children and adolescents \n     occur. Stopping the sale to minors is of paramount importance \n     to protect our nation's youth.\n       The bulk of the $34 million will be spent on contracts with \n     the states that want to join FDA in ensuring retailer \n     compliance with the provisions already in place. (By the end \n     of this fiscal year, the agency expects to have contracted \n     with the first ten states who have joined with us to address \n     this problem.) Without these funds, FDA will not have the \n     credible national enforcement program required to reduce \n     significantly young people's access to tobacco.\n\n[[Page S7914]]\n\n       The remaining funds are necessary to educate retailers and \n     the public about the new rules. An effective compliance \n     outreach program will increase the likelihood that retailers \n     will understand and comply with the age and photo ID \n     provisions of the tobacco regulations. Retailers who do not \n     know about the rules cannot possibly comply with them.\n       By providing the full funding requested by the agency, FDA \n     will be able to put in place a comprehensive enforcement and \n     outreach program. Every day, another 3,000 young people \n     become regular smokers; of these 1,000 will die prematurely \n     because of their smoking. If funds are provided by the \n     Congress, the new FDA tobacco regulation will significantly \n     help prevent another generation of young people from \n     endangering their lives because of this deadly addiction. I \n     appeal to you to help us assure that funding.\n       An identical letter is being sent to Senator Bumpers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donna E. Shalala.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as the letter from Secretary Shalala makes \nclear, the full $34 million is needed to carry out the minimum age and \nphoto ID rules. She states:\n\n       Without these funds, FDA will not have the credible \n     national enforcement program required to reduce significantly \n     young people's access to tobacco.\n\n  Again, the pending litigation has not reduced FDA's need for or its \nability to utilize the $34 million. So our amendment provides the full \nfunding for FDA to work with the States to carry out the minimum age \nand photo ID rules.\n  Now, where do we get the money? We offset the full cost of the FDA \nyouth smoking initiative by increasing the tobacco marketing assessment \nfrom the current 1 percent of the national price support level to 2.1 \npercent for the 1998 crop of flue-cured tobacco and for the 1997 crop \nof burley and other tobacco. The increase will apply to assessments \nexpected to be collected in fiscal year 1998. That is because flue-\ncured tobacco is marketed in the summer, while burley and others are \nmarketed almost entirely after October 1.\n  The full cost of the increase would be borne by purchasers of \ntobacco, that is, the tobacco companies. In addition, for the tobacco \ncovered by the amendment, half of the current 1 percent assessment now \npaid by producers would be shifted to purchasers, thus providing \nassessment relief to tobacco farmers.\n  We have heard concerns expressed clearly and forcefully on the floor \nof the Senate about the consequences for our tobacco farmers of changes \nin tobacco policies. I am very sympathetic to the situation of any \nfarmer, including tobacco farmers. They are just trying to make a \nliving. I know how hard farmers work and what a struggle it is for them \nto make a living. So I am concerned, also, about the impacts on \ntobacco-farming families.\n  For that reason, this amendment is crafted to relieve tobacco farmers \nof their obligation to pay a part of the marketing assessment on the \ntobacco covered by the amendment. Currently, the producer of domestic \ntobacco--that is the farmer --pays half of the assessment. That is one-\nhalf of 1 percent of the support price, with the purchaser paying the \nother one-half of 1 percent. What our amendment says is that the \ntobacco companies will pay the whole assessment, including the \nincrease. So this amendment provides relief for our tobacco farmers \nbecause it will relieve them of the burden they have now of paying that \none-half of 1 percent of the assessment. I might add, parenthetically, \nMr. President, I believe if tobacco companies have to pay the full 2.1 \npercent, then they are going to pass costs along to the consumers--that \nis, those who smoke tobacco. On the one hand, we relieve the tobacco \nfarmers of this burden and we have made those who use tobacco pay more.\n  As a nation, we are in solid agreement that use of tobacco by minors \nmust be reduced--or at least we say we are. When that happens, it also \nmeans that we eventually will have fewer adults smoking. So it is our \nnational policy that there will be less of a market in this country for \ntobacco. Tobacco farmers need to recognize that change is coming. But I \nalso know that when markets for agricultural commodities change, it is \noften the farmers who bear the brunt of that change. It is no different \nfor tobacco than for corn or soybeans or hogs or wheat or cotton or any \nother commodity. I hope that we will find more ways to help tobacco \nfarmers deal with this change. In the meantime, I am suggesting that at \nleast we should require that tobacco companies pay the marketing \nassessment. It will ease the burden on tobacco farmers, who clearly are \nfacing uncertainty.\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot continue to postpone addressing the \nmonumental costs to society of tobacco use on the grounds that doing so \nmay have some negative impact on farmers. There are too many lives at \nstake--lives of people who are children today.\n  Again, let me make it clear that this amendment does not give FDA any \nadditional jurisdiction over tobacco farmers. It does not create any \nnew authority for FDA to regulate tobacco farmers or become involved in \nthe marketing by farmers of tobacco. The offset in the amendment \ninvolving an increase in the assessment involves only the Department of \nAgriculture, not the FDA.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, there is some misinformation floating around to \nthe effect that we do not need this FDA funding because of the proposed \ntobacco settlement that is now under review by the Congress and the \nadministration. Well, Mr. President, this FDA initiative against youth \nsmoking was begun long before the tobacco settlement talks even \nstarted. The minimum age and photo ID check rules are in place and are \nworking. But there is a pressing need for more funding to allow all 50 \nStates to carry out enforcement efforts aimed at preventing youth \nsmoking. There plainly is no good reason for delaying full \nimplementation of the FDA initiative. We should not await the uncertain \nfate of the tobacco settlement before putting the necessary resources \ninto FDA's enforcement and outreach efforts to stop underage smoking. \nAs a nation, we cannot afford to continue losing our kids to tobacco at \nthe horrendous rates that we are now experiencing. So the proposed \ntobacco settlement and this FDA initiative are totally separate \nmatters--there should be no confusion on this point--and there is no \ninconsistency between them either.\n  Mr. President, I have here a letter from 33 attorneys general \ninvolved in the settlement activities, who write in support of full \nfunding for the FDA initiative, what our amendment here provides. The \n33 attorneys general who are involved in the settlement say they \nsupport full funding of this initiative. They would not have signed the \nletter if there were any reason to delay funding the FDA efforts \npending possible legislation to carry out the settlement.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Attorney General of Washington,\n\n                                       Olympia, WA, June 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chair, Senate Appropriations Committee, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations Committee, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chair, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, \n         Rural Development and Related Agencies, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Dale Bumpers,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \n         Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: We are writing as the attorneys \n     general for our respective states in support of the Food and \n     Drug Administration's (FDA) request for $34 million to \n     implement the tobacco initiative in the Agriculture \n     Appropriations bill. This funding is critical to our efforts \n     to protect kids from tobacco sales.\n       There is no reason not to fully fund the FDA tobacco \n     regulations. A Federal District Court recently upheld FDA's \n     general jurisdiction over the sale of tobacco products to \n     minors, and the American public overwhelmingly supports this \n     initiative. The tobacco industry failed in its legal effort \n     to derail FDA's important protections for kids. Now, local, \n     state and federal officials must move forward and work \n     together to implement FDA's regulations.\n       In 1994, attorneys general from around the country issued a \n     report illustrating the need for comprehensive new policies \n     to protect kids from tobacco. In the past three years, 40 \n     attorneys general have filed suit against the tobacco \n     industry to recover damages caused by their behavior. To stop \n     the marketing of tobacco products to kids is a primary goal \n     of these lawsuits against the tobacco industry.\n       We are prepared to work hand-in-hand with FDA to ensure \n     that the provisions of its tobacco initiative are fully \n     enforced. Towards this end, FDA has allocated a significant \n     portion of the $34 million to go directly to\n\n[[Page S7915]]\n\n     the states to help with enforcement. This money is critical \n     to ensuring our country's success in reducing tobacco use by \n     youth.\n       We need to act without delay: cigarette smoking among high \n     school seniors is at a 17 year high and smoking among 8th and \n     10th graders has increased by more than 50 percent since \n     1991. Tobacco use is clearly a problem that starts with \n     children: almost 90 percent of adult smokers started using \n     tobacco at or before age 18, and the average youth smoker \n     begins at age 13 and becomes a daily smoker by age 14\\1/2\\.\n       While some provisions of FDA's initiative are on hold \n     pending appeal, the court fully upheld FDA's funding that \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are both drugs and \n     drug delivery devices. In addition, the court provided FDA \n     with full authority to continue implementing provisions \n     requiring retailers to check photo identification of \n     consumers seeking to purchase tobacco who appear to be \n     younger than 27 years of age. Strong enforcement of this \n     provision is key to reducing youth access to tobacco \n     products. The $34 million requested by FDA will provide much \n     needed funding for enforcement by state and local officials.\n       Currently, it is far too easy for kids to buy cigarettes \n     and chewing tobacco through vending machines and at retail \n     outlets. A review of thirteen studies of over-the-counter \n     sales found that, on average, children and adolescents were \n     able to successfully buy tobacco products 67 percent of the \n     time. We can substantially improve on this record by \n     providing funding for the FDA regulations.\n       The tobacco industry's record of targeting our kids is \n     clear. Now is the time to stand up for America's kids and \n     protect them from cigarettes and chewing tobacco. FDA's \n     jurisdiction over sales to minors has been upheld in court \n     and enjoys strong support among the people of our states. We \n     hope you will vote for full-funding of this critical \n     initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Christine O.

Mr. President, our amendment would in no way prejudice or \nin any way affect the outcome of any legislation designed to implement \nthe settlement. Mr. President, I also have two additional letters here. \nOne is from Secretary Shalala and one is from Michael Moore, the \nMississippi attorney general who has led the attorneys general in the \ntobacco settlement negotiations. As you know, Mississippi already \nreached a settlement with the tobacco companies. Michael Moore led \nthese efforts. I just want to read an excerpt from his letter dated \nJuly 21, 1997:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin:\n       I am writing to express my strong support for your \n     amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill to provide \n     full funding for the Food and Drug Administration's \n     initiative to protect kids from tobacco. This is a critical \n     program that must be supported without delay.\n\n  Attorney General Moore of Mississippi goes on to say:\n\n       There has been some confusion regarding your amendment and \n     whether it would interfere or conflict with the proposed \n     settlement with the tobacco industry. Some Members of \n     Congress have also stated that they believe funding FDA's \n     tobacco program is unnecessary because money will be \n     forthcoming from a settlement. No one is more anxious than I \n     to have Congress promptly address the settlement; but let me \n     be very clear:\n\n  Again, I am reading from Attorney General Moore's letter.\n\n     passage of your amendment is critical because we can't be \n     certain that the tobacco settlement will be passed or \n     implemented in time to provide the needed funds for the \n     upcoming fiscal year. Congress should not jeopardize the \n     current FDA tobacco initiative unless we are assured of the \n     immediate passage of legislation regarding the settlement.\n       Immediate full funding for the FDA rule is appropriate \n     because the agency's initiative is already in place and has \n     been implemented.\n\n  Secretary Shalala, in her letter dated July 22, says:\n\n       Let me emphasize that the funding requested by the \n     administration is separate from any funds that might be \n     available sometime in the future as a result of any \n     settlement. Further, I do not believe it would prejudice or \n     predetermine in any way future congressional action regarding \n     the settlement.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary Shalala and \nthe one from Attorney General Mike Moore of Mississippi be printed at \nthis point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1997.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom: Thank you for your leadership in the effort to \n     fully fund the Food and Drug Administration's fiscal year \n     1998 budget request for the youth smoking initiative. I \n     understand that questions have been raised regarding the \n     relationship of this amendment to the funds discussed in the \n     proposed tobacco settlement.\n       Let me emphasize that the funding requested by the \n     Administration is separate from any funds that might be \n     available sometime in the future as a result of any \n     settlement. Further, I do not believe it would prejudice or \n     predetermine in any way future congressional action regarding \n     the settlement.\n       As you know, the Department intends to use the funding \n     requested by the President for FY 1998 to enforce the age and \n     photo ID provisions of the tobacco regulation that are \n     already in effect. This regulation has been upheld by the \n     Federal District Court in Greensboro, North Carolina and has \n     the force of law.\n       By contrast, the proposed tobacco settlement is still under \n     review by the Administration. No legislation has been \n     considered by Congress and the appropriate committees have \n     just begun to hold hearings. For these reasons, the time \n     frame and likelihood for final action by the White House and \n     Congress on the proposed settlement are entirely unclear. \n     Even under the most optimistic scenario, it is unlikely that \n     any funds under such a settlement would be available in FY98.\n       I hope that this addresses the questions that have been \n     raised. Please let me know if any additional information is \n     necessary.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donna E. Shalala.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             State of Mississippi,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                       Jackson, MS, July 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin. I am writing to express my strong \n     support for your amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations \n     bill to provide full funding for the Food and Drug \n     Administration's initiative to protect kids from tobacco. \n     This is a critical program that must be supported without \n     delay.\n       There has been some confusion regarding your amendment and \n     whether it would interfere or conflict with the proposed \n     settlement with the tobacco industry. Some Members of \n     Congress have also stated that they believe funding FDA's \n     tobacco program is unnecessary because money will be \n     forthcoming from a settlement. No one is more anxious than I \n     to have Congress promptly address the settlement; but let me \n     be very clear; passage of your amendment is critical because \n     we can't be certain that the tobacco settlement will be \n     passed or implemented in time to provide the needed funds for \n     the upcoming fiscal year. Congress should not jeopardize the \n     current FDA tobacco initiative unless we are assured of the \n     immediate passage of legislation regarding the settlement.\n       Immediate full funding for the FDA rule is appropriate \n     because the agency's initiative is already in place and has \n     been implemented. A Federal Court in Greensboro, North \n     Carolina, fully upheld FDA's authority over tobacco products. \n     I sincerely hope the settlement with the tobacco companies \n     will be enacted into law, but in the meantime, let's \n     immediately stop the illegal sale of tobacco to minors.\n       Regardless of what happens with the settlement, the FDA \n     rule is in place and should remain a national priority. I \n     commend you for your efforts to provide full funding for this \n     historic program and wish you success.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Mike Moore,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n\n[[Page S7916]]\n\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, Mr. President, both letters make it clear that the \ntobacco settlement does not obviate the need for the FDA funding that \nwe provide in our amendment and that providing the funding would not \ninterfere with the settlement.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Byrd for his \nexcellent addition to our amendment. Senator Byrd has been the leader \nin the Senate in focusing, also, on the horrendous problem of youth \ndrinking and the need to clamp down on young people buying alcohol. \nSenator Byrd's addition requires that States be encouraged to \ncoordinate their enforcement of the tobacco ID check with enforcement \nof laws that prohibit underage drinking.\n  Mr. President, this is a significant improvement to our original \nproposal. I commend my distinguished senior colleague from West \nVirginia for providing this language. As I said to Senator Byrd, if we \ntighten down on these ID checks, if we provide the funding so that when \nMelissa--Melissa is 16 and she looks older than Amy who is age 25--goes \nin to buy tobacco we will also attack underage drinking. A lot of times \nthey may be buying beer or wine along with tobacco. As long as an ID \ncheck is made, it will stop underage drinking as well as smoking. So I \nagree with Senator Byrd that the States should coordinate their \nenforcement of tobacco ID checks with enforcement of laws that prohibit \nunderage drinking.\n  Mr. President, again, I have an amendment here that incorporates that \nlanguage from Senator Byrd. I thank my colleague, Senator Chafee, for \nhis cosponsorship.\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Reed, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 968.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. HELMS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue reading the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n       At the end of title VII, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . TOBACCO ASSESSMENTS.\n\n       Section 106 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1445) \n     is amended--\n  (1) in subsection (g)(1), by striking ``Effective'' and inserting \n``Except as provided in subsection (h), effective''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Marketing Assessment for Certain 1997 and 1998 \n     Crops.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Effective only for the 1997 crop of \n     tobacco (other than Flue-cured tobacco) and the 1998 crop of \n     Flue-cured tobacco for which price support is made available \n     under this Act, each purchaser of such tobacco, and each \n     importer of the same kind of tobacco, shall remit to the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation a nonrefundable marketing \n     assessment in an amount equal to--\n       ``(A) in the case of a purchaser of domestic tobacco, 2.1 \n     percent of the national price support level for each such \n     crop; and\n       ``(B) in the case of an importer of tobacco, 2.1 percent of \n     the national support price for the same kind of tobacco;\n\n     as provided for in this section.\n       ``(2) Collection and enforcement.--The purchaser and \n     importer assessments under paragraph (1) shall be--\n       ``(A) collected in the same manner as provided for in \n     section 106A(d)(2) or 106B(d)(3), as applicable; and\n       ``(B) enforced in the same manner as provided in section \n     106A(h) or 106B(j), as applicable.\n       ``(3) Enforcement.--The Secretary may enforce this \n     subsection in the courts of the United States.\n\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, $964,261,000 \n     is provided for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug \n     Administration. In carrying out their responsibilities under \n     the Food and Drug Administration's youth tobacco use \n     prevention initiative, States are encouraged to coordinate \n     their enforcement efforts with enforcement of laws that \n     prohibit underage drinking''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Harkin amendment \nto the Agriculture appropriations bill. The illegal sale of tobacco \nproducts to teenagers is a serious national problem. Each year, it is \nestimated that a half a billion cigarettes are sold to Americans under \nthe age of 18.\n  The Harkin amendment is an important test of the genuineness of the \nSenate's commitment to reducing teenage smoking by fully funding the \nenforcement of the FDA tobacco regulations. These FDA rules prohibit \nthe sale of tobacco to minors, and require retailers to check the photo \nidentification of consumers who purchase tobacco products if they \nappear to be 27 years old or younger. Of the $34 million, $24 million \nwill go to the States for enforcement.\n  The Harkin amendment also represents an important test of the \nSenate's resolve to support FDA regulation of tobacco. Three months \nago, a federal court in Greensboro, NC upheld FDA's authority to issue \nthe youth access regulations. But rather than strengthening the FDA's \nhand by providing the agency with the necessary funds to enforce the \nrules, the current bill shamefully weakens the FDA's authority \nappropriating only $5 million for enforcement, or just one-seventh of \nthe President's request for $34 million.\n  Some argue that the Senate should wait until the so-called global \ntobacco settlement is enacted into law before funding the regulations, \ndespite the fact that serious concerns have been raised that the \nsettlement doesn't adequately protect the public health. Even if some \nversion of the settlement is approved, it will not be in time for the \ncurrent budget cycle. In addition, 33 of the State attorneys general \nwho negotiated the settlement support the $34 million funding level.\n  Each day we delay in funding the FDA regulations, 3,000 new smokers \nbetween the ages of 12 and 17 will take up smoking--or 1 million a \nyear.\n  According to a spring 1996 survey conducted by the University of \nMichigan Institute for Social Research, the prevalence of youth tobacco \nuse in America has been on the increase over the last 5 years. It rose \nby nearly 50 percent among 8th and 10th graders, and by nearly 20 \npercent among high school seniors between 1991 and 1996.\n  When children are hooked on cigarette smoking at a young age, it is \nespecially hard for them to quit. Ninety percent of current adult \nsmokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. Ninety-five \npercent of teenage smokers say they intend to quit in the near future--\nbut only a quarter of them will actually do so within the first 8 years \nof beginning to smoke.\n  Tobacco companies have known this fact for years--and used it \ncynically to their advantage. Many experts believe that if the industry \ncannot persuade children to take up smoking, the industry will collapse \nwithin a generation.\n  That's why ``Big Tobacco'' targets children with billions of dollars \nin advertising and promotional giveaways, promising popularity, \nexcitement, and success for those who take up smoking.\n  Because of these marketing practices, the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention estimate that 5 million of today's children will die \nprematurely from smoking-caused illnesses.\n  In addition, the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia \nUniversity has found that smoking is a gateway to the use of illegal \ndrugs. Children between the ages of 12 and 17 who smoke are 12 times \nmore likely to use heroin and 19 times more likely to use cocaine than \nnonsmokers. The younger a person begins to use tobacco, the higher the \nlikelihood of regular drug use as adults.\n  By providing the full $34 million that President Clinton requested to \nimplement photo I.D. checks for the purchase of tobacco products by \nanyone under the age of 27, the Senate can make an important difference \nin reducing tobacco use among the Nation's youth.\n  The additional Federal funds in the Harkin amendment to enforce the \nFDA tobacco regulations are clearly needed, and I urge the Senate to \napprove the amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 969 to Amendment No. 968\n\n      (Purpose: To impose an assessment on ethanol manufacturers)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for himself, \n     and Mr. Faircloth, proposes an amendment numbered 969 to \n     amendment numbered 968.\n\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     ASSESSMENT FOR ETHANOL PRODUCERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--For fiscal year 1998, the rate of tax \n     otherwise imposed on a gallon of ethanol under the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 shall be increased by 3 cents and such \n     rate increase shall not be considered in any determination \n     under section 9503(f)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986.\n       (b) Establishment of Trust Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--Subchapter A of chapter 98 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to trust fund code) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 9512. TRUST FUND FOR ANTI-SMOKING ACTIVITIES.\n\n       ``(a) Creation of Trust Fund.--There is established in the \n     Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the \n     `Trust Fund for Anti-Smoking Activities' (hereafter referred \n     to in this section as the `Trust Fund'), consisting of such \n     amounts as may be appropriated or transferred to the Trust \n     Fund as provided in this section or section 9602(b).\n       ``(b) Transfers to Trust Fund.--The Secretary shall \n     transfer to the Trust Fund an amount equivalent to the net \n     increase in revenues received in the Treasury attributable to \n     section   (a) of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and \n     Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     1998, as estimated by the Secretary.\n       ``(c) Distribution of Amounts in Trust Fund.--Amounts in \n     the Trust Fund shall be available, as provided by \n     appropriation Acts, to the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services for anti-smoking programs through the Substance \n     Abuse and Mental Health Administration.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--The table of sections for such \n     subchapter A is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new item:\n\n         ``SEC. 9512. TRUST FUND FOR ANTI-SMOKING ACTIVITIES.''.\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply fuel removed after September 30, 1997.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to have the \nvote on underlying amendment.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HAGEL). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Harkin \namendment to fund the Food and Drug Administration's youth smoking \nprevention initiative at $34 million for fiscal year 1998. This is a \nworthwhile amendment which has my support. I applaud the efforts of Mr. \nHarkin to provide funding for this important initiative. Tobacco use \namong minors is illegal, and we should make every effort to prevent it.\n  I am particularly pleased that the amendment by Mr. Harkin has been \nstrengthened at my urging to encourage States to couple their youth \nsmoking prevention efforts with State laws that prohibit underage \ndrinking. These issues go hand in hand in preventing our youth from \nusing destructive substances.\n  Alcohol is the drug of choice among teens as well as a lot of adults, \nI am sorry to say, and the consequences are devastating. According to \nstatistics compiled by the National Center on Addiction and Substance \nAbuse, among children between the ages of 16 and 17, 69.3 percent have \nat one point in their lifetime experimented with alcohol. In the last \nmonth, approximately 8 percent of the Nation's eighth graders have been \ndrunk.\n  Think of that, eighth graders. Approximately 8 percent of the \nNation's eighth graders have been drunk. What's the matter with the \nparents? I wonder what the parents are doing letting their children in \nthe eighth grade drink. I wouldn't consider myself much of a parent if \nI let my children drink. If they do that, I blame myself. But the fact \nis that 8 percent of the Nation's eighth graders have been drunk. It is \npretty hard to believe. That would not have happened in my day going to \nschool.\n  In 1995, there were 2,206 alcohol-related fatalities of children \nbetween the ages of 15 and 20. According to the National Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, 37.5 percent of \nthe young people who have consumed alcohol have also used some illicit \ndrug, while only 5 percent of young people who have never consumed \nalcohol have used some illicit drug; 26.7 percent of those who have \nconsumed alcohol have tried marijuana, while of those who have never \nconsumed alcohol only 1.2 percent have tried marijuana. And 5 percent \nof youths who have partaken of alcohol have tried cocaine, while of \nthose who do not drink alcohol only one-tenth of 1 percent have tried \ncocaine.\n  So it is not just that alcohol is a real starter not only for more \nalcohol but for illicit drugs, for marijuana, for cocaine.\n  Every State has a law prohibiting the sale of alcohol to individuals \nunder the age of 21. How is it then that two out of every three \nteenagers who drink report that they can buy their own alcoholic \nbeverages? Again, what is wrong with the parents? The parents are \nsleeping on the job. Two out of every three teenagers who drink report \nthat they can buy their own alcoholic beverages. In my case, they would \nbuy a good basting as well. My parents, they would not have put up with \nthat, not with me, nor would other parents back in those days. We are \nliving in a time, of course, when anything goes.\n  Our children are besieged with media messages that create the \nimpression that alcohol can help to solve life's problems, lead to \npopularity, and enhance athletic skills. Do you want to be a good \nathlete? Drink. Drink beer. Do you want to be popular with the girls? \nDrink beer. Do you want to be popular with the boys? Drink beer. The \nmedia messages help to leave that impression. These messages, coupled \nwith insufficient enforcement of laws prohibiting the consumption of \nalcohol by minors, give our Nation's youth the impression that it is OK \nfor them to drink. This impression has deadly consequences. In the \nthree leading causes of death for 15- to 24-year-olds--accidents, \nhomicides and suicides--alcohol is a factor. Alcohol is involved in the \nthree leading causes of death for 15- to 24-year-olds.\n\n  Efforts to curb the sale of alcohol to minors have high payoffs in \nhelping to prevent children from drinking and driving death or injury. \nSo I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Harkin amendment \nto actively address two areas that so seriously harm the physical and \nmental health of our Nation's children. We have seen a great drive on \nin recent years by our Nation to curb the use of tobacco. All that is \nvery well and good. I am not against that at all. But who has the nerve \nto raise the finger against alcohol? Who has the nerve to say, ``Don't \ndrink, period.'' ``Don't drink, period.''\n  I congratulate my colleague, and I thank him for allowing me to join \nin the support of his amendment and for allowing me to add the language \nof my proposal that deals with drinking.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will yield provided, Mr. President, I do not lose the \nfloor. I have to do this----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just wanted to thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nhis addition to this amendment. The Senator from West Virginia, as I \nmentioned earlier, is the leading voice in this Chamber about the \ndangers of alcohol and alcohol addiction, especially drinking under \nage. It has become, like tobacco, the scourge of our Nation, \nespecially, as the Senator said, beer drinking among teenagers in \ncollege, and that is just a gateway to harder alcohol and other drugs.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has done us a great service because \nmost of the data that we have seen indicate that the teenagers who \nillegally buy tobacco also illegally buy alcohol.\n  Sometimes we tend to get blinders on around here; we don't see other \nthings, and I would admit freely and openly that I had been focusing on \nthe teenage smoking and had not thought about the other aspects of the \nteenager who walks in to buy the tobacco. And you can bet your bottom \ndollar, I say to my friend from West Virginia, that if this\n\n[[Page S7918]]\n\ngirl here--as I said earlier, which one of these is underage--you \nreally cannot tell--Melissa or Amy. This one looks the youngest. She \nhas a pair of overalls on. This one looks older. But it turns out this \none is 16 and this one is 25.\n  And you bet your bottom dollar, I ask the Senator from West Virginia, \nif this one, who is 16, walks in and is successful in buying \ncigarettes, then the next thing might be, well, as long as she got by \nwith that, how about a six-pack of beer, too.\n  Mr. BYRD. Sure. Why not?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Why not? So the Senator is right on the mark. As long as \nyou ID them, you better make sure they don't get the alcohol, too.\n  So I thank the Senator from West Virginia for helping us take the \nblinders off to see this has broader implications than just tobacco. \nThis can help us cut down a lot on teenage drinking, and I thank my \nfriend.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. And I say this not in defense of smoking, but \nthe young lady or the young man who buys alcohol, or who buys tobacco \nis not likely to go out and take a smoke and wrap his car around the \ntelephone pole killing himself or possibly some other teenagers or \nstriking an automobile and killing a lady and her daughter who are out \ngrocery shopping.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right on the mark.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I promised the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina, [Mr. Helms], if he would have no objection in my \ncalling off the quorum, I would ask for a quorum when I completed my \nstatement.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina whether----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield for that purpose, for the purpose--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is asking a question of the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I will if the Senator will ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I do not want to get involved in the second-degree \namendment. I just want to deliver a few pearls of wisdom in \nconnection----\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. With the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I promised the Senator from North Carolina, the State whose \nmotto is ``To Be Rather Than To Seem,'' that I would suggest the \nabsence of a quorum when I had finished. I will keep my promise. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following, and \nI believe it has been agreed to on the other side. One, that the yeas \nand nays be deemed to have been ordered on the second-degree amendment, \nthe perfecting amendment; two, that the yeas and nays will be deemed to \nhave been ordered on the underlying amendment; and then, at the \nappropriate time, that the vote to proceed, first on the second-degree \nperfecting amendment, and, if that fails, then there be an up-or-down \nvote on the underlying amendment--meaning that there will be rollcall \nvotes, up or down, on both amendments.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 969, As Modified\n\n  First of all, I send to the desk a modification, before this is acted \non.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 969), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     ASSESSMENT FOR ETHANOL PRODUCERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--For fiscal year 1998, the rate of tax \n     otherwise imposed on a gallon of ethanol under the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 shall be increased by 3 cents and such \n     rate increase shall not be considered in any determination \n     under section 9503(f)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986.\n       (b) Establishment of Trust Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--Subchapter A of chapter 98 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to trust fund code) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 9512. TRUST FUND FOR ANTI-SMOKING ACTIVITIES.\n\n       ``(a) Creation of Trust Fund.--There is established in the \n     Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the \n     `Trust Fund for Anti-Smoking Activities' (hereafter referred \n     to in this section as the `Trust Fund'), consisting of such \n     amounts as may be appropriated or transferred to the Trust \n     Fund as provided in this section or section 9602(b).\n       ``(b) Transfers to Trust Fund.--The Secretary shall \n     transfer to the Trust Fund an amount equivalent to the net \n     increase in revenues received in the Treasury attributable to \n     section (a) of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and \n     Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     1998, as estimated by the Secretary.\n       ``(c) Distribution of Amounts in Trust Fund.--Amounts in \n     the Trust Fund shall be available, as provided by \n     appropriation Acts, to the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services for anti-smoking programs through the Substance \n     Abuse and Mental Health Administration.''. The Secretary is \n     directed to encourage States, in carrying out their \n     responsibilities under the youth tobacco use prevention \n     initiative, to coordinate their enforcement efforts with \n     enforcement of laws that prohibit underage drinking.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--The table of sections for such \n     subchapter A is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new item:\n\n         ``SEC. 9512.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, and I will object. I \ncertainly have no objection to having the yeas and nays, but I prefer \nto do it in the constitutional route, have them ordered by one-fifth of \nthe Senators who are present. For years we have objected to ordering \nthe yeas and nays by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well.\n  Mr. BYRD. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HELMS. I object to the same thing, but I tried to hasten it a \nlittle bit.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. The second-degree amendment, as modified, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has already been modified.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to ordering the yeas and \nnays on the first amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection? Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry. I just want to know where we \nstand. We have now ordered the yeas and nays on both the underlying \namendment and on the perfecting amendment, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I further understand----\n  Mr. HELMS. As modified.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I understand it----\n  Mr. HELMS. No, I mean the second-degree perfecting amendment, as \nmodified.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand. As I further understand, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina asked consent that we have an up-or-down vote on his \namendment, his perfecting amendment, and then an up-or-down vote on the \nunderlying amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the perfecting amendment is defeated.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the perfecting amendment is defeated. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment was objected to.\n\n[[Page S7919]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, this is a new request, as \nI understand it.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. Would this Senator have the right, for \nexample, when Senators have indicated that they do not care to debate \nthe issue any further, to move to table the underlying amendment and \nget the yeas and nays and have a vote on the motion to table the \nunderlying amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not if this agreement were entered into.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Further inquiring of the Chair, there have been two \nunanimous-consent requests granted, or there have been the yeas and \nnays ordered on two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. But now there is a request pending that there be an up-\nor-down vote on both amendments; is that a correct understanding of the \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Iowa making that request?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let this Senator be clear. This Senator, \nin good faith, just went over to my friend from North Carolina and \nasked if we could get past this impasse in the following manner: Could \nwe agree to have the yeas and nays on this Senator's underlying \namendment, then to let the Senator from North Carolina modify his \namendment and then ask for the yeas and nays on that amendment, and \nfurther, we agreed and shook hands that we would then have a vote on \nhis amendment up or down, and then if he failed, then we would have a \nvote up or down on my amendment. I believe that was what the agreement \nwas.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, let me be sure I understand the Senator. \nThe first vote would be on the perfecting amendment, is that it?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct. It would be an up-or-down vote on the \nperfecting amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. And that is the amendment of the Senator from North \nCarolina, is that correct?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes, the perfecting amendment, as modified.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And then if that amendment failed, then there would be an \nup-or-down vote on the underlying amendment, and that is what we are \nasking the Senate to do, to carry out that agreement that we made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Then I gather the Senator from Iowa is making the \npoint that a motion to table the underlying amendment would not be in \norder.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Under this request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is an agreement we have already entered into?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not yet.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I think I am getting to the point here where I don't like \nthis agreement, and, I say with all respect, of what we are trying to \ndo. One, if this agreement is accepted, then as I understand it--and I \nam not as good at the rules as I used to be or should be--but this \nprecludes a tabling motion on the underlying amendment if we agree to \nthis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. And, second, if we agree to this and the second-degree \namendment is defeated, then I am precluded from offering another \namendment in the second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. Then I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum. We are going to be \nhere for a long time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 109) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 109\n\n       Whereas, Canadian fishing vessels blockaded the M/V \n     MALASPINA, a U.S. passenger vessel operated by the Alaska \n     Marine Highway System, preventing that vessel from exercising \n     its right to innocent passage from 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, \n     July 19, 1997 until 9:00 p.m. Monday, July 21, 1997;\n       Whereas the Alaska Marine Highway System is part of the \n     United States National Highway System and blocking this \n     critical link between Alaska and the contiguous States is \n     similar in impact to a blockade of a major North American \n     highway or air-travel route;\n       Whereas the M/V MALASPINA was carrying over 300 passengers, \n     mail sent through the U.S. Postal Service, quantities of \n     fresh perishable foodstuff bound for communities without any \n     other road connections to the contiguous States, and the \n     official traveling exhibit of the Vietnam War Memorial;\n       Whereas international law, as reflected in Article 17 of \n     the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \n     guarantees the right of innocent passage through the \n     territorial sea of Canada of the ships of all States;\n       Whereas the Government of Canada failed to enforce an \n     injunction issued by a Canadian court requiring the M/V \n     MALASPINA to be allowed to continue its passage, and the M/V \n     MALASPINA departed only after the blockaders agreed to let it \n     depart;\n       Whereas, during the past three years U.S. vessels have \n     periodically been harassed or treated in ways inconsistent \n     with international law by citizens of Canada and by the \n     Government of Canada in an inappropriate response to concerns \n     in Canada about the harvest of Pacific salmon in waters under \n     the sole jurisdiction of the United States;\n       Whereas Canada has failed to match the good faith efforts \n     of the United States in attempting to resolve differences \n     under the Pacific Salmon Treaty, in particular, by rejecting \n     continued attempts to reach agreement and withdrawing from \n     negotiations when an agreement seemed imminent just before \n     the Canadian national election of June, 1997;\n       Whereas neither the Government of Canada nor its citizens \n     have been deterred from additional actions against vessels of \n     the United States by the diplomatic responses of the United \n     States to past incidents such as the imposition of an illegal \n     transit fee on American fishing vessels in June, 1994: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That it is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) The failure of the Government of Canada to protect U.S. \n     citizens exercising their right of innocent passage through \n     the territorial sea of Canada from illegal actions and \n     harassment should be condemned;\n\n[[Page S7920]]\n\n       (2) The President of the United States should immediately \n     take steps to protect the interests of the United States and \n     should not tolerate threats to those interests from the \n     action or inaction of a foreign government or its citizens;\n       (3) The President should provide assistance, including \n     financial assistance, to States and citizens of the United \n     States seeking damages in Canada that have resulted from \n     illegal or harassing actions by the Government of Canada or \n     its citizens; and\n       (4) The President should use all necessary and appropriate \n     means to compel the Government of Canada to prevent any \n     further illegal or harassing actions against the United \n     States, its citizens or their interests, which may include--\n       (A) using U.S. assets and personnel to protect U.S. \n     citizens exercising their right of innocent passage through \n     the territorial sea of Canada from illegal actions or \n     harassment until such time as the President determines that \n     the Government of Canada has adopted a long-term policy that \n     ensures such protection;\n       (B) prohibiting the import of selected Canadian products \n     until such time as the President determines that Canada has \n     adopted a long-term policy that protects U.S. citizens \n     exercising their right of innocent passage through the \n     territorial sea of Canada from illegal actions or harassment;\n       (C) directing that no Canadian vessel may anchor or \n     otherwise take shelter in U.S. waters off Alaska or other \n     States without formal clearance from U.S. Customs, except in \n     emergency situations;\n       (D) directing that no fish or shellfish taken in sport \n     fisheries in the Province of British Columbia may enter the \n     United States; and\n       (E) enforcing U.S. law with respect to all vessels in \n     waters of the Dixon Entrance claimed by the United States, \n     including the area in which jurisdiction is disputed.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

There are 2 minutes, equally divided, on the \nmotion to table amendment No. 965, the Durbin Amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand that we have 2 minutes, \nequally divided, on the motion to table the Durbin Amendment. I made \nthe motion to table. The Durbin Amendment seeks to do away with crop \ninsurance payments for tobacco farmers and any disaster assistance \npayments that might fall due under the law. I moved to table it. It \ncarried with it a second degree amendment by the Senator from Kentucky \n[Mr. Ford], which limits crop insurance payments to farms 400 acres or \nsmaller.\n  So, as you may see, unless we table the Durbin amendment, you are \ngoing to cause a lot of disruptions in agriculture for two reasons. I \nhope that the Senate will vote to table this amendment. This is an \nagriculture appropriations bill. Both of these amendments would change \nthe law, not funding levels. Let's stick to the purpose of our bill and \nplease vote to table the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment eliminates the Federal \nsubsidy for tobacco. How many times have we faced that question?\n  Senators, the Federal Government says that tobacco is dangerous. Why \ndo the taxpayers continue to subsidize it? We subsidize it in the form \nof crop insurance.\n  Senator Gregg and I are offering this amendment to eliminate once and \nfor all crop insurance for tobacco. Some Senators have said that is \nunfair. Every crop gets insured. Right? Wrong. Sixty-seven crops are \npresently ensured. Sixteen hundred are not.\n  The list goes on and on and on. I am about to drop them.\n  What is this about? It is about a crop that is perfectly legal and \nperfectly lethal. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in \nAmerica today.\n  Let's get our public health policy and our subsidies straight.\n  So, to vote against the crop insurance for tobacco, the appropriate \nvote is ``no'' on the motion to table and ``no'' on more subsidies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion of the Senator from \nMississippi to lay on the table the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 969, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Helms amendment \nNo. 969.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the issue here was joined with the \noffering of the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Iowa. It is \nan amendment related to the Food and Drug Administration's funds for an \nantismoking regulatory program that has been developed and put out by \nthe Food and Drug Administration. The issue is whether or not there is \nsufficient funds in the FDA account to help pay the cost of this \nregulatory program.\n  Some Senators may not be aware of the fact that we have increased in \nthis legislation the proposed funding for FDA by over $20 million. As a \nmatter of fact, I think the total is around $30 million--$24 million \nfor the FDA account for this next fiscal year. This is in comparison \nwith this current year's funding level. So there are funds available to \ncarry out the additional food safety initiatives that the Food and Drug \nAdministration has proposed. There is a specified $4.9 million \navailable, the same amount as last year, for the FDA's smoking \nregulatory program, or antismoking regulatory program.\n  One thing that has to be kept in mind, I think, to try to understand, \nget a perspective on this issue is that litigation is underway. There \nwas a lawsuit filed in North Carolina. Some of the regulatory \ninitiatives of the FDA were upheld and some are on appeal.\n  Mr. President, the other aspect of this issue is that there has been \na negotiated settlement among attorneys general and the tobacco \nindustry that involves the commitment of the tobacco industry to make \ncertain payments to help pay health costs and Food and Drug \nAdministration activities in connection with the use of tobacco and \ntrying to convince people that smoking tobacco is bad for you.\n  This bill does not in any way try to adversely affect or take away \nfrom any initiative of that kind. We did say, when we were discussing \nthis legislation in the subcommittee and at the full committee, that we \nassumed some funds could be made available from the tobacco industry to \nhelp pay costs that might not be fully funded in this legislation, \ncosts of the Food and Drug Administration. So we see nothing wrong\n\n[[Page S7921]]\n\nwith making that assumption in our bill. The Harkin amendment imposes \nan assessment on tobacco companies that would cause funds then to be \ncreated that could then be given to the FDA for additional program \ncosts.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has offered a second-degree amendment \nchanging the source of the funding from the assessment to an ethanol \nassessment, so that the funds would come from the ethanol program, in \neffect, for the antismoking program of FDA. And so there is where we \nstand now.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered on the Helms amendment. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered on the Harkin amendment. And so that is the \nsituation as I understand it. There was a suggestion that one way to \ndeal with this is to put it before the Senate in the form of a motion \nto table the Harkin amendment.\n  Now, I could make that motion, but I do not want to make that motion \nand cut off the right of Senators who want to speak on this issue. And \nI understand from the Senator from Iowa that he might want to speak \nfurther on it. The Senator from Rhode Island is a cosponsor of the \nHarkin amendment and he wanted to speak. So I am reluctant to make that \nmotion. But it would be my hope that we could resolve the issue in that \nway. If that is not satisfactory to the Senate, the Senate can work its \nwill. But that is the suggestion that I have for dealing with the \nissue, of wrapping it all up in one vote, if the motion to table is \napproved. If the motion to table is not approved, then we have a vote \non the Helms amendment and we have a vote on the Harkin amendment. So \nthat is my suggestion for how we can wrap it all up.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am just one Senator. I am trying to help get this bill \npassed and get this issue resolved, and I hope that that can be \nembraced by the proponents of both sides.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I say to my friend from \nMississippi that the amendment I offered is an entirely separate matter \nthe proposed tobacco settlement that is being worked out with the \nattorneys general and the tobacco companies. In fact, I submitted for \nthe Record earlier a copy of a letter from 33 attorneys general \ninvolved in the tobacco settlement supporting full funding for FDA's \ntobacco initiative. I have also a letter here from Michael Moore, who \nis the attorney general of the State of Mississippi who is the lead \nattorney general in the negotiations. He stated here, ``I would like to \nexpress my strong support for your amendment.'' Dated July 21. That \nwould be 2 days ago.\n  And he said, ``There has been some confusion regarding your amendment \nand whether it would interfere or conflict with the proposed settlement \nwith the tobacco industry.'' He went on to say that he supported it.\n  So this has nothing to do with the proposed tobacco settlement \nwhatsoever. What this has to do with is the part of the proposed FDA \nrule that was upheld by the court in Greensboro, NC. The court upheld \nthe authority of FDA to regulate tobacco sales to minors. The FDA \npromulgated the rule. It was upheld by the courts.\n  Now, the administration has requested $34 million to implement the \nrule. It needs this amount to carry out the rules upheld by the court. \nHowever, in the Agriculture appropriations bill there is only $4.9 \nmillion to implement it. So we cannot reach out to all 50 States to get \nthis rule implemented to cut down on sales of tobacco to young people. \nAnd due to the involvement, I might say the good involvement, of the \nSenator from West Virginia, a provision was added to our amendment that \nsays that in carrying out the responsibilities under the Food and Drug \nAdministration initiative, States are encouraged to coordinate \nenforcement efforts with the enforcement of laws that prohibit under-\nage drinking. That is, I might add, a very worthwhile addition to this \namendment. So I hope Senators are not confused. This has nothing to do \nwith the tobacco settlement whatsoever. This has everything to do with \nwhether or not we are going to have enforcement of the FDA rule to \nprevent sales of tobacco to kids.\n  I would also point out there is some talk that somehow this FDA \ninitiative is duplicative of the SAMHSA regulations. I am informed that \nit is not. This is because SAMHSA is not an enforcement program but FDA \nis. SAMHSA provides no incentives for retailers to stop illegal sales \nto kids. FDA will educate retailers about their responsibility and \npenalize retailers if they repeatedly sell to kids. And so SAMHSA is a \nlot different than FDA's tobacco initiative.\n  Now, why does the FDA need the full $34 million? Well, basically, the \nCourt provided FDA with full authority to regulate cigarettes and \nsmokeless tobacco products and with full authority to continue \nimplementing provisions of the FDA initiative that sets a minimum age \nof 18 for buying tobacco and requires retailers to check the photo ID \nof consumers seeking to purchase tobacco.\n  Given that there are more than a half a million retailers in this \ncountry, it will be a big task to educate retailers about their \nresponsibilities. Funds are also needed to conduct periodic compliance \nchecks. So the $34 million is not that much money given the task at \nhand. The Court did strike down parts of the FDA rule, but resources \nare needed to enforce the minimum age and ID check rules that were \nfully upheld by the Court.\n\n  Mr. President, $34 million is a very small investment when you \nrealize that tobacco use drains more than $50 billion from our health \ncare system each year. So this is a very small amount of money.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. Might I inquire \nof the Chair, what is the business before the Senate? I make a \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate is the Helms \namendment. I believe that is 969.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, Mr. President, I think that we are all very clear \non this. Now, I had in good faith with the Senator from North Carolina \nmade an agreement earlier that I would be permitted the yeas and nays \non my amendment, which required unanimous consent at that point, that \nthe Senator would then be allowed to modify his amendment, which he \ndid, and then we asked for the yeas and nays on the amendment of the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  We could then have a vote on his amendment and then have a vote on my \nunderlying amendment--in other words, a vote first on the amendment of \nthe Senator from North Carolina. If that prevailed, well, that would be \nthe end of it. If it went down, then there would be an up-or-down vote \non my amendment. And the Senator can correct me if I am wrong, but I \nbelieve that was the agreement and we shook hands on it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Iowa yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield only for a question.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I think it might be helpful if we engaged in a few \nquestions and answers to understand precisely what this amendment is. I \nhave not been sure all along I understood it.\n  There is presently a Federal law which prohibits the sale of \ncigarettes to anybody under 18 years of age, is that correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, that is true.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And does the Federal Government provide any funds to the \nStates for enforcement of that law at present?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand that that is, indeed, what the FDA \ninitiative is for, is to provide funds to the States to implement it \nand to carry it out.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The question is, do we provide any money for them at \nthis moment for the enforcement of this law?\n  Mr. HARKIN. This Senator is not aware of any. However, I would not \nunequivocally state there is not.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I understand there is $4.9 million available for that \npurpose, is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S7922]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Arkansas is correct with respect to the \n$4.9 million. As I understand it, the $4.9 million is what is expected \nto be spent this year for the first step in this initiative, this FDA \ninitiative to cut down on tobacco sales to minors under the age of 18. \nThe $4.9 million is the first step in that process.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Now, the administration has asked for an additional $34 \nmillion?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, they have asked for $34 million. That includes the \n$4.9 million.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That includes the present 4-plus million.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. It raises the 4.9 up to 34.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. This money will be distributed to the States to assist \nthem in the enforcement of this law?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Now, if we do not provide--we have imposed, in effect, a \nlaw that we are requesting the States to enforce. We passed a law \nsaying to the States, you can't allow sales of cigarettes to anybody \nunder 18, and we have not given them any money to enforce it. How does \nthat play with the law we passed here either last year or the year \nbefore on mandates to the States with no money?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator will recall the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, [Mr. Kempthorne], led the fight here to provide that the Federal \nGovernment in the future must pay the States for any mandates we impose \non them and for which we do not provide any money. I am asking the \nSenator, why doesn't this come under the category of a violation, as \nlong as we required them to enforce the ``18-year-old'' prohibition, \nbut we haven't given them any money? Why is that not a violation of the \nlaw we passed here prohibiting mandates on local jurisdictions without \nmoney?\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I understand it, what the Senator is suggesting is \nthat this money is to help the Federal Government meet its obligations \nof ensuring that we do not mandate States to do things which we do not \nfund.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Well, essentially that is right, but what I am saying is \nat present we do not give the States but I think maybe $4-plus million, \nwhich is not nearly enough.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might respond, that $4.9 million only covers 10 \nStates. We want to cover 50 States. Thus the need for the $34 million.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me ask the Senator this question, changing gears \njust a little bit. Could the Senator tell us, is there a figure \navailable as to what it would take to effectively enforce this law in \nall 50 States?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am told that figure is $34 million. And that is what \nthey are requesting. They are requesting $34 million to expand it from \n10 States to 50 States.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Under the rule of thumb, I come from a State that has 1 \npercent of the Nation's population. When I was Governor of that State \nwe used to always assume that under all the formulas, welfare and \notherwise, we would get 1 percent, because we have 1 percent of the \npopulation. In this case, if we had $34 million and we put it out on \nthat basis, Arkansas would get $340,000.\n  I don't think that would be enough to even get the water hot, in \nenforcing this law.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I may respond again to the Senator, I think there is a \nbit of confusion here. It is my understanding that the FDA rule does \nnot impose a mandate on States. It imposes an obligation on retailers \nwho sell tobacco or tobacco products not to sell them to anyone under \nthe age of 18. In fact, the rule says that anyone under the age of 27 \nmust provide a valid photo ID to prove their age is over the age of 18. \nThe money that we are seeking here is to go out to the States and local \ncommunities to help them, and to help retailers, enforce and comply \nwith the FDA rule.\n  The FDA rule does not apply to a State. It applies to retailers, and \nnot to a State.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me ask the Senator this question. If the amendment \nof the Senator fails and there is no money going to the States and the \nStates simply take the position that they are not going to enforce this \nrule because they don't have the money to do it, then there will be no \nenforcement?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And there would be no way for the Feds to make them \nenforce it?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is absolutely correct, there is no way we \ncould make them enforce it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If we develop a formula along the lines I mentioned a \nmoment ago, where say my State of Arkansas would get 1 percent, what if \nwe were to say to the Federal Government: We don't like the rule and we \nare not going to enforce it. Keep your $340,000. Would the Federal \nGovernment have any recourse against the State of Arkansas?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, because the States will contract with FDA to help \ncarry out the FDA rule. But there is no mandate that the States have to \nenforce the FDA rule. We are seeking, with this amount of money, $34 \nmillion, a way of implementing the rule through the use of State and \nlocal governments to help enforce this rule. But there is no mandate \nthat they have to do so; absolutely none whatsoever.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. FORD. Could I get in here just a minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Does the Senator from Iowa yield \nto the Senator from Alaska, who is asking to be recognized?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. FORD. May I ask the Senator a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa controls the times.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question from the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. You are talking about funding a regulation and not a \nstatutory provision, isn't that correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. FORD. Isn't it true, under SAMHSA and the so-called Synar \namendment, that the enforcement is there and there is about $1 billion \nin this particular area as block grants? Isn't that true?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond to the Senator this way, and we had this \ndiscussion earlier. The Synar regulation of SAMHSA is not an \nenforcement program. FDA is. SAMHSA provides no incentives for \nretailers to stop illegal sales to kids. Through its tobacco \ninitiative, FDA will educate retailers about their responsibility, and \ncan assess penalties and penalize retailers if they repeatedly sell to \nkids. SAMHSA does not provide enforcement power or enforcement money.\n  Mr. FORD. Under SAMHSA, as I understand it, the States are required \nto certify to SAMHSA that they are carrying out these laws and one of \nthe requirements under SAMHSA, in the so-called Synar amendment, is \nsting operations. So the enforcement is there from the States \ncertifying to SAMHSA that they are complying with the law. And $1 \nbillion is there, as I recall, for the enforcement because, if you \ndon't enforce it and you don't certify it, then you lose your block \ngrants. And that is pretty tough enforcement, in my opinion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I might respond to my friend from Kentucky, that, under \nthe Synar amendment it is true that SAMHSA--SAMHSA imposes an--\n  Mr. FORD. That's Japanese.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sets targets for the States to cut illegal sales to \nminors.\n  Mr. FORD. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If they do not do so, then the State could lose block \ngrant funding--\n  Mr. FORD. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If they do not reduce smoking.\n  Mr. FORD. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But here is the catch. The tobacco industry was \nsuccessful in pulling the teeth from this provision. Synar has no teeth \nbecause there are no hard targets. It is discretionary whether any \nState will lose its block grant. That is why SAMHSA is not an \nenforcement program, no one is going to lose their block grants, \nbecause there are no teeth in the targets. If States miss their \ntargets, they are not going to lose their block grants. To my \nknowledge, no State has.\n  Mr. FORD. I say to my good friend--\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield further without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Under the Synar amendment, the States have passed laws to \ncomply with SAMHSA. And, under that\n\n[[Page S7923]]\n\ncompliance they are required to enforce the law. And they are to so \ncertify. They are to so certify to HHS that they are doing it. And part \nof that requirement is the so-called sting operations, that you \nwouldn't notify an operation that you are going to inspect them.\n  So, this to me is double jeopardy on the States. You are taking \nSAMHSA that can take away their block grants and you have FDA, that you \nare trying to give money to, to enforce something that you already have \nthe enforcement mechanism to do.\n  We may disagree on this, but $1 billion is a lot of money. It is not \nan unfunded mandate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would reply to the Senator from Kentucky again in this \nway. SAMHSA does in fact provide that States should or must enforce \nthis and reduce smoking by passing laws that would do that, to take \naction to do that. However, there are absolutely no teeth at all in \nthis SAMHSA provision because, if States don't do it, there are \nessentially no effective penalties that apply.\n  Mr. FORD. Senator, losing their block grant is a penalty.\n  Mr. HARKIN. A State could conceivably lose its block grant but there \nare no hard targets that hold the states accountable to enforce laws \nthat cut teenage smoking.\n  Mr. FORD. They passed a law saying what you have to do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But there are no teeth saying if you don't meet the \nrequirements of law that you lose their block grants. There are no \nteeth in it.\n  Mr. FORD. It reminds me of the military, the teeth and the tail. I \nbelieve the teeth here have been pulled.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The teeth have been pulled out of SAMHSA. But \nnonetheless, I say to the Senator from Kentucky, that SAMHSA applies to \nthe States. The States do their thing. What the FDA initiative goes to \nare the retailers. The FDA rule goes directly to retailers. And what \nthis money is used for is to go out and contract with State and local \njurisdictions to enforce the rules to prevent teen smoking and to help \nretailers understand what they have to do. And the FDA can absolutely \nset up penalties for retailers who do not comply, who are repeat \noffenders in selling tobacco to underage kids. That is not the case \nunder the SAMHSA rules. I am sorry.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, without the Senator losing his right to the \nfloor, I would like to ask him another question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. FORD. How can States regulate the purchase of cigarettes without \ndealing with retailers? There is no way. Because that is where the \ntobacco is sold. So, therefore, they do deal with retailers. Under the \nSAMHSA rule they have, based on their law in their State, under that \nstatute, to comply with SAMHSA. And you have funded it by $1 billion \nand that is a block grant to the States.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, let's be clear what we are talking \nabout when we are talking about SAMHSA. SAMHSA and the States can pass \na law and they can deal with retailers. But there are no hard targets \nin SAMHSA to say: Here is what you have to do or you will certainly \nlose your block grant. The State can pass all kinds of laws but, if the \nState laws don't meet a target, then SAMHSA has no way of going to the \nState and saying, ``Look, you didn't meet the requirements of the law \nand therefore we will take away your mental health and substance abuse \nblock grants.''\n  If there were, in the Synar amendment, a provision that said that, if \na State, for example, cannot show that by year one they have taken this \nstep and this step and this step, and that they have met the target--if \nin that case they then would lose their block grants, I would then \nagree with the Senator from Kentucky.\n  That is not the case in the Synar amendment. It is a lot of nice \nwords, but it doesn't really get to the heart of it, because there are \nno effective penalties, there is no real trigger, there is no hard \ntarget that, if a State doesn't do something, they then will lose their \nblock grant.\n  On the other hand, the proposed FDA rule upheld by the courts goes to \nthe retailers, and FDA can--not must--but can contract with States and \ncontract with local jurisdictions for enforcement of the FDA rules. FDA \nwill also provide information, resources, support and help through \noutreach. A lot of times the small businesses don't really know what \nthey have to do, and outreach can help them carry out this rule \nrequiring the photo ID under age 27.\n  So I don't want to get this FDA initiative confused with SAMHSA at \nall. This is something entirely different. I don't know if the Senator \nfrom Alaska wanted me to yield for a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Alaska would like to have the floor, \nMr. President.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I was saying earlier before I yielded \nto the Senator from Arkansas, I was talking about the situation that we \nhad agreed to, that I thought I agreed to. I might just also say that \nthe Helms amendment provides no funds to reduce tobacco smoking in any \nway. It creates a 3-cent tax on each gallon of ethanol. It puts it in a \ntrust fund to be used for programs within the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration, but it doesn't allow the money \nto be spent unless funding is included in some appropriations bill. So \nit really doesn't provide an alternative source of funding. It just \nsets up a trust fund that you take money out of ethanol and put in \nthere. But it really doesn't do anything.\n  As I understood it, I had agreed with the Senator from North Carolina \nthat I would not object to a unanimous consent request to have the yeas \nand nays on my amendment, which was required at that point in time; \nthen he would modify his amendment; and then we would have the yeas and \nnays on his amendment; and if we could have an up-or-down vote on his \namendment, which I thought was fair, and if we could have an up-or-down \nvote on my amendment, which I thought would be fair.\n  Now I understand that that may not be the case; that now there may be \na motion made to table the underlying amendment without a vote \nhappening on the Helms amendment. I think there should be a vote on the \nHelms amendment to see whether or not people want to take the money out \nof ethanol and put it into a trust fund which doesn't go anywhere, or \nwhether Senators would rather raise the assessment, as the amendment by \nSenator Chafee and I, and others, does: to raise the marketing \nassessment now from 1 percent to 2.1 percent, remove the half a percent \nthat farmers have to pay now, make tobacco companies pay the full 2.1 \npercent, in order to offset the $34 million needed to fund the FDA's \nyouth tobacco initiative.\n  That really is the essence of the two amendments, and I believe we \nought to have a vote on the two amendments. So, therefore, Mr. \nPresident, I move to table the Helms amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the pending amendment is the amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Carolina to raise a tax. The \nunderlying amendment is an amendment to raise a fee, and then it turns \naround and spends the fee. I view my job as chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee--I beg your pardon, did he make a motion to \ntable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend for just a moment, \napparently we have a motion to table, which is a nondebatable motion.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am sorry. I apologize. I did not hear that motion. \nWhen was the motion made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It apparently was made just prior to the \nSenator from Iowa taking his seat.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it in order to table the \nunderlying amendment now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not at this point in time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I regret that, and I apologize to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the Helms amendment No. 969, as modified. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7924]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 76, nays 24, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 197 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--76\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--24\n\n     Bennett\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     D'Amato\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roth\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 969), as modified, \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 968\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to appeal to the Senate on this \nbill. It is my hope that we can finish this bill tonight and move on to \nState, Justice, Commerce bill tomorrow and finish it before we recess \nfor this week. We still will have two more to do or three more to do \nnext week, in terms of appropriations bills. Our goal has been to try \nand finish all that we can before the recess.\n  Mr. President, this amendment that is pending, the Harkin amendment, \nas I understand it, would require that this bill be referred to Ways \nand Means when it goes to the House. I do not believe that we should be \nhandling this amendment on this bill. The Senator knows that has been \nmy feeling. I am grateful to the Senator for bringing it to the floor \nrather than having a prolonged discussion of it in the Appropriations \nCommittee. But it is my hope that the Senate will understand this \nmotion I am about to make and support it, so that we can keep the \nmomentum we have for our appropriations bills and finish this bill \ntonight. I do not think the bill will be able to be finished tonight \nunless we do get this motion of mine agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the Harkin amendment and \nI will yield in a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the Harkin amendment, and \nI ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield to the Senator from \nIowa, and I also ask unanimous consent that my motion then be set aside \nso that the two leaders can arrange the balance of the program for this \nevening. There are Senators who have problems, as I understand it. The \ntwo leaders will address that. I have made the motion to table, right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion has been made to table.\n  Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The question is on the motion to table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I made a motion to table, and I asked unanimous consent \nthat I be able to listen to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I can't hear anything. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the motion to table \nthe Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I asked the Senator to yield for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator didn't choose to do that. He moved \nto table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the question, Senator?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Alaska stated that this amendment would \nmean that the bill would be referred to the Ways and Means Committee of \nthe House. However, the amendment that Senator Chafee and I offered is \non an assessment that was passed by the Agriculture Committee in 1990, \nnot the Ways and Means Committee. The Ways and Means Committee never \nhad any jurisdiction over this.\n  I am somewhat perplexed as to why this would then go to the Ways and \nMeans Committee, since it was the Agriculture Committee that passed the \nassessment in 1990.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I just want to say that my information was that that \ncommittee of the House has taken one of our bills previously.\n  I do ask for the yeas and nays and renew my request that the leaders \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate will please come to order.\n  The majority leader is now recognized on the leader time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have a unanimous consent request that we \nhave been working on for the past few minutes with the members of the \nAppropriations Committee and the leadership on both sides of the aisle. \nThis will give the Members some clear understanding of what they can \nexpect for the balance of the evening and first thing in the morning.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to table the \nHarkin amendment occur at 6:30 p.m. this evening and, between now and \n6:30, Senator Bryan be recognized to offer an amendment regarding \nmarket promotion and there be 30 minutes for debate to be equally \ndivided in the usual form and the vote occur in relation to that \namendment following the motion to table at 6:30 and no amendments be in \norder to the Bryan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object. I ask that you might \ninclude in the request that I be recognized to offer an amendment \ntonight--it won't be voted on tonight--after the votes on tabling the \nHarkin and Bryan amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator repeat the question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I was asking whether or not you would modify the \nrequest that I be able to offer an amendment after we have those 2 \nvotes tonight. It won't be voted on tonight, I say to colleagues.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I had hoped to do that. I would be willing--\nwell, if I could get an agreement to what I have asked, and then I \nwould like to propound a second unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I don't \nthink I will. I have not seen the Bryan amendment and I think in your \nunanimous consent you stated that there could be no second-degree \namendments, is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. The Bryan amendment is available and we do have 30 minutes \nreserved for debate equally divided, and I don't believe--under the \nrequest we asked for, no second-degree amendments would be in order.\n  Mr. BURNS. I lift the objection. That will be fine.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is still heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I ask the majority leader, \nbecause there is some, I think, misunderstanding here about going to \nthe Ways and Means Committee, which I don't believe is correct, since \ncustoms fees are normally within the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means \nCommittee in any event. There are in this bill more provisions that \ndeal with authorization in\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\nthe agricultural area. I have a letter from Senator Lugar here saying \nthat he supports our amendment, and he finds it fully consistent with \nhis views. So this amendment would not be referred to the Ways and \nMeans Committee of the House. There is other language in the bill that \nis in the authorizing level of the Agriculture Committee. This \nassessment was created in the reconciliation bill of 1990, under the \njurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee. It is not a customs fee. I \nwas wondering whether we could have a few more minutes to discuss this \nissue so we can clear it up.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are working very feverishly trying to \naccommodate a number of Senators that have very important meetings and \nmatters they need to go to. We will have 35 more minutes here in which \ndiscussions or clarifications can be worked out, I hope, or at least an \nunderstanding of what is going on. I personally am not aware of what \njurisdictions are involved. We are just trying to get a time schedule \nhere that would accommodate everybody. I am sure that the Senators will \ncontinue discussing this issue in the meantime.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I understand the UC, there was to be a vote on the \nHarkin amendment at 6:35.\n  Mr. LOTT. That's correct. Between now and 6:30, Senator Bryan will \noffer his amendment, with 30 minutes of debate. During that time, you \ncan continue to talk.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Can we have 5 minutes to discuss my amendment before the \nvote, from 6:30 to 6:35?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I modify my unanimous consent request that \nbetween 6:30 and 6:35 we have 5 minutes of debate, 2\\1/2\\ on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will propound another unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after these two votes, a \nGrams amendment with regard to compact language be in order, followed \nby a Wellstone amendment, followed by the managers' amendment, with the \nvote or votes on those amendments and final passage to occur in the \nmorning at 9:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I had \nsaid to the minority leader that I know colleagues have a schedule \ntonight and are willing to do the amendment. I wanted to have at least \n5 minutes tomorrow to summarize this amendment before people vote. That \nwould be 10 minutes--in other words, 5 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. I modify my unanimous consent request that there be 10 \nminutes, equally divided, before the votes in the morning on the Grams \namendment, if necessary, and the Wellstone amendment, if necessary, and \nthen final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest, as modified?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, is it my understanding \nthat the compact amendment deals with the dairy matter? It is my \nunderstanding that, if it does deal with the dairy matter, there are \nSenators on our side that would object to any time agreement. So we \nwill have to work out additional time agreements in regard to the Grams \namendment before we can agree on this particular--\n  Mr. LOTT. I didn't ask for any time agreements on the Grams amendment \nor the Wellstone amendment, thinking that Senators could have a full \ntime opportunity tonight to discuss their amendments, without time \nlimit. The only time limit would be that we would come in at 9:30 and \nhave 10 minutes on Wellstone, equally divided, and then go to final \npassage.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Unfortunately, the Grams amendment reopens the question \nof the dairy compact, as described to me. That is an extraordinarily \ncontroversial issue involving the Northeast as well as the Midwest. I \nam told that Northeastern Senators would not agree to any time \nagreement so long as this amendment is pending.\n  Mr. LOTT. So that we can get the train underway, we have one UC \nagreed to. Let's have the debate and we will have the votes at 6:30 \nand, in the meantime, we will see if we can work out the final \nagreement that would get us to final votes tonight.\n  I have to say that because we don't have this agreement, then we have \nno conclusion about whether or not there would be additional votes \nafter 6:30. We will try to clarify that when we get through with those \nvotes, sometime shortly before 7.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wish to comment on my vote on tobacco \nfarmers' eligibility for Federal crop insurance. I begin by noting that \nno substance rivals tobacco in its negative impact on our Nation's \nhealth: It is estimated that tobacco use is responsible for the \npremature deaths of 400,000 people annually.\n  Caught up in the battle between elected and public health officials \nand tobacco companies are the tobacco farmers, whose honest labor is \nspent raising this dangerous but unfortunately often lucrative crop. It \nis contradictory at best--and irrational at worst--for the American \ntaxpayers to on the one hand pay for the medical costs associated with \ntobacco use, and on the other, pay to subsidize tobacco production \nthrough reduced-rate crop insurance. For this reason, I oppose \ncontinuing to provide tobacco farmers with taxpayer-subsidized crop \ninsurance.\n  I do, however, believe that tobacco growers ought to be given \nreasonable warning that they stand to lose their Federal insurance, \nenabling them to find comparable coverage in the private insurance \nmarket. To me, it is simply an issue of fairness. I was troubled by the \nimmediacy of the Durbin amendment's provisions, and, though I supported \nits objective, voted against it for this reason.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 970\n\n       (Purpose: To limit funding for the market access program)\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Grams, and Mr. Reid, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 970.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Beginning on page 63, strike line 24 and all that follows \n     through page 64, line 5, and insert the following:\n       Sec. 718. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to provide assistance under, or to pay the salaries \n     of personnel who carry out, a market promotion or market \n     access program pursuant to section 203 of the Agricultural \n     Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5623)--\n       (1) that provides assistance to the United States Mink \n     Export Development Council or any mink industry trade \n     association;\n       (2) to the extent that the aggregate amount of funds and \n     value of commodities under the program exceeds $70,000,000; \n     or\n       (3) that provides assistance to a foreign person (as \n     defined in section 9 of the Agricultural Foreign Investment \n     Disclosure Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 3508)).\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, as I understand the unanimous consent, it \nis 30 minutes equally divided, if I might inquire of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today, along with Senator \nKerry, Senator Gregg, and Senator Grams, addresses a continuing misuse \nof taxpayer dollars by the now infamous Market Access Program, which \nhas previously been known as the Market Promotion Program, and before \nthat the Targeted Export Assistance Program.\n  As most Senators know, I have worked to eliminate this unjustifiable \nprogram for more than 5 years. But the resilient program keeps coming \nback to life under different names and without the consent of the full \nSenate. When efforts to eliminate the program have been blocked, I have \ntried to reform the program and end its subsidies to large corporate \nand foreign interests. Twice now the Senate has voted to reduce funding \nfor this program to a level of $70 million annually, and twice the \nfunding has been restored off the Senate floor.\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\n  Today, I am asking the Senate to join me once again to put an end to \nthis program's abuses. It is inexcusable to allow this program to \ncontinue to funnel Americans hard-earned tax dollars to foreign \ncompanies to subsidize their advertising budgets. When the Market \nAccess Program was created more than 10 years ago it was called the \nTargeted Export Assistance Program and was intended to be used by trade \norganizations to counter unfair trading practices by foreign \ncompetitors to disadvantage U.S. exports, and reduce funds from the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation to promote \nU.S. goods in foreign markets. I don't think that anyone would disagree \nthat expanding foreign markets for U.S. products is an important part \nof the overall competitive trade strategy. However, as this program \nevolved over the past 10 years the program was no longer limited to \nexporters facing unfair competition. Even as this body labored to cut \nback on Federal expenditures, scarce U.S. tax dollars continued to flow \nto major U.S. corporations as well as to foreign companies.\n  Make no mistake. We are talking about more than $1.5 billion given \naway to corporate entities over the past decade. Unlike the Promotion \nAssistance Program provided through the Department of Commerce, these \nare grants. So they are never repaid.\n  From 1986 to 1993, nearly $100 million of Market Promotion Program \nfunds went to foreign companies. From 1993 to 1995, the program gave \nroughly $10 million to $12 million each year to foreign corporations.\n  Many of my colleagues will recall that I joined with the \ndistinguished ranking member of this subcommittee, Senator Bumpers, to \ntry to end this blatant waste of taxpayer dollars, and the Senate \nbacked us in our efforts. During consideration of the 1996 farm bill, \nthe Senate voted 59 to 37 in favor of my amendment to prevent Market \nAccess Program funds from flowing to foreign companies. The amendment \nprovided that only ``small business,'' as defined by the Small Business \nAdministration, and Kapra Vaultsted Cooperatives, would provide for \nassistance through programs.\n  In addition, funds for the program which were at that time set at \n$110 million were capped at $70 million. So the Senate has been on \nrecord to limit the amount of money in this program at $70 million and \nto eliminate money from this program going to foreign companies.\n  I make it clear. My preference would be to eliminate the entire \nprogram because I believe this is corporate welfare in its worst form. \nThat has not been the will of the Senate. But twice the Senate has been \non record capping this program and preventing money from going to \nforeign companies.\n  In reviewing the action of the Foreign Agriculture Service since the \n1996 farm bill changes took effect, it is clear however, that the \nForeign Agriculture Service has not carried out the intent of the \nSenate in spite of the Senate's action to bar the distribution of \nMarket Access Program funds to foreign companies. Companies based in \nthe United Kingdom, Australia, and Saudi Arabia received more than \n$475,000 in fiscal year 1996 through this same program.\n  There is a partial list of foreign companies that received funds \nafter the Senate added in the 1996 agriculture bill a prohibition \nagainst money going to foreign companies. They did it by an ingenious \nbut somewhat convoluted definition of what constitutes a foreign \ncompany.\n  The purpose of this amendment is simply to do what the Senate has \ngone on record to do twice before, and that is to cap the amount of \nmoney going into the program at $70 million and to prevent money from \ngoing to foreign companies.\n  I ask my colleagues to be supportive of this amendment.\n  If I might cite an example. The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute \nhas received $55 million through this program since 1987. Supporters of \nthis corporate giveaway would no doubt point out the importance of \nsupporting Alaskan industry in foreign markets. But the Alaskan Seafood \nMarketing Institute gave at least $724,000 to USDA-listed foreign \ncorporations in 1996 alone.\n\n  So I must say it boggles the mind to imagine how much money has gone \nto these same companies since the program began in 1986.\n  The National Peanut Council in 1996 distributed $50,000 to Internut \nGermany, $60,000 to Felix Polska, and $30,000 to the Basamh Trading \nCompany of Saudi Arabia. All three of these companies were openly \nlisted as foreign on the USDA list in past years. Yet, they continue to \nreceive funds from the Market Access Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator has used 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I reserve remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  One part of the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Nevada \nsuggests that foreign corporations should not be eligible for funds \nunder this provision of our bill.\n  Our bill does not contain any language relating to this program \nbecause we are not limiting the spending of funds that are directed by \nthe legislative language in the farm bill. The last farm bill that was \npassed directs that funds be made available by the Department of \nAgriculture for this program in the amount of $90 million. Our bill \ndoes not limit the use of those funds. It does not any further restrict \nthe use of those funds.\n  The amendment the Senator has offered will change existing \nlegislative language. I want to read the amendment.\n\n       Funds made available to carry out this section shall not be \n     used to provide direct assistance to any foreign for-profit \n     corporation, or the corporation's use in promoting foreign-\n     produced products. It shall not be used to provide direct \n     assistance to any for-profit corporation that is not \n     recognized as a small business concern described in section \n     3(a) of the Small Business Act, ``excluding a cooperative . . \n     . an association described in the first section of the act,'' \n     et cetera--``. . . a nonprofit trade association.''\n\n  So the whole point is that this program has been reformed, reformed, \nand reformed. The Senator from Nevada just cannot be pleased that this \nprogram continues to be authorized and funded and funded. Our committee \nis simply letting the funds be used, as directed by law, by the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  So what he is suggesting is cut the funds that are directed by law to \nbe spent by the Department of Agriculture on this program, and to \nfurther restrict them with additional legislative language.\n  What amount of reform is going to be enough? I mean it gets to the \npoint where I suggest we are nit-picking this program now. Once upon a \ntime there were charts in here with McDonald's hamburger signs saying \nthat they were benefiting from this program, and we were appropriating \nmoney that was being used by huge corporations to increase their sales. \nAll the program was ever designed to do was to combat unfair trade \npractices overseas in foreign markets where we were trying to compete \nfor our share of the market in the sale of agriculture commodities and \nfood products. We were giving the Department of Agriculture money. It \nwas called the Targeted Export Assistance Program first. Then it was \nthe Market Promotion Program. Now it is the Market Access Program. We \ncan't even get the right name so that it is acceptable. So the Senator \ncontinues to make changes.\n  I think we ought to just say this program is working. It is \nincreasing sales of U.S. farm-produced commodities in overseas markets. \nThere is a limited amount of money available. It is prescribed by law.\n  Everyone here had a chance to debate the farm bill. We had a chance \nto debate all of the limiting language that any Senator wanted to \noffer. And that was done. It is over with. It is not being abused \nanymore, if it ever was. It is not being subjected to any kind of abuse \nthat I know anything about.\n\n  So my suggestion to the Senate is to table this amendment and get on \nwith the consideration of the rest of the bill. It is not necessary to \nadopt it to seek any reforms that need to be made.\n  So I am hoping the Senate will reject the amendment and vote for the \nmotion to table.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n[[Page S7927]]\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself another 4 minutes, and I would certainly \nprovide whatever time the distinguished ranking member would like to \nspeak if he chooses to comment on this.\n  Madam President, let me just point out that this program ought to be \neliminated. The Senate has been resistant. But the Senate has gone on \nrecord twice as having said the program ought to be limited to $70 \nmillion. The present level would be $90 million.\n  So this amendment seeks to in effect do what the Senate twice has \ngone on record as trying to accomplish.\n  Second, my colleagues will recall that the other part of the \namendment that we offered was passed by a vote of 59 to 31, which, I \nbelieve, was to eliminate money going to foreign companies.\n  The bureaucracy is extraordinarily creative and ingenious. So \ncompanies that have historically since the advent of this program back \nin the 1980's were designated as foreign companies miraculously under a \nnew definition after the Congress--this is the current law--went on \nrecord as saying not to allow this money to go to foreign companies. \nThey have redefined ``foreign companies'' as ``nonforeign'' or \n``domestic companies'' for purposes of this legislation.\n  So one of the reforms that we thought that we got enacted in the last \nCongress--that is, to eliminate the flow of money to companies like \nthis to Saudi Arabia, to France, to the Netherlands, to Germany, to \nCanada, the United Kingdom, and other companies. We thought we had \nclosed that door. But the Foreign Agriculture Service had redefined \nwhat constitutes a foreign company.\n  So what this amendment tries to do is to reinstate the intent of the \nSenate as passed by an overwhelming margin, and is currently the law to \nprohibit the flow of money in this program, the taxpayer dollars to \nforeign companies.\n  I hope my colleagues will be supportive of this amendment as they \nhave on two previous occasions.\n  I yield the floor but reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I know of no other Senators who are \nseeking recognition on this issue.\n  Might I inquire how much time remains under the order on the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 10 minutes, \nand the Senator from Nevada has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield myself the additional 10 \nminutes.\n  I was just handed a chart that shows how much money comparatively is \nbeing spent on export or market promotion by the European Union as \ncompared with how much we are spending in the United States of taxpayer \nfunds for the same purpose.\n  I do not have one of these big charts on an easel, and I don't know \nif everybody can see this, but this big colored part of the chart here \nis how much is spent by the European Union, and it is $10.11 billion. \nThis is this year. You cannot see anything on the other side except \nwhite, but if you look very, very carefully, you can see just a little \nbit of a line here and it is $0.15 billion. And the Senator is trying \nto cut that further.\n  Now, think about it. The European Union is spending more money \npromoting the sale of wine than we are spending as a nation in our \nFederal programs on all of our United States-produced commodities and \nfoodstuffs that are being sold in the overseas markets. Think about it. \nAnd this program is available only to trade associations, cooperatives \nand small businesses. Think about it.\n  Now, this is getting ridiculous. We have changed this program every \ntime it has come up, or changes have been attempted every time it has \ncome up. It has been reformed and modified and refocused. We are trying \nto give the Department of Agriculture some funds to use in situations \nwhere our exporters are being denied access to markets or are being \nunfairly treated in some way by barriers that are being erected to \nprevent the sale of United States-produced agriculture foodstuffs and \ncommodities.\n  Whose side are we on, for goodness sakes? Think about this. We are \nbeing asked to cut the program more and to limit it more so it is tied \ndown tighter than you can imagine.\n  Finally, I think those who ask for access to these funds, these \nmarket access program funds are going to finally give up. It is going \nto be so much red-tape, so many new rules and regulations, that it is \ngoing to take a whole firm of lawyers to figure out how to get some of \nthese funds to use if you need them.\n  I am hoping that the Senate will say OK, enough is enough. In the \nfarm bill of last year--year before last--language was used to try to \ndefine as carefully as could be the authority for using these funds, \nand the amount of money was not given any discretion at all in terms of \nthe appropriations process. It was directed in the farm bill that $90 \nmillion be spent or made available to the Department of Agriculture to \nspend under these tightly constricted and restrained definitions. Now \nthe Senator is saying the appropriations bill, because it does not \nlimit the expenditure of these funds that are directed, ought to be \namended so that it will, and that there ought to be further limitations \non the spending. I say I think enough is enough. We have reformed the \nprogram.\n  There is a coalition of exporters that has written me a letter again \nsaying that the Senate, they understand, may have to consider another \namendment to further reduce or eliminate funding for the Market Access \nProgram. A similar amendment was defeated last year, they point out in \nthis letter. The program has been substantially reformed and reduced; \nit is targeted toward farmer-owned cooperatives, small businesses and \ntrade associations; it is administered on a cost-share basis with \nfarmers and ranchers and other participants; they are required to \ncontribute as much as 50 percent toward the program costs; on and on \nand on.\n  Here is a list of all of those who are a part of this coalition, \ndouble-spaced columns here, a whole page of U.S. agriculture producers \nand growers trying to sell our share in the world market. Exports have \nbecome so important to U.S. agriculture. There are markets out there \nthat are growing and expanding. There are opportunities for us. They \ncreate jobs here in the United States for our U.S. citizens. Vote for \nAmerica for a change. Vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. My friend and colleague from Mississippi propounded, I \nthink, a very fair question. Whose side are you on? Those who support \nthe Bryan amendment are on the side of the American taxpayer. I believe \nthat whether you come from a farm State or nonfarm State, when you are \ntold that your hard-earned tax dollars go to foreign companies, that is \noffensive. I think it is not only offensive, it is without \njustification.\n  How can we call upon the American people, in effect, to subsidize \nforeign companies with their own tax dollars. It is my view that this \nprogram is corporate welfare. It is also my view that this program \nought to be eliminated. But that is not the issue today. The issue \ntoday is whether you favor cutting off money, taxpayer dollars, to \nforeign companies such as these that are illustrated here from Saudi \nArabia, from France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. We tried to \ndo that. We tried to do that. But the bureaucrats have come up with \nsome convoluted definition of what constitutes a foreign company that \nnow makes it possible for foreign companies to receive these moneys \nnotwithstanding the overwhelming vote of the Senate to express its \ndispleasure.\n  I could not resist a comment when my friend from Mississippi talked \nabout the reforms that have taken place. This is a program that is in \nneed of elimination. But I will say to you that the General Accounting \nOffice as recently as March of this year had this to say about this \nMarket Access Program, and I quote:\n\n       Adequate assurance does not exist to demonstrate that \n     Market Access Program funds are supporting additional \n     promotional activities rather than simply replacing company \n     industry funds.\n\n  So, in effect, what is occurring here is a big scam, and the American \ntaxpayer is the victim. Companies that receive these subsidies simply \nreduce the amount of money of their own corporate funds for their \nadvertising budget and have it supplemented at the expense of the \ntaxpayer. That neither encourages nor helps agricultural exports\n\n[[Page S7928]]\n\nnor helps American agriculture, but it certainly dips deep into the \ntaxpayer pocket, as it has for many, many years.\n  This is the time to eliminate one of the fundamental abuses. That is \nmoney going to foreign companies. We thought we had done that in the \nlast Congress. This definition in this amendment tightens that loophole \nthat apparently the bureaucrats have been able to find and would put a \ncap which the Senate has previously voted on at $70 million.\n  I will yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am pleased once again to join with my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, as a cosponsor of his \namendment to reduce funding for the Market Access Program [MAP]. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this effort to scale back funding for the \nMarket Access Program by $20 million for fiscal year 1998.\n  I would like to eliminate totally the Market Access Program, formerly \nknown as the Market Promotion Program. This is a subsidy program which \nhas been roundly criticized by research institutes across the political \nand economic spectrum--the National Taxpayers' Union, the Progressive \nPolicy Institute, Citizens Against Government Waste, the Cato \nInstitute, and others.\n  The MAP Program makes possible some of the most obvious cases of \ncorporate welfare to which we can point in the Federal budget today. \nBut, as my friend from Nevada knows, we have tried year after year to \nterminate this program which has funneled more than $1 billion of \ntaxpayer money into the advertising budgets of some major American \ncorporations. Unfortunately, our efforts to eliminate this program have \nbeen unsuccessful, but we have proscribed some of the more egregious \nuses of MAP funds.\n  For example, American taxpayers no longer will be subsidizing the \nadvertising expenses of the mink industry to promote fashion shows \nabroad. My amendment to the MAP passed the Senate last year and I am \npleased that the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nAgriculture Subcommittee have agreed to continue this prohibition \nanother year. In addition, last year, the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas, Senator Bumpers, and Senator Bryan successfully led the fight \nto limit this program to small businesses and agricultural co-\noperatives. That was another giant step in the right direction--\ntaxpayers should not be subsidizing the foreign advertising accounts of \nMcDonald's, Gallo Wines, M, Tyson's and all the other corporate \ngiants that have received MAP funds in the past.\n  American taxpayers also should not be asked to subsidize foreign \nfirms. And this program has benefited foreign companies. From 1986-\n1993, $92 million of MPP funds went to foreign-based firms. Senator \nBryan successfully passed an amendment that will keep MAP funds from \ngoing to foreign corporations. Yet, as we heard while he described his \namendment today, more than 40 foreign companies received funding from \nthe MAP last year. This is outrageous, and makes obvious the necessity \nfor the distinguished Senator's amendment.\n  At a time when we are asked to cut back on education funding, on \nMedicare, on environmental programs, how can we justify paying the \nadvertising expenses of foreign agricultural companies?\n  Our work to eliminate corporate welfare from this program certainly \nis not finished. As long as foreign-owned companies with subsidiaries \nin the United States are still able to receive subsidies to advertise \ntheir products in their own countries, I will be back in this Chamber \narguing against this program. I am hopeful that the Senate will pass \nthis amendment today, because it will take us a long way toward the \ngoal of removing the nonsensical from this program by eliminating \nfunding for foreign-owned subsidiaries and for large corporations.\n  I think most Americans are not even aware that this kind of egregious \nsubsidy is taking place, and when I discuss this program with people in \nmy state, they express astonishment and dismay. They know it is \ninappropriate and unnecessary, and measured against the other choices \nwe are making here, it is plainly and simply wrong.\n  I commend my distinguished colleague from Nevada, Senator Bryan, for \nhis continuing leadership fighting inappropriate Federal subsidies, and \nthe MAP in particular. He and I have joined forces in this effort on so \nmany occasions, fighting against the wool and mohair subsidy, fighting \nthe mink subsidy, fighting wasteful subsidies in the MAP Program. I \nurge all my colleagues to vote for this amendment to reduce funding for \nthe Market Access Program.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I urge that the amendment be defeated. \nI am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the Record a copy of \na letter to me from the Coalition to Promote U.S. Agricultural Exports \nthat I referred to in my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Coalition to Promote\n\n\n                                    U.S. Agricultural Exports,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: It is our understanding the Senate may \n     consider the FY 1998 agriculture appropriations bill as early \n     as today. Accordingly, we want to take this opportunity to \n     urge your strong opposition to any amendment which may \n     further reduce or eliminate funding for USDA's Market Access \n     Program (MAP). A similar amendment was defeated last year by \n     a 55-42 vote.\n       MAP has been substantially reformed and refocused. It is \n     now specifically targeted towards farmer-owned cooperatives, \n     small businesses and trade associations. Further, it is \n     administered on a cost-share basis with farmers and ranchers, \n     and other participants, required to contribute as much as 50 \n     percent or more toward the program's cost. In addition to \n     encouraging U.S. agricultural exports, it has helped create \n     and maintain needed jobs throughout the economy. Over one \n     million Americans have jobs which depend on U.S. agricultural \n     exports.\n       The program is also a key part of the new 7-year farm bill \n     (FAIR ACT of 1996), which gradually reduces direct income \n     support to farmers over 7 years and eliminates acreage \n     reduction programs, while providing greater planting \n     flexibility. As a result, farm income is more dependent than \n     ever on maintaining and expanding exports, which now account \n     for as much as one-third or more of domestic production. The \n     export market, however, continues to be extremely competitive \n     with the European Union and other countries heavily \n     outspending the U.S. when it comes to market development and \n     promotion efforts. Recently, the European Union announced a \n     major new initiative aimed at Japan--the largest single \n     market for U.S. agriculture. This underscores the continued \n     need for MAP and similar programs.\n       Enclosed for your use are additional fact sheets, including \n     a table highlighting the value of agricultural exports and \n     number of export-related jobs by state.\n       Again, we appreciate your leadership and support on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                       Coalition Membership--1997\n\n     Ag Processing, Inc.\n     Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute\n     American Farm Bureau Federation\n     American Forest & Paper Association\n     American Hardwood Export Council\n     American Meat Institute\n     American Plywood Association\n     American Seed Trade Association\n     American Sheep Industry Association\n     American Soybean Association\n     Blue Diamond Growers\n     California Agricultural Export Council\n     California Canning Peach Association\n     California Kiwifruit Commission\n     California Pistachio Commission\n     California Prune Board\n     California Table Grape Commission\n     California Tomato Board\n     California Walnut Commission\n     Cherry Marketing Institute, Inc.\n     Chocolate Manufacturers Association\n     CoBank\n     Diamond Walnut Growers\n     Eastern Agricultural and Food Export Council Corp.\n     Farmland Industries\n     Florida Citrus Mutual\n     Florida Citrus Packers\n     Florida Department of Citrus\n     Ginseng Board of Wisconsin\n     Hop Growers of America\n     International American Supermarkets Corp.\n     International Dairy Foods Association\n     Kentucky Distillers Association\n     Mid-America International Agri-Trade Council\n     National Association of State Departments of Agriculture\n     National Cattlemen's Beef Association\n     National Confectioners Association\n     National Corn Growers Association\n     National Cotton Council\n     National Council of Farmer Cooperatives\n     National Dry Bean Council\n     National Grange\n     National Hay Association\n     National Grape Cooperative Association, Inc.\n     National Milk Producers Federation\n     National Peanut Council of America\n     National Pork Producers Council\n     National Potato Council\n     National Renderers Association\n\n[[Page S7929]]\n\n     National Sunflower Association\n     NORPAC Foods, Inc.\n     Northwest Horticultural Council\n     Pet Food Institute\n     Produce Marketing Association\n     Protein Grain Products International\n     Sioux Honey Association\n     Southern Forest Products Association\n     Southern U.S. Trade Association\n     Sun-Diamond Growers of California\n     Sun Maid Raisin Growers of California\n     Sunkist Growers\n     Sunsweet Prune Growers\n     The Catfish Institute\n     The Farm Credit Council\n     The Popcorn Institute\n     Tree Fruit Reserve\n     Tree Top, Inc.\n     Tri Valley Growers\n     United Egg Association\n     United Egg Producers\n     United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association\n     USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council\n     USA Poultry & Egg Export Council\n     USA Rice Federation\n     U.S. Apple Association\n     U.S. Feed Grains Council\n     U.S. Livestock Genetics Export, Inc.\n     U.S. Meat Export Federation\n     U.S. Wheat Associates\n     Vinifera Wine Growers Association\n     Vodka Producers of America\n     Washington Apple Commission\n     Western Pistachio Association\n     Western U.S. Agricultural Trade Association\n     Wine Institute\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, am I correct that 5 minutes is now running \non the debate on the Harkin amendment with 2\\1/2\\ minutes equally \ndivided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not yet running.\n  Mr. FORD. May I be recognized since there is no pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair. And I might get a few more minutes here.\n  The motion to table the Harkin amendment is significant because the \nSenator from Iowa talked about the goals; there were no goals under the \nSAMHSA amendment or what we refer to as the Synar amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank my neighbor. I have in my hand the explanation and \nrationale for the budget request of FDA as it relates to tobacco. There \nis not a goal in here. There is not a goal in here. So if SAMHSA does \nnot have a goal, then FDA does not have one. So if the teeth are not in \nthe SAMHSA amendment, there are no teeth in the FDA amendment that the \nSenator from Iowa said there were.\n\n  So it is a little bit confusing to me for him to say that FDA has a \ngoal and they have teeth, and yet when you look at the explanation of \nthe program, the rationale for the budget request, there is no goal in \nhere, none whatsoever. None whatsoever. We hear a lot about health, but \nthe enforcement is there. The enforcement under SAMHSA is there. The \nability to take from the States is there--that is enforcement--to carry \nout and comply with the law.\n  Now, this is double jeopardy. We have SAMHSA on one side telling the \nStates what to do. They passed a law. Now we are trying to give FDA $34 \nmillion, taken directly from the farmers' pocket--whether you want to \nagree with that or not--and say FDA is going to get involved, also. It \njust does not seem fair. Then the $34 million that we have, that the \nSenator is asking for, is the budget request of the administration \nprior to the court case which threw out several of these items and, \ntherefore, $34 million would not be needed anyhow.\n  So, I say to my colleagues, tobacco is something that everybody wants \nto shoot at. But what we forget about is the farmer. He is sitting \nthere. He does not set a price on anything. What will you give me? So \nthey say the manufacturers will pay all of it. They just reduce the \nprice of tobacco, and the farmer pays for it. He pays for the \nwarehouse; he pays for the grading; he pays the deficit reduction \ncharge. All these are paid by the farmer before he gets the check. So \nnow we find ourselves saying FDA has rules to go by. There are no \nrules. The Senator from Iowa gave me this piece of paper, and there are \nno criteria in here that say the States have to do anything, if they \nwant to give them money to enforce it. Well, it is already there, and \nthe States have already passed the laws.\n  So, Madam President, I will yield the floor and I still have the \nopportunity to get 2\\1/2\\ minutes, I understand. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 5 minutes equally divided on the \nHarkin amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I understand we have 2\\1/2\\ minutes. Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just listened to my friend from Kentucky--and he is my \nfriend, I mean that in all sincerity--talking about this amendment not \nbeing fair. Madam President, what is not fair is this: Kids all over \nAmerica walking into gas stations, small retail outlets, not being \nasked to show an ID, buying cigarettes and getting hooked, getting \nhooked on tobacco. That is what is not fair. That is what is not fair, \nand that is what this amendment seeks to prevent.\n  The FDA promulgated a rule. The tobacco companies took them to court. \nThe court in Greensboro, NC, upheld that part of the FDA rule that says \nFDA can set a minimum age for tobacco purchases and require that retail \nestablishments have to card anyone who appears to be under 27. The \nCourt said FDA can promulgate that rule. The rule is in place.\n  What our amendment does is provide some money to the States and local \njurisdictions to enforce the rules and also money to help the private \nestablishments meet their obligations not to sell to minors and to have \nan ID check on young people so they do not buy tobacco when they are \nunder the age of 18. That is what is fair. States need the funds.\n  This funding for FDA's youth tobacco initiative is supported by 33 \nattorneys general from around the country who have been part of this \ntobacco settlement that they are working on. The attorney general of \nMississippi, Mike Moore, wrote me a letter supporting this amendment \nsaying it would not interfere or conflict with the proposed tobacco \nsettlement.\n  Lastly, this offset is totally within the jurisdiction of the \nAgriculture Committee. It is supported by both Chairman Lugar and by \nme, the ranking member. This amendment will not go to the Ways and \nMeans Committee. It is under Agriculture's jurisdiction. It was in the \n1990 reconciliation bill and it is today.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Harkins's \namendment to increase the tobacco deficit-reduction assessment and \ndevote the proceeds to enforcement of the Food and Drug \nAdministration's rules to deter underage smoking.\n  Senator Harkin has discussed this amendment with me and I find it \nfully consistent with my own views on the urgency of preventing \nsmoking. The increased assessment will still contribute to future \ndeficit reduction because it will assist us in preventing smoking. When \na young person makes the mistake of beginning to smoke, serious health \nrisks are created for the individual. The problems do not end here, \nhowever. A decision to smoke is also a decision to increase potential \nfuture health care costs. Many of these costs are borne by the Federal \nand State governments. People who do not begin smoking will be less a \nburden on the Nation's health care system and on the Nation's treasury.\n  The primary benefit of the amendment, however, will be on the lives \nof individual young people. If they do not begin smoking in youth, they \nare unlikely to start once they attain greater maturity. Preventing \nsmoking at an especially vulnerable age is a national priority and I \ncommend Senator Harkin for advancing it in this amendment.\n\n[[Page S7930]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Rhode Island, and thank him for his support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I stand in strong support of the Harkin \namendment. We know today 90 percent of the adults who are smoking \nstarted when they were children. We know, if current trends continue, 5 \nmillion kids today under 18 years old will die because of smoking \nrelated diseases. We know all this, yet we are doing nothing effective \nto stop the use of tobacco products by children under 18 years of age.\n  The Harkin amendment would actually provide resources to ensure that \nthe FDA regulations are enforced. That, to me, is the most critical \ntest. I believe we should support this amendment wholeheartedly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. There are \n2\\1/2\\ minutes available on the other side.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I have made this motion to table. We \nhave an extraordinary procedure, having the right to debate before it \nis voted upon, but, in fairness, I thought that should be the case.\n  Let me state to the Chair and the Senate, we have checked with the \nWays and Means Committee. The tax counsel for that committee has \ninformed my staff that this provision will require a review by the Ways \nand Means Committee. What it is, it is a revenue-raising measure. This \nis an appropriations bill, a bill to spend money. It is not a bill for \nlegislation. Until just a couple of years ago, we had a point of order \nabout legislation on appropriations bills. That is no longer a valid \ntechnique for us to control the bill. The only way we can control a \nbill and keep amendments like this off is to have a motion to table.\n  I urge the Senate to come back to our senses concerning legislation \non appropriations bills, particularly legislation that raises money. \nThe House is the place where revenue-raising measures start, under the \nConstitution. They have every right to take this bill to their \ncommittee. I do not disagree with the purpose that the Senator from \nIowa seeks to fulfill with this money. But if he wants to do it, he \nshould go to the legislative committees and have the tax committees \nraise the money, and then we will help him spend it. Our job is to \nspend money, not to raise money.\n  This is a wrong provision on this bill. It is going to delay. We are \nnot through tonight. I don't think we are through with this amendment \nunless we table it.\n  Beyond that, if it passes, it is going to go over and this bill will \ngo to the Ways and Means Committee, and the Ways and Means Committee \nwill send it back to the Senate. That is no way to handle \nappropriations bills.\n  I have tried my best as Appropriations Committee chairman to move \nthese bills, to move them through, to be absolutely fair in \nconsideration of provisions that could be in an appropriations bill. \nThe Senator has part of his amendment which provides money to spend to \nFDA. We don't have that money. So what he does, he also puts in a \nprovision to raise revenue. We do not have that right in an \nappropriations bill. The Senate doesn't have that right. Revenue-\nraising measures must start in the House of Representatives.\n  I urge the Senate to read the Constitution, read it again, and table \nthis amendment. Because that is the only way to handle amendments like \nthis, is to table them, now, under our procedure. I believe we should \nnot vote on this in a substantive way. We should table it and leave it \nto the tax-raising committees to raise the revenue. We should handle \nspending.\n  Has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have another unanimous-consent request we \nwould like to make on the amendments that are pending and how we can \nget to a conclusion. Then we can advise the Members that there would be \nno more votes tonight if we can get this agreement worked out. I think \nwe have talked to all the interested Senators, and we should get this \nagreed to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following be the only remaining \namendments in order and they be limited to relevant second-degrees and \nvotes ordered with respect to those amendments be stacked to occur \nbeginning at 10 a.m. on Thursday, with 2 minutes for debate between \neach stacked vote, equally divided. Those amendments are\n\n[[Page S7931]]\n\nas follows and subject to time restraints where noted: Grams, dairy \ncompact amendment; Wellstone, school breakfast, 1 hour equally divided; \na managers' amendment; the Bingaman amendment with regard to CRP; the \nRobb amendment with regard to farmers' civil rights; and the Johnson \namendment regarding livestock packers.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nabove-listed amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and, if \nthe Senate has received H.R. 2160, the Senate proceed to the House \ncompanion bill, all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of \nS. 1033, as amended, be inserted, and the bill be advanced to third \nreading, and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, and following the passage the Senate insist on its \namendment and request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, two \nquestions of the majority leader. When we had this discussion about how \nto proceed, I had asked for 10 minutes to be equally divided before the \nvote because I think the amendment is an important one. Colleagues will \nnot be here tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. That was the \nagreement. So we need to modify the agreement that there would be 10 \nminutes equally divided before the Wellstone amendment would be voted \non tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the majority leader.\n  The second question was, my understanding is I will proceed next, or \nis there----\n  Mr. LOTT. The request we have here is that the Grams amendment would \ngo first, because I think we have that worked out where it will be just \na very brief period of time, and we would go right to your amendment \nafter that with a time limit of 1 hour equally divided.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, the Grams amendment has \nbeen worked out? We are not going to have a long time on that; is that \ncorrect? Is that what you are saying?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Any other objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I have been waiting all \nday to make a brief statement of 3 or 4 minutes. I would like to have \nthe opportunity.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is it regarding the legislation?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Regarding the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Did the Senator from Minnesota have a question that I did \nnot respond to?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his cooperation and \nhis understanding that these things are very difficult and sometimes we \nall get a little carried away in our comments. I appreciate his \ncooperation on this. He will have time to make his case and he will \nhave 10 minutes in the morning. I thank him for his cooperation.\n  Mr. President, in furtherance of this reservation, Mr. President, I--\nhow long does the Senator need?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Four minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I also ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Arizona \nhave 4 minutes before we begin on the amendments we have lined up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I might ask \nthe majority leader, I understand from in the UC request that, after \nall these amendments are disposed of, we go to the third reading of the \nbill, and that there would be a vote on final passage.\n  Mr. LOTT. That's right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. After that, the UC also says that the House bill would \nthen come in and be substituted for the Senate bill and then proceed to \na third reading of the House bill at that point in time. However, it is \nmy understanding that when the House bill is substituted for the Senate \nbill, it is also open for amendment at that point in time; is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LOTT. This is the normal language that we use in this type of \nconsent, getting the final passage. It is the normal procedure and the \nnormal language. I guess, in theory, it is subject to amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I would like to inform the distinguished majority \nleader that when this point happens, I intend to offer an amendment on \nthe House bill. It would be subject to the Senate bill at that point in \ntime.\n  Mr. LOTT. It would be what? Subject to what?\n  Mr. HARKIN. When the House bill takes the place of the Senate bill, \nwhen you strike all after the enacting clause and put in the House \nbill, at that point the House bill is then open for amendment. It is my \nintention to offer an amendment to the House bill at that point in \ntime.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while the leaders are discussing this \nissue, I will make my brief statement at this time so that we can \nproceed with the business of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, once again, the hard work of Chairman Cochran and \nSenator Bumpers is readily apparent in this bill and report. I \ncongratulate them for their efforts.\n  This is the eighth appropriations bill to come before the Senate in \nthese 2 weeks. And I must say that this bill and report, so far, take \nthe cake for earmarks and set-asides for Members' special interests.\n  Most of these earmarks are in the report language and do not, \ntherefore, have the full force of law. But I have no doubt that the \nDepartment of Agriculture will feel compelled to spend the funds \nappropriated to them in accordance with these earmarks.\n  These earmarks are the usual collection of add-ons for universities \nand laboratories, prohibitions on closing facilities or cutting \npersonnel levels, special exemptions for certain areas, and the like. \nThere is little on this list that would surprise any of my colleagues.\n  There is, however, a new type of earmark that I do not recall seeing \nin other appropriations bills. I am referring to the practice of \nearmarking funds to provide additional personnel at specific locations. \nFor example, in the report:\n  $250,000 is earmarked for a hydrologist to work for the Agricultural \nResearch Service on south Florida Everglades restoration;\n  $500,000 is earmarked for additional scientists to do research on \nparasitic mites and Africanized honeybees at the Bee Laboratory in \nTexas;\n  Language specifies funding at fiscal year 1997 levels for the peanut \nresearch unit of the Agricultural Research Service in Oklahoma to \nretain two scientists at the facility;\n  Language specifies funding at fiscal year 1997 levels to maintain the \npotato breeder and small grains geneticist positions at the \nAgricultural Research Service facility in Aberdeen, ID--the report \nnotes that the current potato breeder is getting ready to retire;\n  An additional $250,000 is earmarked for an animal physiologist \nposition at the Fort Keough Laboratory in Montana;\n  $1.05 million is added for additional staffing at the Rice Germplasm \nLaboratory in Arkansas;\n  $250,000 is added for additional scientific staffing at the Small \nFruits Research Laboratory in Mississippi;\n  $250,000 is added to establish a small grains pathologist research \nposition for the Agricultural Research Service in Raleigh, NC;\n  Language acknowledges the importance of the horticulturist position \nspecializing in grape production at the Agricultural Research Service \nstation in Prosser, WA;\n  $200,000 is added for 21 additional full-time inspectors at \nagriculture quarantine inspection facilities at Hawaii's airports;\n  $200,000 is added for the cattle tick inspection program to ensure \ncurrent staffing levels are maintained along the border with Mexico; \nand\n  Language recommends continued staffing and operations at the \ncooperative services office in Hilo, HI.\n\n[[Page S7932]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am amazed again. We have found a new way of \nearmarking. I congratulate the appropriators for doing so. I have never \nbefore seen earmarking funds for the hiring of a specialist at a \nparticular job. So I want to again say we have broken a new frontier \nhere and one that I am sure will be emulated by others in the \nappropriations bills to come.\n  Mr. President, I won't delay the Senate further. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a listing of the provisions that I find objectionable in \nthe agriculture appropriations bill be printed in the Record at this \ntime.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Objectionable Provisions in S. 1033 Fiscal Year 1998 Agriculture \n                          Appropriations Bill\n\n\n

Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to renew my unanimous-consent \nrequest, with the modifications that we think are appropriate at this \ntime. So I will begin again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following be the only remaining \namendments in order, and limited to relevant second-degree amendment \nand votes ordered with respect to those amendments be stacked to occur \nbeginning at 10 a.m. on Thursday, with 2 minutes for debate between \neach stacked vote, equally divided, except that there will be 10 \nminutes prior to the Wellstone amendment.\n  Those amendments are as follows and subject to time restraints where \nnoted:\n  Grams, on dairy compact; Wellstone, on school breakfast; a manager's \npackage; a Bingaman amendment on CRP; Robb, concerning farmers' civil \nrights, and a Johnson amendment with regard to livestock packers.\n  I further ask that following disposition of the amendments, the \nSenate then proceed to vote on S. 1033 and, following passage, the bill \nremain at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, there will be no further rollcall votes this \nevening. The next rollcall votes will be a series of votes completing \naction on the Agriculture appropriations bill occurring at 10 a.m.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am sorry the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain, left the floor. He listed a number of what he called earmarks, \nand the implication was that any money in this bill earmarked for \nspecific kinds of research or specific kinds of personnel in a \nparticular State was--he didn't say it in these words, but that it was \npork and that earmarks are automatically bad. I could not disagree \nmore. Every earmark the Senator from Arizona mentioned tonight, listed \ntonight in the bill, he was absolutely correct about it. Every one of \nthem were for research projects.\n  I said in my opening statement this morning that it is a tragedy that \nin this country we have become complacent about our food supplies, and, \nyet, we are adding 2 million people a year in this Nation alone to \nfeed, and almost 100 million people a year worldwide to feed. And at \nthe same time in this Nation, as we add 2 million people to feed, we \nare also taking between 2 million and 3 million acres of arable land \nout of cultivation for airports, urban sprawl, housing, you name it.\n  Now, it is quite obvious to me that when you spend about $1.2 billion \nfor research--I don't know precisely how much is in this bill, but when \nyou consider the fact that we spend $13 billion a year on medical \nresearch, which I applaud, $13 billion a year for NASA, all of which I \napplaud--except space station, of course--and $36 billion to $40 \nbillion--I believe $40 billion we approved the other day to make things \nexplode in the Defense authorization bill, without so much as a whimper \nfrom one person in this body--about $40 billion in research and \ndevelopment.\n  I am not saying it is all bad. All I am saying is here is poor old \nagriculture which is going to be charged with the responsibility--and \nis charged with the responsibility--of providing a good, safe, reliable \nfood supply for this country. The American housewife spends 10 cents of \nevery dollar for food, the lowest of any nation on Earth. And to \nsuggest that somehow or other these items in here simply because they \nearmarked are bad and a waste of money--I can tell you, for example, \nthat the new poultry and meat inspection system which is being \nimplemented right now as the ultimate in providing safe food for us to \neat is the result of a very small appropriation to a consortium of the \nUniversity of Arkansas, Kansas State, and Iowa State--one of the best \nbargains we ever got. And every dime of it was earmarked to start that \nprogram several years ago.\n  Mr. President, I am about to get exercised. And I could go on with \nall the earmarks that have provided great research for this country \nthat we have all benefited from.\n  I know there is some pork in this bill, as there is in every bill. \nBut I can tell you just because someone says it is for the State of \nMississippi or the State of Arkansas doesn't mean it is bad. The truth \nof matter is we have reaped tremendous benefits from some of these \nearmarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I must say that I agree with the Senator \nfrom Arkansas on the last part of his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7920-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE INTERNATIONAL DOLPHIN CONSERVATION PROGRAM ACT --MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, very much, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 971\n\n   (Purpose: To require the Director of the Office of Management and \n Budget to conduct, complete, and transmit to Congress a comprehensive \neconomic evaluation of the direct and indirect effects of the Northeast \n                       Interstate Dairy Compact)\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, tonight I am pleased that an amendment by \nSenator Feingold and I, which we intended to offer, has now been \naccepted in modified form.\n  Because this issue is so important to my State, I wanted to take some \ntime to briefly review why I offered the amendment and why this \namendment is requiring a study of the Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  My amendment is straightforward and is noncontroversial. It simply \nrequires the Secretary of Agriculture to study and report the economic \nimpacts of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.\n  The focus of this amendment is to examine the impact of the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact on food nutrition programs and on the entire \nNation's dairy industry.\n  This amendment will help protect senior citizens, children, and the \nmost needy among us.\n  This amendment helps all who rely on food stamps, the School Lunch \nProgram, the Summer Food Service Program, the Child and Adult Care Food \nProgram, the Special Milk Program, the School Breakfast Program, and \nthe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and \nChildren, as well as dairy producers in 44 States.\n  Joining me in offering this amendment are Senators Feingold, Thomas, \nKohl, Levin, Wellstone, DeWine, and Craig.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, on July 1, 1997, the Compact \nbecame effective in a six-State region in New England giving producers \nthere an arbitrary, fixed price for their milk--nearly $17 per \nhundredweight.\n  Unfortunately, few of us know exactly what this will mean for \nconsumers in that region, particularly the poor; for the cost of \ndelivering food nutrition assistance by Federal, State, and local \ngovernments; and for dairy producers in 44 other States, including my \nproducers in Minnesota, who receive far, far less for their milk than \ntheir New England counterparts.\n  We are not sure of the Compact's impact, in large part, because there \nhas been so little light shed on it. It became law attached in a \nconference committee. The Compact has always seemed to travel under a \ncloud with no justification for its existence.\n  For example, in the 103d Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld a business meeting to consider the Compact--without the benefit of \na single hearing--and reported the Compact to the floor. The Senate \nnever considered it.\n  A House Judiciary subcommittee held one hearing on the proposal, but \neventually sent it to full Committee without recommendation because the \nvote was evenly divided for and against the Compact. The bill died in \nCommittee.\n  In fact, at the House hearing, the administration's testimony was \n``we believe this is a matter that warrants further review and \nconsideration''. Hardly a ringing endorsement.\n  In the 104th Congress, the Compact was the subject of not a single \nhearing in either the Judiciary Committee or the Agriculture Committee \nof the Senate. Nor was it the topic of a single hearing in counterpart \nCommittees in the House.\n  Despite this, the Compact wound up in the Senate's version of the \nfarm bill. In response, a majority of this body voted to strip it out. \nThe House never included the Compact in its version of the farm bill. \nYet, somehow the Compact found its way back into the farm bill during \nconference, and survived buried in a conference report most of us \nsupported overall.\n  Subsequent to the authority for the Compact becoming law, the \nSecretary of Agriculture decided to go ahead with implementation of the \nCompact despite the fact that the President's own Council of Economic \nAdvisors recommended against it.\n  As a matter of fact, it was reported that the former head of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisors, Mr. Joseph Stiglitz, lashed \nout at the * * * Compact, noting it was a cost to U.S. consumers and \nlowered real benefits paid out via food stamps by 10 percent.\n  I wish I could share with my colleagues the Council of Economic \nAdvisor's actual recommendation against the Compact. Unfortunately, \nhowever, when I wrote to the current Chairman of the Council, Ms. Janet \nYellen, for that information, my request was denied.\n  I also took the time to show up at an Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee hearing to submit the request to Secretary Glickman who \nwas testifying at the time. A month or two later, I received from the \nSecretary yet another denial of my request for this information.\n  Adding insult to injury, when the Compact was being challenged in \ncourt, it seemed for a while that the Department of Agriculture was \ngoing to have a tough time just beating back that challenge even though \nthe Federal court hearing the case was applying the lowest possible \nthreshold--the rationale basis test--in scrutinizing the Compact.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the rationable basis test applied by \ncourts only requires that there be just a little bit of logic in a \ngovernment action--it just has to make some kind of sense.\n  Yet, on the Secretary's first attempt to explain the Compact, the \njudge in a frustrated tone, stated that the Secretary of Agriculture's \nconcerns--about the Compact--expressed in four paragraphs, overshadow \nthe four reasons, expressed in two sentences, that the Secretary gave--\nin favor of the Compact.\n  In short, the Secretary could not even supply a meager rational \nreason for the Compact's existence.\n  Shortly after that pronouncement from the court, the Secretary of \nAgriculture asked Judge Friedman for a second shot at rationalizing the \nCompact.\n  However, the amended brief supporting the Compact did not address the \neconomic impacts of the Compact or even the Secretary's own concerns. \nBut, since the court only required some kind of reasoning--any kind of \nreasoning--the Compact survived in court.\n  Mr. President, it is plain to see from all this that the cloud \ncovering the Compact has still not lifted. The Compact and its exact \neconomic effects are very uncertain, at best, and this should rightly \nconcern Members from the Compact region as well as those of us in the \nother 44 States.\n  In his August 9, 1996, statement, Secretary Glickman himself stated:\n\n       I am concerned about the potential effects of the Compact \n     in several respects and intend, therefore, to monitor closely \n     its implementation.\n\n  Secretary Glickman also continued:\n\n       I expect that the Compact Commission will implement the \n     Compact in a way that does not burden other regions of the \n     country, consistent with the provisions of the FAIR Act and \n     the Compact. I will monitor whether the Compact has any \n     adverse effects on the income of dairy producers outside the \n     Compact region.\n\n  Further, the Secretary announced, and again I quote:\n\n       Perhaps most significantly, I am deeply concerned about and \n     will closely monitor the effect of the Compact on consumers, \n     especially low-income families, within the Compact region.\n       I expect that the Commission will pay close attention to \n     monitor the effects of its decisions on consumers before and \n     after it takes any action.\n\n  He went on to say, and again I am quoting:\n\n       I also expect the commission and the Compact States to \n     provide assistance to offset any increased burden on low-\n     income families in the Compact region. I am also concerned \n     about the effect of the Compact on the Department of \n     Agriculture's nutrition programs, and I expect the commission \n     to exercise its authority to reimburse participants in a \n     special supplemental nutrition program for WIC and to fulfill \n     its obligation to reimburse the CCC, as provided in the \n     Compact and in the FAIR Act.\n\n  Mr. President, despite the concerns expressed by the Secretary of \nAgriculture regarding the compact, we still\n\n[[Page S7936]]\n\nhave no way of knowing whether the compact is in fact having an adverse \neffect on consumers, especially the poor, and, if it is, to what \nextent.\n  We have no way of knowing whether the compact is increasing the cost \nof food nutrition programs, adversely affecting taxpayers who foot the \nbill. We also have no way of knowing whether the compact has an adverse \neffect on the dairy producers of 44 other States in this country or \nwhether the CCC will pick up bigger tabs because of the compact. The \nonly information we have today are newspaper articles from the compact \nregion reporting that retail milk prices have climbed 20 to 26 cents \nper gallon since the compact was implemented, and retailers and \nconsumer groups are blaming the compact.\n  We are also hearing word that milk production in the compact region \nis on the rise in response to the fixed prices New England dairy \nproducers are receiving. I am told that one large processor in the \ncompact region is not accepting any additional milk at one of its \nplants and is instead shipping five to seven loads a day of excess milk \nto the Midwest where it is sold for around $7 to $8 per hundredweight \nfor processing.\n  If these reports are correct, New England lawmakers should be \nextremely concerned about their consumers, especially the poorest among \nthem. My colleagues from the other 44 States, especially those States \nthat produce dry powdered milk or cheese, should be equally concerned \nabout producers in their home States having to compete with $7 and $8 \nmilk coming out of New England. But the fact is none of us know for \nsure what is happening out there due to the compact because the cloud \nlingers, and, therefore, all I am asking from my colleagues is a little \nbit of sunshine.\n  It seems to me that last Congress we bought this rig sight unseen \nwithout even so much as kicking the tires. Under those circumstances, I \ndon't think it is unreasonable to now ask that we take a look under the \nhood. If the folks who sold us the compact are right, then there is \nnothing to hide. At this juncture, I believe that a study of the \ncompact is not only appropriate but it is very necessary.\n  Mr. President, in the August 9, 1996, statement of Secretary \nGlickman, which I mentioned earlier, the Secretary also stated:\n\n       I also encourage Congress to exercise its oversight \n     function and to monitor the implementation of the compact.\n\n  Mr. President, I think the Secretary has offered us some very sound \nadvice. This is the best way to provide that necessary oversight. If \nthe compact is compromising our efforts to help the disadvantaged, the \nsenior citizens and children through nutrition programs or \ndisadvantaging dairy producers in 44 States, I want to be one of the \nfirst to learn that information and then to do something about it.\n  So, Mr. President, I understand again that this amendment I offer \nwith Senator Feingold is accepted, and I thank all of those who have \nhelped us work on this and support it.\n  Also, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I add Senator \nAbraham to the list of cosponsors of this amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair. I thank you for the time and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator's amendment offered for a vote?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I understand that the amendment has been \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment would need to be offered and a \nvoice vote taken.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, my understanding is that the amendment has \nbeen accepted and no recall vote is needed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator needs to send the amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Levin, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Craig, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 971.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S7937]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By previous order, the Senator from Minnesota \nhas the floor and has an amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my understanding is that the Senator \nfrom--I thought that this amendment was going to be much more brief. \nThat was my understanding. I am anxious to go on with my amendment, but \nmy understanding is that the Senator from Vermont had wanted to speak \non this, and out of courtesy to a colleague, I defer to him.\n  I ask the Senator, does he know how long he will be speaking?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I tell my good friend from Minnesota that I \nwill speak probably about 1 minute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. More than that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It will be very brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank Senators who worked very hard in \nworking this matter out. I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee, my good friend, the senior Senator from Mississippi, for \nhis efforts and, of course, the senior Senator from Arkansas [Mr. \nBumpers], for his efforts.\n  I thank the members of my staff who worked so hard, and my colleague \nfrom Vermont, Senator Jeffords. And, of course, Senator Grams and \nSenator Feingold, from Wisconsin, who as a Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, while involved in a very difficult markup today, also spent \na great deal of time in trying to work out this matter of great concern \nto his dairy farmers, as it is the other Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nWellstone.\n  We have worked out an understanding regarding a study of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact and regarding milk pricing practices as they \neffect consumers.\n  The Director of OMB will do a study on dairy, retail store, \nwholesaler and processor pricing in New England.\n  Many Senators are very concerned, and I have not found one who is \nnot, that when the price that farmers get for their milk drops that the \nretail price--the consumer price--often does not drop.\n  Wholesalers or retail stores appear to be simply making more profits \nat the expense of farmers.\n  This is one issue we are very interested in.\n  Also, the price of milk in New England, in the South, in the Midwest, \nand in the West is supported by a variety of milk marketing orders. \nThese have a tremendous impact on the price of milk in retail stores, \nand these marketing orders will continue to exist for years to come.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact will exist for only about 18 months--it \nterminates in 1999, or when the Secretary reforms the milk marketing \norder system, whichever comes first as provided in the farm bill.\n  I want to remind everyone that the compact was first approved by each \nof the six legislative bodies in New England, and signed into law by \neach of their Governors.\n  So the impact on retail prices of the milk marketing order system, \nthe impact on prices of wholesaler and retail profits, the impact on \nprices of the dairy compact, among other factors will be examined by \nthe Director.\n  The prices farmers get for their milk dropped substantially last \nNovember nationwide. They dropped quickly, and have stayed low for \nmonths.\n  It amounted to a 35 cent to 40 cent drop on a per gallon basis. That \nis a huge drop for farmers. Yet retail stores did not lower their \nprices to consumers except by a few pennies.\n  Prices that farmers got stayed low, and prices paid by consumers \nstayed high.\n  How did the stores make out during this big price drop to farmers? \nThere has been a major increase in retail store profits for milk.\n  In some areas of the country there is now a $1.40 per gallon \ndifference between the raw milk price--which farmers get--and the \nretail price of milk.\n  Now that stores took advantage of that price drop to lock in huge \nprofit margins for milk are they going to give consumers a break? Of \ncourse not.\n  The Compact Commission did its job. They picked a fair return for \nfarmers that is lower than the average price last year for milk.\n  Let me repeat that: under the Compact farmers in New England are \ngetting less for their milk than the average price they got for their \nmilk last year.\n\n  Because retail stores now have huge built-in profit margins on milk \nthere should be no increases in price under the compact--yet retail \nstores are not satisfied.\n  The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have exposed this \nretail store overcharging for milk.\n  The Wall Street Journal pointed out that the value of milk for \nfarmers plunged by 22 percent since October of 1996--but that no \ncomparative decline occurred in the retail price of milk.\n  Farmers got one-fifth less for their milk, and stores made a bundle. \nThe dairy case is now the most profitable part of a supermarket.\n  The last time I asked GAO to look at store profits for milk I was \namazed at what they discovered.\n  GAO found then, and its the same now, that when farm prices collapse \nthat retail milk prices to consumers stay high.\n  The failure of stores to lower prices may have had a significant \nadverse impact on nutrition programs. Also, I know from newspaper \naccounts that one chainstore in Maine dropped the price of a gallon of \nskim milk by one penny after the compact was implemented. Other stores \nreacted differently even though they enjoyed the benefit of a major \nprice drop which I previously discussed. We need to know if stores \nunfairly increased prices by taking advantage of the compact even \nthough they did not have to increase prices at all.\n  I thank my good friend from Minnesota for the courtesy of letting me \ntake this time, and my friend from Minnesota, Mr. Grams.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 972\n\n  (Purpose: To provide funds for outreach and startup for the school \n                   breakfast program, with an offset)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I am sorry it is late tonight. I am \ngoing to have a chance to summarize this amendment for colleagues \ntomorrow. Let me just start out with a poster from the Children's \nDefense Fund: ``Remember Those Hungry Kids In China? Now They Are In \nOmaha.'' But it could be in any of our States. Currently there are an \nestimated 5.5 million American kids who don't eat regularly. They don't \nget enough to eat.\n  Mr. President, we have to do better. I offer an amendment to the \nagriculture appropriations bill which would revive the outreach and \nstartup grants program for school breakfasts. They are called outreach \ngrants. It may come as a shock to some of the Members of this body that \nchildren, too many children, are going to school hungry and we are not \ndoing anything about it. Let me repeat that. I have brought this \namendment to the floor of the Senate before. I now have an amendment on \nthe agriculture appropriations bill. I hope I will win on this \namendment. I appeal to my colleagues to please support this amendment, \nbut I will come back with this amendment over and over and over again, \nuntil I restore the funding.\n  This program was eliminated. Let me just repeat what is going on \nhere. There are too many children who go to school who are hungry. We \nare not doing anything about it. There are too many children who go to \nschool with rotting teeth from non-nutritious foods. There are too many \nchildren who go to school with aching, empty stomachs. There are too \nmany children who go to school who are unable to learn because they are \nmalnourished and hungry. And that is not the goodness in our country.\n  Mr. President, the welfare law of 1996 eliminated--eliminated the \nschool breakfast outreach and startup grants. They were created in 1990 \nand they were made permanent in 1994. What these outreach grants are \nall about--and we are talking about $5 million and only $5 million to \nreestablish this program--these were grants that enabled States and \nschool districts to set up school breakfast programs. Some 45 States \nhave received these funds. Every student who is eligible for a free \nlunch is eligible for school breakfast as well. However, only about 40 \npercent of those who are hungry, those who come from very low-income \nfamilies and are eligible for school lunch program, are able to \nparticipate in the school breakfast program as well.\n  This program, this outreach program which was combined with the \npublic awareness program by the Food Research and Action Committee--and \nthank God we have FRAC, because they do wonderful work, and other \nnutrition advocacy groups--was a catalyst. We were able, through this \noutreach program, to expand the school breakfast program by 26,000 \nschools to an additional 2.3 million poor children between 1987 and \n1994.\n  I would like my colleagues to listen carefully to this, not only \ntonight, many are gone but staffs are around, but also tomorrow when I \nsummarize. This program was extremely successful. It was eliminated \nbecause of the almost Orwellian argument that the $5 million outreach \nprogram should be eliminated because it was effective, because it was \nproviding States and school districts with the information they needed \nto set up a school breakfast program to help hungry, malnourished \nchildren.\n  I need to repeat that argument. This was completely eliminated. We \neliminated an outreach program for poor children in America to make \nsure that they were able to participate in the school breakfast program \nbecause the argument was made it was encouraging school districts to \nset up school breakfast programs and therefore the Federal Government \nwould have to contribute some money.\n  Yes, we would. And that would be a good thing. Because today there \nare 14.3 million children who receive free and reduced-price lunches, \nbut 8 million of them, spread across 27,000 schools, go to school \nhungry and receive no school breakfasts at all. Mr. President, 8 \nmillion children who need the help, 8 million children who could be \nstarting out the day with a nutritious breakfast, do not receive that \nassistance, in part because we eliminated a $5 million outreach grant \nprogram. We eliminated the whole program. My colleagues know that \nhungry children cannot learn. And they know that if they cannot learn, \nwhen they are adults they won't be able to earn. I could not think of \nanything that is more shortsighted.\n  Let me just repeat, talking about children and the importance of an \nequal chance for every child, too many children in our country, 8 \nmillion children--maybe more, maybe a few less, what difference does it \nmake?--go to school and there is no school breakfast program. They are \neligible. We eliminated the outreach program that would give States and \nschool districts additional information so they could help hungry \nchildren, and as a result of that there are too many children who don't \ndo well in school.\n  Let me go with the next chart, although I will hold this up tomorrow. \nI would like my colleagues to see this.\n\n[[Page S7939]]\n\n There are hungry kids in our country, an estimated 5.5 million \nAmerican kids don't regularly get enough to eat. That is the \nFood Research in Action Coalition report, that is the Children's \nDefense Fund, this comes from the work of Tufts University. I mean, the \nevidence is there, colleagues. We have too many children who are \nmalnourished. We have too many children that do not have an adequate \ndiet. And we eliminate a $5 million program, an outreach program, \nbecause we said it was too effective.\n\n  This chart points out the percentage of children from hungry and \nnonhungry households, and how it relates to health-related problems. \nLet me point out, the red is percent of nonhungry children, the green \nis percent of hungry children. Whether you are looking at unwanted \nweight loss, or fatigue, or frequent colds, or inability to \nconcentrate, or ear infection, dizziness, asthma, allergies, diarrhea, \nirritability, frequent headaches--over and over and over again--this is \nfrom the Food Research Action Council, 1995--it is dramatic: The much \nlarger percentage of children who are hungry children experience all of \nthese specific health related problems.\n  It is not too much, I say to my colleague from Mississippi, this is \nnot too much to ask for. I don't think, when we voted on the welfare \nbill, the debate was really on this one $5 million outreach program. It \nwas just one program in a large bill that we eliminated and we should \nnot have. We set it up in 1990. It was very effective between 1990 and \n1994; 1995, it was an excellent program, it was a program that provided \noutreach to 45 States. It meant that some additional school districts \nknew how to set up a school breakfast program. And, yes, we ended up \nproviding some funding for that. But we should. Where there are \nchildren in need, where there are children who could really be helped \nby a program that would give them a nutritious meal, would give them a \nnutritious breakfast, we ought to make sure that happens. Otherwise \nthese children don't do as well in school.\n  I would just say to my colleagues, this is really all about our \nnational vow of equal opportunity for every child. How can anybody here \nin the U.S. Senate say that we truly have equal opportunity for every \nsingle child when we have over 5 million children that do not get \nenough to eat and we don't even allocate $5 million for an outreach \nprogram that would help those children start out the day with a \nnutritious breakfast? This is wrong. I am just sure of it. This is \nwrong. We have to be able to do this.\n  I just want to say, because my colleague is on the floor, Senator \nCochran from Mississippi, that the Ag Appropriations Subcommittee did \nnot cut this program at all. They didn't eliminate this program. This \nhappened in the overall welfare bill. This was not action of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I also want to say that Senator Cochran has been an advocate for \nchildren's nutrition programs. So let me be crystal clear, this is not \naimed at some action taken by the Ag Appropriations Committee. But, Mr. \nPresident, what we did in the last Congress was profoundly mistaken.\n  Let me just read for a moment--and there are many different studies I \ncould read from--from the Tufts study. This really went back to 1987, \nin which Meyer Sampson, et al, examined the effect of the School \nBreakfast Program on school performance of low-income students in \nLawrence, MA.\n  In any case, what they found out is that from standardized tests to \nlateness and absences, over and over again, children who participated \nin the School Breakfast Program were shown to do much better on \nachievement tests, were shown to get to school on time, were shown to \nnot be absent from school so often.\n  It is just so clear. Can't we come up with $5 million? Now we have a \ndoctor, Dr. Frist, who is presiding. This is a medical issue. I am just \nsaying to Dr. Frist that we have a study here from the Food Research \nAction Council which points out the correlation between children who \nare malnourished and some of the health problems--unwanted weight loss, \nfatigue, frequent colds, inability to concentrate, ear infection, \ndizziness.\n  I am saying I don't think any of us realize that in the welfare bill, \nwe eliminated a $5 million--that is all it is--outreach program that \nwas very effective. It was in operation in 45 States, and for the $5 \nmillion investment, we help provide school districts with information \nabout how they can set up a school breakfast program.\n  I am pointing out that there are some 8 million children who are \neligible for the School Breakfast Program who don't receive any help, \nand there are too many children who go to school and don't get a \nnutritious meal. For $5 million, I say to my colleagues, we could have \nthis outreach program. We never should have eliminated it. We know that \nwhen children are hungry, they don't do as well in school. The evidence \nis irrefutable and irreducible. We know that when children are \nmalnourished and hungry that they don't have the same opportunities as \nour children do to do well in school. And we know that there is, as \nreported by the Tufts study, as reported by some of the work of the \nFood Research Action Council, and I have here about--if I had wanted \nto, I could have taken several hours to go over this amendment--a \nvariety of different studies that have been done, and over and over and \nover again, it is the same. This is the Tufts University School of \nNutrition, I say to the Presiding Officer, ``The Link Between Nutrition \nand Cognitive Development in Children.''\n  Look, if we have children in our country--and the evidence is clear--\nwho go to school and, because their parents are so poor or for other \nreasons, and they are eligible because they are from low-income \nfamilies, they don't get that nutritious breakfast, and we know there \nis a link between nutrition and cognitive development, we know there is \na link in early years, we know there is a link in terms of how children \ndo in school, why in the world would we have eliminated an outreach \nprogram? That is what we did.\n  I will tomorrow, in summarizing this amendment, talk about what the \noffset will be, but I want to be real clear to everybody who is \nlistening tonight--and I will do my very best to talk about this \ntomorrow again--that it may come as a shock, but the fact of the matter \nis, there are too many children who are going to school hungry, and we \nare not doing what we could do to help those children.\n  It is a fact that there are too many children who go to school with \nrotting teeth from non-nutritious foods, and we could allocate $5 \nmillion for an outreach program which, as I pointed out, multiplies \nitself over and over and over again, and, in fact, has made a huge \ndifference for some 2.3 million children.\n  It is a fact that too many children are going to school with aching, \nempty stomachs, and we are not doing all that we can do to help those \nchildren.\n  It is a fact that there are too many children who, because they do \nnot start out the day with a decent meal, are not able to learn, and I \nwill say it one more time, they are not able to learn, and because they \nare not able to learn, when they are adults, they are not able to earn.\n  How shortsighted can it be to not be willing--we had a $270 billion \nPentagon budget. We have all sorts of subsidies that go to oil \ncompanies, to pharmaceutical companies, to big insurance companies. We \nfind all sorts of places and areas to spend money, and this $5 million \noutreach program was eliminated.\n  Mr. President, maybe some people who are watching tonight will have a \nchance to speak on the floor about something I think is important \ntomorrow morning. I will have a chance to summarize this amendment. But \none more time, I hope that we will restore this. I could read study \nafter study after study, but I don't think I need to; I really don't \nthink I need to. It is just crystal clear: We never should have \neliminated a $5 million outreach program that actually led to some 2.2 \nmillion more children having the chance to participate in the School \nBreakfast Program, because this outreach program gave school districts \nand gave States the information they needed to set up the School \nBreakfast Program.\n\n  Then in the welfare bill, this outreach program was eliminated \nbecause the curious argument was made that it was too successful and \ntoo many school districts were setting up the School Breakfast Program \nand, God forbid, we were going to have to spend more money on child \nnutrition. That is the\n\n[[Page S7940]]\n\nargument that was made, not by this committee, but the Ag Committee has \njurisdiction over nutrition programs.\n  I say to my colleague from Mississippi, this is an opportunity for us \nto do something in a bipartisan way that would really make a \ndifference. This would be a good thing to do. This would be a right \nthing to do. This would be a small thing to do, but it would have a \nreally large impact.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time to see whether or \nnot there might be some reaction to my amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the kind remarks \nof the distinguished Senator from Minnesota in connection with the fact \nthat the program discussed by him, and which is the subject of his \namendment, was not in any way reduced in funding by the action of the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee or the full Committee on \nAppropriations. As a matter of fact, we tried very hard to identify \nneeds in the nutrition area, including the school lunch programs, child \nnutrition programs, food stamps, Women, Infants and Children feeding \nprogram, and others. I think Senators will notice that there are \nsubstantial increases in funding for WIC, for example, to make sure \nthere is a full participation permitted next year, and that means we \nhad to add $200 million more to that account to help guarantee that no \none participating in the WIC Program now would be denied eligibility or \nparticipation due to a lack of funding next year.\n  And in every other way, we tried to look at the evidence before the \ncommittee that we had available to us during our hearings to assess the \nneeds and to make available the funds that we thought were necessary to \nhelp make sure that all Americans have access to a nutritious diet, \nthat the food supply is safe, and that, in every respect, we continue \nto make sure that people in our society do not have to go without food.\n  Having said that, the Senator is correct in that there are still a \nlot of unmet needs, there are still a lot of problems. We can identify \nareas of the country that have special needs. I am sympathetic to those \nneeds and assure all Senators that this committee will continue to try \nto work to alleviate those needs.\n  The amendment addresses language that was adopted by the Senate and \neventually contained in legislation signed by the President that \nmodified a lot of the programs that do provide assistance to \nindividuals. In the welfare reform effort, there were a number of the \nlaws that were modified, some under the jurisdiction of our Agriculture \nCommittee--this was one of them--that were made necessary through the \nestablishment of spending ceilings in certain program areas.\n  Our committee had the unwelcome task in many cases of identifying \nprograms that could be helpful in some areas of the country but, for \nvarious reasons, maybe the States or local school districts, it was \nthought, could do the things that the Federal Government had previously \nbeen trying to do. And this is one area.\n  Outreach is very important. School districts, local communities, \nState governments all have resources, all have very dedicated people \nleading them in elected positions and in every way are available to \nhelp deal with problems that the Senator from Minnesota has discussed.\n  I do not know what the disposition of the legislative committee will \nbe on this amendment, whether it will suggest that it ought to be \naccepted or resisted. We are consulting with the leaders of the \nlegislative committee, and we understand that they will continue to \nlook at this and maybe tomorrow when we return to consideration of this \namendment in the morning when we convene, there may be a better \nunderstanding of what the response will be at that time.\n  But at this point, I am willing to let the Senator continue to \ndiscuss his amendment if he likes. He has the right to do that under \nthe order that has been entered, and we will be happy to continue to \nwork with him on this and other issues that he is interested in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague, who is \nalways gracious. I think that is one of the reasons he is held in such \nhigh regard.\n  I just point out again that we can have a discussion tomorrow morning \nor negotiation. And look, from my point of view, you know, I am \nsometimes grateful for small victories. And if there was a way that \nthis amendment would be accepted, I would be very pleased. Then I would \nhave to fight hard to keep it in the conference committee.\n  Mr. President, I think that my colleague from Mississippi is \nabsolutely correct in his analysis of what happened by way of going \nafter this outreach grant program for school breakfasts with the \nargument being, ``Here are the caps and here is what we have got to do \nto save the money.'' If you want to, call me naive, but I just would \nlike to say that this is a very brutal argument, not by my colleague \nfrom Mississippi, but this is a brutal argument that people are making. \n``We have got caps. We have got to save the money. Therefore, we \neliminate a $5 million outreach program because it has led--that is why \nwe have to eliminate it--it will lead to more school districts setting \nup a school breakfast program, and, therefore, more children who are in \nfact malnourished or hungry will be able to get at school a nutritious \nbreakfast.'' That is a brutal argument.\n  Why in the world are we willing to make these kinds of cuts that \ntarget these children when we know darn well that the medical evidence \nand the educational evidence is so clear that it can make a huge \ndifference whether or not a poor child has a decent breakfast and can \nstart out the schoolday with a decent breakfast?\n  What do you think the price is that we pay in children that could do \nwell in school, that don't, that drop out? What do you think the price \nis that we pay for kids that get into trouble with substance abuse, \nthat get into trouble with the law, that there is a higher correlation \nbetween high school dropouts and incarceration than cigarette smoking \nand lung cancer? What is the price we pay for kids dropping out?\n  Now, an adequate breakfast for a poor child does not, ipso facto, \nguarantee that child will do well. But why in the world did we \neliminate this outreach program? And why can't we restore it?\n  Mr. President, I am really hoping that tomorrow we will be able to \nget support for this one. The Tufts University--I believe the Chair \nknows the Tufts University does some pretty good work, especially when \nit comes to issues with children and malnutrition.\n  Current scientific research links nutrition and cognitive \ndevelopment.\n  Undernutrition along with environmental factors associated with \npoverty can permanently retard physical growth, brain development, and \ncognitive functioning.\n\n  The longer a child's nutritional, emotional, and education needs go \nunmet, the greater the likelihood of cognitive impairments.\n  Iron deficiency anemia, affecting nearly 25 percent of poor children \nin the United States, is associated with impaired cognitive \ndevelopment. Iron deficiency anemia, which affects 25 percent of poor \nchildren in the United States, is associated with impaired cognitive \ndevelopment, and we cannot find $5 million for an outreach program, for \na school breakfast program for malnourished children?\n  Poor children who attend school hungry perform significantly below \nnonhungry low-income peers on standardized test scores.\n  There is a study--I am a social scientist. They had an experimental \ngroup and control group, and they found out--they took children from \nthe same income category--and they found that those children who \nattended school not hungry did much better on standardized tests than \nthose children who attended school hungry.\n  Is anybody here surprised by that finding? Isn't that clear? Those \nchildren from poor families who go to school and receive a good \nbreakfast will do better in school, will do better on standardized \ntests. Does anybody want to argue with that? Well, if you\n\n[[Page S7941]]\n\ndon't, then how can you eliminate an outreach program that makes sure \nthat those children are able to get that healthy breakfast?\n  So, Mr. President, we will have more debate on this tomorrow. I thank \nmy colleague, the Senator from Mississippi. I really hope that there \nwill be support for this amendment, that we can find the small amount \nof money which would make such a huge difference.\n  In any case, this is one of those amendments I just am going to keep \nbringing out on the floor because I know that we did the wrong thing. I \nknow that. I think I can argue that. Since I believe in the goodness of \npeople and I believe in the goodness of the Senate, I think there has \njust got to be a way that we can restore this program because it is not \na program; it is kids, it is children. And we can help them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 971\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment offered by Senator Grams which has been agreed to today and \nit has been my pleasure to work with the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. \nGrams] and the Senators from Vermont [Mr. Leahy and Mr. Jeffords] to \nreach an agreement to require the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget to study the impacts of the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact. I appreciate the cooperation of the senior Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] and the senior Senator from Arkansas [Mr. \nBumpers] in reaching agreement on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we have offered today is an extremely \nreasonable amendment on which all Senators should agree. This amendment \nsimply requires that the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget study the economic effects of implementation of the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact with respect to consumers, dairy farmers \noutside the compact as well as on vital low income nutrition programs \nsuch as the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast \nProgram, and the Summer Food Service Program all offer milk to children \nfrom low-income families. The congressional oversight provided by this \namendment is the responsible thing to do and I am pleased that the \nmanagers of the bill and the compact supporters have agreed to have \nthis study conducted.\n  The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact was included in the conference \nreport of the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, \nor farm bill, despite the fact the full Senate decisively struck the \ncompact from the Senate bill by a vote of 50 to 46. The compact was in \nneither the Senate farm bill nor the House version of the farm bill as \npassed by both Chambers.\n  It is unfortunate that the will of the Senate was undermined by the \nbackroom agreements of the conference committee. That conference \nagreement further undermined the authority of the Congress by \nimproperly delegating to the Secretary of Agriculture the ability to \nconsent to the compact, regardless of the national public interest. \nThis amendment will help us to determine whether the public interest is \nsubverted by the compact.\n  And the public interest is definitely implicated by the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact. The compact allows six States to fix milk \nprices paid to dairy farmers well beyond the minimum price specified \nunder Federal Milk Marketing Orders. The compact also allows those six \nStates to keep out milk produced by farmers from other parts of the \ncountry, regardless of how competitively that milk is priced. The \ncompact provides competitive credits, or subsidies, to compact milk \nprocessors in order to allow them to sell their milk outside of the \ncompact region. Meanwhile, the compact fails to protect consumers from \nincreased prices and does not have any mechanism in place to protect \nfarmers outside the compact from the actions of dairy farmers in six \nStates who are isolated from the market conditions that non-compact \nproducers face.\n  Mr. President, up to this point both the concern about, and the \npromise of, the Northeast Dairy Compact has been conjecture. But now \nthat the compact has gone into effect we will have hard data to examine \nits economic impacts.\n  The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission fixed the price of \nfluid milk in the compact region at $16.94 per hundredweight on July 1, \n1997. That price is a full $3.00 above the price Northeast farmers \nwould have received in July under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. As \nmany of the compact opponents had predicted, the retail price of fluid \nmilk has increased by as much as 26 cents per gallon--a full cost \nincrease pass through to consumers--something the compact proponents \nsaid would never happen.\n  And media in the Northeast report on farmers who are now considering \nadding more cows to their herds to increase their production and income \nwhen in fact, compact proponents suggested that the compact would not \nincrease milk production in the Northeast. These production increases \nin the compact region come at a time when producers in the 44 other \nStates are facing 6-year low prices due to excess dairy product stocks. \nAt a time when the market is sending the dairy industry the signal to \ncut back of supplies, the compact farmers are getting the signal to \nincrease production.\n  Furthermore, anecdotal reports from milk buyers in the Northeast \nsuggest that excess milk production from the Northeast is already being \ndumped on States outside of the region at prices less than half the \nprice being paid to compact producers. Farmers fear this excess milk \nwill depress prices nationally which are already at devastatingly low \nlevels. Yet compact opponents were assured that no milk would be dumped \noutside of the compact because the compact was a net milk importer.\n  Mr. President, given that many of the things compact proponents said \ncould never happen appear to be happening--increased consumer costs, \nincreased milk production, lower priced exports of milk from the \ncompact region--we must take a careful look at the impacts of this \ncompact.\n  We must scrutinize how the compact affects our vital low-income \nnutrition programs. The National School Lunch Program serves 25 million \nchildren daily and in 1996 served 4.3 billion lunches. The six compact \nStates alone served 170 million school lunches in 1996, nearly all of \nwhich were served with milk. Milk is also a component of the School \nBreakfast Program, the Summer Food Service Program, the Child and Adult \nCare Food Program and the Special Milk Program, programs all offered in \nthe compact States.\n  If the cost of milk to consumers is going up in the compact region \ndue to compact milk price, the value of food stamps for poor families \nmay be declining, costs to schools, summer food service institutions \nand child and adult care facilities are likely increasing as their per \nmeal reimbursement remains flat and the cost of the milk they serve \nincreases, and the food dollars of low-income families are likely not \nstretching as far as they used to. It is absolutely critical that we \ndetermine the impact of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact on  \nthese vital nutrition programs and I am surprised that compact \nproponents do not agree.\n\n  The amendment that has been accepted today will help determine \nwhether or not the benefit of the compact exceeds the financial cost to \ndairy producers in other States.\n  The Northeast dairy compact has been extremely controversial in the \nU.S. Senate because it takes an entirely regional approach to dairy \npolicy, walling off a few farmers in six States from the conditions \nfaced by tens of thousands of dairy farmers elsewhere. And Mr. \nPresident I believe the Northeast dairy compact will ultimately harm \nWisconsin's 24,000 dairy farmers. But I also believe it will hurt dairy \nfarmers in the 44 non-compact States such as California, Washington, \nOregon, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Idaho, and Indiana, among others.\n  Milk is produced and marketed in a national, not a regional market. \nAnd what happens with respect to milk prices and production levels in \none region has national repercussions. Wisconsin's family farmers, with \nan average herd size of 55 cows, are concerned that increased \nproduction in the Northeast spurred on by the high compact milk price, \nwill depress prices throughout the Nation. Farmers who are suffering \nfrom the current national $10.74 basic milk price cannot afford to \nsuffer further price declines due to increased milk production from the \nNortheast. Furthermore, as history has shown increased milk production \nin one region\n\n[[Page S7942]]\n\nin surplus of what is needed for fluid purposes results in surplus \nproduction of cheese, butter and similar product. This in turn \ndepresses cheese prices which directly impact prices paid to producers. \nThese concerns are serious and the compact must be carefully evaluated \nto determine if compact farmers are producing too much milk to the \ndetriment of non-compact farmers.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate today has recognized the \nobligation of this body in ensuring that the compact is carefully \nmonitored and its impacts scrutinized.\n  Mr. President, I remain strongly opposed to the compact and will \ncontinue to work toward its repeal. The compact sets a dangerous \nprecedent in allowing one region to fix prices for its producers to the \ndetriment of non-compact producers. I believe the Northeast dairy \ncompact will harm the 24,000 family dairy farmers in my State of \nWisconsin. Hopefully the information that may be gathered by the study \nrequired by our amendment will help persuade the Senate that it erred \nin allowing the inclusion of the amendment in the 1996 Farm bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       prescription drug user fee\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with Senator Cochran regarding the status of legislation to \nmodernize the Food and Drug Administration and reauthorize the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 [PDUFA]. The Labor Committee has \nreported out S. 830 with a strong bipartisan vote of 14-4. This \nlegislation reauthorizes PDUFA for 5 years and brings the Agency's \nprocedures up to date with the tremendous innovation now occurring in \nthe health technology sector. It is my understanding that the bill \nbefore us does not reauthorize or extend the PDUFA program and \nappropriately leaves this action to the Labor Committee and the \nCongress. The bill before us does anticipate this reauthorization of \nPDUFA by setting a limit on the amount of fees which may be collected \nand expended once the reauthorization is enacted--which is a sensible \napproach. FDA reform and reauthorization of PDUFA go hand-in-hand and I \nam fully confident that we will have legislation accomplishing both at \nonce on the floor in a timely fashion.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Jeffords, is \ncorrect. I would note that the bill before us does not allow the \ncollection of Mammography Standards Act or PDUFA fees in the absence of \nauthorizing legislation from the Labor Committee being approved by the \nCongress and signed into law. Further, I am well aware of the Senator's \nefforts to bring a bill reauthorizing PDUFA and modernizing the FDA to \nthe floor and strongly agree that reform of the Agency and PDUFA \nreauthorization must go forward together. I look forward to debating \nthese issues in the full Senate in the near future.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of \nAgriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1998.\n  The Senate-reported bill provides $50.0 billion in new budget \nauthority [BA] and $41.6 billion in new outlays to fund most of the \nprograms of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. \nAll of the funding in this bill is nondefense spending. This \nsubcommittee received no allocation under the Crime Reduction Trust \nFund.\n  When outlays for prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $48.8 billion in BA \nand $49.2 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. Including mandatory \nsavings, the subcommittee is at its 602(b) allocation in BA and \nslightly below its 602(b) allocation in outlays.\n  The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 602(b) allocation \ntotals $48.8 billion in budget authority [BA] and $49.4 billion in \noutlays. Within this amount, $13.8 billion in BA and $14.2 billion in \noutlays is for nondefense discretionary spending.\n  For discretionary spending in the bill, and counting--scoring--all \nthe mandatory savings in the bill, the Senate-reported bill is at the \nsubcommittee's 602(b) allocation in BA and $128 million below the \nallocation in outlays. It is $281 million in BA and $324 million in \noutlays below the President's budget request for these programs.\n  I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor under \nits 602(b) allocation. I appreciate the committee's support for a \nnumber of ongoing projects and programs important to my home State of \nNew Mexico as it has worked to keep this bill within its budget \nallocation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nSenate Budget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n              S. 1033, AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS, 1998--SPENDING COMPARISONS, SENATE-REPORTED BILL             \n                                         [Fiscal year 1998, $ millions]                                         \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Defense  Nondefense   Crime  Mandatory   Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:                                                                                           \n  Budget authority.............................................  .......     13,791   ......    35,048    48,839\n  Outlays......................................................  .......     14,039   ......    35,205    49,244\nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority.............................................  .......     13,791   ......    35,048    48,839\n  Outlays......................................................  .......     14,167   ......    35,205    49,372\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n  Budget authority.............................................  .......     14,072   ......    35,048    49,120\n  Outlays......................................................  .......     14,363   ......    35,205    49,568\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n  Budget authority.............................................  .......  ..........  ......    35,048    35,048\n  Outlays......................................................  .......      3,909   ......    35,205    39,114\n                                                                                                                \n               SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:                                                                \nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority.............................................  .......  ..........  ......  .........  .......\n  Outlays......................................................  .......

I urge the passage of the bill.\n\n\n                            Access to Credit\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would like to take a moment to discuss an issue in \nwhich I know my colleague, Senator Lugar, has a strong interest, that \nis the need for access to credit by entrepreneurs in the rural areas of \nthis country. I have been concerned about the access to capital for \nentrepreneurial businesses almost since I first stepped onto the Senate \nfloor after my election in 1992 and I want to make clear that I have \npursued a number of different avenues to help create a more liquid \ncredit market in rural areas. Senator Lugar, you and I are no strangers \nto under served capital needs of rural businesses. I helped sponsor and \npass Senator D'Amato's Small Business Loan Securitization bill almost 3 \nyears ago in hopes of helping bring more credit to rural businesses.\n  In past Congresses and in this Congress I have repeatedly approached \nSenator Bond, the chairman of the Small Business Committee, with regard \nto the increasing need for rural credit. The Small Business Committee \ntells me that there will be inadequate funding for rural \nnonagricultural businesses as included in the SBA 7(a) Program. The \nDepartment of Agriculture is concerned that there is inadequate funding \nfor its Business and Industry Program, which lends to rural \nnonagricultural interests. Additionally, many bankers have voiced their \nconcerns that inadequate credit and liquidity will adversely affect \ntheir small business lending and investment programs nationwide.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am aware that recent studies by USDA, GAO, the Kansas \nCity Fed, and the Rural Policy Research Institute have all noted the \ndifficulty rural businesses, particularly new businesses, have in \nobtaining capital. The studies also suggest that a lack of adequate \ncredit for rural businesses is affecting the economic growth of those \ncommunities.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have read those reports as well and I know that the \nreasons they cite for these deficiencies include relatively fewer \ncredit suppliers, higher costs due to lower credit demand, a lack of \nprofessional lending experience in rural and outlying areas, and a lack \nof liquidity in many rural lending institutions when compared to urban \nlending institutions.\n  The amendment I was prepared to offer today sought to remedy this \nsituation by creating a pilot project, at no cost to the Federal \nGovernment, for 1\n\n[[Page S7943]]\n\nyear. If the pilot had proven unsuccessful, the project would not have \nbeen renewed.\n  This solution would have expanded the authorities of an existing \nGovernment Sponsored Enterprise [GSE] to ensure reliable and \ncompetitively priced credit from existing lending institutions to rural \nsmall businesses nationwide.\n  It was my belief that this was the most expedient legislative \napproach to take. I believe that the expansion of Farmer Mac's \nauthority in this area makes sense because it is a logical outgrowth of \nactivities it already conducts, such as securitizing commercial loans, \noperating through thousands of existing commercial credit outlets, and \nproviding access to national capital markets for rural and nonrural \nborrowers alike.\n  I look forward to working with the Agriculture Committee, which has \njurisdiction over this issue, over the coming months to remedy this \nproblem and I thank my colleague Senator Lugar for his willingness to \naddress this important issue.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I, too, am concerned that rural entrepreneurs do not have \nthe same kind of access to capital markets as do their nonrural \ncounterparts. I am also aware of concerns raised by various groups in \nregards to my esteemed colleague's amendment. I believe a hearing will \noffer the opportunity to vet all points of view. It is my intent that \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry hold a hearing on \nrural and agricultural credit as soon as possible in the hopes that we \ncan find a timely solution to this problem.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have been monitoring the problems \nassociated with rural credit needs for some time. At a time when the \ncredit availability problems of rural small business and rural \ninfrastructure are being highlighted by various experts and studies, \nthe very institutions that provide credit to these concerns are having \ntheir funding reduced. Solutions to these problems are being thwarted \nby petty bickering and turf battles that do little else than prolong \nthe agony for rural residents and deprive them of the benefits they \ndeserve.\n  I have read with interest the recent reports from the Rural Policy \nResearch Institute [RUPRI], the General Accounting Office [GAO], and \nthe USDA on rural credit needs. I have also reviewed the proceedings of \nthe Kansas City Fed's conference on ``Financing Rural America.'' These \ndocuments present no surprises for those of us who represent rural \nareas. While each study approaches its task in a unique manner, all of \nthese reports are similar in their conclusions. They note that while \nrural financial markets work reasonably well, not all market segments \nare equally well served. They all agree that small businesses from \nrural areas can have a difficult time obtaining financing, have fewer \ncredit options, and may well pay more for their credit than comparable \nurban enterprises. At a time when small businesses are being recognized \nfor their valuable contributions to our economic growth and stability, \nsmall businesses are experiencing increasing credit needs. \nUnfortunately, USDA's Business and Industry loan program and the Small \nBusiness Administration's funding are being limited in fiscal year \n1998.\n  The facts are worrisome. As the RUPRI study points out, many rural \nareas were bypassed by recent employment growth. Existing rural \nemployment is concentrated in slow-growth or declining industries. Job \ngrowth in rural areas, particularly rural areas that are not adjacent \nto metropolitan areas, is biased toward low-skill, low-wage activities. \nUSDA has stated that ``Rural economies are characterized by a \npreponderance of small businesses, fewer and smaller local sources of \nfinancial capital, less diversification of business and industry, and \nfewer ties to non-local economic activity.'' This does not bode well \nfor my home State of Utah where 25 of 29 counties are classified as \nrural by the USDA.\n  To further illustrate, USDA's Fiscal Year 1998 Business and Industry \n[B] loan program will be straight-lined at fiscal year 97 levels. \nBased on data provided by USDA, current B loan volume is capped at \nabout $740 million; however, USDA has applications pending for yet \nanother $700 million, with preapplications already on file for still \nanother $200 million. These numbers suggest that adequate private \ncapital is not available. Again, using my home State of Utah as an \nexample, there are over $10 million in B loans outstanding. However, \ndue to USDA budget limitations, loans for almost $19 million, \nassociated with pending applications and preapplications, will not be \nmade. This will not be helpful to Utah's economic growth and \ndevelopment, especially in rural areas. Unfortunately, this story of \nunmet rural credit demand can be replicated for almost all of the 50 \nStates represented by this Congress.\n  All of the above mentioned reports discuss options for addressing the \nneed for rural credit. All of them discuss one or more options \nassociated with GSE funding, which frankly, are the most logical and \npersuasive alternatives discussed. I, personally, am persuaded that \nexpansion of Farmer Mac authorities is the most effective and the least \nobtrusive alternative presented to date. It uses existing credit \ndelivery systems and allows lenders to sell their qualifying loans into \nthe secondary market. Other options discussed include expanding the \nauthorities of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, or the Farm Credit \nSystem. I am uncomfortable in advocating expansion of a mortgage \nlender's authorities into commercial lending activity. I am equally \nuncomfortable with expanding a tax exempt GSE's authorities into direct \ncompetition with the private sector. I am open to suggestions and want \nto consider all options, including merging GSE's or mergers of public \nand private interests if such options will provide cost-effective and \nefficient solutions to the problems associated with rural credit \navailability.\n  Throughout the discussion of the last several weeks, I have become \npoignantly aware of the strongly held feelings on this issue. I am \nconcerned that a solution to the problems associated with improving \nrural credit delivery may be beyond the grasp of rural residents and \nbusinessmen if the petty bickering and turf battles are not set aside. \nI commend my esteemed colleague, Senator Lugar, who chairs the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry for his willingness \nto hold hearings on this issue. I, for one, am open to any and all \nreasonable options for improving credit delivery in these rural areas. \nI believe, as many of these reports point out, that improved economic \ngrowth will be the result and national GDP will be enhanced.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the fiscal year 1998 agriculture spending \nbill that comes before us today totals $3.2 billion less than was spent \non agriculture-related programs last year, and $12.6 billion less than \nwas spent the prior year. That is an actual reduction in spending, from \n$63.3 billion in fiscal year 1996 to $50.7 billion this year--an \nastounding 20 percent cut.\n  Mr. President, the savings are due in large part to the more market-\noriented farm policies that Congress approved in 1996--policies that I \nsupported. The Freedom to Farm Act did away with the decades-old policy \nof providing subsidies to farmers when market prices dropped. It did \naway with the policy of requiring farmers to plant the same crops every \nyear and instead established a system of fixed, declining payments on \nthe way to a farm policy free of Government intervention.\n  The substantial savings in farm programs will allow us to target more \nfunding to high-priority domestic programs, like the Women, Infants, \nand Children [WIC] nutrition program and the Food and Drug \nAdministration's food safety initiative. WIC alone would receive an \nadditional $121 million in the upcoming fiscal year. And without price \nsupports and other subsidies to artificially boost the cost of food, \nevery family's food budget will eventually go farther. WIC recipients \nwill get more for their food dollar. Taxpayers will save. Every family \nwill save.\n  Given that spending is better prioritized, and given the substantial \nsavings achieved in this bill, I intend to vote for it. Nevertheless, I \nbelieve we have the opportunity to do even better. Corporate welfare \nprograms, like the Market Access Program, which subsidizes the \nadvertising budgets of U.S. companies overseas, is still funded by this \nbill. It should be cut or eliminated. Spending on the tobacco, sugar, \nand peanut programs could also be reduced. These programs were largely\n\n[[Page S7944]]\n\npreserved, notwithstanding other reforms in the 1996 farm bill. We \nought to phase them out as well.\n  There are a variety of special funding earmarks in this bill that \ncould be the subject of the President's new line-item veto authority. \nThe veto could be applied, for example, to almost all of the nearly 100 \nspecial research grants earmarked within the Cooperate State Research, \nEducation, and Extension Service budget. The Committee report \nidentifies grants totalling $47.5 million for such activities as maple \nresearch, alternative salmon products, goat research, and potato \nresearch, to name just a few. Most of these grants were not requested \nby the President.\n  It may well be that some of these research activities have merit and \nshould proceed, but I would ask why taxpayers should be obligated, \nparticularly to fund those projects that specifically benefit targeted \nindustries? More money could always be spent to find ways of enhancing \nproductivity, improving flavor or appearance, or increasing resistance \nto disease or drought. It seems to me, however, that producers--whether \nthey grow potatoes, blueberries, cranberries, or goats--have every \nreason and incentive to bear the costs of research that leads to better \ncrops or improved sales. That is, after all, a fundamental cost of \ndoing business. At the very least, we ought to ensure that such grants \nare awarded on a competitive basis after adequate peer review.\n  Mr. President, there is similar earmarking in the Agricultural \nResearch Service budget--set-asides for improving postharvest \ntechnologies for apples, for hops research, and the enhancement of \npeanut flavor quality. The list goes on and on. I would not be \nsurprised if any of these projects was to be among the first that the \nPresident strikes with the line-item veto.\n  Since a reduction of 20 percent in the overall budget should be \nrecognized, I intend to support the bill. But I will also be inclined \nto support vetoes of some items in the legislation.\n\n\n                              karnal bunt\n\n  Mr. President, before I conclude my remarks, I would like to take \nthis opportunity to discuss an ongoing issue that has severely affected \nthe wheat industry in Arizona. Karnal bunt was discovered in Arizona in \nMarch 1996. Growers and seed producers have been hard hit since then, \nand progress has been made only in the area of compensation. USDA \ncontinues to hold the wheat-seed industry under a Karnal bunt-spore \nquarantine, a decision that has devastated this once stable and \nprofitable industry. Though Karnal bunt poses no health threat to \nhumans or animals, USDA refuses to lift the quarantine. Furthermore, \nthe results of tests conducted by the USDA Agriculture Research Service \nscientists support findings by the University of Arizona that spores \nfrom ryegrass can severely bunt wheat. The science in this area is very \ninvolved, but what it boils down to is that USDA officials continue to \ncontend that there exist two separate spores for bunting wheat; they \nrefuse to acknowledge the Agriculture Research Service test results. \nThese results show that we are talking about one and the same spore, \nnot two separate spores. Yet ryegrass and wheat continue to be treated \ndifferently, one is not quarantined but the other is. Arizona remains \nthe only State under quarantine.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about an Arizona industry that produced \nmore than 335,000 tons of wheat in 1995 at a value of $46.2 million. \nThe value of the 1996 crop before Karnal bunt was expected to top $80 \nmillion. This year, Arizona wheatgrowers planted approximately 20 \npercent less wheat due to Karnal bunt restrictions. Dr. Bruce Beatty of \nthe University of Arizona estimates losses of more than $100 million, \nan estimate given in Federal court testimony that has not been \nchallenged by the USDA. Obviously, the wheat industry plays a vital \nrole in the economy of Arizona.\n  In a June 19 speech made to the International Grains Council, \nSecretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman stated that ``perhaps the \ngreatest threat to free trade is phony science.'' He continued, \n``Unfounded sanitary and phytosanitary objections have the potential to \nwreck the delicate balance of fairness we are trying to establish.'' \nFairness is all Arizona seeks. The USDA policy in addressing the Karnal \nbunt issue has failed. Science has shown that severe bunting of wheat \ncan occur from spores determined to be ryegrass in nature from Oregon, \nAlabama, Tennessee, and Georgia. Yet Arizona remains the only State \nunder quarantine. Therefore, I call on the Secretary to lift the \nquarantine that has wreaked havoc on the Arizona wheat industry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I commend Senators Cochran and Bumpers for \nthe excellent bill they crafted to fund many crucial programs affecting \nAmerican agriculture. They have done a superb job of balancing the \ncompeting yet meritorious interests covered in this legislation. It was \na pleasure working with them as a new member of the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations, and I thank them for the generous way in which they \nresponded to my requests to ensure that the needs of North Dakota \nfarmers and ranchers were addressed.\n  There is one issue which was not addressed in this bill which is of \ngreat concern to me. I hope it will be addressed in conference. The \nbuildings and facilities account of the Cooperative State Research, \nExtension, and Education Service received no funding in this bill. \nWhile I understand the chairman's desire not to continue to fund this \nconstruction account, I think it is unfair not to fulfill our \nresponsibilities to complete the projects in the pipeline. There are a \nnumber of institutions in this category. These institutions have \nalready received partial Federal funding, have met all the program \nrequirements, including their 50-percent State matching requirement, \nbut they cannot be completed unless the conference committee provides \nthe balance of the Federal funding needed to do so.\n  North Dakota State University [NDSU] falls into this category, and it \nis a unique case. Since fiscal year 1992, it has received approximately \n$1.9 million in Federal funds for an animal care research facility. It \nwas not until June 30, 1995, when the House indicated in its report on \nthe fiscal year 1996 Agriculture appropriations bill that it was making \nan ``in depth review of policies and practices related to this \nprogram,'' that there was any indication that the program might be \nchanged. In fact, it was not until September 28, 1995, that we had \nnotice that time might be of importance and that it was the conference \ncommittee's intent to terminate the program after fiscal year 1997.\n  Since North Dakota has a biennial legislature, which did not meet in \n1996, it could not meet its 50-percent cost share requirement in 1996. \nWhen the legislature met early in 1997, it appropriated the relevant \nState cost share funds for this facility. Let me repeat, the only \nreason NDSU did not meet the committee's 1996 requirement is that it \ncould not since our State legislature did not meet.\n  The animal care facility at North Dakota State University is an \nextremely important project for the State and the region. Livestock \nproduction is a $1 billion industry in our State. It is likely to grow. \nBut livestock disease is always a threat to the industry, especially \nsome of the anabiotic-resistant organisms and viruses we have to deal \nwith today. Work in this proposed facility can help protect incomes in \nthe livestock industry by reducing livestock disease and deaths, \ncontributing to the development of more effective pharmaceuticals and \nhelping to ensure the quality and safety of food products. This \nfacility is absolutely crucial to the future health and growth of \nagriculture in our region.\n  Not to provide the balance of the Federal funds necessary to complete \nthis facility, when North Dakota State University and the North Dakota \nState Legislature acted in good faith, seems unfair to me, and I urge \nmy colleagues on the conference committee to seek an equitable solution \nto this problem.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and ranking members, Senators Cochran and \nBumpers, and their excellent staffs, especially Becky Davies and Galen \nFountain, for all their help on this bill.\n\n\n                            Asthma Inhalers\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise to highlight my particular support \nfor one provision in the committee report for this bill and express my \nconcern with proposed Food and Drug Administration rulemaking that \nwould adversely effect asthma patients.\n\n[[Page S7945]]\n\n  First, I'd like to note my own personal interest in the issue. My own \nchildren suffer from asthma and I appreciate only too well the impact \nof this condition on children and their families. As a result, I \nstrongly support efforts to ensure that asthmatics have access to the \nsafest and most effective treatment.\n  The agency's recent actions, however, suggest that remote, even \nhypothetical environmental concerns might take precedence over the \ndirect concerns for the lives and health of America's substantial \nasthmatic population. In March of this year, the agency issued an \nadvance notice of proposed rulemaking setting forth the criteria by \nwhich it would ban certain CFC-propelled metered-dose inhalers [MDI's] \nfrom sale in this country. The proposal was apparently developed in \nresponse to concerns about ozone depletion.\n  But this ozone depletion is already subject to international treaty \nprovisions of the Montreal protocol that ensure the timely removal of \nproducts using CFC's. These medical devices are covered by those \nprovisions, even though they only contribute a fraction of 1 percent of \nthe overall atmospheric chlorine that threatens the ozone. Now the \nagency proposes to speed up the ban on those products in pursuit of \nsome environmental gain--but at the risk of patients with asthma.\n  There is currently only one MDI, of approximately 70, that is not \npropelled by CFC's. Removing any or all of these products too early may \nthreaten the health of some patients, particularly the increasing \nnumber of American children with asthma. How will the agency address a \nsituation where a CFC-free product with an active ingredient is not \nlabeled for children when the proposed rule would remove from the \nmarket a CFC-propelled product with the same ingredient that is labeled \nfor children? How is the health of those children promoted through such \na policy? Why is the agency considering removing otherwise legal \nproducts from the market, products proven to be beneficial for \nchildren, at a time when it laments the lack of adequately labeled \nproducts for children? And further, how are children, health care \ncosts, and the Federal budget benefited by this bureaucratically \ncreated monopoly?\n  If the agency believes that hypothetical environmental concerns can \njustify speeding up an international treaty that attempts to \naccommodate the health of these 5 million children with asthma, then I \nurge them to justify that position before the relevant committees of \nCongress. In the meantime, I urge the FDA to carefully consider the \nmerits of the rulemaking they are proposing and whether alternative \napproaches might better serve the health of America's asthmatic \nchildren.\n\n\n                Amendment Nos. 973 Through 976, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under the previous order, there is \npermitted the offering of a managers' amendment.\n  Senator Bumpers and I have been working to identify requests from \nSenators for inclusion in this managers' amendment, and we have now \nprepared a managers' amendment and it includes the following four \namendments:\n  An amendment to be offered by myself and Senator Bumpers on behalf of \nSenators Daschle, Dorgan, Johnson, Conrad and Baucus, regarding the \nLivestock Indemnity Assistance Program; an amendment proposed by \nSenators Grams and Wellstone regarding the planting of wild rice; an \namendment proposed by Senator Craig regarding inspection and \ncertification of agricultural processing equipment; an amendment \nproposed by Senator DeWine on the Orphan Feeding Program in Haiti.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes \n     amendments numbered 973 through 976, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 973\n\n       At the end of the bill insert the following new section:\n       ``Sec.  . From proceeds earned from the sale of grain in \n     the disaster reserve established in the Agricultural Act of \n     1970, the Secretary may use up to an additional $23 million \n     to implement a livestock indemnity program as established in \n     PL 105-18.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 974\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of appropriated funds to administer the \n provision of contract payments to a producer for contract acreage on \nwhich wild rice is planted unless the contract payment is reduced by an \n           acre for each contract acre planted to wild rice)\n\n       On page 66, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 728. PLANTING OF WILD RICE ON CONTRACT ACREAGE.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated in this Act may be used to \n     administer the provision of contract payments to a producer \n     under the Agricultural Market Transition Act (7. U.S.C. 7201 \n     et seq.) for contract acreage on which wild rice is planted \n     unless the contract payment is reduced by an acre for each \n     contract acre planted to wild rice.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. This technical amendment, which I offer with Senator \nWellstone, simply provides that if a producer decides to grow wild rice \non acres on which he receives Agricultural Market Transition Act [AMTA] \npayments, that producer's AMTA payment will be reduced on those acres.\n  This amendment ensures that wild rice producers, who do not receive \nany kind of program payment, do not have to compete against producers \nwho unfairly grow wild rice plus collect farm payments on the same \nacreage. In short, it ensures fairness by prohibiting double dipping \nand keeps producers on an equal playing field.\n  USDA once believed that the substance of this amendment could be \naccomplished through regulation but later indicated that legislation is \nnecessary.\n  This same amendment was approved during consideration of last year's \nAgriculture appropriations on a voice vote but was removed during \nconference with other provisions for reasons unrelated to the substance \nof the amendment.\n  I understand the amendment I offer has been approved by the chairman \nand ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senators Lugar \nand Harkin. I want to thank each of them for their assistance in this \nregard.\n  I also understand that this amendment has been accepted by the \nchairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senators Cochran and Bumpers.\n  Accordingly, I would ask the chairman to accept this amendment I \noffer today with Senator Wellstone.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 975\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of appropriated funds to inspect or \n   certify agricultural products unless the Secretary of Agriculture \ninspects and certifies agricultural processing equipment, and imposes a \n fee for the inspection and certification, in a manner that is similar \n     to the inspection and certification of agricultural products)\n\n       On page 66, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . INSPECTION AND CERTIFICATION OF AGRICULTURAL \n                   PROCESSING EQUIPMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), none \n     of the funds made available by this Act or any other Act for \n     any fiscal year may be used to carry out section 203(h) of \n     the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1622(h)) \n     unless the Secretary of Agriculture inspects and certifies \n     agricultural processing equipment, and imposes a fee for the \n     inspection and certification, in a manner that is similar to \n     the inspection and certification of agricultural products \n     under that section, as determined by the Secretary.\n       (b) Relationship to Other Law.--Subsection (a) shall not \n     affect the authority of the Secretary to carry out the \n     Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) or the \n     Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment relative \nto the inspection of equipment used in the production of agricultural \nproducts. For years, FSIS has inspected and certified all equipment \nused in processing agricultural products. However, FSIS announced on \nMay 2, 1996, its intent to discontinue its prior approval process.\n  While the FSIS proposal is still pending, no system of prior approval \nhas been developed anywhere at USDA.\n  Mr. President, the Craig amendment would establish a fee for service \nsystem for equipment inspection within AMS, which currently inspects \nprocessed agriculture products. Let me stress: The system would be \nentirely voluntary. Those equipment manufacturers who choose to \nparticipate would pay for the service and, if the equipment qualifies, \nbecome AMS certified.\n\n[[Page S7946]]\n\n  This proposal is self-funding and would use the existing trust fund \nestablished in section 203(h) of the Agricultural Marketing Act of \n1946. By providing a certification process to replace the FSIS system, \nthe amendment would both reduce the risk that unacceptable equipment \ncould be purchased and installed in processing plants and enhance \nexports of processing equipment.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the support of the managers of the bill \nin adopting this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 976\n\n    (Purpose: To require the United States Agency for International \n  Development to use at least the same amount of funds made available \n   under title II of Public Law 480 to carry out the orphan feeding \n program in Haiti during fiscal year 1998 as was used by the Agency to \n             carry out the program during fiscal year 1997)\n\n       On page 53, line 3, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That, of the amount of funds \n     made available under title II of said Act, the United States \n     Agency for International Development should use at least the \n     same amount of funds to carry out the orphan feeding program \n     in Haiti during fiscal year 1998 as was used by the Agency to \n     carry out the program during fiscal year 1997''.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, my amendment is simple and to the point. \nIt urges the U.S. Agency for International Development to maintain the \nsame level of resources for orphan feeding programs in Haiti in fiscal \nyear 1998 as it provided in fiscal year 1997.\n  The total funding level for Public Law 480 title II food programs is \nprojected to stay the same for fiscal year 1998 as was appropriated for \nfiscal year 1997. Therefore, I believe that keeping the same level of \nsuch resources for this particular program should not be contentious, \nespecially when my colleagues understand who the beneficiaries of this \nprogram are.\n  Mr. President, many facilities in Haiti have to care for a truly vast \nnumber of orphans--and also for an increasing number of abandoned and \nneglected children. In the Port-au-Prince area alone, Christian Relief \nServices provides Public Law 480 title II food assistance to 70 \norphanages. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency also supports \nsome 46 orphanages in the southern rural areas. Simply stated, there \nare numerous orphanages throughout this country which take care of \nthousands upon thousands of orphaned and abandoned children.\n\n  I have traveled to Haiti four times in the last few years and have \nvisited many orphanages. I can give you a first-hand account of some of \ntheir heart-breaking stories. The flow of desperate children into these \norphanages is constant--and these institutions face an increasing \nchallenge in accommodating all of these needy children.\n  Take the case of Notre Dame de Victoires, an orphanage run by Sister \nVeronique. She will not turn down a single child that is dropped off at \nher facility. She also makes frequent visits to the local hospitals \nwhere babies, after being born, are abandoned. This particular \norphanage takes care of the sickest of the sick. They get no means of \nsupport other than the food administered to them through CRS, which in \nturn receives its resources through AID.\n  Mr. President, let me make it clear what this amendment does. The \ncurrent program guarantees one meal a day to these orphans. My \namendment would ensure that these meals keep coming. I am not talking \nabout medical assistance, clothing, or anything else. Just one meal. \nThese orphanages still have to find sources of support for the other \nmeals and other necessary assistance for these children.\n  According to AID, $238,000 worth of food went indirectly to \norphanages in fiscal year 1996. If this figure is accurate, this is \nless than 1 percent of the total food resources allocated by AID for \nHaiti. Specifically, in fiscal year 1996 only 506 metric tonnes of \nfood--out of a total of 50,000 metric tonnes provided by AID--went \ntoward feeding children in orphanages. This is just a drop in the \nbucket of AID resources.\n  Now, I have urged AID to maintain the current level of resources \nallocated for feeding orphans in fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year \n1998. AID officials assured me that they will do just that. In fact, \nthey spoke to the relevant relief agencies about the situation and \nconfirmed that this could be done.\n  My original intent was to earmark this program, requiring AID to \nimplement what has been promised. After numerous conversations between \nmy staff and AID, and after their repeated assurances, the amendment I \nam offering states that AID simply should honor its commitment. This \namendment would make AID's commitment not a personal assurance to me, \nbut a commitment to the U.S. Senate. And if this language is kept in \nconference and signed into law, the commitment will be thus extended to \nthe entire U.S. Congress.\n  Mr. President, I am not asking for any more money than the orphanages \nare currently receiving from AID. This is essential for the survival of \nmany thousands of Haitian children living in overcrowded orphanages. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for this important amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments be considered and agreed to, en bloc, that statements of the \nSenators accompanying the amendments be printed in the Record, and that \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 973 through 976), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, that concludes action on the Agriculture \nappropriations bill that is contemplated for this evening. Under the \norder that has been entered, there will be consideration of specified \namendments tomorrow morning, and then we will vote on passage of the \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7935-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, H.R. 1119, the House-passed version of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, includes several maritime \nprovisions which are within the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation. Of particular interest are \nsection 1021(b) and title XXXVI of that bill. The House National \nSecurity Committee, which has jurisdiction over certain maritime \nmatters in that body, has chosen to attach these maritime \nauthorizations to H.R. 1119 rather than include them in a separate \nbill. If the Senate amends and passes H.R. 1119, the Commerce Committee \nwill not have the opportunity to consider those maritime provisions \nwhich are within its jurisdiction.\n  As both the chairman of the Commerce Committee and a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, I do not wish to either slow the progress we \nare making on the National Defense Authorization Act or relinquish the \nCommerce Committee's right to consider maritime authorizations under \nits jurisdiction. Therefore, I'd like to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss these provisions, and the process for addressing similar \njurisdictional issues in the future, with Senator Hollings, ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee; Senator Hutchison, chairman of the \nSurface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee; and Senator \nInouye, ranking member of the Surface Transportation and Merchant \nMarine Subcommittee.\n  First, I would like to summarize the maritime authorization \nprovisions of H.R. 1119. Section 1021(b) of the bill would amend title \n46, United States Code, to facilitate the scrapping of excess National \nDefense Reserve Fleet [NDRF] vessels that contain hazardous materials \nand would amend the National Maritime Heritage Act to extend the \nauthorization for this program an additional 2 years to 2001 to account \nfor the delay in scrapping the NDRF vessels. Section 3601 of the bill \nwould authorize appropriations for the Maritime Administration's \nexpenses for operations and training and under the loan guarantee \nprogram authorized by title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, at the \nlevels requested by the President for fiscal year 1998. Section 3602 \nwould repeal the requirement for a\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\nnow obsolete annual report by the Maritime Administration on regional \nshipbuilding costs. Section 3603 would amend the Maritime Security Act \nof 1996 by clarifying that the noncontiguous domestic trade \nrestrictions of that act do not apply to self-propelled tanker \noperations of Maritime Security Program [MSP] contractors. Also, \nsection 3603 would relieve foreign-built MSP vessels from the 3-year \ndelay in eligibility for certain cargo preference programs. Section \n3604 would amend the Maritime Security Act to allow vessel operators \nthat participate in military sealift readiness agreements with the \nDepartment of Defense, but that are not MSP contractors, to temporarily \nuse foreign-flag vessels as replacements for any vessel activated under \nthose agreements. Section 3605 would convey an NDRF vessel to the \nArtship Foundation in Oakland, CA. Section 3606 would enforce the \nsingle-hull tank vessel phase-out schedule of the Oil Pollution Act of \n1990 by eliminating a loophole that would otherwise allow single hull \ntank vessel lives to be extended by reducing their cargo capacity.\n  These provisions are clearly within the jurisdiction of the Commerce \nCommittee. I ask that the Armed Services Committee not accept them for \ninclusion in the final National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 1998 so that the Commerce Committee may consider these provisions \nas separate legislation this year. I ask Senators Hollings, Hutchison, \nand Inouye if they agree with this position.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I agree that these provisions are \nclearly within the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, that the \nArmed Services Committee should not accept them for inclusion in the \nfinal National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998, and that \nthe Commerce Committee should consider these provisions as separate \nlegislation this year.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I agree with this proposed course of \naction. I intend to introduce separate legislation including these \nprovisions so that they may be considered by the Commerce Committee \nthis year.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I intend to work with Senator Hutchison on \nseparate authorizing legislation, and also agree with this proposed \ncourse of action.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also intend to work with the members of \nthe Commerce Committee and the Armed Services Committee to ensure full \nCommerce Committee consideration of maritime issues that may be \nincluded in future national defense bills initiated by the other body.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I share the Commerce Committee \nchairman's interest in working with the Armed Services Committee to \nensure that the future inclusion of maritime provisions in House-passed \nnational defense bills does not impair the Commerce Committee's ability \nto carry out its jurisdictional responsibility over issues affecting \nthe Maritime Administration and the merchant marine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7946-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE LATE GEN. FRANK S. BESSON, JR.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, though the borders of the United States \nstretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Rio Grande to \nthe ``Great White North,'' the defense of our Nation takes our military \npersonnel around the globe. Point to almost any continent on the globe \nand you will find American soldiers serving bravely and selflessly, and \ntransporting these men and women to the far corners of the Earth, as \nwell as keeping them supplied with everything from bullets to vehicles, \nis a challenging but essential task which falls to the Army Materiel \nCommand. Today, I rise to pay tribute to a man who made many \ninnovations in the field of military logistics and who served the U.S. \nArmy in times of peace and war, Gen. Frank S. Besson, Jr.\n  General Besson passed away more than 10 years ago, but during his \nlife and military career, he distinguished himself in any number of \nways and set an excellent example for service to the Nation and \ndevotion to the Army. A 1932 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, \nthen Second Lieutenant Besson headed north to Boston where he earned a \nmaster's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His \neducation and training at West Point and MIT paid dividends for the \nsecurity of the Nation, and helped to pave his way to leadership \npositions at the highest levels of the U.S. Army. During his career, \nFrank Besson served with distinction in Persia, Japan, Europe, and in \nthe United States. He was responsible for important innovations in the \nareas of military pipelines, steel airplane landing mats, steel \ntreadway bridges, and ``roll-on/roll-off'' techniques. Though no sane \nperson welcomed the outbreak of World War II, that conflict proved the \nviability of Frank Beeson's innovations, and the lives of thousands of \nGI's were made a little easier thanks to his ideas and efforts. As a \nmatter of fact, it was Frank Besson who ordered studies which led to \nthe adoption of the ``Bailey Bridge,'' a key piece of equipment used \nduring World War II which allowed Allied Forces greater mobility in \ntheir march against the Reich.\n  At age 34, Frank Besson became the youngest brigadier general in the \nArmy Ground Forces. From 1941 to 1945, while we battled the Axis \nPowers, General Besson was charged with ensuring that Allied supplies \nreached Soviet forces through the Persian corridor, and as the Deputy \nChief Transportation Officer of Army Forces in the Western Pacific, he \nplayed an important role in the war against Japan. When the Imperial \nJapanese surrendered in 1945, General Besson shifted his efforts from \nworking for the defeat of that nation to helping rehabilitate its rail \nsystem and working to rebuild Japan.\n  As the shooting of World War II was replaced by the tense stalemate \nof the cold war, General Besson continued to serve, this time working \nto contain the Soviet Union by helping NATO plan and meet its \nlogistical challenges. By the end of the 1950's, General Besson had \nreached the top of his career field, serving as Chief of Transportation \nfor the U.S. Army, and when the Army Materiel Command was formed in \n1962, he took command of this new entity. On May 27, 1964, General \nBesson again made history by becoming the first Army officer to become \na four-star general as the head of a logistical organization during \npeacetime.\n  During his career, General Besson earned a long list of awards, \ncommendations, and distinctions, including the Distinguished Service \nMedal, the Legion of Merit, and the Commander of the Order of the \nBritish Empire. There is no question that this was a man who made his \nmark on military and transportation history, and who dedicated his life \nto protecting our Nation. While it has been many years since General \nBesson wore the uniform of the U.S. Army, his accomplishments, \nleadership, and service have not been forgotten, and as a matter of \nfact, they are still greatly appreciated by the soldiers of today.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending July 18, the United States imported 8,145,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 360,000 barrels more than the 7,785,000 \nimported each day during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 56.3 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 \npercent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil \nembargo in the 1970's foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of \nAmerica's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By \nU.S. producers using American workers?\n  Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in \nAmerica if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil\n\n[[Page S7948]]\n\nflowing into the United States--now 8,145,000 barrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7947-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RESOLVING OUR MARITIME DISPUTES WITH CANADA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I voted against the resolution \noffered by Senator Murkowski condemning the Government of Canada for \nits failure to resolve the blockade of a United States vessel in \nCanadian waters.\n  Canada's inaction clearly was wrong. The M/V Malaspina, a United \nStats passenger vessel operated by the Alaska Marine Highway System, \nwas blockaded in port by Canadian fishing boats for 3 days. The \nCanadian Government not only failed to condemn the blockage of the \nFerry boat, it also took no action to enforce an injunction issued by a \nCanadian court requiring the M/V Malaspina to be allowed to continue \nits passage. The ferry was able to continue its passage only when the \nfishing boats voluntarily ended their blockade.\n  There is no doubt that the M/V Malaspina has the right of innocent \npassage through the territorial sea of Canada. Article 17 of the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea guarantees that right to the \nships of all states.\n  There can also be no doubt that Canada failed to handle the illegal \nblockage of the United States vessel responsibly.\n  The amendment introduced by Senator Murkowski, however, is overkill. \nIt would grant broad authority to the President and instruct him to \ncompel Canada to prevent any further harassment of United States \nshipping. The amendment hints at the use of military force to escort \nshipping through Canadian waters, and offers only vague guidance on how \noutstanding maritime disputes with Canada might ultimately be resolved.\n  I believe that we should not jump to coercive methods to deal with \nmaritime disputes--especially with one of our closest allies and \nlargest trading partners--until all other diplomatic avenues have been \ntried and exhausted. Moreover, as a general rule, the Senate should \navoid granting the President broad authority to accomplish vague \nobjectives.\n  Rather than escalating this dispute, the Senate should call on Canada \nto fulfill its international commitments and provide assurances that \nthe M/V Malaspina episode will not be repeated. We deserve at least \nthat mush consideration from our ally to the north.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7948-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7948-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12 noon, a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 765.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Alaska; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas the federal matching rate for the Medicaid program \n     in each state varies from 50 percent to 77 percent based on \n     the relative per capita income of each state; and\n       Whereas the use of a simple per capita income figure in the \n     Medicaid program is unfair to the State of Alaska because it \n     ignores the higher cost of living in Alaska, particularly the \n     higher cost of health care services; and\n       Whereas this unfair federal funding formula affects not \n     only the state's receipt of federal matching funds for \n     Medicaid but also for the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance \n     Program, child support disbursements, and certain funds under \n     welfare reform; and\n       Whereas the federal government has already recognized the \n     higher cost of living in Alaska by adjusting by 25 percent \n     the Medicare nursing facility rates and the federal poverty \n     level figures for the state; and\n       Whereas the use of a 25 percent cost-of-living adjustment \n     in the federal formula would reduce the state's general fund \n     Medicaid match from 50 percent to 38 percent, resulting in a \n     savings of $39,249,300 in Medicaid and $646,000 in the Foster \n     Care and Adoption Assistance Program that could be applied to \n     other state purposes without any reductions in Medicaid \n     services or services to children; be it\n       Resolved That the Alaska State Legislature respectfully \n     urges the Congress to amend the Social Security Act so that \n     the higher cost of living in Alaska is reflected when per \n     capita income is used in determining the federal share of \n     Medicaid costs in the state.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-191.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to extend the \nInterstate 4R discretionary program; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n             THE INTERSTATE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould help improve our country's aging Interstate System--the \nInterstate System Improvement Act of 1997. My colleagues, Senators \nMoseley-Braun and Reid have joined me as original cosponsors.\n  This bill is simple. It would fund the discretionary Interstate 4R \n[I-4R] program at a level of $800 million annually, a significant \nincrease from the current level of $66 million in fiscal year 1997. I \nbelieve that the I-4R program is one of the most crucial aspects of the \nupcoming Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act [ISTEA] \nreauthorization. And, I hope to work with my colleagues on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to incorporate this important \nmeasure into ISTEA legislation later this year.\n  The I-4R program is critical to the resurfacing, restoration, \nrehabilitation, and reconstruction of our country's vital \ninfrastructure. This year, the program is funded at $66 million. \nHowever, demand for funds has outpaced available money by more than 9 \nto 1. For example, in fiscal year 1997, 25 States requested $1.2 \nbillion in I-4R funds under the discretionary program. Only six States \nreceived assistance, most at greatly reduced levels. Nineteen States \nwill receive no I-4R discretionary funds in fiscal year 1997 and over \n$1 billion in funding requests have gone unanswered.\n  States with major interstate projects would benefit greatly from this \nlegislation. In Illinois alone, the State faces a highway funding \nshortage because of crucial projects like the Stevenson Expressway in \nChicago and I-74 in Peoria. These projects are simply too important to \ndelay. A healthy I-4R discretionary program is necessary in order to \nrebuild this vital infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in advancing this \nimportant legislation.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nInterstate System Improvement Act of 1997 with my colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin.\n  This legislation would increase the authorization for the \ndiscretionary I-4R program from its current level of around $60 to $800 \nmillion annually. This change would allow States with large interstate \nimprovement projects to compete for discretionary grants at the Federal \nlevel.\n  As our Nation's interstate system ages, it is going to become more \nimportant for many States to have access to large, discretionary grants \nfor major interstate improvement projects. For my home State of \nIllinois, this legislation would provide an opportunity to compete for \nfunds to reconstruct a 15-mile segment of the aging Stevenson \nExpressway, one of the Chicago area's most important arteries, and one \nthat is badly in need of repair.\n  I believe this change is important to improve our current system of \nhighway funding, and I urge my colleagues on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee who are involved in drafting legislation to reauthorize \nthe Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act to include \nthis legislation as part of their reauthorization bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Coats, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 1056. A bill to provide for farm-related exemptions from certain \nhazardous materials transportation requirements; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  farm-related exemptions legislation\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to provide \nfor farm-related exemptions for certain hazardous materials and \ntransportation requirements. I send it to the desk and ask for its \nappropriate referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be read twice and then referred \nto the appropriate committee.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nprovide further regulatory relief for our farmers and ranchers.\n  Let me give you some background on this issue. Earlier this year, the \nU.S. Department of Transportation published a rule under the HM-200 \ndocket which severely restricts the transportation of agricultural \nproducts classified as hazardous materials.\n  This aspect of the HM-200 rule could cost the agricultural retail \nindustry and the farm economy millions of dollars every year.\n  Currently, States model their regulations concerning the transport of \nhazardous materials on Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations [HMR's]. \nHowever, some States with large farm economies provide exceptions from \nthe State HMR's to the agricultural industry for the short-haul, \nintrastate, retail-to-farm transport of agricultural inputs.\n\n  HM-200 would supersede all State HMR's, eliminate these exceptions, \nand apply Federal regulations to the short-haul, seasonal and mostly \nrural transport of farm products.\n  The cost of this regulatory burden is estimated to be in excess of \n$12,300 a year for each agricultural retailer. Industrywide, it is \nestimated that it could cost the agricultural economy nearly $62 \nmillion annually.\n  We all want safe highways, safe food production, and a safe \nworkplace, but when DOT, OSHA, and EPA regulations are stirred together \nin a pot, the stew can turn out to be quite rancid. Placing these \nFederal burdens on the backs of farmers and ranchers in Montana's rural \ncommunities, can mean the difference between flying or dying.\n  HM-200 will require agricultural retailers to comply with time \nconsuming and costly regulations that will not make our rural roads \nsafer, but only increase the cost of doing business, cause confusion, \nand require unnecessary paperwork. These expenses will be passed on to \nfarmers who already are burdened with slimming margins and ever higher \ncost of production.\n  States and the agricultural community have an excellent track record \nfor protecting the environment and keeping the public safe. The \nagricultural retail industry complies with numerous safety measures \nsuch as requiring all drivers to have Commercial Drivers Licenses \n[CDL's] drug and alcohol testing for drivers, HAZMAT handling \nexperience, and so forth.\n  Additionally, States which do not provide exceptions to their own \nHMR's for the agricultural community will face a new regulatory burden \nsince these States rarely enforce the regulations that they have in \nplace. The U.S. DOT has made it abundantly clear that they will expect \nall States to actively enforce HM-200, thereby making it an unfunded \nmandate.\n  Despite petitions for reconsideration from the agricultural \ncommunity--all of which have gone unanswered by DOT--HM-200 is due to \nbe implemented on October 1, 1997--it was published in February of this \nyear.\n  This legislation seeks to delay implementation of HM-200 with respect \nto agricultural transports, until October 1, 1999, or until the \nreauthorization of Federal Hazardous Materials legislation. By allowing \nfor a delay in HM-200 implementation, I believe we can properly address \nand examine the facts as they stand with regard to the need for this \nnew regulation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation, and help keep \nour agricultural community from having to bear a needless expense which \nhas little safety value to the public.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. \n        Johnson):\n  S. 1057. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nrequire mandatory spending limits for Senate candidates and limits on \nindependent expenditures, to ban soft money, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n               THE CAMPAIGN SPENDING CONTROL ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss legislation I have \njust introduced, the Campaign Spending Control Act of 1997. The 1996 \nelections, unfortunately, will be remembered for two remarkable facts. \nFirst, Federal campaigns produced record spending; over $2.7 billion or \nalmost $28 for every voter. Second, the election produced record-low \nvoter participation: less than half of those eligible chose to vote. \nThese two tragic facts are inextricably linked.\n  Due to the vast sums of money spent on campaigns, most Americans \nbelieve\n\n[[Page S7952]]\n\nour current campaign system is tainted by special interest money. Under \na flood of money and television ads, voters view their voice as \nmeaningless, their concerns as unaddressed, and their votes as \nunimportant. In order to restore public confidence, campaign finance \nreform must accomplish three goals. It must significantly reduce \ncampaign spending; level the playing field for those who challenge \nincumbents; and, finally, encourage greater public participation and \ndebate.\n  These goals cannot be successfully addressed without significantly \nchanging the rules which govern campaigns. Campaign scandals have posed \na threat to the health of our democracy throughout our Nation's \nhistory. In 1907, after enduring embarrassment over a campaign scandal, \nPresident Teddy Roosevelt championed legislation prohibiting \ncorporations from financing Federal candidates. In 1974, responding to \nthe scandals of the 1972 elections and the resignation of President \nNixon, Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation limiting spending by \ncandidates, parties, and wealthy individuals.\n  In 1996, all the past campaign reforms imploded, with a flood of \ncorporate and individual money overwhelming legal limits. Million-\ndollar corporate contributions funded advertisements to impact \nPresidential and congressional campaigns. Well-funded individuals and \norganizations also got into the act. By spending a record $70 million \non so-called issue advertising, labor unions, business organizations, \nand ideological groups circumvented limits on direct contributions to \ncandidates. Thus, candidates, awash in a sea of outside money, were \npushed to not only trounce their opponents in fundraising, but to match \noutside groups. The chase for dollars sapped candidates' time which \ncould have been spent debating, attending forums, and otherwise \nengaging voters. Once solicited, most of these millions were spent on \nuninformative, 30-second advertisements, which only served to further \nalienate the electorate. Unchecked, this campaign system will spiral \ninto exponential spending increases, further disenfranchisement, and \nless dialog. The system is already close to collapsing under its own \nweight; the time to act is now.\n  The roots of this abysmal situation can be traced to a misguided \nSupreme Court decision. In Buckley versus Valeo, a 1976 case which \nchallenged the 1974 campaign reform legislation, the Court held that, \nin order to avoid corruption, contributions to candidates and \ncommittees could be limited. However, the Court invalidated expenditure \nlimits on candidates and independent entities as infringements on free \nspeech rights. The Court surmised that unlimited spending would \nincrease the number and depth of issues discussed. Twenty years of \ncampaign spending has proven the Court's decision fatally flawed: fewer \nissues are discussed, less debate occurs, and voter participation has \ndeclined. The single most important step to reform elections and \nrevitalize our democracy is to reverse the Buckley decision by limiting \nthe amount of money that a candidate or his allies can spend.\n\n  For this reason, Senators Bryan, Hollings, Johnson, and I are \nintroducing legislation which directly challenges the Buckley decision \nand places mandatory limits on all campaign expenditures. These limits \ndo not favor incumbents. Over the last three elections, these limits \nwould have restricted 80 percent of incumbents, while only impacting 18 \npercent of those who challenged incumbents. Additionally, this \nlegislation would fully ban corporate contributions, as well as \nunlimited and unregulated contributions by wealthy individuals and \norganizations. Further, our bill would limit campaign expenditures by \nsupposedly, neutral, independent groups, and restrict corporations, \nlabor unions, and other organizations from influencing campaigns under \nthe guise of issue advocacy. The end result of this legislation would \nbe to eliminate over $500 million from the system, discourage \nviolations, encourage challenges to incumbents, and further promote \ndebate among both candidates and the electorate.\n  What effect would these limits have on political debate? Contrary to \nthe Supreme Court, I believe such limits would increase dialog. \nCandidates would be free from the burdens of unending fundraising and \nthus be available to participate in debates, forums, and interviews. \nWith greater access to candidates and less reason to believe that \ncandidates were captives of their contributors, voters might well be \nmore prepared to invest the time needed to be informed on issues of \nconcern and ask candidates to address them.\n  Some will argue that this legislation impinges upon freedom of \nspeech. The bill will marginally restrict the rights of a few to spend \nmoney--not speak--so that the majority of voters might restore their \nfaith in the process. Thus, speech will be restricted no more than \nnecessary to fulfill what I believe to be several compelling interests. \nSuch a restriction conforms with constitutional jurisprudence and has \nbeen demonstrated necessary by history. The fact is all democratic \ndebates are restricted by rules. My legislation would simply implement \nnecessary rules into our campaign system. Finally, it is important to \nremember that the vast majority of Americans, 96 percent, have never \nmade a political contribution at any level of government. Capping \nexpenditures will truly impact very few individuals, and that \nrestriction will be marginal, but necessary.\n  Implementing spending caps is a grass-roots initiative. Elected \nofficials from 33 States have urged that the Buckley decision be \nrevisited and limits implemented. Legislative bodies in Ohio and \nVermont have implemented sweeping reform by enacting mandatory caps on \ncandidate expenditures. Other States, such as my own, have embraced \npublic financing as a means of reform. Yet, today, Congress struggles \nto even consider the most modest of reforms, such as banning so called \nsoft money: unlimited donations by corporations, labor unions, and \nwealthy individuals to political party committees. Unfortunately, \nbecause most of the current reform proposals accept the reasoning \nenunciated in the Buckley decision, they will only serve to redirect an \nunlimited flow of cash. While I enthusiastically support any \nsubstantive reform, if we are to address the underlying cancer which \nhas disintegrated voter trust and participation, the problem of \nunlimited expenditures must be directly confronted. This is a step that \none municipality and two States have embraced. Many more State \nofficials as well as prominent constitutional law scholars have urged \nsuch a course. Expenditure limitations have been proposed by \ncongressional reformers in the past, and it is time to rededicate \nourselves to this goal.\n\n  Mr. President, I have a list of the 33 State officials and 24 State \nattorneys general who have urged the reversal of Buckley. I ask \nunanimous consent that these documents be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, our democracy is dependent upon \nparticipation, stimulated by a belief that the system works for \neveryone. Just as scandals led to reform in 1907 and 1974, Congress \nmust now rise to the task once again to address a threat to our \ndemocratic process. Polls continue to demonstrate that a majority of \nAmericans believe the political process is controlled by wealthy \ninterests. The most dangerous aspect of the current situation is that \npolls also show that voters have no faith in the ability of their \nrepresentatives to implement reform. If we do not address the influence \nof money in our electoral system, the health of our democracy will \nendure increasing risk. It is time to begin true, comprehensive reform. \nI would like to thank Senators Bryan, Hollings, and Johnson for joining \nme in this endeavor. Their leadership on this issue in the past has \nproven invaluable, and I am proud that they have chosen to join me in \nthis important effort. It is my hope that the Senate will now move to \naddress the problem of our campaign system at its root. Finally, Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1057\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) restore the public confidence in and the integrity of \n     our democratic system;\n       (2) strengthen and promote full and free discussion and \n     debate during election campaigns;\n       (3) relieve Federal officeholders from limitations on their \n     attention to the affairs of the Federal government that can \n     arise from excessive attention to fundraising;\n       (4) relieve elective office-seekers and officeholders from \n     the limitations on purposeful political conduct and discourse \n     that can arise from excessive attention to fundraising;\n       (5) reduce corruption and undue influence, or the \n     appearance thereof, in the financing of Federal election \n     campaigns; and\n       (6) provide non-preferential terms of access to elected \n     Federal officeholders by all interested members of the public \n     in order to uphold the constitutionally guaranteed right to \n     petition the Government for redress of grievances.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS OF FACT.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The current Federal campaign finance system, with its \n     perceived preferential access to lawmakers for interest \n     groups capable of contributing sizable sums of money to \n     lawmakers' campaigns, has caused a widespread loss of public \n     confidence in the fairness and responsiveness of elective \n     government and undermined the belief, necessary to a \n     functioning democracy, that the Government exists to serve \n     the needs of all people.\n       (2) The United States Supreme Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, \n     424 U.S. 1 (1976), disapproved the use of mandatory spending \n     limits as a remedy for such effects, while approving the use \n     of campaign contribution limits.\n       (3) Since that time, campaign expenditures have risen \n     steeply in Federal elections with spending by successful \n     candidates for the United States Senate between 1976 and 1996 \n     rising from $609,100 to $3,775,000, an increase that is twice \n     the rate of inflation.\n       (4) As campaign spending has escalated, voter turnout has \n     steadily declined and in 1996 voter turnout fell to its \n     lowest point since 1924, and stands now at the lowest level \n     of any democracy in the world.\n       (5) Coupled with out-of-control campaign spending has come \n     the constant necessity of fundraising, arising, to a large \n     extent, from candidates adopting a defensive ``arms race'' \n     posture of constant readiness against the risk of massively \n     financed attacks against whatever the candidate may say or \n     do.\n       (6) The current campaign finance system has had a \n     deleterious effect on those who hold public office as endless \n     fundraising pressures intrude upon the performance of \n     constitutionally required duties. Capable and dedicated \n     officials have left office in dismay over these distractions \n     and the negative public perceptions that the fundraising \n     process engenders and numerous qualified citizens have \n     declined to seek office because of the prospect of having to \n     raise the extraordinary amounts of money needed in today's \n     elections.\n       (7) The requirement for candidates to fundraise, the \n     average 1996 expenditure level required a successful Senate \n     candidate to raise more than $12,099 a week for 6 years, \n     significantly impedes on the ability of Senators and other \n     officeholders to tend to their official duties, and limits \n     the ability of candidates to interact with the electorate \n     while also tending to professional responsibilities.\n       (8) As talented incumbent and potential public servants are \n     deterred from seeking office in Congress because of such \n     fundraising pressures, the quality of representation suffers \n     and those who do serve are impeded in their effort to devote \n     full attention to matters of the Government by the campaign \n     financing system.\n       (9) Contribution limits are inadequate to control all of \n     these trends and as long as campaign spending is effectively \n     unrestrained, supporters can find ways to protect their \n     favored candidates from being outspent. Since 1976 major \n     techniques have been found and exploited to get around and \n     evade contribution limits.\n       (10) Techniques to evade contribution limits include \n     personal spending by wealthy candidates, independent \n     expenditures that assist or attack an identified candidate, \n     media campaigns by corporations, labor unions, and nonprofit \n     organizations to advocate the election or defeat of \n     candidates, and the use of national, State, or local \n     political parties as a conduit for money that assists or \n     attacks such candidates.\n       (11) Wealthy candidates may, under the present Federal \n     campaign financing system, spend any amount they want out of \n     their own resources and while such spending may not be self-\n     corrupting, it introduces the very defects the Supreme Court \n     wants to avoid. The effectively limitless character of such \n     resources obliges a wealthy candidate's opponent to reach for \n     larger amounts of outside support, causing the deleterious \n     effects previously described.\n       (12) Experience shows that there is an identity of interest \n     between candidates and political parties because the parties \n     exist to support candidates, not the other way around. Party \n     expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, an \n     identifiable candidate are, therefore, effectively spending \n     on behalf of a candidate.\n       (13) Political experience shows that so-called \n     ``independent'' support, whether by individuals, committees, \n     or other entities, can be and often is coordinated with a \n     candidate's campaign by means of tacit understandings without \n     losing its nominally independent character and, similarly, \n     contributions to a political party, ostensibly for ``party-\n     building'' purposes, can be and often are routed, by \n     undeclared design, to the support of identified candidates.\n       (14) The actual, case-by-case detection of coordination \n     between candidate, party, and independent contributor is, as \n     a practical matter, impossible in a fast-moving campaign \n     environment.\n       (15) So-called ``issue advocacy'' communications, by or \n     through political parties or independent contributors, need \n     not, as a practical matter, advocate expressly for the \n     election or defeat of a named candidate in order to cross the \n     line into election campaign advocacy; any clear, objective \n     indication of purpose, such that voters may readily observe \n     where their electoral support is invited, can suffice as \n     evidence of intent to impact a Federal election campaign.\n       (16) When State political parties or other entities \n     operating under State law receive funds, often called ``soft \n     money'', for use in Federal elections, they become de facto \n     agents of the national political party and the inclusion of \n     these funds under applicable Federal limitations is necessary \n     and proper for the effective regulation of Federal election \n     campaigns.\n       (17) The exorbitant level of money in the political system \n     has served to distort our democracy by giving some \n     contributors, who constitute less than 3 percent of the \n     citizenry, the appearance of favored access to elected \n     officials, thus undermining the ability of ordinary citizens \n     to petition their Government. Concerns over the potential for \n     corruption and undue influence, and the appearances thereof, \n     has left citizens cynical, the reputation of elected \n     officials tarnished, and the moral authority of Government \n     weakened.\n       (18) The 2 decades of experience since the Supreme Court's \n     Buckley v. Valeo ruling in 1976 have made it evident that \n     reasonable limits on election campaign expenditures are now \n     necessary and these limits must comprehensively address all \n     types of expenditures to prevent circumvention of such \n     limits.\n       (19) The Supreme Court based its Buckley v. Valeo decision \n     on a concern that spending limits could narrow political \n     speech ``by restricting the number of issues discussed, the \n     depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience \n     reached''. The experience of the past 20 years has been \n     otherwise as experience shows that unlimited expenditures can \n     drown out or distort political discourse in a flood of \n     distractive repetition. Reasonable spending limits will \n     increase the opportunity for previously muted voices to be \n     heard and thereby increase the number, depth, and diversity \n     of ideas presented to the public.\n       (20) Issue advocacy communications that do not promote or \n     oppose an identified candidate should remain unregulated, as \n     should the traditional freedom of the press to report and \n     editorialize about candidates and campaigns.\n       (21) In establishing reasonable limits on campaign \n     spending, it is necessary that the limits reflect the \n     realities of modern campaigning in a large, diverse \n     population with sophisticated and expensive modes of \n     communication. The limits must allow citizens to benefit from \n     a full and free debate of issues and permit candidates to \n     garner the resources necessary to engage in that debate.\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\n       (22) The expenditure limits established in this Act for \n     election to the United States Senate were determined after \n     careful review of historical spending patterns in Senate \n     campaigns as well as the particular spending level of the 3 \n     most recent elections as evidenced by the following:\n       (A) The limit formula allows candidates a level of spending \n     which guarantees an ability to disseminate their message by \n     accounting for the size of the population in each State as \n     well as historical spending trends including the demonstrated \n     trend of lower campaign spending per voter in larger States \n     as compared to voter spending in smaller States.\n       (B) The candidate expenditure limits included in this \n     legislation would have restricted 80 percent of the incumbent \n     candidates in the last 3 elections, while only impeding 18 \n     percent of the challengers.\n       (C) It is clear from recent experience that expenditure \n     limits as set by the formula in this Act will be high enough \n     to allow an effective level of competition, encourage \n     candidate dialogue with constituents, and circumscribe the \n     most egregiously high spending levels, so as to be a bulwark \n     against future campaign finance excesses and the resulting \n     voter disenfranchisement.\n                TITLE I--SENATE ELECTION SPENDING LIMITS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Valeo.\n       Former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley has denounced the decision \n     and has helped lead the recent push in the U.S. Congress for \n     a constitutional amendment to allow for mandatory spending \n     limits in federal elections. The City of Cincinnati is \n     litigating the first direct court challenge to the ruling, \n     defending an ordinance passed in 1995 by the City Council \n     which sets limits in city council races. And, in late October \n     1996, a group of prominent constitutional scholars from \n     around the nation signed a statement calling for the reversal \n     of Buckley.\n       The attorneys general statement reads as follows:\n       ``Over two decades ago, the United States Supreme Court, in \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), declared mandatory \n     campaign expenditure limits unconstitutional on First \n     Amendment grounds.

A bill to restrict the activities of the United States with \nrespect to foreign laws that regulate the marketing of tobacco products \nand to subject cigarettes that are exported to the same restrictions on \nlabeling as apply to the sale or distribution of cigarettes in the \nUnited States; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n              the worldwide tobacco disclosure act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Worldwide \nTobacco Disclosure Act of 1997. I am joined by Senators Wyden, Durbin, \nand Harkin. Our bill will address a loophole in current law that \nenables packages of cigarettes to be exported from this country without \nwarning labels and to prevent the executive branch from undermining \nother countries' restrictions on tobacco.\n  Within a few decades, the World Health Organization estimates that 10 \nmillion people will die annually from tobacco-related disease, up from \n3 million per year. An astonishing 70 percent of those deaths will be \nin developing countries. To give my colleagues a basis for comparison, \nin America, today, approximately 400,000 die a year from tobacco. While \nsmoking has declined 10 percent since 1990 in developed countries, the \nWHO concludes it has risen an alarming 67 percent in developing \ncountries during that same period. American tobacco exports have \nincreased by almost 340 percent since the mid-1970's, and these exports \nnow account for more than half of our tobacco companies' sales.\n  America is rightfully proud of its exports and the standards it \nupholds in international trade. But with tobacco, we're exporting \ndeath. We are the largest exporter of a product we know kills, and that \nis not something about which we should be proud. With marketing savvy \nand millions of dollars, American tobacco companies have significantly \nincreased cigarette consumption in developing countries. It is \nestimated that cigarette consumption increased by 10 percent as a \ndirect result of American tobacco companies entering the markets of \nJapan, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan.\n  Why should Congress care if hundreds of thousands of teenage boys and \ngirls in China become addicted to nicotine? Why not let their \ngovernment deal with this matter? Mr. President, morally, we are \nobligated to warn them, to the extent we know of tobacco's dangers. We \nare obligated to support the efforts of our trading partners to protect \nthe health of their citizens.\n  Mr. President, cigarettes kill and the label should clearly state \nthat. One component of the proposed tobacco settlement between the \nState attorneys general and the tobacco industry was stronger warning \nlabels on cigarette packages, similar to those I included in \nlegislation introduced earlier this year. While we are taking \nadditional steps to make our citizens more aware of the dangers of \ntobacco, my colleagues may be surprised to know that our Government \nrequires no warning on exported cigarette packages. We know that \nsmoking is addictive and can kill, but you would never guess that by \nlooking at a pack of Camels exported from this country into Africa or \nEastern Europe. When we enacted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and \nAdvertising Act of 1965, we may have thought that other countries would \nrequire their own warning labels and these would be adequate. We know, \nMr. President, that this is simply not the case.\n\n  Too many countries, especially in the developing world, have no \nwarning labels on cigarette packages, and those that do, are inadequate \nto fully alert their citizens to the dangers of tobacco. Coupled with a \npoor national health system, citizens in these countries have no chance \nagainst tobacco promotional giveaways or slick advertising. Not knowing \nof the health risks associated with cigarettes, they are easily \naddicted and a significant percentage of them will die from this \nproduct.\n  Mr. President, barring further steps, a health crisis resulting from \ntobacco will occur in the developing world within the next few decades. \nOur country alone spends $50 billion a year more on health care as a \nresult of tobacco. Imagine what the worldwide cost of tobacco related \nillness will be in 20 years. Today limited funds are spent combating \nhunger, AIDS and other infectious diseases, and infant mortality \nworldwide. In about 10 years, we can add tobacco related illnesses to \nthe list.\n  One part of this legislation, Mr. President, requires exported \npackages of cigarettes to have warning labels in the language of the \ncountry where the cigarette will be consumed. Before exporting \nhazardous materials, Congress requires exports to alert our Government \nprior to export so that we might warn the government of the importing \ncountry that a certain product is being shipped to its borders. \nCigarettes are a hazardous product and should be treated differently \nthan an exported widget. Foreign subsidiaries of American tobacco \ncompanies will also be required to comply with this legislation because \nwe do not want to put our farmers at a competitive disadvantage. This \nis a global problem that must be addressed by whatever means we have \navailable. Should a country require more stringent labels than ours, \nthe administration could grant a waiver of this provision for that \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the success tobacco companies have had selling death \noverseas is not solely due to their own own efforts. In the past, the \nU.S. Government assisted U.S. tobacco companies in hooking foreigners \nby using trade policy to dismantle foreign tobacco regulations, such as \nadvertising bans, in several key markets. While most of this assistance \noccurred in the 1980's, its effects are felt today. Japan, South Korea, \nThailand, and Taiwan were on the other side of this dispute with our \nGovernment over their antitobacco laws. They lost, their citizens lost, \nand the U.S. tobacco companies won. Smoking in those countries is \nhigher as a result of past action by the U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Our bill will prevent the USTR from undermining another country's \ntobacco restrictions if those restrictions are applied to both foreign \nand domestic products in the same manner. If a country has an \nadvertising ban on tobacco products, our Government should not be \nspending money trying to dismantle that law if it equally affects \nforeign and domestic companies.\n  This legislation is consistent with a GATT decision from 1990, which \nheld that member nations can use various policies to protect health as \nlong as they are applied evenly to domestic and foreign products, and \nwith statements made by our current U.S. Trade Representative. Charlene \nBarshefsky\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\nstated last year that the U.S. Government should not object when \nforeign government take steps to protect their citizens by adopting \nhealth measures to restrict the consumption of tobacco.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues would agree that we should not, \nin good conscience, turn a blind eye to the untold suffering caused by \nU.S. exports of this deadly product. We know too much about tobacco to \nsit idly by while our companies poison tens of millions throughout the \nworld. And if foreign governments do not warn their citizens of \ntobacco's dangers, enacting this legislation is the very least we can \nand should do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nlegislation be printed in the Congressional Record along with letters \nof support for this legislation from the American Lung Association, the \nNational Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, and the American Heart \nAssociation, and two articles from the Washington Post documenting our \nGovernment's actions in Asia in the 1980's and how U.S. tobacco \ncompanies are targeting overseas markets.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1060\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The American Lung Association \n     supports your legislation addressing U.S. economic and \n     foreign policy towards the international sale and labeling of \n     tobacco products.\n       Tobacco use continues to be the single most preventable \n     cause of premature death and disease in the United States. \n     Worldwide, smoking causes one death every ten seconds, 3 \n     million people a year. Unless strong measures are taken, it \n     is estimated that in three decades the death toll will rise \n     to about 10 million people each year, with 70 percent of \n     those deaths occurring in developing countries.\n       In the past, the United States government has assisted U.S. \n     tobacco companies in their efforts to expand tobacco \n     advertising, promotion and exports. Using Section 301 of the \n     Trade Act of 1974, previous administrations have issued \n     formal threats to force other nations to import U.S. tobacco \n     products and to weaken health laws that would reduce tobacco \n     use. Your legislation would end the\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\n     U.S. government's proactive involvement in the exportation of \n     tobacco's death and disease to other countries by curtailing \n     federal agencies from intervening internationally on behalf \n     of the industry.\n       The American Lung Association believes the United States \n     should be a world leader in tobacco control and that the U.S. \n     should not help open international markets so companies here \n     can profit from death and disease elsewhere. This policy is \n     unacceptable and must end. The adoption of your legislation \n     would be a major step in the right direction.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this and other tobacco \n     control-related issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Fran Du Melle,\n     Deputy Managing Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               National Center for\n\n\n                                            Tobacco-Free Kids,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: We are writing on behalf of the \n     National Center for Tobacco Free Kids to express the center's \n     strong support for your effort, as a part of the Worldwide \n     Tobacco Disclosure Act, to ensure that the United States does \n     not interfere with actions taken by foreign governments to \n     reduce the dangers that tobacco products pose to their \n     citizens. This would help to save lives and improve the \n     public health of people around the world.\n       There is clear need for action to be taken to prevent the \n     spread of tobacco caused disease throughout the world. In \n     1994, over 4.6 trillion cigarettes were consumed in foreign \n     nations. In 1995, over 3.1 million people died as a result of \n     tobacco use, with over 1.2 million of those deaths occurring \n     in developing countries. As worldwide tobacco use and tobacco \n     related disease has reached astronomical levels, U.S. tobacco \n     exports have continued to climb. In 1995, the U.S. exported \n     an estimated 240 billion cigarettes, up from less than 60 \n     billion ten years earlier.\n       In the past, America has taken action against governments \n     that promulgate rules to curb tobacco caused disease. During \n     the previous administration, the U.S. pressured Thailand, \n     Taiwan, South Korea and other countries not to enact tough \n     new laws to curb tobacco marketing, even though these laws \n     were to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. The U.S. \n     also encouraged Taiwan to repeal new requirements for \n     cigarette warning labels. The Worldwide Tobacco Disclosure \n     Act would prevent American officials from using economic \n     muscle to promote higher cigarette exports by blocking \n     legitimate health laws in other countries.\n       We commend you for taking the lead in introducing this \n     important piece of legislation and urge the Senate to stand \n     up for the health of millions of people around the world.\n           Sincerely Yours,\n     William D. Novelli,\n       President.\n     Matthew L. Myers,\n       Executive Vice President and General Counsel.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   American Heart Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The American Heart Association \n     (AHA) is pleased to express its strong support for your \n     legislation, the Worldwide Tobacco Disclosure Act of 1997, a \n     critical step in addressing the inadequacy of current laws on \n     U.S. economic and foreign policy regarding the international \n     sale of tobacco products. In general, we believe that the \n     U.S. should actively promote the global adoption of U.S. \n     domestic tobacco control policies.\n       The AHA is a non-profit organization representing the \n     interests of over 4.6 million volunteers nationwide who give \n     their time and energies to reducing cardiovascular disease \n     and stroke, this nation's number one and three killers \n     respectively. Despite our efforts, and the efforts of our \n     partners in tobacco control, tobacco use continues to be the \n     number one preventable cause of premature death and disease \n     in the United States.\n       Worldwide, smoking causes one death every 10 seconds. The \n     global smoking rate is increasing steadily, despite decreases \n     in the United States and other developed nation. The World \n     Health Organization (WHO) predicts that more than 500 million \n     people alive today eventually will die of diseases caused by \n     smoking, unless strong action is taken to stem this epidemic.\n       Historically, U.S. government agencies and Congress have \n     assisted U.S. tobacco companies in their efforts to expand \n     tobacco advertising, promotion and exports around the world. \n     Previous administrations have issued formal trade threats \n     under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, to force other \n     nations to import U.S. tobacco products and to weaken health \n     laws that would reduce tobacco use.\n       The AHA supports the primary goals of this legislation: \n     That exported cigarettes carry the same federal labeling \n     format requirements as those manufactured, imported or \n     packaged for sale or distribution within the United States, \n     and that there be a prohibition on the use of federal funds \n     to aid any effort by the United States, through negotiation \n     or otherwise, to weaken the tobacco control laws of foreign \n     countries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     Martha, N. Hill, R.N., Ph.D.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 17, 1996]\n\n          U.S. Aided Cigarette Firms In Conquests Across Asia\n\n\n           Aggressive Strategy Forced Open Lucrative Markets\n\n                           (By Glenn Frankel)\n\n       On the streets of Manila, ``jump boys'' as young as 10 hop \n     in and out of traffic selling Marlboros and Lucky Strikes to \n     passing motorists. In the discos and coffee shops of Seoul, \n     young Koreans light up foreign brands that a decade ago were \n     illegal to possess. Downtown Kiev has become the Ukrainian \n     version of Marlboro Country, with the gray socialist \n     cityscape punctuated with colorful billboards of cowboy \n     sunsets and chiseled faces. And in Beijing, America's biggest \n     tobacco companies are competing for the right to launch \n     cooperative projects with the state-run tobacco monopoly in \n     hopes of capturing a share of the biggest potential market in \n     the world.\n       Throughout the bustling cities of a newly prosperous Asia \n     and the ruined economies of the former Soviet Bloc, the \n     American cigarette is king. It has become a symbol of \n     affluence and sophistication, a statement and an aspiration. \n     At home--where the American tobacco industry is besieged by \n     anti-smoking activists, whistle-blowers, government \n     regulators, grand juries and plaintiffs' lawyers--cigarette \n     consumption has undergone a 15-year decline. Thanks to \n     foreign sales, however, the companies are making larger \n     profits than ever before.\n       But the industry did not launch its campaign for new \n     overseas markets alone. The Reagan and Bush administrations \n     used their economic and political clout to pry open markets \n     in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and China for \n     American cigarettes. At a time when one arm of the government \n     was warning Americans about the dangers of smoking, another \n     was helping the industry recruit a new generation of smokers \n     abroad.\n       To this day, many U.S. officials see cigarette exports as \n     strictly an issue of free trade and economic fairness, while \n     tobacco industry critics and public health advocates consider \n     it a moral question. Even the Clinton administration finds \n     itself torn: It is the most vocally anti-smoking \n     administration in U.S. history, yet it has been in the \n     uncomfortable role of challenging or delaying some anti-\n     smoking efforts overseas.\n       At the same time, fledgling anti-smoking movements are \n     rising up with support from American activists, passing \n     restrictions that in some cases are tougher than those in the \n     United States.\n       Having exported its cigarette industry, the United States \n     is now in effect exporting its anti-smoking movement as well.\n       Just as the industry's overseas campaign has produced new \n     smokers and new profits, it has also produced new \n     consequences. International epidemiologist Richard Peto of \n     Oxford University estimates that smoking is responsible for 3 \n     million deaths per year worldwide; he projects that 30 years \n     from now the number will have reached 10 million, most of \n     them in developing nations. In China alone, Peto says 50 \n     million people who are currently 18 or younger eventually \n     will die from smoking-related diseases. ``In most countries, \n     the worst is yet to come,'' he warned.\n       Asia is where tobacco's search for new horizons began and \n     where the industry came to rely most on Washington's help. \n     U.S. officials in effect became the industry's lawyers, \n     agents and collaborators. Prominent politicians such as \n     Robert J. Dole, Jesse Helms, Dan Quayle and Al Gore played a \n     role. ``No matter how this process spins itself out,'' George \n     Griffin, commercial counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, \n     told Matthew N. Winokur, public affairs manager of Philip \n     Morris Asia, in a ``Dear Matt'' letter in January 1986, ``I \n     want to emphasize that the embassy and the various U.S. \n     government agencies in Washington will keep the interests of \n     Philip Morris and the other American cigarette manufacturers \n     in the forefront of our daily concerns.''\n       U.S. officials not only insisted that Asian countries allow \n     American companies to sell cigarettes, they also demanded \n     that the companies be allowed to advertise, hold giveaway \n     promotions and sponsor concerts and sports events in what \n     critics say was a blatant appeal to women and young people. \n     They regularly consulted with company representatives and \n     relied upon the industry's arguments and research. They \n     ignored the protests of public health officials in the United \n     States and Asia who warned of the consequences of the market \n     openings they sought. Indeed, their constant slogan was that \n     health factors were irrelevant. This was, they insisted, \n     solely an issue of free trade.\n       But then-Vice President Quayle suggested another motive \n     when he told a North Carolina farming audience in 1990 that \n     the government also was seeking to help the tobacco industry \n     compensate for shrinking markets at home. ``I don't think \n     it's any news to North Carolina tobacco farmers that the \n     American public as a whole is smoking less,'' said Quayle. \n     ``We ought to think about the exports. We ought to think \n     about opening up markets, breaking down the barriers.''\n       A handful of American health officials vigorously opposed \n     the government's campaign, yet were either stymied or \n     ignored. ``I feel\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\n     the most shameful thing this country did was to export \n     disease, disability and death by selling our cigarettes to \n     the world,'' said former surgeon general C. Everett Koop. \n     ``What the companies did was shocking, but even more \n     appalling was the fact that our own government helped make it \n     possible.''\n\n\n                             waging the war\n\n       Clayton Yeutter, an affable, high octane Nebraska \n     Republican with a wide smile and serious political \n     aspirations, came to the Office of the U.S. Trade \n     Representative in 1985 with a mission: to put a dent in the \n     record U.S. trade deficit by forcing foreign countries to \n     lower their barriers against American products.\n       Yeutter (prounced ``Yi-ter'') took office at a time when \n     Washington was on the verge of declaring a trade war against \n     some of its staunchest allies in the Far East. Asian tigers \n     such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand were running \n     up huge trade surpluses with the United States on goods \n     ranging from T-shirts to computer chips to luxury sedans. The \n     U.S. annual trade deficit in 1984 totaled a record $123 \n     billion. Congressional Democrats proposed a 25 percent \n     surcharge on products from Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and \n     Brazil, while the House and Senate overwhelmingly approved \n     resolutions calling for retaliation against Japan if it \n     didn't increase its purchases of exports.\n       In heeding that warning, the Reagan administration turned \n     to a small, elite and little-known federal agency. The Office \n     of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) had only 164 \n     permanent employees, but it enjoyed cabinet-level status and \n     a self-styled half-joking, half-serious reputation as ``the \n     Jedi knights of the trade world.'' Operating out of the four-\n     story, Civil War-era Winder Building on 17th Street NW, \n     USTR's staff was known for its dedication and aggressiveness. \n     Most staff members came from departments such as Commerce, \n     State and Agriculture, and they saw the trade rep's office as \n     a place where they could practice their craft free from the \n     fetters of larger, more rigid bureaucracies. They worked long \n     hours and displayed a fierce loyalty to each other and the \n     agency they served.\n       In 1985 they got a new boss to match their mood. Yeutter \n     had worked as a deputy trade representative during the Ford \n     administration, then went on to become president of the \n     Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He came back to Washington with \n     an eye toward using USTR as a launching pad for becoming a \n     U.S. senator, secretary of agriculture or even vice \n     president, according to friends. Yeutter was not a member of \n     Ronald Reagan's inner circle, and he was eager to show the \n     president what he could do. ``They told me they needed a \n     high-energy person,'' he recalled in a interview. ``I told \n     them I was ready to hit the ground running.''\n       Yeutter knew that USTR had a weapon in its arsenal that was \n     tailor-made for softening up recalcitrant trading partners. \n     Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act empowered USTR to launch a \n     full-scale investigation of unfair trading practices and \n     required that Washington invoke retaliatory sanctions within \n     a year if a targeted government did not agree to change its \n     ways. Launching a 301 was like setting a time bomb; both \n     sides could hear the clock ticking.\n       Yeutter had no trouble persuading the administration to \n     allow him to use Section 301 aggressively. ``There was a lot \n     of momentum for attempting something new,'' he said.\n       The U.S. tobacco industry had been trying for years to get \n     a foothold in these promising new Asian markets. In 1981 the \n     big three--Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and \n     Brown & Williamson--had formed a trade group called the U.S. \n     Cigarette Export Association to pursue a joint industry-wide \n     policy on the issue. But the companies had felt frustrated \n     during the first term of the Reagan administration.\n       Japan, the West's second largest market for cigarettes, \n     remained virtually closed to American brands due to high \n     tariffs and discriminatory distribution. South Korean law \n     effectively made it a crime to buy or sell a pack of foreign \n     cigarettes. Taiwan and Thailand remained tightly shut. All of \n     these countries but Taiwan were signatories to the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and Taipei hoped to join \n     soon. Yet each appeared to violate free trade principles.\n       ``In international trade terms, it's really very rare that \n     the issues are so clear-cut and so blatant,'' recalled Owen \n     C. Smith, a Philip Morris foreign trade expert who serves as \n     president of the association. ``These countries were sitting \n     with published laws which on their face discriminated against \n     American products. It was an untenable situation. . . . These \n     were, frankly, open-and-shut cases.''\n       When Yeutter and his staff looked at the cigarette business \n     in these countries, they saw blatant hypocrisy. Each Asian \n     government sought to justify its ban on imported cigarettes \n     in the name of public health, yet each had its own protected, \n     state-controlled tobacco monopoly that manufactured and sold \n     cigarettes--and provided large amounts of tax revenue to the \n     government. The state companies' marketing techniques were in \n     many ways just as cynical as those of the American companies. \n     In Taiwan, for example, the most popular state brand was \n     called Long Life. These were classic, state-run companies; \n     bloated and inefficient, they produced overpriced, low-\n     quality and poorly marketed cigarettes that could never \n     compete with jazzier American brands in free competition.\n       Health was simply a smoke screen, Yeutter quickly decided, \n     raised by recalcitrant foreign governments hooked on \n     cigarette profits. ``I would have had no problem with Japan \n     or Korean or Taiwan putting up genuine health restrictions,'' \n     he insisted. ``But that's not what these governments were \n     doing. They were restricting trade, and it was just \n     blatant.''\n       What Yeutter didn't seem to appreciate was that the very \n     flaws of the state-run monopolies were exactly what a doctor \n     might have ordered: Their high price and poor quality had \n     helped limit smoking mostly to older men who had the money \n     and taste for harsh, tar-heavy local brands. The monopolies \n     seldom, if ever, advertised and did not target the great \n     untapped markets of women and young people. Per capita sales \n     remained low in every country except Japan. From a public \n     health standpoint, maintaining the monopolies was far \n     preferable to opening the gates to American companies with \n     their milder blends and state-of-the-art marketing.\n       ``When the multinational companies penetrate a new country, \n     they not only sell U.S. cigarettes but they transform the \n     entire market,'' said Gregory Connolly, a veteran anti-\n     smoking activist who heads the Massachusetts Tobacco Control \n     Program. ``They transform how tobacco is presented, how it's \n     advertised, how it's promoted. And the result is the creation \n     of new demand, especially among women and young people.''\n       Connolly, who traveled widely through Asia, documented how \n     American companies skirted advertising restrictions by \n     sponsoring televised rock concerts and sporting events, \n     placing cigarette brands in movies and lending their brand \n     names to non-tobacco products such as clothing and sports \n     gear. A Madonna concert in Spain became a ``Salem Madonna \n     Concert'' when televised in Hong Kong, while the U.S. Open \n     tennis tournament in New York became the ``Salem Tennis \n     Open'' in Malaysia. Tennis stars Pat Cash, Michael Chang, \n     Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe appeared in live matches in \n     Malaysia sponsored by RJR.\n       None of this troubled Yeutter and his trade warriors. They \n     saw foreign advertising restrictions as one more form of \n     trade discrimination. The interagency committee that advised \n     Yeutter on the issue consisted of representatives from State, \n     Agriculture, Commerce, Labor and Treasury, but not from \n     Health and Human Services. There was no one with a public \n     health or tobacco control background to argue that there was \n     a link between advertising and health.\n       The companies convinced Yeutter that helping them sell \n     cigarettes meant helping American trade. They produced \n     studies showing that aside from heavy aviation parts, \n     cigarettes were America's most successful manufactured export \n     in terms of the net balance of trade. They estimated that \n     cigarette exports--largely to Western Europe and Latin \n     America--accounted for 250,000 full-time jobs in the United \n     States and contributed more than $4 billion to the positive \n     side of the trade ledger.\n       The industry also turned up the political heat. In a \n     January 1984 letter to an official in the Commerce \n     Department, Robert H. Bockman, then director of corporate \n     affairs for Philip Morris Asia, described trade barriers \n     against his company's products in South Korea. He then went \n     on to discuss what he called ``the politics of tobacco in \n     this election year. Attached please find a listing of the \n     1980 election results in the major tobacco-growing areas in \n     the United States. You will note that the margin of victory \n     for the president [Ronald Reagan] was narrow in some key \n     areas.''\n       Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who at the time chaired the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee, also intervened. In July 1986 Helms \n     wrote to Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone \n     congratulating him on his recent election victory and \n     pointing out that American cigarettes accounted for less than \n     2 percent of the Japanese market. ``Your friends in Congress \n     will have a better chance to stem the tide of anti-Japanese \n     trade sentiment if and when they can cite tangible examples \n     of your doors being opened to American products,'' wrote \n     Helms. ``I urge that you make a commitment to establish \n     timetable for allowing U.S. cigarettes a specific share of \n     your market. May I suggest a goal of 20 percent within the \n     next 18 months.''\n       At Yeutter's urging, Reagan decided not to wait for a \n     formal filing from the industry against Japan. Instead, for \n     the first time the White House filed three 301 complaints \n     with USTR in September 1985, one of them against Japanese \n     restrictions on the sale of U.S. cigarettes.\n       According to the USTR log of the case, U.S. officials \n     presented a lengthy questionnaire at their opening session \n     with Japanese trade representatives, demanding detailed data \n     on the Japanese market. Meanwhile, other U.S. bureaucrats \n     began drawing up lists of products for possible retaliation--\n     all part of what one negotiator called the ``ratcheting-up \n     process.''\n       Japanese negotiators hung tough over the course of 14 \n     sessions. Joseph A. Massey, who was in charge of trade \n     negotiations with Japan, recalled they argued that Japan \n     Tobacco, the state-run cigarette monopoly, was too \n     inefficient to withstand U.S. competition, and that in any \n     case the Americans should continue the previous long-standing \n     practice of giving Japan an indefinite time period to comply.\n       Massey recalled one other unusual aspect of the \n     negotiation: Industry representatives\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\n     from both sides sat in on bargaining sessions. ``The Japanese \n     insisted that Japan Tobacco should be in the room,'' he said. \n     ``We said, `If that's the case, there needs to be \n     parallelism.' . . . They did not sit at the table. They sat \n     quietly along the back wall.''\n       Finally in late September 1986, a year after the 301 \n     complaint was filed, Yeutter received a phone call at his \n     McLean home late one evening from Japanese Finance Minister \n     Kiichi Miyazawa. The minister wanted more time, but Yeutter \n     was unrelenting. He recalls telling Miyazawa that the \n     completed retaliation documents were to be forwarded to the \n     White House the following day. ``I said, `I'm sorry, Mr. \n     Minister, but your government has run out of time,' '' \n     Yeutter recalled.\n       Within days the Japanese capitulated, signing an agreement \n     allowing in American-made cigarettes. By giving in on such a \n     politically well-connected product as cigarettes, Japanese \n     commentators said, Tokyo hoped to buy time on other trade \n     issues. It was, commented the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, a \n     ``blood offering.''\n       And so Japan was transformed into a battleground for the \n     world's biggest tobacco companies. Philip Morris aimed at \n     Japanese women with Virginia Slims; Japan Tobacco fought back \n     with Misty, a thin, mildblended cigarette. When RJR wooed \n     young smokers with Joe Camel, JT countered with Dean, named \n     after fabled actor James Dean. Cigarettes became the second \n     most-advertised product on television in Tokyo--up from 40th \n     just a year earlier.\n       Today, imported brands control 21 percent of the Japanese \n     market and earn more than $7 billion in annual sales. Female \n     smoking is at an all-time high, according to Japan Tobacco's \n     surveys, and one study showed female college freshmen four \n     times more likely to smoke than their mothers.\n       Yeutter and his colleagues insisted they had done nothing \n     for tobacco they would not have done for any other industry. \n     But the fact remained that at a time when the United States \n     could not overcome Japan's resistance on a broad range of \n     exports--from beef to cars to super-computers--U.S. \n     cigarettes flourished, thanks to the perseverance of the \n     trade warriors.\n\n\n                            Into South Korea\n\n       The next target was South Korea, which had a $1.7 billion \n     domestic tobacco market. The U.S. tobacco industry filed a \n     301 complaint against Seoul in January 1988, and USTR \n     initiated its investigation a month later, South Korea's \n     state cigarette monopoly had done little advertising over the \n     years, and a few months before the 301 case, the Seoul \n     government had formally outlawed cigarette ads. But the \n     United States insisted on defining ``fair access'' as \n     including the right to advertise.\n       Even before the formal complaint was filed, tobacco state \n     lawmakers and their allies had supported opening South \n     Korea's market. Senators Dole (R-Kan.) and Helms and 14 \n     others--including Gore, then a senator from Tennessee--wrote \n     to South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan in July 1987 \n     demanding that tobacco companies be allowed ``the right to \n     import and distribute without discriminatory taxes and \n     duties, as well as the right to advertise and promote their \n     products.''\n       The companies did their own work as well. RJR hired former \n     Reagan national security adviser Richard Allen to lobby the \n     government in Seoul and give the company more influence than \n     its corporate rivals. Philip Morris gave a $250,000 contract \n     to former White House aide Michael Deaver, who hired two \n     former USTR officials and later obtained a $475,000 lobbying \n     contract with the South Korean government, according to \n     testimony at his 1987 trial for perjury. (Deaver was \n     convicted of lying to Congress about his lobbying activities \n     after he left the White House.)\n       In May 1988 Seoul formally agreed to open its doors to \n     American brands. The deal allowed cigarette signs and \n     promotions at shops, 120 pages of advertisements in magazines \n     and cigarette company sponsorship of social, cultural and \n     sporting events. Cigarettes quickly became one of the most \n     heavily advertised products in South Korea; from no \n     advertising in 1986, American tobacco companies spent $25 \n     million in 1988. Student activists, anti-smoking groups, the \n     South Korean consumers' union and the local cigarette retail \n     association all staged protests against ``tobacco \n     imperialism'' and boycotted American cigarettes, and the \n     companies accused the state cigarette monopoly of constant \n     violations of the agreement. Still, within a year, American \n     companies had captured 6 percent of the market.\n       USTR also made fast work of Taiwan. On the heels of the \n     Japanese agreement, Taiwan had agreed in October 1985 to \n     liberalize barriers to wine, beer and cigarettes. But a year \n     passed and the market remained effectively closed. Reagan \n     then ordered Yeutter to propose ``proportional \n     countermeasures,'' while U.S. officials threatened to oppose \n     Taiwan's application for membership in GATT.\n       ``Since Taiwan wasn't a GATT member, we were not under GATT \n     constraints,'' said a senior USTR negotiator. ``I hate to say \n     it, but you can do whatever you want with Taiwan and Taiwan \n     knows it. They're much more vulnerable than other \n     countries.''\n       Six weeks after Reagan's order, Taiwan folded. ``The \n     atmosphere in the negotiations was very bad for us,'' \n     recalled Chien-Shien Wang, then deputy minister of commerce, \n     who was Taiwan's chief negotiator. ``We were told the U.S. \n     had lost patience with us and was about to put us on the 301 \n     list. So we had no choice but to agree.''\n       While some USTR officials now concede they were uneasy \n     about using their power on behalf of America's most \n     controversial industry, they say they had no choice.\n       ``For us it was an issue of, it's a U.S. product and it \n     deserves fair market access,'' said Robert Cassidy, the \n     current assistant U.S. trade representative for Asia and the \n     Pacific. ``There are lots of products people here might \n     prefer not to pursue--I myself didn't much like exporting \n     machines to manufacture bullets. But that's not the issue. \n     The issue was, is this discriminatory treatment or not?''\n       Following the agreement, consumption of imported cigarettes \n     in Taiwan soared. According to one industry trade journal, \n     foreign brands went from 1 percent of annual cigarette sales \n     to more than 20 percent in less than two years, while state-\n     manufactured brands declined accordingly. RJR sponsored a \n     dance at a Taipei disco popular with teenagers and offered \n     free admission for five empty packs of Winstons. Studies by \n     Taiwanese public health specialist Ted Chen, now a professor \n     at Tulane University Medical Center, tracked a steadily \n     rising rate of smoking among high schoolers.\n\n\n                        the anti-smoking crusade\n\n       The 301 cases were a boon to the industry. The Boston-based \n     National Bureau of Economic Research estimated in a recent \n     report that sales of American cigarettes were 600 percent \n     higher in the targeted countries in 1991 then they would have \n     been without U.S. intervention. In 1990, after he became \n     secretary of agriculture, Yeutter told a news conference, ``I \n     just saw the figures on tobacco exports here a few days ago \n     and, my, have the turned out to be a marvelous success \n     story.''\n       The tobacco companies insist that the government's efforts \n     merely allowed them to gain a fair share of existing markets. \n     But the National Bureau projected that American entry pushed \n     up average cigarette consumption per capita by nearly 10 \n     percent in the targeted countries. The report said fiercer \n     price competition and sophisticated advertising campaigns had \n     stimulated the increase.\n       Then-surgeon general Koop, a fierce critic of the industry, \n     first heard about the 301s when he visited the Japanese \n     Health Ministry during the swing through the Far East in the \n     mid-1980s. ``They greeted me with, `What are you trying to do \n     for us? We will never be able to pay the medical bill,' '' he \n     recalled. ``I had no idea what they were talking about.''\n       Koop soon found out that USTR was, in his words, ``trading \n     Marlboros for Toyotas.'' But it took several years for anti-\n     smoking activists to become mobilized. In 1988 Koop attempted \n     to hold a hearing on cigarette exports in his Interagency \n     Committee on Smoking and Health, but said he was advised a \n     few days before that the Reagan White House wanted him to \n     drop the subject and uninvite witnesses such as Judith \n     Mackay, a prominent anti-smoking activist from Hong Kong.\n       Koop refused. Officials from State and Commerce who had \n     agreed to appear suddenly withdrew, but Mackay and a parade \n     of critics testified. She accused the United States of waging \n     ``a new Opium War'' against Asia, an allusion to Britain's \n     19th-century effort to force China to allow trade of the \n     addictive drug.\n       When Yeutter learned of the criticism, he wrote to Koop to \n     defend his record. ``I have never smoked, have no desire to \n     do so and believe this addiction to be a terrible human \n     tragedy,'' he told Koop. ``However, what we are about in our \n     trade relationships is something entirely different.''\n       Koop found Yeutter's letter unconvincing. ``I'm a firm \n     believer in the difference between a moral compromise and a \n     political compromise,'' Koop said in a recent interview. ``I \n     suppose Yeutter can say he was just doing his job, but when \n     you really are exporting death and disease to the Third \n     World, that's a moral compromise that I would never make.''\n       During congressional hearings on the trade issue in May \n     1990, the government's sole witness was Sandra Kristoff, then \n     assistant trade representative for Asia and the Pacific, who \n     had negotiated the agreements with South Korea and Taiwan and \n     who vigorously defended USTR's role. She mocked the idea of \n     taking into account health issues in trade policy matters, \n     saying such considerations might result in banning trade in \n     cholesterol-laden cookies ``or hormones in red meat. . . . \n     U.S. trade policy is not in the business of picking winners \n     or losers in terms of products.''\n       After the hearing, two lobbyists for Philip Morris wrote a \n     memo to their boss praising her testimony. ``The best witness \n     we had was USTR Representative Sandy Kristoff . . . ,'' they \n     wrote. ``She was tremendously effective.'' Kristoff, who now \n     serves on the staff of the National Security Council, \n     declined to be interviewed.\n\n\n                           eyeing new markets\n\n       When anti-smoking activist Gregory Connolly toured Asia in \n     1988 he was astonished by how entrenched American cigarettes \n     already had become. In Taipei he discovered 17 billboards \n     advertising foreign cigarettes within sight of a local high \n     school. In Bangkok he was shown student notebooks decorated \n     with the Marlboro logo. In Manila he took photographs of jump \n     boys huddling\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\n     in an alley smoking Marlboros. Afterward, he protested to \n     Filipino health activist Phyllis Tabla: ``You've got to do \n     something about this!''\n       Her reply: ``Don't lecture us! It's not us! It's you!''\n       Philip Morris was so delighted with the success of the 301 \n     cases that when Yeutter left USTR in 1989 to become secretary \n     of agriculture in the Bush administration, the company threw \n     a celebration in his honor at the Decatur Club here. When \n     critics raised questions about the reception, Yeutter told \n     the Senate Agriculture Committee: ``It's unfortunate that \n     when people try to say thank you, it becomes a potential \n     conflict of interest issue, but that's the way the world is \n     these days.''\n       Looking back, Yeutter said he now feels the reception was a \n     mistake. ``Philip Morris shouldn't have done it,'' he said, \n     ``They were simply trying to be gracious. . . . It simply was \n     not good judgment on their part. And in retrospect I probably \n     should have done more to discourage it.''\n       Today Yeutter practices international trade law from a \n     corner office at Hogan & Hartson, Washington's largest law \n     firm. He also sits on the board of British-American Tobacco \n     (BAT), the British-based tobacco conglomerate that owns Brown \n     & Williamson, the Louisville-based cigarette manufacturer \n     that was one of the participants in the 301s. He insists he \n     has not changed his mind about the dangers of smoking. But \n     cigarettes remain a legal product, and, he says, BAT is an \n     excellent, well-run company that he is proud to serve.\n       When Yeutter moved to Agriculture, incoming President Bush \n     appointed Carla Hills, a highly regarded lawyer and former \n     housing and urban development secretary, to succeed him at \n     USTR. One canny political pro replaced another. And USTR set \n     its sights on opening more cigarette markets in Asia.\n       Next on the agenda was Thailand.\n       Conditions there were similar to those in Japan, South \n     Korea and Taiwan: a very promising market in a country \n     undergoing explosive economic growth; a state-run monopoly: \n     tight restrictions on imported cigarettes; an advertising ban \n     purportedly based on health claims.\n       After their success in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, \n     officials were highly optimistic about Thailand.\n       The Thai Finance Ministry already was holding discussions \n     about opening its market.\n       Thailand, both U.S. officials and industry representatives \n     agreed, would be easy.\n       Only they were wrong. As they were about to find out, in \n     pressing on into Thailand, Washington and the industry had \n     gone a country too far.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                        Two on Top of the World\n\n\n the largest independent tobacco merchants are based in va. but their \n                            growth is abroad\n\n               (By Frank Swoboda and Martha M. Hamilton)\n\n       Richmond.--The faint, pungent smell of tobacco leaf is the \n     first thing you notice when you enter the second-floor \n     executive offices of Universal Corp., the world's largest \n     independent tobacco leaf merchant.\n       At Universal, as at the Danville, Va., headquarters of its \n     second largest rival, Dimon, Inc., the smell of tobacco is \n     the smell of money.\n       The two companies (and their only other major competitor, \n     Standard Universal Corp. of North Carolina) are the middlemen \n     in the world tobacco industry. They don't make cigarettes or \n     other consumer tobacco products. Instead, they buy, ship, \n     process, pack, store and finance leaf tobacco for sale to \n     cigarette manufacturers.\n       Together the two had $5.7 billion in revenue in 1996 from \n     operations in locations that included the United States, \n     Brazil, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Italy, Bulgaria and China. \n     Despite declining U.S. consumption, and a multibillion-dollar \n     legal settlement by manufacturers that is apt to cut domestic \n     consumption even further, there is no sense of panic in the \n     corridors of these tobacco merchants. Universal and Dimon \n     know the world market--it's enormous and still growing.\n       ``The world market is where the bulk of the growth is,'' \n     said Universal Vice President James H. Starkey III. Worldwide \n     tobacco consumption has been rising by 1.2 percent to 1.5 \n     percent a year, providing Universal with a consistent 18 \n     percent to 19 percent annual return on equity.\n       About a third of the tobacco grown in the United States is \n     exported. Last year, that came to 340 million tons of flue-\n     cured tobacco, which is harvested over a several-week period \n     and cured by heat, and about 160 million tons of burley \n     tobacco, which is hung to dry and cure, according to Randy \n     Weber, associate administrator for the Farm Service Agency of \n     the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n       ``I don't see us shifting away from tobacco. We have \n     continued to reinvest in tobacco as opportunities arise. \n     We're constantly looking for opportunities for expansion,'' \n     said Starkey.\n       His optimism is echoed by those who follow the industry, \n     ``I'd say the future is very strong, although there are going \n     to be short-term ripples because of the cigarette settlement \n     and the imposition of higher prices,'' said David A. Goldman, \n     an industry analyst with Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta.\n       Universal noted in its annual report to stockholders that \n     ``demand for leaf continues to increase in response to an \n     estimated 1 percent annual growth in world cigarette \n     consumption and consumption of American-blend cigarettes is \n     increasing by 3 to 4 percent annually.''\n       There is a growing global market for the mild tobacco \n     mixture known as ``American blend'' and for American-style \n     cigarettes, of which Universal is a major supplier. More and \n     more of the leaf that goes into those products is being \n     harvested abroad, putting pressure on U.S. growers but \n     increasing profitability for processors by lowering the price \n     of tobacco. As an example of the shift, Starkey points to \n     France, where, he said, the public is beginning to move away \n     from ``dark tobacco'' cigarettes such as the well-known \n     Gaulois to milder, American blend cigarettes as manufacturers \n     introduce low-cost, generic brands to cultivate a taste for \n     the new blend with the smoking public.\n       Universal has operations in 30 countries around the globe. \n     It first went into China in the 1920s, and there and \n     elsewhere it has survived civil wars, communist takeovers and \n     political unrest. ``The one thing we've been good at is \n     managing through instability. We stick to our knitting. We \n     don't get involved in politics,'' Starkey said.\n       Karen W.L. Whelan, Universal's treasurer, said the company \n     keeps ``liaison people'' at its headquarters who travel back \n     and forth to various countries to help it keep track of \n     changes overseas.\n       The search for new markets has taken Universal from Eastern \n     Europe to the emerging nations of Africa. In the early 1990s, \n     Universal and Philip Morris purchased the largest tobacco \n     processing company in Kazakhstan from the government. In \n     China--the world's largest tobacco producer, growing more \n     than half the world's supply of flue-cured tobacco--Universal \n     manages a new leaf processing plant near Bengbu for the \n     Shanghai Tobacco Co.\n       Universal buys the leaf processed at the Chinese plant and \n     has agreed to export a minimum of 70 percent of the tobacco. \n     ``It's the only export operation in China managed by a \n     foreign company,'' Starkey said.\n       The company first entered China in 1925, and it remained \n     until the communist takeover. It returned to China when the \n     Nixon administration reopened relations with the Asian nation \n     in the 1970s.\n       Like almost all the other U.S.-based multinationals, \n     America's tobacco merchants are watching the vast Chinese \n     market closely, for an obvious reason: Smokers in China \n     consume approximately 1.7 trillion cigarettes a year, far \n     more than the 450 billion a year smoked by U.S. consumers, \n     according to Scott & Stringfellow analyst John F. Kasprzak.\n       More than just a tobacco merchant, Universal's interests \n     include lumber and building products distribution in the \n     Netherlands and Belgium. It also buys, processes and \n     distributes tea, rubber, sunflower seeds, dried fruits and \n     seasonings as part of a joint venture with COSUN, a Dutch \n     sugar cooperative. But tobacco is by far its biggest \n     business, accounting for 71 percent of the company's revenues \n     and 83 percent of its operating profits.\n       Rival Dimon Inc. is also enjoying an up-curve, reaching \n     almost $2.2 billion in sales last year. Dimon operates in 36 \n     countries, and like its Richmond competitor its business is \n     not one-dimensional: It ranks as the world's largest exporter \n     and distributor of fresh-cut flowers. Dimon was formed in \n     1995 by a merger of 120-year-old Dibrell Bros. Inc. of \n     Danville with tobacco processor Monk-Austin of Farmville, \n     N.C. That union created a company that ranked second in its \n     industry to Universal; a deal consummated earlier this year \n     in which Dimon acquired British-based Intabex Holdings \n     Worldwide SA narrowed the gap between the two companies.\n       Intabex was a privately-owned company that was the fourth-\n     largest leaf tobacco dealer in the world. It owned tobacco \n     buying, processing and exporting operations in the United \n     States, Brazil, Argentina, Malawi, Italy and Thailand and was \n     affiliated with a Zimbabwe company that Dimon also acquired. \n     Its acquisition will offer Dimon considerable opportunity to \n     cut costs, Kasprzak said, by consolidating operations and \n     refinancing Intabex's considerable debt.\n       Officials from Dimon declined to be interviewed for this \n     story.\n       Both Universal and Dimon have benefited from industry \n     consolidation, which has in the past several years cut the \n     number of major leaf merchants from eight to three. But the \n     same consolidation has hurt U.S. tobacco growers, said Jerry \n     Jenkins, a grower in Lunenberg County, Va., who is also \n     chairman of Tobacco Associates, the export promotion \n     organization for the nation's flue-cured growers.\n       ``The problem with the recent mergers and consolidations in \n     the industry is that they reduce competition,'' said Jenkins, \n     who farms about 30 acres of flue-cured tobacco and 3.5 acres \n     of dark fire-cured tobacco. ``It's generally not to the \n     benefit of the seller of the product.''\n       Virginia farmers grow flue-cured tobacco on approximately \n     40,000 acres and burley tobacco on about 10,000 acres. \n     Maryland is also a tobacco-growing state but on a much \n     smaller level. Only about 8,000 acres there are devoted to \n     tobacco cultivation, according to the USDA's Weber.\n       The increasing worldwide demand for tobacco that is filling \n     the coffers of Universal and Dimon may not be the long-term \n     salvation of these farmers. Although the world's\n\n[[Page S7965]]\n\n     smokers are developing a taste for American blend, U.S.-grown \n     tobacco is simply too expensive for many world markets. U.S. \n     tobacco is still as much as 30 percent higher in price than \n     competitive tobacco products from Brazil and Zimbabwe, \n     according to Universal's Starkey.\n       Perhaps an even greater problem for American growers is the \n     financing role the processing companies play in overseas \n     markets. According to analyst Goldman, companies like Dimon \n     contract with a cigarette maker like R.J. Reynolds Tobacco \n     Co. to deliver a certain grade of tobacco a year from now and \n     ask for a down payment. They then use that down payment to \n     provide cash advances to growers in countries such as Brazil, \n     helping to finance farmers there without putting their own \n     funds at risk.\n       ``When you're loaning a man money to grow a crop or \n     underwriting his loan and furnishing technical advice, it \n     only seems natural that you're going to want to buy his crop \n     first to recoup that investment,'' said tobacco grower \n     Jenkins. To compete, tobacco growers in Virginia have had to \n     cultivate larger acreages to achieve efficiencies of scale, \n     he said.\n       ``We don't like to buy without having an order,'' said \n     Universal's Whelan, adding that most of the company's tobacco \n     purchases are made at local auction, which is how tobacco is \n     sold in this country. She said that in only a handful of \n     countries does Universal have advance contracts with growers, \n     in countries such as Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico and Italy.\n       The next possible target for expansion for Universal, Dimon \n     and Standard may be processing tobacco for U.S. cigarette \n     manufacturers who now do their own processing, said Scott & \n     Stringfellow's Kasprzak. In recent years Lorillard Tobacco \n     and RJR turned over their leaf purchasing and some processing \n     to Dimon's predecessors, and others may follow suit.\n       In the meantime, Virginia's tobacco merchants can look \n     forward to doing business in a world that every year consumes \n     more cigarettes with no sign of slowing down.\n\n

Res. 109\n\n       Whereas, Canadian fishing vessels blockaded the M/V \n     MALASPINA, a U.S. passenger vessel operated by the Alaska \n     Marine Highway System, preventing that vessel from exercising \n     its right to innocent passage from 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, \n     July 19, 1997 until 9:00 p.m. Monday, July 21, 1997;\n       Whereas, the Alaska Marine Highway System is part of the \n     United States National Highway System and blocking this \n     critical link between Alaska and the contiguous States is \n     similar in impact to a blockade of a major North American \n     highway or air-travel route;\n       Whereas, the M/V MALASPINA was carrying over 300 \n     passengers, mail sent through the U.S. Postal Service, \n     quantities of fresh perishable foodstuff bound for \n     communities without any other road connections to the \n     contiguous States, and the official traveling exhibit of the \n     Vietnam War Memorial;\n       Whereas, international law, as reflected in Article 17 of \n     the United Nations Convention\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\n     on the Law of the Sea, guarantees the right of innocent \n     passage through the territorial sea of Canada of the ships of \n     all States;\n       Whereas, the Government of Canada failed to enforce an \n     injunction issued by a Canadian court requiring the M/V \n     MALASPINA to be allowed to continue its passage, and the M/V \n     MALASPINA departed only after the blockaders agreed to let it \n     depart;\n       Whereas, during the past three years U.S. vessels have \n     periodically been harassed or treated in ways inconsistent \n     with international law by citizens of Canada and by the \n     Government of Canada in an inappropriate response to concerns \n     in Canada about the harvest of Pacific salmon in waters under \n     the sole jurisdiction of the United States;\n       Whereas, Canada has failed to match the good faith efforts \n     of the United States in attempting to resolve differences \n     under the Pacific Salmon Treaty, in particular, by rejecting \n     continued attempts to reach agreement and withdrawing from \n     negotiations when an agreement seemed imminent just before \n     the Canadian national election of June, 1997;\n       Whereas neither the Government of Canada nor its citizens \n     have been deterred from additional actions against vessels of \n     the United States by the diplomatic responses of the United \n     States to past incidents such as the imposition of an illegal \n     transit fee on American fishing vessels in June, 1994: Now, \n     therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate, that it is the sense \n     of the Senate that--\n       (1) The failure of the Government of Canada to protect U.S. \n     citizens exercising their right of innocent passage through \n     the territorial sea of Canada from illegal actions and \n     harassment should be condemned;\n       (2) The President of the United States should immediately \n     take steps to protect the interests of the United States and \n     should not tolerate threats to those interests from the \n     action or inaction of a foreign government or its citizens;\n       (3) The President should provide assistance, including \n     financial assistance, to States and citizens of the United \n     States seeking damages in Canada that have resulted from \n     illegal or harassing actions by the Government of Canada or \n     its citizens; and\n       (4) The President should use all necessary and appropriate \n     means to compel the Government of Canada to prevent any \n     further illegal or harassing actions against the United \n     States, its citizens or their interests, which may include--\n       (A) using U.S. assets and personnel to protect U.S. \n     citizens exercising their right of innocent passage through \n     the territorial sea of Canada from illegal actions or \n     harassment until such time as the President determines that \n     the Government of Canada has adopted a long-term policy that \n     ensures such protection;\n       (B) prohibiting the import of selected Canadian products \n     until such time as the President determines that Canada has \n     adopted a long-term policy that protects U.S. citizens \n     exercising their right of innocent passage through the \n     territorial sea of Canada from illegal actions or harassment;\n       (C) directing that no Canadian vessel may anchor or \n     otherwise take shelter in U.S. waters off Alaska or other \n     States without formal clearance from U.S. Customs, except in \n     emergency situations;\n       (D) directing that no fish or shellfish taken in sport \n     fisheries in the Province of British Columbia may enter the \n     United States; and\n       (E) enforcing U.S. law with respect to all vessels in \n     waters of the Dixon Entrance claimed by the United States, \n     including the area in which jurisdiction is disputed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7965-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7966-S7969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n THE AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n        RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       ROBERTS AMENDMENT NO. 961\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1033) making \nappropriations for Agriculture, rural development, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and related agencies programs for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 1998, and for other purposes;

Mr. President, As chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and \nFederal Services, which has jurisdiction over postal matters, I would \nlike to comment on Representative Molinari's Stamp Out Breast Cancer \nAct, H.R. 1585, passed by the House on July 22, 1997. This bill is \nsimilar to the Feinstein amendment included as part of the Senate's \nfiscal year 1998 Treasury/Postal appropriations bill, S. 1023, in that \nit would raise money for breast cancer research through a new, \nspecially designed postage stamp--generally referred to as a \nsemipostal--which would be purchased on a voluntary basis and as an \nalternative to regular first-class postage.\n  H.R. 1585 differs from the Feinstein amendment in three respects. The \nrate of this semipostal would be determined in part, by the Postal \nService to cover administrative costs and the remainder by the \ngovernors of the Postal Service to direct research. The total cost \nwould not exceed the current cost plus 25 percent. In addition, \nfollowing the 2-year period beginning on the date which the stamp would \nbe publicly available, the General Accounting Office would report to \nCongress with an evaluation of the effectiveness and appropriateness of \nthis method of fundraising and a description of the resources required \nto carry out this bill. Finally, the Postal Service would have the \nauthority to decide when the stamp would be available to the public and \nwould have up until 12 months after the date of enactment to make it \navailable.\n  Though this is a well-intentioned bill, and breast cancer research is \na highly worthwhile cause, the idea of using the Postal Service as a \nfundraising organization for social issues is just plain wrong. If we \nstart here, where do we stop? The list of diseases is endless. \nRequiring the Postal Service\n\n[[Page S7970]]\n\nto issue a semipostal stamp for breast cancer would place the Postal \nService and Congress in the very difficult position of determining \nwhich worthy organizations should receive Federal assistance in \nfundraising and which should not.\n  The concept of semipostals has been around for years. Some nations \nissue them, however most do not. The European experience with this kind \nof stamp has shown that they are rarely as beneficial to the designated \norganization as would be expected. Consider the example set by our \nneighbor Canada. In 1975, the Canadian Postal Corporation issued a \nseries of semipostal stamps to provide supplementary revenue for the \nCanadian Olympic Committee. It was reported that while the program \nreceived exceptionally good promotional and advertising support, it \nfell short of its intended revenue objective. Demand for the \nsemipostals throughout Canada was reportedly insubstantial. The \nprogram--viewed as a failure--concluded in 1976. More recently, the \nCanada Post issued a semipostal to support literacy. With a surcharge \nof 5-cents per stamp, it raised only $252,000. After raising only a \nmodest amount of money, combined with a tremendous administrative \nexpense, Canada Post says they will not issue another semipostal.\n  There is a strong U.S. tradition of private fundraising for \ncharities. Such a stamp would effectively use the United States Postal \nService as a fundraiser, a role it has never before taken on. The \nPostal Service's job--and expertise--is mail delivery. Congress should \nbe mindful that the postage stamp pays strictly for postal operations. \nIt is not a fee for anything but delivering the mail and the cost of \nrunning the service. In fact, section 3622 of the Postal Reorganization \nAct of 1970 precludes charging rates in excess of those required to \noffset the Postal Service's costs of providing a particular service. In \nother words, the Postal Service does not have the authority to put a \nsurcharge on a postage rate that is cost and overhead driven. There is \nsimply no legitimate connection between the desire to raise money for a \ncause, and maintenance of the Postal Service's mission of providing \nuniversal service at a universal rate.\n  The goals of H.R. 1585 are laudatory. But, Mr. President, as I \npreviously indicated during Senate consideration of the Feinstein \nsemipostal amendment, the Postal Service should not be doing \nfundraising.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7969-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ON AND UNDER THE DELAWARE RIVER CLEANUP\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr President, I rise today to recognize an \nhistoric event in our relations with our erstwhile cold war enemy, \nVietnam. On May 7, 1997, that country and our own great Nation \nexchanged defense attaches. Senior Col. Vo Dinh Quang of the Vietnam \nArmy was accredited as the defense, military, naval, and air attache to \nthe United States. He is the first defense attache from Vietnam since \n1975, when the South Vietnam attache positions dissolved by default \nwith the collapse of South Vietnam.\n  The Corps of Foreign Attaches is a distinguished group of foreign \nsenior officers who are accredited to the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of State to officially and personally represent their \ndefense secretaries in the United States with regard to military \nmatters. Eighty-one countries around the world, allied and nonallied, \nare represented by over 100 navy, army, and air force officers living \nin the Washington, DC, area. Historically, this prestigious assignment \nhas produced many flag and general officers who have subsequently \nbecome the equivalent of our service chiefs or Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff.\n  A primary responsibility of the foreign defense attache, as \nrecognized by the Vienna Convention, is to collect information and \nlearn about the services of the United States. To assist in this \neffort, the U.S. service chiefs sponsor an aggressive information \nprogram which includes orientation tours to commands and related \nindustrial facilities; service chief counterpart and other delegation \nvisits; intelligence and operations briefings; and document \ndissemination. In turn, the attache provides Department of Defense \ndecisionmakers with perspectives on developments within the attache's \ncountry and armed services.\n  This is the office in which Senior Colonel Quang finds himself today. \nBorn in 1932, Colonel Quang served in the North Vietnamese and \nVietnamese Armies for a total of 27 years before being assigned to the \nDepartment of Foreign Relations within the Vietnamese Ministry of \nDefense. While serving in that capacity, Colonel Quang was a staff \nmember of the Vietnamese Office for Seeking Missing Personnel. His \nresponsibility was to interface with the United States concerning our \ncountry's servicemen who were still missing in action.\n  Once a sworn enemy of the United States, Colonel Quang became a man \nwho searched for the remains of our soldiers, sailors, and airmen. Now \nhe serves here in Washington, representing his country as Vietnam's \nfirst post-war defense attache.\n  In commemorating this historic event, I pray that this new \nrelationship with Vietnam continues to prosper.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7970-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MIKULSKI AMENDMENT ON AMERICORPS LITERACY FUNDING\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator \nMikulski, for her leadership yesterday in seeking $20 million for \nPresident Clinton's America Reads initiative. This amendment supports \n1,300 AmeriCorps members who will serve as literacy tutors to help \nchildren learn to read--and read well--by the end of the third grade.\n  Reading is a fundamental skill for learning, but too many children \nhave trouble learning how to read. If students don't learn to read in \nthe early elementary school years, it is virtually impossible for them \nto keep up later. According to a recent study, 40 percent of fourth \ngrade students don't attain the basic level of reading, and 70 percent \ndon't attain the proficient level.\n  Research shows that reading skills are developed not only in the home \nand in the classroom, but also in communities and libraries. Sustained, \nreading opportunities outside the regular school day and during the \nsummer can raise reading levels when combined with other instruction. \nOnly 30 minutes a day of reading aloud with an adult can enable a young \nchild to make real gains in reading. Adults also serve as role models \nfor young children.\n  I commend Senator Mikulski for her effective leadership in the \nextremely important area of community service and childhood literacy. \nEvery child can learn to read well, and every child deserves that \nchance. No child should be left out or left behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7970-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7970-S7971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXPLANATION OF VOTE ON H.R. 2158\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yesterday I voted against H.R. 2158, \nthe bill providing fiscal year 1998 appropriations for the Departments \nof Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and various \nindependent agencies. Funding\n\n[[Page S7971]]\n\nprovided by that measure totaled nearly $9 billion more than the \ncomparable amount provided last year--about a 10-percent increase.\n  It would be one thing if the increase were devoted to improved \nservices for our Nation's veterans. After all, they put their lives on \nthe line in defense of our country and all of the rights and liberties \nwe enjoy. We owe them a debt of gratitude--and the obligation to \nfulfill the promises our Nation made to them when they were called to \nserve.\n  Yet the spending increase in this bill is not targeted to veterans. \nThe VA sees only a 0.5 percent increase in its budget. Medical care is \nincreased only 1 percent. But presumably, these increases were \nsufficient to fulfill our obligations to veterans, exceeding President \nClinton's request by nearly $93 million. I support them, and I stand \nready to do more if that is necessary.\n  Mr. President, compare the virtual spending freeze that our Nation's \nveteran population is able to bear with what happens to HUD's budget. \nLast year, HUD received a total of $16.3 billion. H.R. 2158 proposes to \ntake that figure to $25.4 billion--a $9 billion increase. An increase \nof nearly 56 percent. That is a huge increase, even by Washington \nstandards.\n  Now I know that part of the reason for the added funding is the need \nto renew expiring section 8 housing contracts. But I believe we have a \nresponsibility to try to offset the extra spending with reductions in \nlower priority HUD programs, rather than just add to the total. I see \nlittle evidence of attempting to prioritize HUD and other programs in \nthis bill.\n  It seems to me that the opportunity to find offsets was certainly \nthere. The AmeriCorps Program, for example, was funded at $405 million. \nRemember, this is a program that pays volunteers to work. In most parts \nof the country, paying someone to work constitutes employment. \nVolunteers provide their time and energy out of their own good will. \nBut here we have a government program--a Clinton administration \npriority--that actually pays volunteers to work.\n  AmeriCorps committed last year to try to reduce its cost per \nparticipant to $17,000 this year and to $15,000 in 1999. Yet that is \nhow much a lot of people around the country earn from their jobs. This \nis an unnecessary expenditure of taxpayer funds, and we would do well \nto eliminate it. Yet I know that President Clinton would probably veto \nthe bill--veterans funding and all--just to preserve it. So there seems \nto be little incentive to do the right thing and trim expenditures.\n  The Community Development Block Grant [CDBG] Program is another case \nin point. The bill provides $1.4 billion for the program, with funding \nearmarked for a variety of projects, including library expansion in \nWest Virginia, the Paramount Theater in Vermont, the Bushnell Theater \nin Connecticut, and economic development in downtown Ogden, Utah, to \nname just a few. If we had to set priorities, just like any family back \nhome, we would probably conclude that section 8 renewals might be a \nlittle more important than some of these CDBG grants.\n  But when the sky is the limit, we do not have to prioritize. We \nsimply add more spending on top of everything else. And that is how we \nget a deficit problem.\n  Mr. President, we need a new way of conducting business. We need to \nget back to a politics of principle, and of being honest with the \nAmerican people about whether we are serious about seeking more \nresponsible use of hard-earned tax dollars and reducing the deficit. \nThis bill represents the old way of doing things, and exemplifies the \npolitics of pork.\n  I voted against the budget agreement last month, in large part \nbecause it allowed too much new spending. And the HUD and independent \nagencies portion of this bill is evidence of what we can expect as the \nagreement is fully implemented. That is why next year's budget deficit \nis projected to rise--and not fall --as a result of the agreement.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that we do not have an opportunity \nto consider the various components of this bill on their own merits--\nveterans, HUD, EPA, NASA, AmeriCorps, and the like. I would have \nsupported the veterans budget, the NASA budget, and environmental \nspending in the bill. But as a package, with the very large increase in \nHUD spending and a lack of sufficient offsets for it, I concluded that \nit was necessary to register concern about the process and our \ncountry's future, and to vote ``no'' on the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7970-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LLOYD D. GEORGE UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise \ntoday in support of a bill I introduced on Monday to designate the new \nFederal courthouse in Las Vegas as the ``Lloyd D. George United States \nCourthouse.'' As the Chief Judge of the United States District Court \nfor the District of Nevada, Lloyd George is considered to be one of the \nmost distinguished jurists of the federal judiciary. There is no \ngreater honor we could bestow on the new courthouse in Las Vegas than \nto name it after a man who has served our Nation with such distinction.\n  Those who have the privilege of knowing Judge George, as I do, \nconsider him to be a man of great integrity whose career has been \nmarked by a constant commitment to justice. As an attorney. Judge \nGeorge enjoyed a successful career practicing primarily in the area of \ncommercial law. Prior to his appointment as a United States District \nJudge in May 1984, Judge George served on the United States Bankruptcy \nBench for 10 years. Judge George is a graduate of Las Vegas High and \nBrigham Young University. He served as the student body president at \nboth schools. He received his law degree from the University of \nCalifornia, Boalt Hall. Judge George was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force, \nattaining the rank of Captain.\n  Throughout Judge George's professional life he has assumed many \nleadership responsibilities requiring countless hours of service work \nall in the pursuit of improving and preserving the best aspects of our \njudicial system. He has served on three--and been the chairman of two--\nUnited States Judicial Conference Committee. Currently, he serves as a \nmember of the Judicial Conference of the United States. At the request \nof Chief Justice Rehnquist he serves as a member of the Executive \nCommittee of the Judicial Conference and the International Judicial \nRelations Committee. He is also a member of the Judicial Council for \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and has chaired the Executive \nCommittee of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit. \nAdditionally, he serves on the Advisory Board of the Central and East \nEuropean Law Initiative, American Bar Association's Standing Committee \nof World Order Under Law, and is an Advisory Committee Member of the \nAmerican Judicature Society. He frequently lectures in the U.S. and \nabroad on various legal topics and has published a number of articles \nin legal periodicals. His dedication to improving and promoting our \njudicial system is unparalleled.\n  All of us are fortunate to live in a country where men like Judge \nLloyd George serve as the arbiter's of our laws. He is truly a man of \nthe highest integrity whose legal career has been guided by a keen, \nalmost innate, sense of justice. On a personal note, I consider myself \nmost fortunate to call Lloyd George my friend.\n  I believe there is no better way to honor Judge George than to name \nthis new courthouse the Lloyd D. George United States Courthouse. The \nproposed courthouse is an architectural wonder that will provide a \nstate of the art judicial forum for generations of Nevadans. Judge \nGeorge was instrumental in bringing this about. We honor his service to \nthe judiciary and his commitment to the principle of equal justice \nunder law by naming the new courthouse after him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7971-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Bond, \nSenator Mikulski, and all the members of the VA-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee for all their hard work in bringing this bill to the floor \nso quickly and with such widespread support. I want to add my voice to \nthe many others offering you congratulations for such a good product.\n  I appreciate the understanding and expertise both of you bring to \nthis bill. Your sensitivity to the need to create new affordable \nhousing and homeownership opportunities serves every Member of the \nSenate well.\n  Unfortunately, no amount of good intentions and hard work can make up \nfor the basic lack of funding for housing programs in this bill. While \nthe bill maintains funding for most crucial programs, existing funding \nlevels will not really solve the housing problems we face in this \ncountry.\n  Let us take a moment to put the problem into a broader context. There \nare about 16.5 million families that are eligible for housing \nassistance in America. Yet, only 4.3 million of these families receive \nany housing assistance whatsoever. This includes households living in \npublic housing, assisted housing, housing built with the tax credit and \nHOME funds.\n  Of the 12 million unassisted families, about 5.5 million are faced \nwith desperate housing needs, yet are receiving no help at all from the \nFederal Government.\n  These families are paying over half their incomes every month to keep \na roof over their heads. Or, they live in housing that is falling down \naround them. These families teeter on the edge of homelessness. One \nunanticipated problem--a temporary layoff, an illness of a parent or \nchild, even an unexpected car repair bill--can force these families to \nchoose between paying the rent and buying groceries.\n  The committee did a good job of addressing many competing needs and \ninterests that go far beyond housing programs. But they have simply not \nbeen given enough resources to address the larger need for adequate \naffordable housing.\n  The fact is, we are facing a likely reduction in the total affordable \nhousing stock in America. We expect about 100,000 units of public \nhousing to be demolished in the next several years. Private owners of \nsome assisted housing are likely to prepay their subsidized mortgages \nto get out from under the affordable housing restrictions. Many owners \nof section 8 project-based housing will simply choose not to renew \ntheir contracts, eliminating some of the highest quality affordable \nhousing stock in the inventory.\n  We cannot continue to go in this direction unless we are prepared to \nface a huge increase in the problem of homelessness. Already, in a time \nof low unemployment and strong economic growth, we have seen an \nincrease in homelessness of 5 percent, according to a Conference of \nMayors study.\n  Mr. President, one casualty of the fiscal constraints that the \ncommittee labored within is the Low Income Housing Preservation and \nHomeownership Act [LIHPRH], better known as the Preservation Program. \nThis program has preserved over 80,000 units of affordable housing \npermanently. Another 30,000 units in 37 States await funding. While the \nGAO has raised some concerns about this program, I want to make sure \nthe facts get in the record. The average cost of preserving this \nhousing is $30,000 to $33,000 per unit. This housing could not possibly \nbe replaced for such a cheap price in my home State of Massachusetts, \nnor, I suspect, in many other States, either.\n  Given the overall reduction of affordable housing, the modest \ninvestment it would take to preserve this housing, housing that is \nunlikely to otherwise be replaced, is a wise investment indeed.\n  I urge the committee to work in conference to find some funding for \nthis crucial program. I know Senator Bond's interest in accomplishing \nthis goal, along with appropriate reforms to the program.\n  In doing so, I urge the chairman to adopt a priority for direct sales \nto tenants. One of the key elements of the Preservation Program has \nbeen to empower residents to participate in the decisionmaking \nregarding how their homes are to be preserved. Sales to the residents \nwho live in these communities is the most direct way to achieve this \nimportant goal. It gives the tenants the opportunity to build equity, \nlike other homeowners; it gives tenants a greater stake in the \nmanagement of the property. In sum, Mr. President, it builds a bridge \nto the middle class for the residents of these projects. I would be \nhappy to work with the chairman to achieve this goal.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for all their hard work. I \nsupport this bill and urge my colleagues to do so, as well. I will \ncontinue to work for more funding for housing programs, and look \nforward to the day when the chairman and ranking member are able to \nfully fund the needs of public housing, assisted housing, and the many \nother demands they face as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7972-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HAMILTON FISH\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, one year ago today, our friend and \nformer colleague in the other body, Hamilton Fish, died here in \nWashington.\n  Ham and his forebears, statesman and patriots to a man, were gifts to \nour Nation's Capital from New York where they emerged from immigrant \nroots that were truly extraordinary in the American experience.\n  In the years I knew Ham, I saw reflected in his bearing, his code of \nlife, his approach to the law and devotion to public service, a man \nwhose very genes held rich lessons of bravery, honesty, integrity and \npatriotism handed down from those who had formed this Nation, nurtured \nand served it since the 17th Century. And yet he never let on about the \nfirst Mayor of New York, the last Mayor of Brooklyn, a hero of the \nBattle of Yorktown who looks down from the nearby Rotunda's wall, the \nSecretary of State, the Senators, Rough Riders and Members of the House \nof Representatives who filled his family tree.\n  An impressive lineage was not what was important to him. To Ham, what \none did in the time allotted by God was what mattered.\n  Officially, Hamilton Fish, was the 13-term Congressman from the \nEmpire State's Hudson Valley, who from his earliest years in Congress \nwrestled with the turmoil of Watergate and the Vietnam war, the causes \nof civil rights, refugees, the environment, and a daily concern that \nWashington respond to and be a positive influence for his constituents \nand all Americans.\n  He was neither a ``hawk'' nor a ``dove'' in the contentious and \nimportant issues of his time, but rather an impressive ``owl''--a wise \nowl, using head and heart, with the talons to fight a ferocious battle \nwhen needed, but possessing the sharp ears and keen eyes to recognize \nand counsel for the strength to be gained from collegial compromise; \nknowing the ways to bridge often great divides of politics and \nideologies.\n  Ham Fish was also a very private figure in our midst. The deep love \nhe shared with his wife and family was obvious soon after first meeting \nhim; but the little known, almost spiritual way he approached, planned \nand prepared for each and every one of his days until he died, whether \nfor legislating, trout fishing or making a favorite soup recipe, being \nwith his grandchildren near his beloved Hudson River or meeting with \nthe famous or not so famous, was astonishing. Hamilton Fish the private \nman knew each and every day was to be cherished: taken all in all, of \nlimited number and deserving to be filled with actions and thoughts \nthat were positive, moral and strong.\n  His memory will remain strong for all of us that worked with him. I \nhope those who are just beginning their lives of public service will \ntake a moment today to think about Hamilton Fish of New York . . . a \ngenuine gift to our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7972-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7972-S7983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The text of the bill (H.R. 2158) making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \nfor sundry independent agencies, commissions, corporations, and offices \nfor the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for other purposes, \nas passed by the Senate on July 22, 1997, is as follows:\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2158) entitled ``An Act making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and for sundry independent agencies, \n     commissions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1998, and for other purposes.'', do pass \n     with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n     That the following sums are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Departments \n     of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \n     for sundry independent agencies, commissions, corporations, \n     and offices for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, \n     and for other purposes, namely:\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n                    Veterans Benefits Administration\n\n\n                       compensation and pensions\n\n                     (including transfers of funds)\n\n       For the payment of compensation benefits to or on behalf of \n     veterans and a pilot program for disability examinations as \n     authorized by law (38 U.S.C. 107, chapters 11, 13, 18, 51, \n     53, 55, and 61); pension benefits to or on behalf of veterans \n     as authorized by law (38 U.S.C. chapters 15, 51, 53, 55, and \n     61; 92 Stat. 2508); and burial benefits, emergency and other \n     officers' retirement pay, adjusted-service credits and \n     certificates, payment of premiums due on commercial life \n     insurance policies guaranteed under the provisions of Article \n     IV of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as \n     amended, and for other benefits as authorized by law (38 \n     U.S.C. 107, 1312, 1977, and 2106, chapters 23, 51, 53, 55, \n     and 61; 50 U.S.C.

(a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) catastrophic natural disasters are occurring with great \n     frequency, a trend that is likely to continue for several \n     decades according to prominent scientists;\n       (2) estimated damage to homes, buildings, and other \n     structures from catastrophic natural disasters has totaled \n     well over $100,000,000,000 during the last decade, not \n     including the indirect costs of the disasters such as lost \n     productivity and economic decline;\n       (3) the lack of adequate planning for catastrophic natural \n     disasters, coupled with inadequate private insurance, has led \n     to increasing reliance on the Federal Government to provide \n     disaster relief, including the appropriation of \n     $40,000,000,000 in supplemental funding since 1989;\n       (4) in the foreseeable future, a strong likelihood exists \n     that the United States will experience a megacatastrophe, the \n     impact of which would cause widespread economic disruption \n     for homeowners and businesses and enormous cost to the \n     Federal Government; and\n       (5) the Federal Government has failed to anticipate \n     catastrophic natural disasters and take comprehensive action \n     to reduce their impact.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should consider legislation that embodies the \n     following principles:\n       (1) Persons who live in areas at risk of natural disaster \n     should assume a practical level of personal responsibility \n     for the risks through private insurance.\n       (2) The insurance industry, in partnership with the Federal \n     Government and other private sector entities, should \n     establish new mechanisms for the spreading of the risk of \n     catastrophes that minimize the involvement and liability of \n     the Federal Government.\n       (3) A partnership should be formed between the private \n     sector and government at all levels to encourage better \n     disaster preparation and respond quickly to the physical and \n     financial impacts of catastrophic natural disasters.\n       Sec. 424. It is the sense of the Senate that Congress \n     should appropriate for the Department of Veterans Affairs for \n     discretionary activities in each of fiscal years 1999 through \n     2002 an amount equal to the amount required by the Department \n     in such fiscal year for such activities.\n       Sec. 425. (a) Not later than 60 days after enactment of \n     this Act, the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs shall \n     hold one or more hearings to consider legislation which would \n     add the following diseases at the end of section 1112(c)(2) \n     of title 38, United States Code:\n       (1) Lung cancer.\n       (2) Bone cancer.\n       (3) Skin cancer.\n       (4) Colon cancer.\n       (5) Kidney cancer.\n       (6) Posterior subcapsular cataracts.\n       (7) Non-malignant thyroid nodular disease.\n       (8) Ovarian cancer.\n       (9) Parathyroid adenoma.\n       (10) Tumors of the brain and central nervous system.\n       (11) Rectal cancer.\n       (b) Not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, the \n     Congressional Budget Office shall provide to the Senate \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee an estimate of the cost of the provision contained \n     in subsection (a).\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Departments of Veterans \n     Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7972-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIONAL GEOLOGIC MAPPING REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Res. 40\n\n       Whereas the International Support and Verification \n     Commission of the Organization of American States (in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``OAS-CIAV'') was established \n     in the August 7, 1989, Tela Accords by the presidents of the \n     Central American countries and by the Secretaries General of \n     the United Nations and the Organization of American States \n     for the purpose of ending the Nicaraguan war and \n     reintegrating members of the Nicaraguan Resistance into civil \n     society;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV, originally comprised of 53 unarmed \n     Latin Americans, successfully demobilized 22,500 members of \n     the Nicaraguan Resistance and distributed food and \n     humanitarian assistance to more than 119,000 repatriated \n     Nicaraguans prior to July 1991;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV provided seeds, starter plants, and \n     fertilizer to more than 17,000 families of demobilized \n     combatants;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV assisted former Nicaraguan Resistance \n     members in the construction of nearly 3,000 homes for \n     impoverished families, 45 schools, 50 health clinics, and 25 \n     community multi-purpose centers, as well as the development \n     of microenterprises;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV assisted rural communities with the \n     reparation of roads, development of potable water sources, \n     veterinary and preventative medical training, raising basic \n     crops, cattle ranching, and reforestation;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV, together with the Pan-American Health \n     Organization (PAHO), trained local paramedics to staff 22 \n     health posts in the Atlantic and Pacific regions of Nicaragua \n     and provided medical supplies to treat mothers, young \n     children, and cholera patients, among others, in a five-month \n     program that benefited nearly 50,000 Nicaraguans;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV, with 15 members under a new mandate \n     effective June 9, 1993, has investigated and documented more \n     than 1,800 human rights violations, including 653 murders and \n     has presented these cases to Nicaraguan authorities, \n     following and advocating justice in each case;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV has demobilized 20,745 rearmed contras \n     and Sandinistas, as well as apolitical criminal groups, and \n     recently brokered and mediated the successful\n\n[[Page S7984]]\n\n     May 1997 negotiations between the Government of Nicaragua and \n     the largest rearmed group;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV has resolved hostage crises \n     successfully, including the 1993 abductions of UNO party \n     Congressmen, the Vice President and the French military \n     attache, and the 1996 kidnappings of an Agency for \n     International Development contractor and 28 Supreme Electoral \n     Council employees;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV created 86 peace commissions and has \n     provided assistance and extensive training in human rights \n     and alternative dispute resolution for their members, who are \n     currently mediating conflicts, including kidnappings and \n     demobilization of rearmed groups, in every municipality of \n     the zones of conflict;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV assistance and training by the OAS-\n     CIAV of rural Nicaraguans has led to a decrease in violence \n     in the zones of conflict since 1994, in some areas as much as \n     85 percent;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV has assisted children wounded by land \n     mines;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV has provided assistance to disabled \n     war veterans and widows of combatants;\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV provided and distributed 44,010 birth \n     certificates to rural Nicaraguans in early 1996, allowing \n     them to participate in the 1996 presidential and \n     parliamentary elections; and\n       Whereas the OAS-CIAV provided transportation to and \n     communication with remote areas or areas of conflict, \n     assuring a secure climate for voter registration and the \n     elections: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Senate--\n       (1) commends and congratulates Santiago Murray and Sergio \n     Caramagna, the first and current directors, respectively, of \n     the OAS-CIAV and all members of the OAS-CIAV team for their \n     tireless defense of human rights, promotion of peaceful \n     conflict resolution, and contribution to the development of \n     freedom and democracy in Nicaragua; and\n       (2) expresses its support for the continuation of the role \n     of the Organization of American States (OAS) in Nicaragua \n     described in the resolution passed by the OAS General \n     Assembly in Lima, Peru, on June 4, 1997.\n       Sec. 2.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the resolution appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Res. 41\n\n       Whereas the Republic of Cyprus has been divided and \n     occupied by foreign forces since 1974 in violation of United \n     Nations resolutions;\n       Whereas the international community, Congress, and \n     successive United States administrations have called for an \n     end to the status quo on Cyprus, considering that it \n     perpetuates an unacceptable violation of international law \n     and fundamental human rights affecting all the people of \n     Cyprus, and undermines significant United States interests in \n     the Eastern Mediterranean region;\n       Whereas the international community and the United States \n     Government have repeatedly called for the speedy withdrawal \n     of all foreign forces from the territory of Cyprus;\n       Whereas there are internationally acceptable means to \n     resolve the situation in Cyprus, including the \n     demilitarization of Cyprus and the establishment of a \n     multinational force to ensure the security of both \n     communities in Cyprus;\n       Whereas during the past year tensions in Cyprus have \n     dramatically increased, with violent incidents occurring \n     along cease-fire lines at a level not reached since 1974;\n       Whereas recent events in Cyprus have heightened the \n     potential for armed conflict in the region involving two \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies, Greece and \n     Turkey, which would threaten vital United States interests in \n     the already volatile Eastern Mediterranean area and beyond;\n       Whereas a peaceful, just, and lasting solution to the \n     Cyprus problem would greatly benefit the security, and the \n     political, economic, and social well-being of all Cypriots, \n     as well as contribute to improved relations between Greece \n     and Turkey;\n       Whereas a lasting solution to the Cyprus problem would also \n     strengthen peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean \n     and serve important interests of the United States;\n       Whereas the United Nations has repeatedly stated the \n     parameters for such a solution, most recently in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1092, adopted on December \n     23, 1996, with United States support;\n       Whereas the prospect of the accession by Cyprus to the \n     European Union, which the United States has actively sup- \n     ported, could serve as a catalyst for a solution to the \n     Cyprus problem;\n       Whereas President Bill Clinton has pledged that in 1997 the \n     United States will ``play a heightened role in promoting a \n     resolution in Cyprus''; and\n       Whereas United States leadership will be a crucial factor \n     in achieving a solution to the Cyprus problem, and increased \n     United States involvement in the search for this solution \n     will contribute to a reduction of tension on Cyprus: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms its view that the status quo on Cyprus is \n     unacceptable and detrimental to the interests of the United \n     States in the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond;\n       (2) considers that lasting peace and stability on Cyprus \n     could be best secured by--\n       (A) a process of complete demilitarization leading to the \n     withdrawal of all foreign occupation forces;\n       (B) the cessation of foreign arms transfers to Cyprus; and\n       (C) the provision of alternative internationally acceptable \n     and effective security arrangements with guaranteed rights \n     for both communities as negotiated by the parties;\n       (3) welcomes and supports the commitment by President \n     Clinton to give increased attention to Cyprus and to make the \n     search for a solution a priority of United States foreign \n     policy, as witnessed by the appointment of Ambassador Richard \n     Holbrooke as Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus; and\n       (4) calls upon the parties to lend their full support and \n     cooperation to United States, United Nations, and other \n     international efforts to promote an equitable and speedy \n     resolution of the Cyprus problem--\n       (A) on the basis of international law, the provisions of \n     relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, and \n     democratic principles, including respect for human rights; \n     and\n       (B) in accordance with the norms and requirements for \n     accession to the European Union.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I rise to congratulate the Senate on having adopted Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 41, which calls for a United States initiative \nseeking a just and peaceful resolution on the situation on Cyprus.\n  Senator Smith of Oregon and I submitted this resolution last week in \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations, where it received speedy and \nfavorable action. I applaud my colleagues for having adopted the \nresolution today.\n  For 23 years Cyprus has been divided, with the northern part occupied \nby Turkish troops, and the southern part home to the Greek Cypriot \ncommunity. Tensions remain high, and since Cyprus has become one of the \nmost heavily armed places in the world, the possibility for serious \nhostilities is high. So, Mr. President, it is clear that the status quo \non Cyprus is detrimental to U.S. interests in the volatile Eastern \nMediterranean region.\n  The resolution declares that lasting peace and stability on Cyprus \ncould best be served by complete demilitarization leading to the \nwithdrawal of all foreign occupation forces, the cessation of foreign \narms transfers to Cyprus, and the provision of alternative \ninternationally acceptable and effective security arrangements with \nguaranteed rights for both communities as negotiated by the parties.\n  The resolution also welcomes and supports President Clinton's \ncommitment to give increased attention to Cyprus as witnessed by \nAmbassador Holbrook's appointment as Special Presidential Emissary for \nCyprus.\n  Finally, the resolution calls upon the parties to lend their full \nsupport and cooperation to United States, United Nations, and other \ninternational efforts to promote an equitable and speedy resolution of \nthe Cyprus problem on the basis of international law,\n\n[[Page S7985]]\n\nrelevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, and democratic principles, \nincluding respect for human rights, and in accordance with the norms \nand requirements for accession to the European Union.\n  This last item is important, Mr. President, giving the naming earlier \nthis month of Cyprus to the first group of candidate countries for \nfinal membership negotiations with the European Union, along with \nPoland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, and Estonia.\n  Mr. President, the intolerable situation on Cyprus must be changed. \nFace to face negotiations between the two parties have resumed, and \nthere are some grounds for optimism. I hope that this resolution will \nserve to energize the parties to come to a just and lasting agreement.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/23/senate-section/article/S7984-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 24, 1997\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.
