Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow resume consideration of the Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill, S. 2307, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2307) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senate's Transportation \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 which the Senate will approve \ntoday is of vital importance to the state of New Jersey. As the most \ndensely populated state in the nation, efficient and effective \ntransportation is critical to the economic well being of my state, as \nwell as to the quality of life of its residents.\n  The Senate's transportation appropriations bill provides over $900 \nmillion in transportation investments to my state. In addition, New \nJersey will receive tremendous benefits from investments in Amtrak \nservices, in the William J. Hughes FAA Technical Center in Pomona, in \nthe U.S. Coast Guard training center in Cape May, the Coast Guard air \nstation in Pomona, and in the airports in our state, particularly \nNewark International Airport. This investment provides good paying jobs \nin the short-term, and in the long-term, it will create and maintain \nthe infrastructure that New Jersey needs to attract and keep a strong \nworkforce. Ultimately, these investments will serve to reduce \ncongestion, improve air quality, and enhance New Jerseyans' quality of \nlife.\n  Mr. President, I would like to highlight some of the important \nprovisions in the Senate's bill which I was able to secure for the \nGarden State.\n  Transit is an intricate part of Northern New Jersey's transportation \nplan. The single largest component of New Jersey's mass transit \ninitiatives is the Urban Core. I was pleased to secure $70 million that \nwill go toward additional design and construction of the Hudson-Bergen \nLight Rail link. This rail line will reduce congestion and increase \nmobility, and will spur economic development in the communities along \nthe Hudson County waterfront and into Bergen County. It will improve \nair quality, and provide needed construction, operation and maintenance \njobs.\n  In addition, the $12 million that is provided for the Newark-\nElizabeth Rail Link is the first significant infusion of federal \ndollars that will seriously initiate this project. This mass transit\n\n[[Page S8954]]\n\nproject will first link Broad Street Station to Penn Station in Newark, \nextending past Newark International Airport, through the City of \nElizabeth and into Union County. Also part of Urban Core, the Newark-\nElizabeth Rail Link is an integral part of the ``Circle of Mobility'' \nthat will serve to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance \nNew Jerseyans' quality of life. To date I have secured over $600 \nmillion for Urban Core projects.\n  In addition to the Urban Core and transit formula assistance, the \nbill makes a number of bus and bus facility projects eligible for \nfederal assistance. Among those are the Market Street bus maintenance \nfacility in Paterson, New Jersey Transit jitney shuttle buses, Newark, \nMorris and Essex Station access and buses, the South Amboy regional \nintermodal transportation initiative and New Jersey Transit clean fuel \nbuses.\n  The bill also allocates $4 million to the National Transit Institute \nat Rutgers University, of which $1 million will go toward mass transit \nworkplace safety training.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that Amtrak is a critical component \nof our nation's transportation system, particularly in New Jersey and \nthroughout the Northeast corridor. It provides safe and effective \ntransportation to millions of customers every year, reducing congestion \non our roads and in our skies. If Amtrak were not operating, there \nwould be 18,000 cars a day on New Jersey's already dense highways. This \nis untenable for my state. Despite many difficulties, I am pleased that \nthe Senate bill provides $555 million for Amtrak's national rail \noperations. This funding is in addition to the $2.2 billion in capital \nfunding provided by the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997. \nThis investment will allow Amtrak to continue its operations for \nanother year and further enable it to reach its goal of self-\nsufficiency by 2002.\n  Mr. President, the bill also includes a general provision concerning \na High Occupancy Vehicle lane along I-287 in New Jersey. The provision \nwould allow the state to remove the HOV restrictions without being \nrequired to reimburse the federal government for construction costs. A \nfew years ago, I secured $140 million for the HOV lane in an \nappropriations bill at the request of the state. Now operational, the \nHOV lane is clearly not working, as only 72 cars an hour are using the \nlane, significantly less than the 600 cars expected. Currently, a state \ncan appeal to the federal government to decommission an HOV lane \nwithout having to pay back the funds if it successfully makes the case \nthat it is not ``in the public interest.'' Since the I-287 lane was \ndirected by statute, the federal government does not have the authority \nto approve a state's appeal. The general provision allows New Jersey to \nappeal to the Federal Highway Administration that the lane is not in \nthe public interest, and if the Secretary concurs, the state will not \nhave to pay back the $140 million. No one is more committed to cleaner \nair, energy conservation, and innovations to cut traffic congestion \nthan I. HOV lanes have worked in certain settings and I support them \nwhere they are successful. But, in New Jersey, it may be that our \ntraffic patterns, work schedules and other issues make it difficult for \nthe I-287 HOV lane to work. This provision removes a significant \nfinancial hurdle if the HOV lane is proven to be a failed lane.\n  Mr. President, to make roads in New Jersey as productive as possible, \nthe Senate bill includes $6 million for intelligent transportation \nsystem initiatives in New Jersey. These funds will go to advance \nprojects already underway and managed by TRANSCOM, a consortium of 14 \nstate and local agencies in the NY/NJ/CN metropolitan area. TRANSCOM is \nresponsible for developing and coordinating the region's traffic \nmanagement and incident detection system through the deployment of \nsignificant investments in intelligent transportation systems. Over \nhalf of the congestion on the region's roadways is due to traffic \nincidents and it is TRANSCOM's mission to improve inter-agency response \nto such incidents.\n  Mr. President, transportation is the lifeblood of New Jersey and \naviation is in the center of it. I am pleased to cite a number of \nprovisions in this bill that improve upon the state's aviation system. \nFirst, the bill includes $11 million for the redesign of national air \nspace, of which $3 million will be used to focus the FAA's efforts of \nredesigning the airspace in the New Jersey/New York metropolitan area. \nThis funding will kick-off the redesign process, which will hopefully \nalleviate congestion and improve aircraft operations in the region's \nalready dense and complex airspace, leading to fewer delays and reduced \nair noise levels. I was also pleased to secure $100,000 for a \n``technical assistance grant'' for a community group to retain the \nservices of an expert to ensure that citizens are represented and \nincluded during the FAA's redesign effort.\n  I was also pleased to secure funding that will greatly improve \noperations at Newark International Airport. The bill provides $2 \nmillion to begin work on installing state-of-the-art radar upgrades and \nrunway-monitoring improvements that will reduce delays and enhance \nsafety at the airport. Moreover, the bill includes report language that \nrecognizes the cooperative effort among the FAA, the Port Authority of \nNew York/New Jersey, and airport users to make Newark Airport among the \nbest in the country. The language directs the FAA to report quarterly \non the progress of the cooperative working group and outlines the \nvarious equipment and initiatives that are priorities for the airport.\n  The bill also includes report language expressing concern about \nstaffing and equipment needs at New Jersey/New York area towers, the \nNew York TRACON and the New York Air Traffic Control Center. This \nlanguage will serve to direct the FAA to do all it can to improve the \nsafety and efficiency of these facilities. And, the bill includes a \nprovision directing the FAA to ensure that the air traffic controllers \nserving all the major FAA facilities in the region--air traffic control \ntowers, the New York TRACON and the New York Center--are compensated \nequally. The FAA's proposed reclassification scheme would create a pay \ngap that does not recognize the equity of the work performed at the \nfacilities and will force the experienced controllers serving the \ntowers to go to the Center and the TRACON. The language prevents this \nfrom happening.\n  Moreover, the bill fully funds the Hughes Technical Center in Pomona. \nThe Technical Center is the world's premier aviation testing and \ndevelopment center, with state-of-the-art facilities and an impressive \nworkforce. The bill provides funding to continue the good work at the \nTech Center.\n  Mr. President, I strongly supported funding for the Office of \nPipeline Safety, and I am pleased that the bill provides $32.7 million \nfor pipeline safety programs, with $1 million set aside for One-Call \nprograms. These programs require anyone who is going to dig--\ncontractors, utilities, for example--to find out the exact location of \npipelines before they break ground. We in New Jersey know all too well \nthe damage that a pipeline accident can have on victims of pipeline \neruptions, and particularly to the community. Four years ago, around \nmidnight, on March 24, 1994, a major natural gas pipeline ruptured in \nEdison, New Jersey, a densely populated, urban environment. This \nrupture caused a deafening boom, awakening residents of the Durham \nWoods apartment complex and changing their lives forever. The explosion \nwas caused by third party damage, something a strong one-call program \nwould address. Thus, the bill includes language emphasizing the \nimportance of One-Call programs in preventing accidents. Two-thirds of \nall pipeline accidents are caused by people who dig without knowing of \nthe locations of pipelines.\n  Mr. President, the bill also provides $2 million for the Biomechanics \nConsortium, of which the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New \nJersey (UMDNJ) is a member. These institutions study the effects of \nmotor vehicle crash injuries on adults and children, resulting in the \ndeployment of more effective life-saving safety devices. These life-\nsaving funds are extremely important and I am pleased that the bill \nfunds this program.\n  Mr. President, the Coast Guard has an important presence in our state \nand I am pleased that it is well funded. In addition to the assistance \nprovided to the air station in Pomona and the training center in Cape \nMay, the bill fully funds the Coast Guard's Container Inspection \nProgram (CIP) at $3.6\n\n[[Page S8955]]\n\nmillion. The CIP addresses environmental and safety problems posed by \nimproper transport of containerized hazardous materials into U.S. \nports. I established this program in 1994 to address the environmental \nand safety problems posed by improper transport of containerized \nhazardous materials into U.S. ports. This was highlighted by the 1992 \nSanta Clara casualty, in which several containers of highly toxic \narsenic trioxide were lost overboard off the New Jersey coast, posing a \nsubstantial threat to the marine environment and its resources. \nFollowing this, the Coast Guard conducted intensive, targeted \ninspections and discovered wanton and widespread violations of \ncontainer handling and packaging regulations. This program serves to \nprevent such casualties and protect the marine environment.\n  Mr. President, having better, more efficient transit systems, roads, \nairports and all other transportation systems will improve the quality \nof life for thousands of residents and visitors to New Jersey on a \ndaily basis. I am glad that as Ranking Minority Member of this \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee I was able to secure this \nfunding, as well as the bill and report language for New Jersey. I \nappreciate the generosity shown by the Chairman of the Subcommittee, \nSenator Richard Shelby, who has been most cooperative and helpful \nthroughout the process. His work will serve all New Jerseyans and the \nnation well.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my strong support \nfor S. 2307, the Department of Transportation's Appropriations Bill for \nFY 1999. This funding comes at a critical time for our nation and in \nparticular, Washington state.\n  Mr. President, as I fly home each weekend, I join thousands of other \ncommuters in the Puget Sound Region immersed in daily and agonizing \ngridlock. Our State Department of Transportation is working furiously \nto construct HOV lanes, park and rides and additional interchanges. I \napplaud our State Secretary Sid Morrison for his innovative thinking \nand leadership during this time of enormous growth.\n  Our region's economic boom has brought many advantages, however, its \nimpact on mobility in the region has been dramatic and continually \nfrustrates motorists. This bill will provide much needed relief for our \nPuget Sound Region and for infrastructure improvements throughout \nWashington state. I am most pleased that I was able to work with the \ncommittee to secure $60 million for the Puget Sound's Regional Transit \nAuthority, known as Sound Move. This will include $47 million for \ncommuter rail between Seattle and Tacoma and $13 million to begin light \nrail construction.\n  Additionally, I want to express my support for the committee's work \nin funding the Elliot Bay Water Taxi, the Columbia River Marine Fire \nand Safety Association, ITS systems near Spokane's SR 395, airport \nimprovements at Everett's Paine Field, Boeing Field and the Pullman \nAirport. These projects are vital to our region's multi-modal planning. \nThe linking of car, bus, bike, ferry, plane, train and pedestrian has \nbecome the framework of every infrastructure decision.\n  I wanted to personally thank Chairman Shelby and our Ranking Member, \nSenator Lautenberg for their dedicated work. Their combined efforts and \nleadership on our subcommittee have produced enormous results that will \nbe felt by generations to come. I am pleased to see our commitment to \nAmtrak, the Coast Guard, FAA and the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration. I am committed to helping this bill remain in \nconference and urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Our work today is wonderful news for the millions of Americans \nsitting right now in parking lots which were once called highways.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, this legislation includes critical \nfunding for our nation's airports, roads, mass transit systems, and \nother transportation. I want to particularly thank the managers of the \nbill for including funding for Amtrak, and for a number of key projects \nimportant to Illinois, including funding for Metra, Metro Link, and the \nChicago Transit Authority.\n  I am disappointed that the legislation includes an amendment, added \nlast night, that provides for expedited review of court challenges to \nthe DBE program. I hope that the conferees on this bill will see fit to \ndrop this ill-advised and unnecessary intrusion into hundreds years of \njudicial process.\n\n\n              federal lands highway program (Highway 323)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the Committee's \nintent regarding the directive to the Secretary to make funds available \nfor Highway 323 in Southeastern Montana.\n  Under the Federal Lands Highway Program, the Secretary is to make \nfunds available to conduct the environmental review, design and, to the \nextent possible, right-of-way acquisition for the future phased \nconstruction to a paved secondary road standard for 50.4 miles along \nHighway 323 between the communities of Alzada, Montana and Ekalaka, \nMontana.\n  This additional language needs to be recognized in order to \ndiscourage duplication of work that has already been completed.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I agree with the Senator of Montana.\n\n\n               federal lands highway program (highway 93)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the Committee's \nintent on a couple of different issues in the Transportation \nAppropriations bill. Under the Federal Lands Highway Program account, \ntwo separate highway issues are addressed. I would like to ensure the \nSecretary is aware of the importance of both of these highway issues.\n  The first, is in Northeastern Montana. Highway 93 is the primary \nroute from Interstate 90 to the Flathead Valley and Glacier National \nPark. This area is growing in recreational popularity. This beautiful \nvalley is home to Flathead Lake. Located between Kalispell and Polson, \nthis is the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi.\n  Glacier National Park receives numerous visitors by air and train. \nBut the most popular means to reach the park is by Highway 93.\n  Big Mountain recreational ski area is located to the north of the \nValley. This resort area is a year-round attraction for outdoor \nenthusaiasts--many of whom drive to the area by way of Highway 93.\n  I often travel this highway to visit my constituents on the Salish \nand Kootenai Indian reservation as well as my constituents in \nKalispell, and Northwest Montana. Recently on this highway, I noticed I \nwas literally traveling in bumper to bumper traffic. This is not a \ncommon phenomenon in Montana but the increased summer traffic in this \narea has many of the local users concerned about their safety and the \nsafety of their passengers.\n  For nearly thirty years, Montana's American Legion has taken on the \nresponsibility to remind drivers of the dangers of highway travel by \nplacing a white cross along the roadside. The roadside along Highway 93 \nis littered with these white crosses.\n  As a result of the public outcry to help reduce the number of \naccidents on this highway, I, on behalf of the Montana Department of \nTransportation, would like to ask the Committee to direct the Secretary \nto authorize and release all funds designated for the four-lane \nexpansion of Highway 93. I would also like to ask the Committee to \ndirect the Secretary to withdraw the Federal Highway Administration's \nrecord of decision requiring resolution at the State, local and tribal \nlevels.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I understand the concern expressed by my colleague from \nMontana. It is the intent of the Committee that the Secretary should \nact as we have encouraged him to and I will work with you in conference \nto clarify that.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the question is, \nShall the bill, S. 2307, as amended, pass? The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), the \nSenator from Montana (Mr. Burns), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms), the Senator from Idaho \n(Mr. Kempthorne), the Senator From Arizona (Mr. McCain), and the \nSenator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens), are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMontana (Mr. Burns) would vote ``yes.''\n\n[[Page S8956]]\n\n  Mr. FORD.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The American credit union movement began as a \n     cooperative effort to serve the productive and provident \n     credit needs of individuals of modest means.\n       (2) Credit unions continue to fulfill this public purpose, \n     and current members and membership groups should not face \n     divestiture from the financial services institution of their \n     choice as a result of recent court action.\n       (3) To promote thrift and credit extension, a meaningful \n     affinity and bond among members, manifested by a commonality \n     of routine interaction, shared and related work experiences, \n     interests, or activities, or the maintenance of an otherwise \n     well-understood sense of cohesion or identity is essential to \n     the fulfillment of the public mission of credit unions.\n       (4) Credit unions, unlike many other participants in the \n     financial services market, are exempt from Federal and most \n     State taxes because they are member-owned, democratically \n     operated, not-for-profit organizations generally managed by \n     volunteer boards of directors and because they have the \n     specified mission of meeting the credit and savings needs of \n     consumers, especially persons of modest means.\n       (5) Improved credit union safety and soundness provisions \n     will enhance the public benefit that citizens receive from \n     these cooperative financial services institutions.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act--\n       (1) the term ``Administration'' means the National Credit \n     Union Administration;\n       (2) the term ``Board'' means the National Credit Union \n     Administration Board;\n       (3) the term ``Federal banking agencies'' has the same \n     meaning as in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act;\n       (4) the terms ``insured credit union'' and ``State-\n     chartered insured credit union'' have the same meanings as in \n     section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act; and\n       (5) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n     Treasury.\n                     TITLE I--CREDIT UNION MEMBERSHIP\n\n     SEC. 101. FIELDS OF MEMBERSHIP.\n\n       Section 109 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. \n     1759) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence--\n       (A) by striking ``Federal credit union membership shall \n     consist of'' and inserting ``(a) In General.--Subject to \n     subsection (b), Federal credit union membership shall consist \n     of'';

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that staff of the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be permitted access to \nthe floor during consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today, we consider H.R. 1151, the Credit \nUnion Membership Access Act, which is critical legislation. It is \nlegislation necessary to preserve the ability of all Americans to join \nthe credit union of their choice, and to ensure that 73 million \nAmericans who are currently members of a credit union in no way have \ntheir membership status jeopardized.\n  Credit unions work, Mr. President. They work for working families, \nthey work for the little guy. And in their hour of gravest need, it is \ntime for Congress to work for them. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation as enthusiastically as our friends in the House did--\nby an overwhelming vote of 411-8. I am confident that we will act to \npreserve the rights of all Americans to join credit unions now and into \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, this legislation was crafted in response to a Supreme \nCourt ruling that was decided on a very narrow legal point, handed down \non February 25 of this year. That ruling placed 20 million Americans in \nimmediate jeopardy and tens of millions of others of being kicked out \nof the credit unions they belong to. Who are these Americans? They are \nsmall business employees and small business owners, low- and moderate-\nincome earners, farmers, laborers, church members--the hard-working \nAmerican men and women who have a right to affordable financial \nservices as much as anyone else.\n  For decades, the American dream has been made a reality by credit \nunions. These cooperatives reach out to individuals, associations and \ncommunities who have had the door slammed in their faces by other \nfinancial institutions. Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, the \neconomy, while strong today, the economy--such that people can get \nloans for a variety of reasons--may not always be that strong. I hope \nit is. But if history is any reminder of what may be in the future, \nthere will be difficult times.\n  It has always been the credit union that has given to the little guy, \nthe forgotten middle class--I don't mean little in terms of size and \nnot as a pejorative, but indeed I am talking about the backbone of this \ncountry--the opportunity to look his or her neighbor in the eye, who \nknows that they are good and who knows they will work to pay back that \nloan, as opposed to somebody 2,000 miles away who doesn't even see that \nperson, who gets an application, who views it in terms of what the \nincome is or the fact that the person is out of work, or the fact that \nthe person has a small farm and is running against tough times and \nsays, no, and turns them down.\n  It has traditionally been the credit union neighbor, knowing a \nneighbor employee, working next to his co-employee, recognizing their \nneeds, making that money available so they can send their kid to \nschool. It is one of the great strengths of this country, and it gives \nus economic diversity, it gives people choice, and it provides \ncompetition.\n  There are those who do not like competition, who set up a whole \nseries--almost a canard as to, ``Oh, no; credit unions are a problem.'' \nThey are a problem, because they give people affordable opportunities \nto borrow at the lowest rates, because they don't pay income taxes. \nWhy? They are not paying dividends out to people. Where do those moneys \ngo? Those moneys go so that additional loans are available to their \nmembers. I love it. I think it is great. I think it really is Americana \nat its best.\n  During good and prosperous times, we should not turn away and we \nshould not create conditions that make it difficult, if not impossible, \nfor them to serve the needs of our neighbors and our friends, and \npeople in all of our communities.\n  Mr. President, it is not good enough to say, ``I am going to vote for \na credit union bill,'' and then attempt to fix a whole series of \nmeasures aimed at impeding the credit unions from doing their job. \nThere are going to be some of my good friends and colleagues who are \ngoing to come here and say, ``We want to make it possible for others in \nthe financial services area to recognize that we love them and we care \nfor them,'' et cetera.\n  There are going to be a number of amendments that are going to be put \nforth. Some of these amendments, and one in particular, one that would \nattempt to remove the Community Reinvestment Act from the obligation of \ncommunity banks--if that is passed, that will spell a veto of this \nbill.\n  I am not suggesting to you we shouldn't help community banks. I want \nto help them. Indeed, our President who presides today has come forth. \nI want to commend the Senator from Colorado for some very creative, \nlong overdue actions to help community banks in the most positive way \nby seeing to it that they do not have unfair tax burdens placed upon \nthem, by seeing that they have the opportunity to expand their board of \ndirectors or their shareholders, the number of shareholders, without \nfalling into another taxable area.\n  There are things we can do and should be doing. But we shouldn't be \nattempting to do them, in my opinion, on this bill because it clouds \nthe issue of whether or not we are going to give credit unions the \nopportunity to continue to serve their people.\n  Let me suggest this. Our Senate bill goes much further than the House \nbill to ensure the safety and the soundness of credit unions through \ntougher, more detailed provisions requiring a system of prompt, \ncorrective action for federally insured credit unions.\n  This is not a giveaway. This is not the same bill that came from the \nHouse. It is improved. It is tougher on them and fairer on them. We sat \ndown and negotiated with them. We said to them that we are not going to \nplace at risk the FDIC insurance for the American taxpayer. They \nagreed.\n  The system is be patterned after the prompt corrective action \nprovisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. This is a different \nbill from the one that comes from the House. It is aimed at protecting \nour taxpayers.\n  The Senate bill also includes for the first time capital requirements \nfor all federally insured credit unions, including a risk-based capital \nrequirement for complex credit unions. Together, these provisions \nrepresent the most significant legislative reform of credit union \nsafety and soundness since 1970 when the National Credit Union \ninsurance fund was created.\n  We have included the enhanced safety and soundness provisions upon \nthe recommendation of the Treasury Department following an extensive \nTreasury Department study placed in legislation by our colleague, \nSenator Bennett. These are basic, prudent approaches to successfully \nmanage any financial institution that Congress has already applied to \nbanks and thrifts. In the long run, it is the American taxpayer that we \nprotect by assuring that credit unions reach and attain high levels of \ncapital, or face restrictions with respect to their operations.\n  Credit unions, no matter how small or how large, need a sufficient \ncapital buffer to handle unexpected downturns in the economy and \nsubsequent losses. The capital requirements in this bill will see to it \nthat those goals are achieved.\n  We all know how important prevention is, along with legislative \noversight, when dealing with financial institutions. Credit unions are \nno different from other financial institutions when it comes to \nprevention and oversight.\n  There are those who will say you are going in and giving to the \nmasses. No. We responded to their legitimate concerns that they can \ncontinue business. But we have tougher end requirements as it relates \nto sound operation and oversight and the ability to close those down \nwho may not be meeting their obligations.\n\n[[Page S8963]]\n\n  In 1991, the GAO issued an extensive study which detailed the \nrecommendations for corporate credit union investments and capital \nratios that were later adopted. These recommendations were also adopted \nby the NCUA.\n  The failure of Cap Corp. in 1995 raised specific concerns about the \ninterest rate risk that corporate credit unions were taking. Our \ncommittee held hearings in early 1995 and later reported out a bill, S. \n883. In 1997, NCUA issued a comprehensive revision of the rules \ngoverning corporate credit unions to address concerns arising from the \nfailure of Cap Corp.\n  Mr. President, credit unions all over are now in solid shape, as \nconcluded in the exhaustive study done by Treasury last year. The new \nsafety and soundness provisions, as recommended by the Treasury \nDepartment, will further strengthen insured credit unions across the \ncountry and, in so doing, protect our taxpayers.\n  Our legislation also goes much further than the House in placing for \nthe first time significant restrictions on member business loans. We \nare going to hear something about that. We are going to hear that we \nshould restrict loans that credit unions can make. While the House bill \nsimply puts a freeze on current regulations and requires a study, our \nbill places statutory limits on the amount of total business loans \navailable for credit unions.\n  This is not a bill crafted to please all. This is a bill crafted to \npermit credit unions to do that which they do best--to make those \nloans, those personal loans to their members, and, yes, to meet the \nneeds of the small businessmen.\n  In the Senate bill, the total amount of outstanding member business \nloans of a federally insured credit union cannot exceed 12.25 percent \nof the assets of the credit union. Credit unions that become \nundercapitalized--that is, less than 6 percent of their net worth--are \nprohibited from making new commercial loans that would result in an \nincrease in the total amount of member business loans outstanding. \nCredit unions that presently exceed the member business loan limits \nwill be given 3 years in which to come into compliance.\n  Mr. President, this is a pretty tough loan limitation, the first \ntime. It is not in the House bill--never had any limitations on \nbusiness loans. There are going to be some who genuinely feel that \nshould be curtailed even further. I would suggest to go further would \nreally do violence to the ability of almost 200 of the Nation's 1,500 \ncredit unions that make these loans available today. It is unintended \nmischief that will take place if that legislation passes. I say \n``unintended,'' Mr. President. Notwithstanding unintended, the \nconsequences will not be fair and will be disruptive.\n  These restrictions on business lending in our bill are real and they \nare meaningful, and together with the expanded safety and soundness \nprovisions in title III of the bill, we will ensure that credit union \nbusiness lending does not present any safety and soundness concerns. In \na July 13 letter to the majority leader, Secretary Rubin has stated \nTreasury's position that the prompt corrective action in capital \nstandard provisions in the bill represent an adequate response to any \nsafety and soundness concerns about credit union business lending.\n  Furthermore, I have a copy of the statement of the administration \npolicy dated July 22, 1998, which states that there is no safety and \nsoundness basis for additional business loan requirements.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Rubin's letter and the \nStatement of the Administration Policy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Trent: I appreciate your scheduling H.R. 1151, the \n     Credit Union Membership Access Act, for Senate floor action \n     beginning July 17. I am writing to urge expeditious Senate \n     passage of the bill--as approved by the Banking Committee on \n     April 30--without any extraneous amendments.\n       In revising the statute governing federal credit unions' \n     field of membership, the bill would protect existing credit \n     union members and membership groups, and remove uncertainty \n     created by the Supreme Court's AT decision.\n       The bill's safety and soundness provisions would represent \n     the most significant legislative reform of credit union \n     safety and soundness safeguards since the creation of the \n     National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in 1970. The bill \n     would institute capital standards for all federally insured \n     credit unions, including a risk-based capital requirement for \n     complex credit unions. It would create a system of prompt \n     corrective action--specifically tailored to credit unions as \n     not-for-profit, member-owned cooperatives. It would also take \n     a series of steps to make the Share Insurance Fund even \n     stronger and more resilient.\n       These reforms involve little cost or burden to credit \n     unions today, yet they could pay enormous dividends in more \n     difficult times.\n       The bill rightly reaffirms and reinforces credit unions' \n     mission of serving persons of modest means. Section 204 would \n     require periodic review of each federally insured credit \n     union's record of meeting the needs of such persons within \n     its field of membership. This requirement is flexible, \n     tailored to credit unions, and will impose no unreasonable \n     burden. It rests on the Congressionally mandated mission of \n     credit unions and on the benefits of federal deposit \n     insurance. Such deposit insurance gives credit union members \n     ironclad assurance about the safety of their savings, and \n     thus helps credit unions compete for deposits with larger, \n     more widely known financial institutions (just as it helps \n     community banks and thrifts). Section 204 is particularly \n     appropriate in view of how the bill liberalizes the common \n     bond requirement and thus facilitates credit unions' \n     expansion beyond their core membership groups.\n       Finally, I would like to comment on the safety and \n     soundness of credit unions' business lending. Credit unions \n     may make business loans only to their members, and cannot \n     make loans to business corporations. Under the National \n     Credit Union Administration's regulations, each business loan \n     must be fully secured with good-quality collateral, the \n     borrower must be personally liable on the loan, and business \n     loans to any one borrower generally cannot exceed 15 percent \n     of the credit union's reserves. Credit unions' business loans \n     have delinquency rates that are comparable to those on \n     commercial loans made by community banks and thrifts, and \n     charge-off (i.e., loss) rates that compare favorably with \n     those of banks and thrifts. We believe that existing \n     safeguards--together with such new statutory protections as \n     the 6 percent capital requirement, the risk-based capital \n     requirement for complex credit unions, and the system of \n     prompt corrective action--represent an adequate response to \n     safety and soundness concerns about credit unions' business \n     lending.\n       We look forward to working with you and other Senators to \n     secure expeditious passage of a clean bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin,\n     Secretary of the Treasury.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n             h.r. 1151--credit union membership access act\n\n       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. \n     1151, as approved by the Senate Banking Committee, without \n     extraneous or controversial amendments. The full Senate \n     should reject amendments rejected at the Banking Committee \n     mark-up, such as the amendment that would substantially \n     weaken the Community Reinvestment Act by exempting certain \n     banks from the Act's requirements. If H.R. 1151 were \n     presented to the President with such an amendment, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury would recommend that the President \n     veto the bill.\n       The Senate Banking Committee version reflects a careful \n     balancing of important goals: (1) protecting existing credit \n     union members and membership groups; (2) removing uncertainty \n     created by the Supreme Court's AT decision; (3) \n     facilitating credit union expansion beyond core membership \n     groups in appropriate circumstances, such as when necessary \n     to meet the needs of underserved areas; (4) reforming credit \n     union safety and soundness safeguards, by instituting capital \n     standards and a risk-based capital requirement, as well as \n     further strengthening the Share Insurance Fund; and (5) \n     reaffirming and reinforcing credit unions' mission of serving \n     persons of modest means. The Administration strongly opposes \n     any efforts to upset this balance by stripping the bill of \n     any of these important provisions.\n       Specifically, Section 204 would require periodic review of \n     each Federally-insured credit union's record of meeting the \n     needs of such persons within its membership. This requirement \n     is flexible, tailored to credit unions, and will impose no \n     unreasonable burden. It rests on the Congressionally mandated \n     mission of credit unions and on the benefits of Federal \n     deposit insurance. Inclusion of Section 204 is particularly \n     important to keeping credit unions focused on their public \n     mission in view of how the bill liberalizes the common bond \n     requirement.\n       In addition, the Administration sees no safety and \n     soundness basis for an amendment that would limit the ability \n     of credit unions to make business loans to their members. \n     Existing safeguards, coupled with the new capital and other \n     reforms in the bill, are sufficient to protect against any \n     safety and soundness risk from member business lending.\n\n[[Page S8964]]\n\n                         pay-as-you-go-scoring\n\n       H.R. 1151 would affect direct spending and receipts; \n     therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of \n     the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The \n     Administration's preliminary estimate is that H.R. 1151 would \n     have a net budget cost of zero.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. We need to act expeditiously on this legislation. I am \ndeeply grateful to the Senate majority leader for making this time \navailable so that we can go forward. Make no mistake about it, without \nthe ability to add new members and new groups, the credit union \nmovement would be fatally injured.\n  I am convinced that we are going to move in a prompt way and that the \nlegislation will pass by an overwhelming margin. Why? Because it is the \nright thing to do. It is the right thing to do for 73 million Americans \nwho now belong to credit unions, for the 20 million Americans whose \ncurrent credit union membership is threatened, and for the 675 million \nAmericans and small businesses who may be shut out, prevented from \njoining a credit union in the future. I certainly urge my colleagues to \nsupport and expeditiously act on this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would be remiss if I did \nnot thank my colleague, the ranking member of the Banking Committee, \nSenator Sarbanes, the distinguished senior Senator from Maryland, for \nhis outstanding contribution and leadership in helping to craft this \nlegislation and to bring it to this point in a totally bipartisan \nfashion. We would not be here positioned to go forth on this \nlegislation were it not for his outstanding leadership and that of a \ndedicated bipartisan staff, might I add, on the minority side. They \nhave done an absolutely fabulous job in bringing us to this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Patience \nSingleton and Loretta Garrison, staff members, be allowed privileges of \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first I want to thank my colleague, \nChairman D'Amato, for his kind words and to underscore the very \neffective leadership which the chairman has exercised in bringing this \nlegislation to this point. This bill came out of the committee on a \nvote of 16 to 2. We had very strong support within the Senate Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and I have been pleased to be \nable to work closely with the chairman in trying to craft this \nlegislation.\n  We had, as usual, outstanding contributions by members of the staff \non both the Republican and the Democratic sides, and we are most \nappreciative to them for the many long hours they have put in on this \nlegislation.\n  The time is now to straighten out the credit union challenge which \nwas posed by the Supreme Court decision. This legislation passed the \nHouse of Representatives in the beginning of April by a vote of 411 to \n8. The Senate Banking Committee, after holding two hearings on the \nissue, marked up the legislation on April 30 and reported it with \namendments to the full Senate by a vote of 16 to 2. Since April 30, we \nhave been looking for an opening on the Legislative Calendar in order \nto take the matter up in the Chamber, and the majority leader has \nprovided this opening.\n  If I could have the attention of the majority leader, I would like to \nask, it is my understanding the intention now is to do the opening \nstatements--I know that Senator Shelby and others have amendments--and \nbegin debate on the amendments, continue that on Monday afternoon \nbeginning at about 1 o'clock, and any votes that would transpire in \nrelationship to the amendments which have been offered would occur \nbeginning about 6 o'clock Monday evening?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we would have to \nbegin those votes a little earlier than that, probably at 5:30. It \nwould be partially driven by how many votes we have. If we just had one \nvote lined up, for instance, we could begin about 5:45. If we have two \nor three, we would have to begin at 5:30 in order to get the voting \nsequence completed by 6:30.\n  So that is what we are up against. We are trying to accommodate \nSenators coming in late and Senators who have to leave after 6:30. But \nthe hope is that you would have two or three amendments ready to be \nvoted on Monday afternoon beginning around 5:30, with the understanding \nthat if we need to hold that first vote a little while for Senators \ncoming in with a close plane connection, we would be prepared to do \nthat, and then have the vote probably on the Shelby amendment and final \npassage Tuesday morning at 9:30.\n  I discussed that with Senator Daschle, and he and I worked on trying \nto accommodate Senators' schedules on all sides. I believe, if you \ncould go ahead and get debate on all amendments today and Monday, then \nwe could have one or two or three votes Monday afternoon, sometime \nbetween 5:30 and 6, probably not later than 5:45, and then the last two \nvotes Tuesday morning.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, some people will be scrambling to \nbe here. I think if we didn't start before 5:45, or if we let that \nfirst vote run a little bit----\n  Mr. LOTT. A little bit, except Senators have to leave at 6:30, and I \nam one of them, and that is the schedule I am particularly interested \nin.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course, the Senator could make the beginning of the \nlast vote and leave.\n  Mr. LOTT. As long as I am out of here at 6:30, everything will be \nfine.\n  Once again, I know we have had to work late, but we have made good \nprogress on the appropriations bills. This is a good bill. But I still \nthink the Senate should work during the day and be home with their \nfamilies at night. That is a novel idea that I still advocate, so I am \ngoing to be with my wife eating supper Monday night at 7 o'clock. Good \nluck before then. But we will try to accommodate everybody, including \nmy favorite lady in the world.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I just want to underscore the intention is, and we have \nevery reasonable expectation that, we are going to be able to complete \nthis bill finally by Tuesday morning and do a good deal of it by Monday \nevening.\n  In addition to the broad bipartisan support for this legislation in \nthe Congress, it is strongly supported by the administration. Senator \nD'Amato has already placed in the Record a letter that Secretary Rubin, \nour very able Secretary of the Treasury, sent to the majority leader \nand to the minority leader urging expeditious Senate passage of the \nbill without any extraneous amendments. Of course, the amendments are \nthe important issue that we will be considering over the next few days.\n  President Clinton has personally indicated his support for this \nlegislation, urging the Senate to pass the bill without weighing it \ndown with extraneous and controversial amendments that would seriously \njeopardize the legislation. H.R. 1151 is also supported by a very \ndiverse range of groups in the community including the Consumer \nFederation of America, the Seniors Coalition, the National Farmers \nUnion, National Educational Association, Americans for Tax Reform, the \nAmerican Small Business Association, AFL-CIO, and the National Urban \nCoalition.\n  The broad support for this legislation suggests the important role \ncredit unions play in our economy. Since the founding of the first \ncredit union in the United States in 1909, almost a century ago, credit \nunions have served as a way for people of average means, without easy \naccess to credit, to pool their savings in order to make loans to \nfellow credit union members at competitive interest rates.\n  Mr. President, the impetus for H.R. 1151 came from a Supreme Court \ndecision earlier this year. In a 5 to 4 decision, the Court held that \nunder the Federal Credit Union Act a federally chartered credit union \nmay only have a single common bond of occupation. This overturned a \npolicy of the National Credit Union Administration, the regulators of \nthe credit unions, first adopted in 1982, which permitted multiple \ngroups each having a separate common bond to be part of a single \nFederal credit union.\n  The consequence of that Supreme Court decision is to prohibit the \nformation of multiple group credit unions. Even if the lower courts, in \nimplementing the Supreme Court decision, permit existing multiple group \ncredit unions to stay in business and to accept members from their \ncurrent groups, employees from the large majority of\n\n[[Page S8965]]\n\ncompanies in the United States will find their future opportunities to \nbecome a member of a Federal credit union seriously constrained by the \nSupreme Court's decision.\n  The National Credit Union Administration generally does not permit \ngroups with less than 500 employees to start a credit union because it \nis judged the group is not broad enough or numerous enough to support a \ncredit union in a safe and sound manner. The only way for employees of \nthese companies to join a credit union is if the companies affiliate \nwith existing credit unions. So, if new multiple bond credit unions are \nprohibited, this will no longer be possible and millions of Americans \nmay be denied the opportunity to join a credit union. This outcome is \nclearly undesirable, in my view, and is, of course, the basis for the \nbroad bipartisan support for enacting this legislation.\n  This legislation would first grandfather existing multiple group \ncredit unions and allow them to add members from their current groups. \nIn addition, it would permit Federal credit unions to have multiple \ngroups, each of which, after the first group, has a common bond of \noccupation or association and has less than 3,000 members. The bill \nwould also give the National Credit Union Administration the power to \nauthorize credit unions to add additional groups if it finds the groups \ncannot safely establish and operate a credit union on their own. The \nCredit Union Administration could also permit a Federal credit union to \nadd a person or organization located in a local community, \nneighborhood, or rural district that it has determined is underserved \nby other depository institutions.\n  But, in order for a Federal credit union to accept additional \nmembership groups, the NCUA would have to find that the credit union is \nadequately capitalized, has adequate managerial or financial resources, \nand has a satisfactory examination record. The legislation directs the \nCredit Union Administration to encourage the formation of separately \nchartered credit unions whenever practicable and consistent with safety \nand soundness.\n  In addition to addressing the membership issue, this legislation \nrequires significant new safety and soundness standards for Federal \ncredit unions. These new requirements are based on recommendations \ncontained in a carefully prepared study of credit unions by the \nTreasury Department conducted at the direction of the Congress and \nsubmitted last year.\n  Earlier, in legislation, the Congress directed the Treasury \nDepartment to study credit unions and to submit a report to the \nCongress. A good deal of what is contained in this legislation reflects \nthe outcome of that study.\n  The bill imposes, for the first time, statutory capital standards on \nFederal credit unions. The bill requires an insured credit union to \nhave a net worth ratio of 7 percent to be ``well capitalized'' and 6 \npercent to be ``adequately capitalized.'' A credit union with a net \nworth ratio of less than 6 percent would be ``undercapitalized,'' at 4 \npercent it would be ``significantly undercapitalized,'' and at 2 \npercent ``critically undercapitalized.'' The legislation provides a \nsystem of prompt corrective action which requires the National Credit \nUnion Administration to take a series of progressively more stringent \nmeasures if the credit union falls below the ``adequately capitalized'' \nlevel. Each insured credit union that is undercapitalized would be \nrequired to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan to the \nNCUA. Until that plan is approved, the credit union generally would not \nbe permitted to increase its average total assets. If an insured credit \nunion becomes critically undercapitalized according to the standards I \nmentioned earlier, the NCUA would be required to liquidate the credit \nunion, appoint a conservator, or take such other action as it \ndetermines could better achieve the purpose of protecting the credit \nunion insurance fund.\n  I have taken a few moments to dwell on these provisions because I \nthink they are quite important. They have generally not been involved \nin the debate that has led up to considering the measure on the floor, \nbut I think Members need to appreciate the very important safety and \nsoundness provisions contained in this legislation. This is a major \nstep in ensuring financial stability in the credit union industry. It \nhas led the Secretary of the Treasury, in the letter which he sent to \nthe leadership, to make this statement. I just want to quote this \nparagraph from Secretary Rubin's letter:\n\n       The bill's safety and soundness provisions would represent \n     the most significant legislative reform of credit union \n     safety and soundness safeguards since the creation of the \n     National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in 1970. The bill \n     would institute capital standards for all federally insured \n     credit unions, including a risk-based capital requirement for \n     complex credit unions. It would create a system of prompt \n     corrective action--specifically tailored to credit unions as \n     not-for-profit, member-owned cooperative. It would also take \n     a series of steps to make the Share Insurance Fund even \n     stronger and more resilient.\n       These reforms involve little cost or burden to credit \n     unions today, yet they could pay enormous dividends in more \n     difficult times.\n\n  We worked closely with the Treasury in considering the provisions \nthat were in the legislation. I think this is a major step forward. I \nreally commend this aspect of the legislation to my colleagues as they \nconsider the overall bill.\n  Furthermore, this bill imposes, for the first time, a limit on \ncommercial lending by credit unions. No such limit currently exists. \nThe bill provides that a credit union would be generally limited in its \nmember business loans to no more than the lesser of 1.75 times the \nminimum net worth required for well-capitalized credit unions--namely 7 \npercent--or 1.7 times its actual net worth. This would put a limit on \nmember business loans for a well-capitalized credit union at \napproximately 12.25 percent of its total loans. Loans of less than \n$50,000 would be excluded--that is an operating practice currently--and \nwe would continue to adhere to that.\n  Many credit unions are chartered for or have a history of making \nbusiness loans to their members. Members of a specialized vocation--\nfarmers, fishermen, taxi drivers and so forth--would not be subject to \nthis limit.\n  Furthermore, this legislation imposes, for the first time, a modest \nbut meaningful community obligation with respect to reinvestment in \ninsured credit unions, which has been carefully tailored to the \nmembership-based nature of credit unions. It would require the National \nCredit Union Administration to prescribe criteria for periodically \nreviewing the record of each insured credit union in providing \naffordable credit union services to all individuals of modest means, \nincluding low- and moderate-income individuals, within the field of \nmembership of the credit union, and provide for making such results \npublicly available.\n  The bill also directs the National Credit Union Administration, in \nevaluating any insured credit union under this requirement, to focus on \nthe actual performance of the credit union and not to impose burdensome \npaperwork or recordkeeping requirements. We think this is a modest but \nimportant step in paying attention to the needs of low- and moderate-\nincome individuals, and thereby making access to credit more broadly \navailable.\n  In conclusion, let me just say this is a very carefully developed and \nbalanced piece of legislation. As I said, the committee held two \nextensive hearings on the matter. It worked very carefully over the \nprovisions that have been included in the legislation and brought here \nbefore the Senate. This legislation seeks to make credit union \nmembership accessible while strengthening the safety and soundness of \nfederally insured credit unions and encourages them to meet the \nfinancial service needs of all of their members.\n  I strongly urge the support of this legislation by my colleagues. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to reject extraneous amendments that may be \noffered to the legislation that may complicate or jeopardize its \nenactment. We now need to move this legislation forward.\n  I think a very careful package has been put together here. The credit \nunion movement supports the legislation as reported by the committee. \nThe administration supports the legislation as reported by the \ncommittee. I respect, obviously, the motivation of my colleagues who \nintend to offer amendments, but I can only point out that those \namendments would greatly complicate our efforts to move this \nlegislation to final passage and signature into law by the President. I \nvery much hope my colleagues can back the work that\n\n[[Page S8966]]\n\nwas done by the committee in bringing this matter to the Senate floor.\n  I, again, thank Chairman D'Amato for his skillful work in developing \nthe legislation to this point and bringing it to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me add my voice to those who have \ncongratulated Senator D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes for this bill. I \nbelieve we have put together a good bill. I think it is a dramatic \nimprovement over the House bill. It does, for the first time, in an \neffective manner begin to look at capital requirements and safety and \nsoundness, and, in doing so, it will dramatically improve the quality \nand regulation of credit unions all over the country. I think those who \nare part of the credit union movement want people to know that their \ndeposits are safe, sound, insured, regulated and protected in the \nsavers' interest.\n  Second, the bill, for the first time, begins to put appropriate \nlimits on the amount of business loans that credit unions can make. \nThere are those who believe, and I happen to be one of them, that \ncredit unions were chartered to provide consumer credit to their \nmembers as part of a cooperative effort. A dramatic movement of credit \nunions into commercial lending would circumvent the whole intent of the \ncredit union movement, and in my opinion, it would be a negative factor \non the progress of the credit union movement. In this bill, we for the \nfirst time set limits on the amount of credit union assets that can go \ninto commercial loans. That is a very positive step.\n  We deal with the common bond issue, and we settle once and for all \nthe principle that every American ought to have the right to join a \ncredit union--not any credit union--but join a credit union within an \nappropriate field of membership. it my view, and I believe that we \nachieve this with this bill, that it should be possible for every \nAmerican citizen to find an appropriate field of membership by which he \nor she can associate with others, and have the opportunity to join a \ncredit union and to affiliate with that credit union if they choose to \ndo it.\n  Those are the positive things about this bill. I am a strong \nsupporter of the bill. I intend to vote for this bill, but there is one \nprovision in the bill to which I am very strongly opposed.\n  In this bill, for the first time ever, we begin to have the Federal \nGovernment direct credit unions as to how they will use their members' \nmoney. In this bill, for the first time ever, we begin the process of \ntelling credit unions that the government is going to allocate some of \na credit union's resources to promote a ``public purpose,'' even though \nit may not be the purpose of credit union members. I believe that not \nonly is this very bad and dangerous public policy, but I think the \nlogic of it is totally inapplicable to credit unions and the credit \nunion movement.\n  The name--it is a wonderful sounding name for a program that has \nnothing to do with any one word in the name--is Community Reinvestment \nAct. In this bill, for the first time ever, we apply in three different \nways this Federal mandate and credit allocation to credit unions.\n  Let me explain why, despite all the arguments you can make on the \nmerits or demerits of the Community Reinvestment Act, why it does not \nbelong on this bill.\n  Credit unions are voluntary, private associations. They are nonprofit \norganizations. They are tax-exempt organizations. They represent a \ncollective effort of members to pool their savings with a common \nobjective. They pool their savings and they lend to each other, the \nmembers of the credit union. In doing so, they perform a cooperative \ncredit function. In many cases, they provide credit that would not be \navailable, certainly at rates that would not be available, in many \ncases, to the consumer.\n  They are not in the business of promoting any broad, general \npurposes, such as the general welfare of the country or the community. \nThey are small, private associations that are organized for the purpose \nof promoting the welfare of their members. The whole purpose is to pool \nnickels, dimes and dollars to build a cash base that can be lent to \nmembers for things such as buying a new car or new truck, buying a new \ntractor.\n  The objective of the credit union is to promote the interest of \ncredit union members. It is not a for-profit organization, and there is \nno logic to applying to it a provision of law where the Government adds \nan additional mandate that the credit unions should direct the money of \nthose members to support some end other than the well-being of the \npeople who put up the money in the first place.\n  Let me explain how this works, and I want to read you some language--\nin my mind, shocking language--that has been included in this bill in \nthe House, and language that I believe should be removed.\n  In the bill, the House has set up this requirement for a Federal \nmandate and capital allocation that goes by the name of community \nreinvestment. I will talk in a moment as to why this provision has \nnothing to do with community or reinvestment.\n  This bill mandates that credit unions conform to this Federal capital \nallocation. Here is how it is defined, and here is basically how it \nworks:\n  In three different places, we have a reference to it in the bill. The \nfirst way that the bill would measure whether a credit union is \ncomplying with this Federal mandate allocating their members' hard-\nearned money is on page 58 in new section 215. In subsection (b), it is \nset out that credit unions have to comply with this community \nreinvestment, and that in doing so, they will be regularly evaluated by \nthe Federal Government, and their record will be looked at to see if \nthe credit union is ``providing''--I want you to remember, that is \n``ing''--``. . . providing affordable credit union services to all \nindividuals of modest means . . . within the field of membership of the \ncredit union. . . .''\n  In other words, in this section, the Federal Government will evaluate \nwhether or not this credit union, in making loans, in allocating the \nmoney of the people who have joined the credit union, is providing \naffordable services--and I don't know how you define ``affordable.'' I \nthink I know how you define ``providing;'' you test whether they are \nactually doing it, although I could imagine some very interesting and \nintrusive methods of testing that the regulators might conjure up. But \nthe test of ``providing'' can be a very rigorous test, since the \nstandard is not whether the credit union is offering its services, it \nis not whether they are trying to do it. They are required to do it. \nThey are to be ``providing''--you are evaluating whether they are ``. . \n. providing affordable credit union services to all individuals of \nmodest means . . . within the field of membership of the credit \nunion.''\n  You need to understand, field of membership and membership are two \ndifferent things. A credit union considers itself successful if it is \nable to get about 20 percent of the people who could join that credit \nunion to join it. So that in any field of membership, normally about 80 \npercent of the people in the field of membership who were invited to \njoin the credit union, who were invited to put up their money, said \n``No, I don't want to join your credit union; I don't want to put my \nmoney into your credit union.'' But the first provision of this bill \nrequires that the credit union, to comply with this law on Federally \nmandated capital allocation, must be ``. . . providing affordable''--\nand where are these terms defined? Nowhere--``credit union services to \nall individuals of modest means . . . within the field of membership.''\n  Now, I do not believe we ought to be forcing credit union members, \nwho put up their own money, to provide services to people that had an \nopportunity to join the credit union but decided not to join it. I \nthink that violates the whole spirit of the credit union movement \nbecause a credit union is a cooperative, and if you want credit union \nservices, you join the credit union. You participate in putting up the \ncapital and you apply for loans or services from the credit union.\n  The second evaluation has to do with community credit unions. And \nthose are credit unions that serve an entire community. This second \nprovision requires that credit unions are ``meeting''--not trying to \nmeet--and please note, the law does not say that you ``offer'' \nservices, that you offer ``affordable'' services, whatever that means, \nto\n\n[[Page S8967]]\n\nall people of modest means within your field of membership. The law \nrequires that you ``provide'' it.\n  Now, the second reference is, that you are ``meeting the credit needs \nand credit union service needs of the entire field of membership of the \ncredit union.'' That is on page 59--``the entire field of membership. * \n* *''\n  So again, you are in a community. This little credit union is \nproviding services to people in a town with 5,000 people; roughly 20 \npercent of those people have joined the credit union. But this law \nrequires that they provide ``affordable'' services--whatever that \nmeans--to people who did not even join the credit union. How can that \nbe right? Clearly, in my opinion, it cannot be right.\n  Now, the third case, very similar to the first, except the language \ngets even more grandiose. Imagine writing a Federal law where you can \nthreaten the deposit insurance of a credit union and put it completely \nout of business. If it does not have Federal deposit insurance, it is \nnot going to be able to operate. This law applies to both Federal \ncredit unions and State credit unions, as long as they receive Federal \ndeposit insurance.\n  Listen to this language. You have regulation to see if the credit \nunion is ``satisfactorily''--satisfactorily, mind you--``providing,'' \n``affordable''--I do not know how you define these terms. I have \ndiscussed ``providing.'' The credit union is actually doing it. It is \nnot ``offering'' services; it is ``providing'' them, services are being \naccepted and received, not just offered. ``Satisfactorily'' is an \nundefined term, satisfactory to whom? ``Affordable'' is undefined and \nundefinable --that the ``credit union is satisfactorily providing \naffordable credit union services to all individuals of modest means \nwithin the field of membership of the credit union,'' whether or not \nthey join the credit union in the first place.\n  Mr. President, this provision does not belong in this bill. This \nprovision is piracy. This provision came about because we have a crisis \nin the credit union movement because of the court ruling, a crisis \nwhich requires congressional action. And what those in the House, who \nput this provision in the bill, have, in essence, said is, that in \norder to resolve your crisis, you have to pay tribute. And the tribute \nyou have to pay is that we are writing a provision of law which says \nthat every year you will be evaluated by a group of Federal bureaucrats \nwho will determine whether you are satisfactorily providing affordable \ncredit union services to people who are not even members of the credit \nunion. And then they will publish their findings.\n  Now, what does this produce? What this produces is a situation where \nyou literally--I am going to use some strong language here; and I mean \nevery word of it--this produces a situation where literally you have \nprofessional protesters who extort resources from banks, and if this \nbill passes unchanged, they will be extorting resources from credit \nunions. Here is how it works. And I am going to give you some examples. \nAnd you are going to be shocked by these examples.\n  What happens is that periodically you have this evaluation that is \nmade public, and whether or not the evaluation is satisfactory, you \nhave a group of people who show up from various organizations to tell \nyou how to use your resource for their benefit. ACORN is very active in \nthis effort, and there are many other organizations, it is a growing \nindustry--they show up at the bank and they say, ``You're not meeting \nyour CRA requirements. And here are some things we want you to do. And \nif you'll do these things, then we will say that you're meeting these \nrequirements, and we will stop protesting for now.''\n  It works like this. You have a bank who may have a perfect record on \nCRA requirements, but they want to merge with another bank. Even though \nthey may have never had anything other than an exemplary rating, \nprotesters can enter the process and challenge the merger on the \ngrounds of community reinvestment and cost the banks millions of \ndollars because of the delays that their protests cause.\n  Now, let me give you two examples of where this has occurred.\n  The first I will refer to happened in 1989 in California. And let me \nsay, Mr. President, it is hard to get banks to talk about this. I \nrecently spoke to the CEO of a major Fortune 500 company, and I \nmentioned to him an effort I am supporting, an effort Senator Shelby is \nundertaking to provide CRA relief for small community banks. When I \nmentioned CRA, he said, ``It's extortion.'' If I called him up and \nasked, ``Could I use your name?'' how many people who are being \nextorted want their name used? They do not. They are afraid to have \ntheir name used. When a CEO of a Fortune 500 company in America is \nafraid to say his mind publicly, to expose extortion, something is \nwrong in America.\n  Now, let me give you my examples and offer my amendment, and then we \nwill debate this again on Monday.\n  In 1989, California First Bank wanted to merge with Union Bank. But \nwhen they sought to merge, opposition was lodged under the CRA \nprovisions of banking law, and in order for these protests to be \nwithdrawn so that delays could be ended and the merger could go \nforward, here is what California First Bank agreed to: One, to increase \npurchases from women and minority-owned vendors to 20 percent of \npurchases within the next 5 years. Second, they agreed to give \ncharitable contributions, cash grants, not loans, in the amount of 1.4 \npercent of income in 1989 and 1.5 percent of income in 1990.\n  Now, I do not know this, but if I were a U.S. attorney in that \ndistrict, I would go look and see if they gave those contributions to \nthe groups that protested the merger. That would be a very interesting \ninquiry.\n  Next, California First Bank committed that 60 percent of the \nemployees placed in middle and senior management positions within the \nnext 5 years would be minorities and women. And finally, they committed \nto appoint three minority and women directors.\n  That is what they had to do in order to get the right to merge with \nanother bank. Now, listen to this next one.\n  Sumitomo Bank of California--now I do not know, but I guess that \nSumitomo Bank is a Japanese affiliate. I think it is relevant because I \nwant you to put yourself in this position. Let us assume that an Ohio \nbank had opened an affiliate in the Dominican Republic and that some \ngovernment agency there had said that, ``You are not meeting your CRA \nrequirements.'' And then they published that, and then a group of \npeople came to the bank and said, ``We want you to do some things so \nthat we then will tell the government that you are meeting these \nrequirements.'' Let's see what the things were that our Government in \neffect forced this bank to do. Let me read to you what they did.\n\n  No. 1, $500 million was committed to CRA-related loans. No. 2, the \nbank committed to spend 2 percent of income on charity, nonprofit \norganizations, with two-thirds of the money going to inner-city \ndevelopment, this being cash, grant money. No. 3, the bank committed to \nappoint minority board members. No. 4, the bank agreed to appoint a \npaid five-member minority advisory board to consult with management. \nAnd, No. 5, the bank agreed to give 20 to 25 percent of outside \ncontracts to minority-owned vendors.\n  Now if that happened to an Ohio bank operating in the Dominican \nRepublic, what would you call it? I would call it extortion. That is \nwhat I would call it. I would call it extortion, or maybe even \nexpropriation, a taking of private property.\n  Now, how does something like that happen? How it happens is that we \nlet people write into law provisions like ``satisfactorily providing \naffordable services,'' which no one can define, nobody knows what it \nmeans, and if you have to comply--a regulator that is willing to let \nprotest groups file objections to banks merging, for example, by simply \nthe ability to hold that merger up--they are able to extort resources.\n  Now, I could go on for quite a while and add to the list. For \nexample, when Bank One wanted to merge with First Chicago. But what do \nyou think happened when they filed that merger? What happened was, they \nhad a group of protesters who showed up, who filed a boilerplate \nobjection which could be drawn up in 15 minutes by any lawyer who deals \nin this area. I am sure the bank president said, ``Well, we have an \nexemplary CRA record.'' The protestors said, ``We have objected to your \nmerger.''\n\n[[Page S8968]]\n\n  So weeks go by, time goes by, and this is the Woodstock Institute \nthat objected in Chicago--I better be careful to get the name right--\nyes, in Chicago, the Woodstock Institute objected. So what happens in \nsuch cases? The bank ends up allocating the resources of its \nstockholders in order to eliminate the objection just to be able to \nmove forward with its business.\n  Now, let me read a quote to just show the arrogance of these people \nwho we are empowering under these laws. Forgive me if I get a little \nexcited about it, but it is the kind of practice I hate worst. This \ncomes from the proposed merger of NationsBank and Bank of America. They \nhave received outstanding CRA grades, but in spite of their \nunprecedented $350 billion CRA packages of loans and services to inner \ncities, et cetera, CRA activists are raising protests against the \nmerger. One of the activist leaders has said the following--remember, \nthis is about banks that have exemplary CRA records, at least according \nto the Government regulators who regulate this activity. These banks \nhave exemplary records. But here is what the protester said, ``We will \nclose down their branches and ensure they fail in California.'' That is \nwhat they said. ``We will close down their branches and ensure they \nfail in California. This is going to be a street fight and we're \nprepared to engage in it.''\n  Do you know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of a little \nimmigrant storeowner. He and his wife and three children are running a \nlittle store, and these great big hoods come knock on his door. They \ncome in and say, ``Somebody could do you some harm. There might be \npeople who could come and break in your store, steal your goods. They \nmight beat you up; they might break your arm. But I will tell you what \nwe will do. If you will pay us 5 percent of what you earn in this \nstore, we will see that nobody comes and breaks your arm.''\n  That is what this reminds me of. That is exactly what this reminds me \nof.\n  Now, I don't like the fact that it is going on. Some day I will get \nrid of it. Some day this is going to be gone. I intend to speak out on \nthis for so long with such great passion that in good time Congress is \nultimately going to rise up and stop this. That is not likely to happen \nhere today, but some day it will happen.\n  What I don't want to do is, I don't want to start this business with \ncredit unions. Now, I am sure that we are going to hear from someone \nwho will say credit unions don't support this amendment. Well, the \ncredit unions have been told, ``You support the Gramm amendment, and \nmaybe your bill won't get passed. You support this amendment, and maybe \nthe President won't sign your bill. You support this amendment, and \nmaybe it will mean endless delays.'' Now, that is like saying to \nsomeone sticking a gun to your temple, saying, ``You feel good about \nthings, don't you?''\n  We will vote on this amendment on Monday afternoon.\n  I don't want credit unions to have to be evaluated on whether or not \nthey are providing satisfactory, affordable services to people who \ndidn't even join the credit union.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3336\n\n(Purpose: To strike provisions requiring credit unions to use the funds \n  of credit union members to serve persons not members of the credit \n                                 union)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as a result of not wanting that to happen, \nI send this amendment to the desk to strike these provisions, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3336.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 204 of the bill and renumber the sections \n     accordingly, and beginning on page 45, line 24, strike all \n     through page 46, line 4, and redesignate subparagraph (E) and \n     (F) on page 46 as subparagraphs (D) and (E), respectively.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is my understanding this will be the \nfirst vote we have on Monday. It is also my understanding that there \nwill probably be an hour set aside so each side will have 30 minutes to \ndebate the amendment. Rather than stay around today and debate it, I \nwill use my 30 minutes on Monday.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. This is an important \namendment. We ought not to add these onerous CRA provisions to credit \nunions, which are investor owned, which are set up as cooperatives to \nserve the people who are members.\n  Imagine, for example, in New York, where you have a credit union that \nwas set up so cabdrivers could save their money and lend it to one \nanother, and the loans, then, would be made to buy a Medallion so \nsomebody could own their own cab.\n  Now, with CRA, the Federal Government comes in and says, ``Hey, how \nmany loans have you made to people who aren't members of your credit \nunion who could have been--they are in your field of membership, but \nthey didn't choose to join your credit union; how many Medallions have \nyou helped them buy?''\n  So Joe Brown, who put money into the credit union for 15 years, \nfinally gets to the point where he thinks he can buy his Medallion, but \nbecause of this provision, the credit union has to take Joe's money and \nlend it to somebody who never joined the credit union, never wanted to \nbe in the credit union.\n  If you can defend that, good luck.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to address the overall issue of \nthe legislation before the Senate, H.R. 1151.\n  I want, first, to commend Chairman D'Amato and the ranking member, \nSenator Sarbanes, for their help in this legislation getting to the \nfloor in a timely fashion.\n  I will not address the issue raised by my colleague from Texas. I \nknow there are others who will want to talk about that at much greater \nlength.\n  There is an underlying legitimate debate there about whether an \nindustry that benefits from Federal insurance, Federal regulation \nassuring that industry's stability and long-term viability, should, in \nturn, have to commit itself to making investments back into its own \ncommunity or not. That debate can go forward. But I want to talk \nbriefly about the underlying bill.\n  As we all, I think, understand, following the Supreme Court's \ndecision earlier this year, the credit union membership of some 20 \nmillion credit union members all across America has been in some \njeopardy. There was initially legislation offered in the other body \nthat was designed simply to overturn the Supreme Court decision. The \nother body chose not to do that. Nevertheless, they did reach a \ncompromise bill that passed in April on an overwhelmingly vote of 411-\n8.\n  Following that debate, and passage of that legislation, the Senate \nBanking Committee took up our version of credit union legislation, with \nthe understanding that prompt action was in fact needed. But again, \nrather than simply choosing to overturn the Supreme Court decision and \nrather than simply choosing to pass the legislation passed in the \nHouse, the Senate Banking Committee crafted its own version, \nstrengthening significantly the language of that original H.R. 1151.\n  Now, there is a compromise involved here. Most Members in this body, \nand many Americans, are members of both credit unions and banks. It is \nimportant that they both be viable, strong contributors to our national \neconomy. It has always been--and it is the nature of compromises--that \nsome will go away not entirely satisfied, but, on the other hand, we \ncan reach that balance that will allow both the banking and credit \nunion industries to go forward in a fair and competitive fashion. That \ncertainly, at least, is the goal of this legislation.\n  So in the course of crafting this bill, we were able to arrive at \nbipartisan agreements on the level of restraint on expansion of credit \nunions that ought to be put into legislative language. There are some \nwho would rather have no restraint whatsoever; others would rather have \nmuch greater restraint on what definition of ``common bond'' is used. \nWe did reach a level of restraint in our legislation that, for the \nfirst time, now exists. I think perhaps, most\n\n[[Page S8969]]\n\nimportantly, the Senate Banking Committee adopted the Treasury \nDepartment's recommendations on safety and soundness.\n  I think one of the greatest concerns all of us have had in this body \nis to make sure that if we are going to have an industry that is \ngrowing and prosperous, that it have underlying regulatory safety and \nsoundness provisions that are really necessary for its long-term \nviability and for the confidence of the American consumers--not to \nmention the confidence the taxpayers ought to be able to have that they \nwill not be called upon at some future time to bail out an industry \nthat may have failed for lack of adequate safety and soundness \nprovisions. I think one of the most important parts of the Senate \nresponse to the crisis that we have faced this year is stronger safety \nand soundness provisions and the adoption of the Treasury's \nrecommendations.\n  The committee also took up the issue of restraint on commercial \nlending--or member business loans, as they are sometimes referred to--\nwhich now, for the first time, is in place. Again, there are those who \nwould have much more severe restrictions and those who would have no \nrestrictions and ask why any restrictions ought to exist over and above \nour safety and soundness standards. But this compromise was reached, \nand I think it is one that is supported by the credit union industry \nand is supported by the consumer groups as well. And the Senate \ncommittee chose to retain language on CRA--or ``CRA-light'' as it is \nsometimes referred to--that was instituted by the other body when they \ntook up H.R. 1151.\n  Again, there are those who would like to see a much more rigorous, \naggressive approach to CRA taken, and there are those who are simply \nphilosophically disinclined to support any kind of CRA, even though \nthis ``light'' version is simply a direction to the regulator of credit \nunions to come up with some assurance that, in fact, credit unions are \ninvesting in their local communities, which certainly has always been \nthe case, although now there are larger credit unions with billions of \ndollars of capital, and some question is raised there. In any event, \nthis is a provision that is accepted by the industry.\n  We need a strong banking industry and we need a strong credit union \nindustry. They both have legitimate, important roles to play in the \nprovision of credit across America. In my State of South Dakota, with \nsome 700,000 citizens, almost 200,000 of them belong to credit unions. \nWe have historically a long track record of utilization of cooperative \nventures, whether it is our rural electric, telephone co-ops, or other \nagricultural cooperatives across the State. We have that long \ntradition, one that has contributed significantly to affording more \noptions, a greater level of economic prosperity, to a great number of \npeople across rural America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of \nthis legislation from the National Farmers Union and a letter from the \nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Farmers Union,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 1998.\n     Re Credit Union Membership Access Act.\n\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     Member of the U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: I am writing on behalf of the 300,000 \n     members of the National Farmers Union (NFU) to urge you to \n     support H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act, \n     which will restore an open field of membership to credit \n     unions. In addition, we urge you to oppose the Hagel-Bennett \n     amendment which would make it more difficult for farmers and \n     ranchers to obtain loans from their credit unions.\n       Farmers, ranchers, and rural citizens around the country \n     are facing tough times right now due to low commodity prices. \n     The Hagel-Bennett amendment would unnecessarily restrict \n     credit unions from making loans to their members for business \n     purposes, and will worsen the difficult situation farmers, \n     ranchers and rural citizens now face.\n       During our 95th annual convention, NFU members affirmed \n     their support for credit unions: ``We are unalterably opposed \n     to any proposal that seeks to curtail services by credit \n     unions to their members under the false guise of regulatory \n     reform or financial soundness. Such proposals are especially \n     discriminatory against rural credit unions which provide \n     agricultural credit services. We pledge our support to the \n     credit union movement in its efforts to combat the anti-\n     competitive regulatory tactics undertaken by other segments \n     of the financial services industry.''\n       We urge you to pass this important legislation, without \n     adoption of the Hagel amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Leland Swenson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Rural Electric\n\n\n                                      Cooperative Association,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 15, 1998.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: On behalf of the over 30 million \n     Americans who currently receive electricity from rural \n     electric cooperatives, we strongly urge you to vote in favor \n     of H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Act, without any \n     amendments.\n       It is vitally important that certainty be brought to the \n     nation's credit unions and their members. For many Americans \n     credit unions are their only source for affordable banking \n     and credit services.\n       H.R. 1151 represents an excellent balance among the \n     competing financial interests and deserves to be enacted \n     before the August recess. The House passed this measure by an \n     overwhelming majority of 411-8 and the Senate Banking \n     Committee reported the bill out in a 16-2 vote.\n       H.R. 1151 has broad bipartisan and constituent support. \n     Please pass this legislation.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Glenn English,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Scott \nSwanjord, a staff member of mine, may have floor privileges during this \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, we have minimal time remaining in this \n105th Congress. The schedule is full. We have virtually the entire \nbudget still to do, and other key issues are facing us. Frankly, we \ncannot afford to have this legislation held up with vetoes, veto \nthreats, with ongoing, never-ending negotiations. So I think it is very \nimportant that we move forward with this legislation.\n  A veto threat has been issued by the White House. If the CRA \nprovisions are taken out--the ``CRA-light'' provisions--we will lose \nour bipartisanship, and it is a provision that is supported by the \nindustry itself. It would appear to me that we need to move forward \nexpeditiously with this legislation. We will be taking up bank \nregulatory relief legislation later on this coming week perhaps. There \nwill be other vehicles in which to debate some of these extraneous \nmatters dealing with the banking industry and, peripherally, the credit \nunion industry. But I think it would be a mistake for us to be caught \nup in too many side issues on the underlying bill here.\n  There is an absolute urgency that we move this bill forward. If we do \nnot, the membership of some 20 million Americans will, in fact, be in \nvery real and very great jeopardy. So with the legislation that passed \n411-8 in the House, passed the Senate Banking Committee by a 16-2 vote, \nit would be my hope that this coming week we could conclude debate on \nthis bill, obviously, with the adequate consideration of well-intended \namendments, hopefully limited in number, but then get this bill in its \ncurrent form onto the President's desk for signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, something was said just a minute ago about \nthe threat of a veto by the President. I have heard this a lot on \ndifferent bills. But I know the process should work. Especially when \nyou have a principle that you believe in and that you know is right, \nyou should not step aside because someone intimates that they might \nveto it. That is part of the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, having said that, later in the debate--probably Monday \nwhen we get back--I will be offering an amendment to the bill dealing \nwith the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. My proposed amendment \nwould authorize a small bank exemption from the Government-mandated \ncredit requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act, which Senator \nGramm from Texas so eloquently talked about earlier this morning. \nCommunity banks, as you well know, as a Senator and present Presiding \nOfficer, by their\n\n[[Page S8970]]\n\nvery nature, serve the needs of their community.\n  They do not need a burdensome, government mandate to force them to \nallocate credit or originate profitable loans. Make no mistake about \nit. Community banks would not exist very long if they didn't take care \nof the whole community; and they do.\n  Since H.R. 1151 increases the competitive advantage credit unions \nhave over banks, we feel this amendment is necessary to reduce the \ninequities in this area and allow our small community banks to better \nmeet the needs of consumers.\n  Nine members of the Banking Committee sponsored a small bank \nexemption amendment to H.R. 1151 in the committee markup. The amendment \nresulted in a tie vote of nine to nine. The nine members of the \ncommittee that supported the amendment felt so strongly about the small \nbank exemption, that all nine members signed a statement of additional \nviews to the committee report, which is unusual.\n  Let me say from the start, CRA is a tax on community banks, CRA \nraises the costs of inputs to banks by increasing their regulatory \nburden and compliance costs. In addition, CRA forces banks to make \nloans according to a federal quota, increasing the risks, and therefore \nthe costs, of borrowing to consumers. Make no mistake about it, the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act raises the cost of borrowing through higher \nloan rates and punishes savers in the form of lower savings rates. \nCongress I believe should adopt policies that lowers the cost of \nborrowing, and my amendment would do that.\n  I would also point out that the federal government does not know the \ndemand for loans any better than the local banker. CRA preempts the \nfree market lending criteria of community banks and imposes the \njudgment of federal bureaucrats. CRA is government mandated credit \nallocation, the form of credit allocation that has proven disastrous \nmost recently in east Asia. We have an opportunity to reduce the scope \nof government mandated credit allocation with this amendment, and I \nurge my colleagues to do so.\n  I want to revisit, and give a little history contextually.\n\n\n                                history\n\n  When the Community Reinvestment Act was introduced in 1977, the \nbill's chief sponsor and chairman of the Banking Committee, William \nProxmire stated:\n\n       The authority to operate new deposit facilities is given \n     away, free, to successful applicants even though the \n     authority conveys a substantial economic benefit to the \n     applicant. Those who obtain new deposit facilities receive a \n     semi-exclusive franchise to do business in a particular \n     geographic area. The Government limits the entry of other \n     potential competitors into that area if such entry would \n     unduly jeopardize existing financial institutions. The \n     Government also restricts competition and the cost of money \n     to the bank by limiting the rate of interest payable on \n     savings deposits and prohibiting any interest on demand \n     deposits.\n\n  Senator Proxmire later said:\n\n       The regulators have thus conferred substantial economic \n     benefits on private institutions without extracting any \n     meaningful quid pro quo for the public.\n\n\n                                 review\n\n  The central premise on which Senator Proxmire bases his justification \nfor ``extracting any meaningful quid pro quo'' may have existed in \n1977, but absolutely does not exist today. Taken one at a time, each \nand every claim Senator Proxmire used to justify CRA in 1977 is no \nlonger applicable today. Let us go through them one at a time:\n  Chartered institutions ``receive a semi-exclusive franchise to do \nbusiness in a particular geographic area.''\n  Congress passed the Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching \nEfficiency Act of 1994, which allowed one bank to acquire another bank \nin any other state, thus subjecting small community banks to the \ncompetition of acquisition hungry megabanks.\n  Senator Proxmire also said:\n  ``Government limits the entry of other potential competitors.''\n  That was in 1977.\n  Clearly this is not the case. The underlying bill, H.R. 1151 does not \nlimit, but dramatically increases the entry of potential competitors.\n  The bill essentially says that credit unions can serve every group in \na community--making them the same as community banks.\n  Senator Proxmire said in 1977 regarding CRA justification:\n  ``Government also restricts competition and the cost of money to the \nbank by limiting the rate of interest payable on savings deposits and \nprohibiting any interest on demand deposits.''\n  This is no longer true.\n  The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of \n1980 phased out the interest rate ceilings on savings deposits and \nintroduced Negotiable Orders of Withdrawals (NOW Accounts) that allowed \nthe payment of interest on demand deposits to consumers.\n\n\n                   Proxmire Premise no longer exists\n\n  Twenty-one years later, the ``substantial economic benefit'' to which \nSenator Proxmire refers no longer exists. Since the benefit no longer \nexists, neither should the Government mandate of credit allocation. \nCongress should lift this mandate off small community banks.\n\n\n                           Regulatory Burden\n\n  According to a recent Federal Reserve study, entitled, ``The Cost of \nBanking Regulation: A Review of the Evidence,'' regulatory costs \naccount for up to ``13 percent of noninterest expenses'' of banks. That \nis a lot of money. In addition, the study concluded that ``(A)verage \ncompliance costs for regulations are substantially greater for banks at \nlow levels of output''--in other words, smaller banks--``than for banks \nat moderate or high levels of output''--or larger banks.\n  This regulatory burden is borne out in the efficiency rate of banks. \nAs you can see by the chart, small banks are less efficient than large \nbanks.\n  Banks with less than $250 million in assets have an efficiency ratio \nof 63 percent versus that of large banks over $250 million with an \nefficiency ratio of 60.5 percent. These inefficiencies translate into a \nlower return on equity for small banks. Large banks have a return on \nequity of 14.4 percent versus 11.3 percent for small banks. This means \nthe average large bank has a return on equity 27 percent greater than \nsmall banks.\n\n\n                        Exemption of Bank Assets\n\n  Contrary to what opponents of the amendment would have you believe, \nthe small bank exemption would not ``gut'' CRA.\n  Banks with less than $250 million in assets account for less than 12 \npercent of bank assets nationwide. Thus, 88 percent of bank assets are \nconcentrated in banks with over $250 million in assets and would still \nbe subject to CRA, assuming that the Shelby amendment is adopted.\n  I have a chart that will help put that into perspective for my \ncolleagues. Although there are 8,110 small banks below $250 million in \nassets, those banks account for only $593 billion in combined assets. \nThat means small banks account for 11.7 percent of bank assets \nnationwide.\n  However, one bank--BankAmerica, the new bank resulting from the \nmerger of NationsBank and BankAmerica--possesses assets of $570 billion \nor 11.3 percent of total bank assets. Thus, one financial giant holds \nassets nearly as big as that of all 8,110 small banks across America. \nThat begs the question, why do we have to burden 8,110 small community \nbanks that only account for such a small portion of CRA monies? The \nvast majority of bank assets are concentrated in the large, billion \ndollar megabanks that can more easily shoulder the burden.\n\n\n                     small banks serve communities\n\n  Small community banks have an excellent record of serving their \ncommunities. Since over half of all banks and thrifts below $250 \nmillion have only one or two branches, they really have no other place \nto go but to their community to do business. Of the 8,970 small banks \nand thrifts, only nine--.1 percent--received a ``substantial \nnoncompliance'' CRA rating in 1997. In addition, small banks have a \nbetter record with regard to the most common type of community-based \nlending--real estate lending.\n  Banks under $250 million had a real estate lending to assets ratio of \n37 percent in 1997 versus 23.9 percent for large banks over $250 \nmillion.\n\n\n                           fair lending laws\n\n  The small bank exemption from CRA is not about discrimination. The \nfollowing fair lending laws will still apply, including: The Fair \nHousing Act of 1968 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of \nrace, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status\n\n[[Page S8971]]\n\nand handicap in all aspects of the housing industry; the Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act of 1974 which prohibits creditors from discrimination \nbased on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, \nage, or receipt of public assistance; and the Home Mortgage Disclosure \nAct of 1975 which requires banks to keep current records of its \nmortgage lending activity.\n  Any assertion that small banks do not serve their communities rings \nhollow. Small banks must serve their communities if they want to \nsurvive. Any claim of discrimination also rings hollow given the fair \nlending laws that apply to all lenders.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the Community Reinvestment Act was \nintroduced in 1977 by Senator Proxmire under the premise that banks \nreceive a ``substantial economic benefit.'' That benefit does not apply \ntoday as we enter the 21st century.\n  The small bank exemption from CRA would go a long way in helping \nreduce the costs and risks of mandated credit allocation. CRA is not \nonly a bad law for banks, but it is also a bad law for consumers. CRA \nforces banks to underwrite risky loans because they find that \npreferable to being terrorized and vandalized by so-called community \ngroups that extort money from banks. As a result, consumers around this \ncountry are being forced to subsidize this terrorist activity in the \nform of higher loan rates, lower savings rates and a lower return on \nequity.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this very important \namendment on behalf of the small community banks around America but, \nmore importantly, every bank customer who walks in to get a loan and is \nforced to subsidize this government mandated credit allocation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield me \njust 2 minutes without losing her right to the floor?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Certainly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alabama leaves \nthe floor--because this is going to turn into a very interesting \ndebate, and I want to make clear the parameters of it, obviously--he \nsent out a letter quoting Senator Proxmire. I am sure he is a good \nformer trial lawyer, and he would anticipate that we would go and read \nall of the Proxmire statement from which he was making selections which \nwere reflected on the chart that he just showed us.\n  Now, from that Proxmire statement, the very one containing these \nselections which the Senator says is his rationale for supporting the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, and from which the Senator allegedly shows \nthat the rationale no longer applies--although I disagree with even \nthat assertion--let me read to you. I will read the next sentence, \nwhich didn't appear on the Senator's chart, I regret to say.\n  Mr. SHELBY. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me make the point, and then I would be happy to \nyield.\n  The next sentence said:\n\n       The Government provides deposit insurance through the FDIC \n     and the FSLIC with a financial backup from the U.S. Treasury.\n\n  ``The Government provides deposit insurance through the FDIC and the \nFSLIC with a financial backup from the U.S. Treasury.''\n  That wasn't quoted as a rationale why it is reasonable to expect \nfinancial institutions to look after the needs of their community--\nbecause they are getting a very important Government support in the \ndeposit insurance.\n  Now, Senator Proxmire made the statement in 1977. To prove his \nstatement, in the 1980s, and to underscore the meaningfulness of the \npublic benefits provided to federally insured financial institutions \nduring the S crisis, the GAO report says that ``the direct and \nindirect cost to the United States taxpayers of resolving the savings \nand loan crisis, namely delivering on this insurance which is provided \nto them, was $132 billion--$132 billion--``and that does not include \nthe interest expenses associated with financing the direct costs of the \ncrisis which would drive the figure even higher.''\n  So, please, with all respect to the former chairman of the Senate \nBanking Committee, if we are going to start doing selections out of his \nstatements, certainly we should include what I regard as the most \nimportant single rationale that he put there:\n\n       The Government provides deposit insurance through the FDIC \n     and the FSLIC with a financial backup from the U.S. Treasury.\n\n  Now, that comes right out of the Congressional Record of January 24, \n1977, which is what the Senator said in the letter he sent to Members \nhe was quoting from. But, unfortunately, for the purposes of clarity in \ndebate, that provision was not cited. Of course, that is the very \nprovision that became applicable in the 1980s when we had the S \ncrisis, and we delivered to the tune of $132 billion in order to honor \nthe deposit insurance requirements. Obviously, without the deposit \ninsurance requirements, you wouldn't have these industries. They are \nabsolutely dependent on them to provide a basic level of financial \nstability and consumer confidence.\n\n  So I appreciate the Senator yielding, but I thought it was important \nto get that on the Record at this point, although we will bring it up \nagain in the debate later on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland \nfor shedding light on this debate, because I think it is very important \nthat this debate be put in context and that the whole story be told. \nThe truth is that this debate, reduced to its essentials, really does \nrelate to a fundamental philosophical difference. Either you are for \nthe politics of conflict and anger and ``I got mine, too bad for you,'' \nor you understand and appreciate the value of a politics based on \ncooperation, on finding common ground, and in recognizing that, as \nAmericans, we are all in this together.\n  The fact of the matter is, the CRA is not extortion, as, apparently, \nit was called on this floor this morning. It is a perfect example of \ncoming up with a construct that allows financial service institutions \nto do good while doing well. I think it is very important for the \nlistening public to understand that this gives money away to no one. \nThese institutions are not giving away money. They are not losing \nmoney. They get back every cent. In fact, the loss ratio, to the extent \nthat we have studies on this, the loss ratio for banks doing business \nunder the Community Reinvestment Act is no different. Banks have done \nno more poorly while under CRA. The Community Reinvestment Act simply \nprovides access to capital for underserved communities. There are those \nof us who think that is a good thing for America, that that helps \neverybody, that everybody benefits when we do not have whole sectors of \nour country, rural areas, inner-city areas--when we don't have whole \nsectors of our country cut off from capital flows.\n  I was going to rise in opposition specifically to the amendment by \nthe Senator from Alabama to this credit union bill. But, really, my \nremarks have to be directed, I think, at both of the pending \namendments, both the amendment of the Senator from Alabama, as well as \nthe amendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  Before I speak specifically on the amendment, however, I think it is \nimportant to say what a strong supporter I am of the underlying bill, \nH.R. 1151. I commend and congratulate the Senator from New York as well \nas the Senator from Maryland for their very good work in resolving the \nissues that are reflected by the Credit Union Membership Access Act, \nwhich was reported out of our Banking Committee by a vote of 16 to 2. \nThe fact is this, the underlying legislation, responds to a ruling by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court that, frankly, terrified a number of people that \nthey would lose their ability to participate in credit unions. \nCertainly this legislation will put an end to those fears.\n  I believe credit unions play such an important role in the panoply of \nfinancial institutions in our country precisely because we have to have \nways to make certain that ordinary citizens will be able to access \ncredit and capital, will have someone they can put a face on, who is in \nthe neighborhood,\n\n[[Page S8972]]\n\nwho is part and parcel of the community. Those values, associated with \nfinancial institutions, is just as important for our country as making \ncertain that our big banks and our big institutions can compete \ninternationally. We have to do both. We have to have the focus and the \nattention paid to Main Street, to little towns and communities, to \nparents who want to send their kids to college, to somebody who wants \nto borrow for a car, somebody who wants to borrow for a house or \nwhatever their immediate needs are. We have to have those kinds of \nopportunities in our system of financial institutions or financial \nservices, as well as the big banks and the institutions capable of \ncompeting with the European and other industrialized nation's banks \nthat can aggregate huge amounts of capital.\n  So I think making certain the credit unions are strong and secure and \nable to provide access to capital and credit for citizens is a very, \nvery important thing, and, again, I strongly support the effort by the \nSenator from New York and the Senator from Maryland in hammering out \nthe basis of H.R. 1151, and I support it.\n  Having said that, I want to talk specifically about the amendment of \nthe Senator from Alabama as well as, more generally, about the \nconversation from the Senator from Texas. I sat here, frankly, when my \nblood wasn't boiling over some of the conversation--actually the \nSenator from Alabama has a more soothing tone so he doesn't get your \nblood up as much as might otherwise happen. But it occurred to me it \nwas really important in this debate to tell the listening audience and \nthe general public what actually is going on here, because so much \ninformation has been left out of the conversation so far.\n  In the first instance, it is important to understand what the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act is not. Let's start there. CRA is not ``fair \nlending.'' It has nothing to do with race as a specific thing. It is \nnot that. It has to do with geographic distribution of capital, so it \nrelates to communities more than anything else, not so much to \nindividuals. That is important to keep in mind as we talk about CRA, \nbecause this debate will continue into next week.\n  The second point I think is important to make, again in terms of what \nCRA is not, CRA is not a giveaway. Every penny comes back--or at least \nas much as to any other lending institution. It is about loans. It is \nnot a mandated interest reduction. It is not requiring financial \ninstitutions go into social work. CRA is not charity.\n  As the Senator from Maryland pointed out, the taxpayers put up the \nmoney, really, for deposit insurance. We also have a tax exemption with \nregard, at least, to the credit unions. There are bankers, frankly, who \nare more than a little annoyed that credit unions have almost a 30 \nbasis point advantage because of the tax exemption that they enjoy. But \nthe tax exemption has been there precisely because we want to make \ncertain that individuals, people in communities, have a chance to go \ninto their neighborhood credit union or credit union associated with \ntheir job and borrow money for college or whatever. So there is a basis \npoint advantage that the credit unions get.\n  The taxpayers, all of us, all Americans who pay taxes, help make that \npossible. That happens any time you create a tax exemption from \nsomething that ought otherwise be taxed. If we say we are going to tax \neverything from here to here, from A to D, but we are going to exempt \nthis little part C to D and say, ``Because you are doing something we \nlike, we are not going to tax you for that,'' that tax exemption, then, \nhas to be made up by everybody else, right? So it becomes what we \nsometimes call a tax expenditure. When you take something out of A to \nD, that little part has to be made up if you have to get to D, and that \nis what happens if we provide for tax exemptions generally. Everybody \nchips in; everybody participates.\n  It should be for that reason, if nothing else, that we recognize that \nwhen you talk about policy like this, it really does matter, it really \ndoes come down to recognizing we are all in this together, that we all \nhave an investment, that we all share in these policies, and that \nfinding the place for cooperation and common ground makes a lot more \nsense for our country than, again, finding the points of conflict, of \nanger, and of ``I got mine, too bad for you.''\n  Another thing CRA is not, it does not have an explicit credit \nallocation criteria. There are no bureaucrats. This is another one of \nthe old saws that just get people's blood boiling, ``Oh boy, those \nnasty Federal bureaucrats telling us what to do.'' There are no \nbureaucrats telling the credit unions, the banks or anybody else, how \nto do their jobs. It is a results-oriented kind of legislation.\n  And, in fact, there are, since the 1995 amendments, simply three \nseparate criteria: A lending test evaluates whether or not a bank has a \nrecord of meeting the credit needs of its local community. Boy, is that \nawful. Has the bank met the credit needs of its local community.\n  An investment test evaluates how well a bank satisfies the credit \nneeds of its local neighborhoods through qualified community \ninvestments that benefit the assessment area. Another horrendous \nextortion we were hearing about a minute ago.\n  Finally, a service test that evaluates how well the needs of the \ncommunity are being met by the bank's retail delivery systems.\n  All of these things go into defining what CRA is about. Again, it is \nno bureaucrat telling somebody on the front end how to do it, but it is \nassessing whether or not the decisions were made in the private sector \nin an appropriate way that would achieve results.\n  Another thing that CRA is not is sanctions. Again, this gets to the \ninflammatory language we heard on the floor about extortion and a gun \nto the head and all the rest of it. There are no sanctions for poor \nperformance, no explicit sanctions.\n  What it does is, the regulators will take an institution's CRA \nratings into account in making evaluations with regard to their \nattempts to expand or merge or otherwise change the way they do \nbusiness. What you have here then is a modest attempt to provide the \nbasis for community reinvestment, and even that is under attack, again, \nI think, by some shopworn and already, hopefully, discredited politics \nthat I don't believe the American people care to hear anymore. It is \nfighting yesterday's battles all over, or, as Yogi Berra would say, \n``It's deja vu all over again.''\n  The amendment of the Senator from Alabama seeks to exempt fully 86 \npercent of our Nation's banks--that is to say, those with under $250 \nmillion in assets--from the provisions of the Community Reinvestment \nAct. This is not the first time he has offered this amendment. In 1995, \nthis very amendment was considered as part of a banking regulatory \nrelief bill. At that time, the Community Reinvestment Act regulations \nwere undergoing revision to make them less burdensome and more \neffective for banks and customers and consumers and communities. The \namendment was unnecessary and counterproductive then. It is even more \nso now. In addition to failing to relate to anything having to do with \nthe current reality, it fails to make the case that it will help \neffectuate the goals of the Community Reinvestment Act.\n  The attempt to describe the CRA as overly burdensome to banks is not \ntrue, has not been true, it is not true. Frankly, the banks themselves \nhave stepped forward to tell us that they believe the CRA is a positive \nthing that allows them to do good and to do well.\n  Let me share for a moment some of the comments by members of the \nbanking industry.\n  Alan Morris, commissioner of banks for the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts, Division of Banks and Loan Agencies:\n\n       I would like to dispel any myths which may still exist \n     about CRA, myths which abound not only among some bankers but \n     among many regulators and community groups. CRA makes good \n     business sense. Of the many bank failures which occurred in \n     Massachusetts over the last 3 years, I can assure you that \n     not one is attributable to a bank making too many CRA loans. \n     We tend to forget, after all, that sound loans to people in \n     businesses in an institution's own local community is what \n     CRA is all about. The false assumptions by some that low and \n     moderate income persons are not deserving of or cannot use \n     banking services is harmful to the communities, the \n     institutions and the economy.\n\n  Again, this is something that affects us all. If we don't have \ncapital flows going to all parts of our country, it is\n\n[[Page S8973]]\n\nkind of like not having blood circulate to your feet. You can either \nget the blood circulating to your feet, or you can cut it off, or you \ncan walk around in pain and misery. We can decide we are going to look \nat abandoned communities with boarded-up houses, with no jobs, where \npeople cannot access capital and credit, or we can do something to get \nthe blood pumping into those communities. And that is what the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act does.\n  Another banker talking about CRA:\n\n       My message is simple: Community reinvestment in low and \n     moderate income communities is good and profitable business.\n\n  Again, doing good and well at the same time.\n  Nora Brownell, senior vice president, corporate affairs, Meridian \nBank Corporation:\n\n       I want to reiterate the Community Reinvestment Act offers \n     all of us an opportunity to address major economic \n     development and service issues in our environment today.\n\n  The question becomes, What battle are we fighting here? What is going \non? Why are we fighting a battle that doesn't exist? Why are we \ncreating an ersatz crisis, or why are we coming up with an ersatz \nsolution in search of a problem if the bankers don't think a problem \nexists, if the credit unions are happy with the bill as it is?\n  I point out the letter from the credit union--what is the quote--they \nare happy with the bill ``as passed by committee.'' ``As passed by \ncommittee'' does not mean either the amendment by the Senator from \nAlabama or the amendment by the Senator from Texas.\n  If the credit unions like the bill as it is, if the bankers aren't \nupset with the Community Reinvestment Act, what then are we talking \nabout and why are we talking about it? I submit to you, I say to my \ncolleagues, that the reason we are talking about it is that some people \nlike to energize conflict and anger as a part of their politics; that \nsome people like to have people mad at each other, because when they \nget people mad at each other, then they can get their voters \nparticularly angry and their supporters particularly annoyed, and out \nof that annoyance, they wind up getting political power. That is what I \nthink all of this really comes down to.\n  I don't mean to be nasty, and I don't mean to be discourteous to any \nof my colleagues, but it is just stunning to me that we continue to \nhave a debate about the burdensome nature of the Community Reinvestment \nAct when the banks themselves aren't complaining about it.\n  To say they are not complaining about it because they are scared, \nbecause there is a gun at their head, really--that then suggests they \nare not only not being burdened but they are too cowardly to talk about \nit. I don't think any of the people who run these institutions are \nafraid to speak up for their own interests, particularly bankers. This \ninstitution has never been known not to listen to bankers. If bankers \nwanted to complain about something, they could have brought it to the \nattention of this committee and this institution. They certainly have \nthe power and clout and have never been too shy in other regards when \nthey needed something--when they needed bailing out, when they needed \nsupport. This institution has been very responsive to bankers, and I \nsuggest they have not been afraid to show their faces and complain \nabout the Community Reinvestment Act.\n  Let's talk a little bit about the history of the CRA. The CRA was \npassed in 1977 to combat what was called the ``redlining'' of certain \nneighborhoods. Redlining refers to the practice of--in some instances, \npeople actually found evidence where red lines were drawn on maps to \nindicate areas that were off limits for lending.\n  The goal of the CRA is to encourage banks to meet the credit needs of \ntheir entire communities, including low- and moderate-income areas--\nnothing more, nothing less. This obligation had its roots, frankly, in \nthe Banking Act of 1935 which required banks to meet the convenience \nand needs of their communities, and that, of course, was reiterated in \nthe Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and, of course, the bank charters \nthemselves.\n  CRA is not new, really, in that regard. There is precedence in other \nexisting laws with regard to the intent of making certain that banking \nand that the access to capital and credit are evenly and equitably \ndistributed throughout all communities.\n  The CRA does not require any banks to make bad loans. It only asks \nthem to explore good loan possibilities in their entire market area. \nCRA opens new markets and allows banks, again, to do good while doing \nwell.\n  Now, it is critical, again, to keep in mind what it is and what it is \nnot. It is not an effort to treat banks as if they were arms of the \nGovernment. It does not set up banks and financial institutions as \nsocial service agencies. It is not about treating them as an equivalent \nof a Government grant. This is not giving money away to anybody. It is \nnot a credit allocation. It is not forcing somebody to give credit to a \nparticular group or particular community in a particular way. And it \ncertainly is not about minorities.\n  I certainly hope that nobody gets away with demonizing the Community \nReinvestment Act on the basis of race, or demonize it, frankly, on the \nbasis that it is for inner-city communities because it is not. It is \nabout communities all over the country, and particularly in rural \ncommunities. Actually, rural communities in some instances are more \nchallenged than our inner-city and urban areas in terms of getting \naccess to capital and credit.\n  It is especially important to preserve the CRA obligations for rural \nbanks when often they are the only game in town for credit purposes. \nSeveral years ago, our Banking Committee held some CRA oversight \nhearings and we discovered cases of small banks in which the service \narea consisted of two towns, each with a population of about 10,000. \nThe bank in that case was found to be in substantial noncompliance with \nCRA because its loan portfolio consisted of only 5 percent of the total \nassets of the bank.\n  Now, again, 5 percent--you say, how could that happen? You have a \nbank in a little town. Why would it give only 5 percent of its loans in \nthe town? Well, in some instances the investments are in Treasuries and \nother things like that which wind up being more profitable for the \nbottom line, but it certainly does not serve the interests of the \ncommunity. And that is not where banking laws--again, going back to \n1935--that is not where the banking laws want to take us. Frankly, that \ndoes not in any way reflect or relate to or in any way show support \nback for the kind of support that taxpayers and citizens overall give \nto these financial institutions.\n  The last time the efforts were made to exempt small banks from the \nCRA--I am speaking specifically to the amendment by the Senator from \nAlabama--there was an article that appeared in the Madison Capital \nTimes in Wisconsin. It is ``Bank measure bad for farms.'' Referring to \nthat amendment, the very same amendment, this article, ``Bank measure \nbad for farms'' presents the view of a concerned rural resident who was \nconcerned about the unpainted barns and boarded-up rural businesses \nthat she saw in her community.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n            [From the Madison Capital Times, July 20, 1995]\n\n                       Bank Measure Bad for Farms\n\n                          (By Margaret Krome)\n\n       Earlier this week I drove past unpainted barns and boarded \n     up rural businesses on my way to a meeting. Like many city \n     dwellers, I fretted about the health of farms I passed and \n     small towns I drove through, but felt powerless to help.\n       However, we urbanites can protest policies that actively \n     harm rural communities. One such proposal is before Congress \n     right now. It would gut a major safeguard for money \n     borrowers, the Community Reinvestment Act.\n       As in all communities, rural citizens need credit. When \n     farmers, other small businesses, and rural citizens deposit \n     their money in their local bank, they do so both to protect \n     their funds and with the hope that when they want to start a \n     new business or bring a new family member into their farm \n     operation, the local bank will, in turn, lend them money.\n       But sometimes banks, and especially many rural banks, \n     establish a very different pattern, where local lending takes \n     a lower priority than making more assured investments, like \n     federal government securities. Thus, such banks drain local \n     resources outside of the very localities that support them, \n     making it that much harder for local citizens to get credit.\n\n[[Page S8974]]\n\n       The Community Reinvestment Act was passed in 1977 to make \n     banks more responsive to the credit needs of the community \n     they serve. The measure provides that before a bank can \n     expand, be bought, merge with another, or make other changes \n     in business structure, its record of community reinvestment \n     is reviewed.\n       If community members voice dissatisfaction with how the \n     bank has met local needs, or if the bank's local lending rate \n     is consistently low, it triggers a regulatory yellow light. \n     Before the bank's plans can proceed, it must respond to \n     citizen concerns.\n       When M Bank proposed to buy out Valley Bank holdings in \n     1993, for example, citizens in southwestern Wisconsin held \n     meetings to raise concerns about lending practices in that \n     10-county region. Without ever becoming a formal challenge, \n     the process resulted in M's working with the community to \n     increase agricultural and small businesses.\n       Despite such successes, now comes H.R. 1858, the \n     ``Financial Institution Regulatory Relief Act of 1995,'' to \n     the rescue of oppressed bankers everywhere. In three simple \n     swipes, it effectively eviscerates the CRA.\n       First, it removes a citizen's or community group's ability \n     to challenge a bank's application for expansion based on its \n     prior CRA performance.\n       Second, it outright exempts banks with less than $100 \n     million in assets from CRA regulations, which especially \n     hurts rural areas, where such banks are located. In fact, \n     under H.R. 1858, CRA provisions would not apply in 34 of the \n     state's 72 mostly rural counties.\n       Finally, and incredibly, it allows banks between $100 and \n     $250 million in assets to ``self-certify'' their CRA \n     compliance . . . as if any bank would ever be motivated to do \n     otherwise.\n       The banking community's complaint that meeting CRA \n     regulations is too costly is unconvincing, given record \n     profits that Wisconsin banks have registered in recent years. \n     Granted, CRA-related paperwork for some banks has been \n     considerable at times, but after a 2-year regulatory reform \n     process, even those problems were addressed in April with \n     greatly lessened reporting requirements and a streamlined \n     examination process for small banks.\n       The ``reforms'' in H.R. 1858 are not designed to relieve \n     banks of onerous reporting requirements. They appear to be \n     poorly disguised efforts to grant banks a carte blanche to \n     invest local monies in whatever ways best suit their private \n     profit-making interests.\n       There's nothing wrong with making a profit, but in rural \n     areas, where often there's little competition among banks, \n     it's wrong to revoke one of the few accountability measures \n     citizens have.\n       Historically, banking officials hold all the cards during \n     any local lending negotiation. The CRA shifts that power \n     balance by giving citizens a forum to air concerns about a \n     bank's pattern of lending.\n       If rural communities are to regain the vitality their \n     citizens deserve, they need true help an meaningful \n     solutions. Permitting banks free rein in the name of \n     regulatory relief is not one of them.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The author stated in the article:\n\n       As in all communities, rural citizens need credit. When \n     farmers, other small businesses, and rural citizens deposit \n     their money in their local bank, they do so both to protect \n     their funds and with the hope that when they want to start a \n     new business or bring a new family member into their farm \n     operation, the local bank will, in turn, lend them money.\n       But sometimes banks, and especially many rural banks, \n     establish a very different pattern, where local lending takes \n     a lower priority than making more assured investments, like \n     Federal Government securities. Thus, such banks drain local \n     resources outside of the very localities that support them, \n     making it that much harder for local citizens to get credit.\n\n  She goes on--by the way, I do not know how many people who are \nlistening to me now got a chance to hear the earlier comments about the \nnasty Federal Government, but, again, here this lady is saying they are \ntaking money out of home localities in rural communities and investing \nthem in Federal Government securities.\n  She goes on to describe how the Community Reinvestment Act spurred \none bank in particular to increase its commitment to agricultural and \nsmall businesses. And I quote. She says:\n\n       . . . in rural areas, where often there is little \n     competition among banks, it's wrong to revoke one of the few \n     accountability measures citizens have.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that she is exactly right. Even if banks \nunder $250 million represent a small percentage of total banking \nassets, they still represent 100 percent of options for many small town \nresidents.\n  To go back to the article, the author also writes:\n\n       If rural communities are to regain the vitality their \n     citizens deserve, they need true help and meaningful \n     solutions. Permitting banks free rein in the name of \n     regulatory relief is not one of them.\n\n  In addition to the article that I just mentioned, I would like, Mr. \nPresident, to have printed in the Record a letter. This letter, which I \nreceived yesterday, expresses strong opposition to the amendment by the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  It asserts that:\n\n       Rural Americans need the tools of the Community \n     Reinvestment Act to ensure accountability of their local \n     lending institutions. It is needed to prevent rural banks \n     from abandoning their commitment to serve millions of \n     Americans living in smaller low- and moderate-income \n     communities.\n\n  This letter, by the way, is signed by 11 groups: The Center for \nCommunity Change, the Center for Rural Affairs, the Federation of \nSouthern Cooperatives, the Housing Assistance Council, the Intertribal \nAgriculture Council, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, National \nCatholic Rural Life Conference, National Family Farm Coalition, \nNational Farmers Union, National Rural Housing Coalition, and the Rural \nCoalition.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 23, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations \n     representing rural Americans, we are writing to express our \n     strong opposition to legislative efforts to weaken the \n     coverage of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Our \n     understanding is that Senator Shelby plans to offer an \n     amendment to H.R. 1151, the credit union legislation, that is \n     scheduled for floor action. In addition, Senator Gramm plans \n     to offer an amendment that strikes provisions, in H.R. 1151 \n     that would ensure that credit unions provide services to all \n     individuals of modest means within their field of membership.\n       The Shelby amendment would exempt banks under $250 million \n     in assets from CRA coverage. This affects over 85% of banks \n     nationally. For citizens in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, \n     Nebraska, and Oklahoma, 95% of the banks would be exempt.\n       Rural Americans need the tools of the Community \n     Reinvestment Act to ensure accountability of their local \n     lending institutions. It is needed to prevent rural banks \n     from abandoning their commitment to serve the millions of \n     Americans living in smaller low and moderate-income \n     communities. Unfortunately, small commercial banks do not \n     automatically reinvest in their local communities. This is \n     documented by national data on reinvestment trends and loan \n     to asset ratios for banks across the country. 50% of small \n     banks have a loan-to-deposit ratio below 70%, with 25% of \n     these having levels less than 58%. The data for 1997 reveals \n     that banks under $100 million in assets received 82% of the \n     substantial non-compliance ratings.\n       We strongly urge you to oppose these amendments to H.R. \n     1151. The Shelby amendment ignores the important regulatory \n     changes since 1995 that have significantly reduced the \n     paperwork and reporting issues for small banks. The Gramm \n     amendment will strike an important provision from the bill \n     that for the first time would require credit unions to meet \n     the financial services needs of their entire field of \n     membership.\n       A vote against these amendments will help meet the credit \n     demand of millions of family farmers, rural residents, and \n     local businesses. Thank you for considering our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n         Center for Community Change; Center for Rural Affairs; \n           Federation of Southern Cooperatives; Housing Assistance \n           Council; Intertribal Agriculture Council; Iowa Citizens \n           for Community Improvement; National Catholic Rural Life \n           Conference; National Family Farm Coalition; National \n           Farmers Union; National Rural Housing Coalition; Rural \n           Coalition.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. In addition, I have received many letters from \ncommunity groups and other concerned citizens who oppose this \namendment.\n  I must point out that, again, in 1995, when this amendment was \nproposed before, letters were sent in opposition by the Save CRA \nCoalition and others. Unlike many of the special interest groups around \nhere in Washington, frankly, that group's name lets you know exactly \nwhat it stands for. The Save CRA Coalition was established to defeat \nthe amendment of the Senator from Alabama when it was previously \noffered.\n  The letter they sent, opposing the weakening of the CRA, was signed \nby 2,181 State and local government organizations, for-profit \nbusinesses, community groups, unions, farm groups and faith-based \norganizations from every State in the country, the District of \nColumbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, by the way, including a \nnumber of organizations from Alabama and Texas.\n\n[[Page S8975]]\n\n  Now, I am going to ask that the letter be printed in the Record also. \nI am not intending to filibuster, and I know that some of my colleagues \nare here on the floor wanting to speak, but there is a long, long list \nof organizations which are very, very recognizable that I hope my \ncolleagues have a chance to take a look at to see the breadth and the \nlevel of opposition to the amendment by the Senator from Alabama and \nthe opposition to weakening the CRA.\n  I hope that also every Member of the Senate will have occasion to at \nleast review the names of the organizations in their own State with \nregard to opposition to this amendment. My own State, what, it is three \npages--Illinois has page 9, page 10, and on to page 11. They are just \nnames in a single space of organizations in opposition to that \namendment. And I am sure if I were to take Missouri or Delaware or any \nof the other States, they would be an equally long list. I hope my \ncolleagues will familiarize themselves--or New York--will familiarize \nthemselves with the names of the organizations that, again, are against \nweakening the Community Reinvestment Act.\n  However, I ask unanimous consent that the letter itself be printed in \nthe Record, but not the names of the organizations who signed the \nletter because that would take up too much space in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Save the CRA Coalition,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Alphonse D'Amato,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato: The following state and local \n     governments organizations, for-profit businesses, community \n     groups, unions, farms groups, and faith-based organizations \n     oppose legislative changes in S. 650 and H.R. 1858 that \n     weaken the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). CRA ensures that \n     creditworthy borrowers have access to the American system of \n     commerical credit. It has given banks an incentive to \n     discover profitable lending and investment opportunities in \n     rural, suburban and urban communities. Congress does not need \n     to revise this effective law.\n       Preservation of CRA is vital to the work of community \n     developers and small business nationwide, CRA has been the \n     catalyst for important local alliances among financial \n     institutions, local businesses, nonprofits, and state and \n     local governments. It has led to hundreds of thousands of \n     modest-income families becoming first-time home owners, \n     generated new capital for small businesses and small and mid-\n     size family farms, and made financing available for local \n     economic development projects. Additionally, CRA has spurred \n     the creation of innovative mechanisms for providing credit \n     such as revolving loan funds and consortia.\n       We recognize the value of making CRA a more performance-\n     based system rather than a process of documentation, however \n     federal regulators have addressed this issue. On April 19, \n     1995, the four bank regulatory agencies issued final rules \n     making CRA compliance more effective. The process of revising \n     these regulations covered two years of intense deliberation; \n     public hearings involving hundreds of bankers, community \n     groups and local officials; and nearly 14,000 written \n     comments from banks and other organizations nationwide. We \n     strongly believe that the regulations agreed to by the \n     nation's financial regulators effectively address whatever \n     weaknesses banks have complained about in CRA's \n     administration and thereby bolster its successes.\n       Proposed ``regulatory relief'' legislation (S. 650 and H.R. \n     1858) would stifle local community efforts by exempting an \n     overwhelming majority of banks and allowing the rest to \n     abandon their commitments to millions of Americans in low- \n     and moderate-income communities. In addition to provisions \n     that explicitly modify the Community Reinvestment Act, other \n     provisions in this legislation deter community reinvestment \n     efforts by abolishing constructive channels for community \n     input in decisions regarding bank mergers and other corporate \n     expansions, and eliminating critical data collection \n     requirements that enable objective assessments of bank \n     performance.\n       Since its enactment in 1977, CRA has attracted more than \n     $60 billion worth of investments in low- and moderate-income \n     communities around the country, and stimulated local \n     economies. Every dollar spent in community-based development \n     circulates through the economy an estimated five times \n     through vendors, suppliers, subcontractors and related \n     workers.\n       In light of the success of the CRA, we urge you to strike \n     provisions within S. 650 and H.R. 1858 that weaken the CRA \n     and to oppose any efforts to cripple this critical law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              2,181 Organizations.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. One of the reasons that CRA has such broad support \nis very simple. It does not force banks to make bad loans. It \nencourages them to examine unexplored markets in their service area, \nand it, again, allows a financial institution to do good while doing \nwell simultaneously. They make money on these loans.\n  My favorite CRA story is about one banker who said that he hated the \nCRA, but he did not think it was burdensome. What he hated was the fact \nthat other banks did it, too. Other banks were complying with CRA. He \nhad discovered years ago--it was kind of a market rating situation--he \ndiscovered years ago that there were many cash-poor but credit-worthy \ncustoms out there. And he had previously been the only one issuing \nloans in certain low- and moderate-income areas in low- and moderate-\nincome neighborhoods.\n  So now with CRA in place, he was forced to compete where he had once \nenjoyed a monopoly. And so he was annoyed, if you will, that his \nmonopoly over the areas that had not had access to capital and credit, \nexcept via him--that that monopoly was now opened up because other \ninstitutions were beginning to engage in those communities, because and \nby virtue of the Community Reinvestment Act.\n  Again, he had learned a lesson that many bankers are now learning. \nBecause of CRA, community reinvestment is the best way to do good while \ndoing well simultaneously. And CRA is profitable for banks. In a survey \nconducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas, 98 percent of banks \nfound that their CRA activities were profitable.\n  Many others agree with the Kansas City study. Most major banks, \nincluding NationsBank and Bank of America, have reiterated their \ncommitment to the CRA. As I recall, when we last had a hearing in the \nBanking Committee, some bankers testified in favor of keeping CRA \nintact. In fact, I was delighted at a hearing we had of the Banking \nCommittee. Secretary Rubin had previously come out in support of the \nCRA, but I actually put the question to Chairman Greenspan, who is \nacknowledged as the guru of financial everything, I guess, and Chairman \nGreenspan reiterated or spoke to his support of the CRA, which I was \nabsolutely delighted about.\n  I will give an earlier statement of Chairman Greenspan:\n\n       When conducted properly by banks which are knowledgeable \n     about their local markets, CRA can be a safe, sound, and \n     profitable business. CRA has prepared financial institutions \n     to discover new markets that may have been underserved \n     before.\n\n  I see a number of my colleagues standing and looking at me. I think \nthis means I am talking too long. I don't mean to filibuster this \nissue. I just want to say I believe I have spoken to the issue. There \nare facts and figures I would like to share with my colleagues, but I \nknow we will have another opportunity to do that because we will have \nthis issue come up again on Monday.\n  Suffice it to say that expanding the Community Reinvestment Act to \nthe credit unions, which apparently the Senator from Texas doesn't like \nvery much, is not something which has the credit unions themselves \nriled up. They like the bill we passed out of committee. They don't \nwant to have that amendment. They want to see us go forward with H.R. \n1151.\n  With regard to the CRA-gutting attempt, taking out 85 percent of CRA \nactivity that the Senator from Alabama would suggest, I submit that \nalso is an amendment that the credit unions don't want to see on this \nbill because it is too important to them.\n  With regard to just an overall appeal to my colleagues, let me \nsuggest that to find a solution like these two are suggesting in search \nof a problem does not do justice to the level of the cooperation that \nwe have seen in this Congress, and particularly with this Banking \nCommittee, that CRA gives us an opportunity to find common ground, to \nwork together, and to work together for the good of our entire country. \nThe alternative is an appeal to conflict and anger which I think is \nbeneath the Senate. I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing both \nof these amendments.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I propound a unanimous consent request: \nThat the pending Gramm amendment be temporarily set aside; I further \nask that at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, July 27, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the\n\n[[Page S8976]]\n\nGramm amendment, with 1 hour for debate equally divided prior to a \nmotion to table; I further ask that the tabling vote occur at 5:30 p.m, \nwith no second-degree amendments in order to the amendment prior to the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I believe my colleague from Connecticut has a brief \nstatement. I believe he has asked our other colleagues that he be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me thank my colleagues who are here, and I will keep \nthese remarks brief. I thank my colleagues from Colorado, North \nCarolina, and Missouri.\n  Briefly, Mr. President, let me, first of all, extend my compliments \nto the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee and the ranking \nmember, Senator D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes, for their excellent \nleadership in bringing this bill on credit unions to the floor. This is \na very, very important piece of legislation. I think most of my \ncolleagues who have followed this debate hoped we wouldn't have had to \ncome to the floor with a credit union bill. But as a result of Supreme \nCourt decisions, we have been forced to act, and to act expeditiously \nin this Congress. In fact, as a result of a letter drafted by the \nchairman, several others, and myself, we have asked the court not to \ninitiate their decision so that there would be time for us \nlegislatively to respond to the Supreme Court decision.\n  This is not just any other bill we are bringing up that may or may \nnot have some importance on the Legislative Calendar. It is critical \nthat before this Congress adjourn this piece of legislation be \nconsidered and adopted and signed into law if we are going to provide \nthe kind of relief that must be sought as a result of the AT credit \nunion decision.\n  Again, my compliments to the leadership of Senator Domenici, Senator \nSarbanes, and other members of the Banking Committee, who voted 16-2, I \nthink was the vote, that brought this bill to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  It is critically important. Why is it important? It is important \nbecause if we are going to see members of credit unions forced to leave \ntheir credit unions as a result of the AT credit union decision, the \nresulting loss of those members could cause a credit union to become \ninsolvent. That is the problem here, and that in itself would create a \ndrain on the taxpayer-backed deposit insurance fund.\n  So, it is very, very important we not allow those credit unions to \nrun the risk of losing its membership as a result of that decision or \nour inability to act and then causing these credit unions to fail \naround the America. None of that will happen, obviously, if we move to \nadopt the legislation.\n  I point out that in the House, the other body, they adopted the \nlegislation, I think, something like 411-8. It was overwhelmingly \nadopted. I am confident that will be the case here, as well. We will \nget a good, strong vote provided we don't get sidetracked on some side \nissues. Whether they have merit or not, there will certainly be other \nvehicles in the minds of some people, but the idea we would allow it to \nbe attached to this, running the risk--you run the risk of having this \ncredit union legislation collapse. If that does happen, then the \nresulting consequences of that collapse will have to be borne by those \nwho try to take advantage of this vehicle to add extraneous matters. \nThat is very, very clear to credit union members all across the \ncountry.\n  This is an opportunity for us to act on this bill. I have strong \nviews about the amendment of our colleague from Alabama on CRA. I am \nopposed to what he wants to do. I know there are Members who strongly \nagree with what he wants to do. But also I will tell you that if you \nallow that provision to be added to this bill, you are going to cause \nthis bill to fall. If that is the case, then the resulting \nconsequences, I think, are terribly predictable.\n  I am not going to necessarily, today, engage in the debate on the \nShelby amendment on the CRA, Community Reinvestment Act, except to say \nthat I know in my State of Connecticut for the literally thousands of \nmembers of credit unions, the millions in the State of New York and \nCalifornia and elsewhere all across this country who are watching this \ndebate, knowing if this bill falls because of a desire of some to come \nup with an amendment here that has some appeal, I think the \ntransparency of the efforts will be quite obvious that, in fact, it is \nreally not the issue of CRA.\n  There are those who, frankly, want to kill this bill, who don't like \nthe credit union bill but don't really want to take it on directly and \nso will offer an extraneous amendment, hopefully, that might just \nnarrowly get adopted, the bill collapses, and you have been able to \nsort of smuggle the destruction of this important piece of legislation \nthrough. It is extremely important that we deal with this bill in as \nclean a fashion as possible, no matter how appealing some of these \namendments may be. So that is important.\n  The second question obviously we want to still address is whether or \nnot we want the maximum possible number of Americans to have the choice \nof joining a credit union. I think people ought to be free to make that \nchoice of joining a credit union. The overwhelming majority of credit \nunions provide affordable financial services to working families all \nacross this country.\n  Let me draw one theme that has been raised during consideration of \nthe bill--that is whether credit unions have lost their mission of \nserving middle-income Americans and families of modest means, which was \nwritten into the original act. The question surfaced because of a \ncampaign of misinformation, in my view, prompted by some industries \nthat compete with credit unions. During the Banking Committee hearing \nof these issues, back in March, one banking industry representative \nstated that ``credit union membership had become so compromised that \nmembership was being offered to members of wealthy country clubs.'' I \nam not making up this example. This one actually happened.\n  Needless to say, those who support credit unions were very upset \nabout that allegation because it would run contrary to the thrust of \nwhat credit unions are supposed to do. We examined that allegation and \nit is was true, in fact, that there were wealthy country club \nmemberships.\n  What they fail to tell you is that the people being solicited to join \nthe credit union were the cooks, janitors, groundskeepers, and others. \nThey weren't members of the country club, they worked at the country \nclub. Yet, if you listened to the allegation, you assumed it was people \nwho paid significant fees to join the club, rather than employees. That \nis the sort of misinformation that is going on to try to destroy this \nbill and this important credit union organization across the country.\n  The average credit union is still very small in size. It is limited \nby the number of people they serve. In my State of Connecticut--an \naffluent State, a strong middle class State--the average size of a \ncredit union as an institution is $16 million in assets. In fact, if \nyou take all the assets of all of my credit unions in Connecticut and \ntotal them up, they don't equal the assets of one of my 10 largest \nbanks in the State of Connecticut. I know that is not true in every \nState, but in Connecticut, which is a fairly affluent State and has an \naggressive, strong credit union organization, total assets of all of my \ncredit union members don't equal the size of any one of the 10 largest \nbanks.\n  In fact, assets of all the 11,392 federally insured credit unions was \n$327 billion, or less than the size of Chase Manhattan Bank or \nCitibank. The asset size of the 11,452 federally insured banks is $5.2 \ntrillion, compared to $327 billion for all the credit unions. So the \nnotion that somehow this is some great threat to commercial banking in \nthis country, I think, is unwarranted, it is not credible at all. Small \nbanks and thrifts are threatened in many ways in this country, but I \nsuggest that they are much more threatened by aggressive banking giants \nlike NationsBank than by any credit union. The loss of banking services \nin many communities that I visited has much more to do with aggressive \ntakeovers and consolidations practiced by large national financial \ninstitutions or large regional institutions than it does competition \nfrom credit unions. That is the least of these smaller banks' and \ncommunity banks' threats.\n  The facts show that while credit unions have experienced modest \ngrowth since the implementation of\n\n[[Page S8977]]\n\nthe multiple common bond, that growth is dwarfed by the growth in the \nbanking industry.\n  Ultimately, the complaints of the bank and thrift industry boil down \nnot so much to a loss of market share but to the fact that credit \nunions offer customers a pretty good deal. They offer customers higher \ninterest rates on savings and checking, as well as lower interest rates \non credit cards and certain kinds of loans; credit unions don't charge \ntheir customers a fee for every conceivable type of transaction. We \nhave reached a point in the banking industry where seeking out a new \nfee income has replaced seeking out new loan business as the way to \nmake profits.\n  Not only are banks generating $3 billion a year in ATM fees--a \nsubject matter that the chairman of the committee cares deeply about--\n$3 billion a year in ATM fees in excess of their costs, but some banks \neven started charging customers for using a deposit slip at branches, \nor for having the temerity to actually call a live person--if you can \never find one--on the phone during normal business hours.\n  While the banks claim that credit unions offer a better deal because \nthey don't pay taxes, that is also a fiction. Credit unions have no \naccess to capital markets to raise funds; they keep the capital needed \nto stay in business only through retained earnings. That is vastly \ndifferent from what the banks do. Moreover, the banks also don't \nacknowledge the many tax advantages they enjoy, such as being able to \nwrite off billions in taxes every year for loan losses that never \noccur, or for receiving a tax credit for any minimal premium they must \npay toward maintaining taxpayer-guaranteed deposit insurance.\n  Credit unions are nonprofit organizations that put their earnings \ninto both creating capital and keeping costs down for their customers, \nthe actions that were precisely envisioned by Congress in establishing \nthe Federal credit unions of 1934.\n  So, Mr. President, I think there is an important role that our credit \nunions play. There is good, healthy competition out there. Let me end \nwhere I began. That is, I urge my colleagues--those of you who truly \ncare about allowing the Supreme Court decision to be dealt with \nlegislatively--there is only one window where we are going to get a \nchance to do this. Even if you find yourself attracted to a standing-\nalone provision on the CRA issue--which I don't, but some do--even if \nyou are slightly attracted to that amendment, by supporting that \namendment you will bring down this bill, and then people are going to \nunderstand what happened here.\n  So I certainly endorse and support the comments of our colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, who speaks eloquently on the \nissue of the Community Reinvestment Act--the strength of it, how well \nit has worked, and how well it is working in reaching sectors of our \nsociety that have been too often in years past denied access to \nfinancial services in our country. I think it would be a mistake to \njeopardize this credit union bill, which has come out of our committee \nwith such a strong vote and such a strong vote in the other body.\n  I think on Monday we can certainly do a great deal to relieve the \nanxiety and fears of literally millions of people across the country \nwho utilize credit unions for their financial security and their \nfutures. They are going to be terribly disappointed in this body if we \nget involved in extraneous matters and bring this bill down. So over \nthe weekend, I urge that members of credit unions across the country \ncertainly let their Members of Congress know how important this bill is \nto them and how important it would be to keep off amendments that could \ndestroy our ability to pass this legislation.\n  I thank my colleagues for their graciousness. I compliment the \nchairman and Senator Sarbanes for their fine work on this bill.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1151. Credit \nunions have played an important role in our financial system. They have \ngiven a helping hand and a hand-up to millions of Americans whom it \notherwise would not have been available to. Nearly 70 million Americans \nare members of credit unions. I consider myself a strong supporter of \ncredit unions. We have over 195 in my State, including the second \nlargest in the Nation. Over 2 million people in North Carolina are \nmembers of credit unions. I do not believe that we should limit their \naccess to credit, and it is the principal reason I support the credit \nunions in this bill. We have to protect and preserve credit unions for \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not without controversy. This bill \nstarted out as a court case in my home State. The case went to the \nSupreme Court that began in North Carolina and was decided against the \ncredit unions.\n  Now, there has been a lot of heated conversation about this \nlegislation. Some of what has been said is correct, but a large part of \nit has been incorrect.\n  Very simply, this is what it would do. This legislation would allow \nmultiple groups, each with their own common bond, to be part of one \ncredit union. The Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 was unclear on this \npoint. But beginning in 1982, the National Credit Union Administration \nhas allowed groups to be part of a credit union. The real question is \nwhether Congress will support the policy that has, in effect, been the \nlaw since then, since the 1980s. I have to conclude that the Congress \nwill, but they are only going to do it with some limitations.\n  Essentially, this is why we have to change the law.\n  And let me say, the changing marketplace has changed the banking \nworld too. Glass-Steagall--the bank law that separates banks and \nsecurities firms has almost no meaning in today's society. In fact, it \nis little adhered to.\n  Mr. President, the workplace has changed dramatically since 1934. The \nera of working for one company, with one occupation, with one skill--\nfor all of one's life is gone. Technology and global markets have \nforever changed our way of life.\n  These changes mean that a one group credit union will have difficulty \nsurviving in today's day and age.\n  Banks used to not have banks outside their own States, and primarily \nwithin their own community. Banks used to be able to sell insurance in \nonly towns of 5,000 people. Now they are limited to the United States.\n  We need to update our bank laws as well--and I hope and anticipate \nthat we can do that.\n  And I have not stood in the way of the bank regulators that have had \nto update our laws through executive action, rather than the Congress \nacting.\n  And I think the same view is reasonable with respect to credit \nunions.\n  But--as I said--there should be some limitations--and there are \nlimitations in this bill.\n  Credit unions do not pay taxes. I am adamantly opposed to taxing \ncredit unions.\n  The answer to this problem is not to impose taxes on credit unions. \nThe answer is to reduce taxes for small banks. That is why Senator \nAllard and I introduced legislation yesterday to make tax law changes \nto help community banks.\n  We need to reduce regulation for small banks--that is why I will vote \nfor Senator Shelby's amendment to remove CRA for community banks.\n  We do not need to punish credit unions to help small banks--I think \nwe should simply help small banks.\n  Let me also say this.\n  We have done a number of things to change and reform the credit union \nindustry.\n  This bill is not without tough provisions for the credit union \nindustry and some of them are pretty tough provisions.\n  We have limited commercial loans to be made by credit unions to 12 \npercent of their assets. Before now, there was no limit. And there was \nonly a study in the House bill.\n  We have required the NCUA to charter separate credit unions where \npossible.\n  We have limited the use of geographic charter credit unions to a \n``defined'' community--so that there cannot be abuses in the chartering \nof geographic credit unions.\n  Finally, we have imposed prompt corrective action on credit unions--\nand we have essentially established minimum net worth requirements for \ncredit unions.\n  So there are many reforms to the industry that have not been \ndiscussed by the opponents of this bill.\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me just say again--this is an important bill to \nkeep credit unions going into the future and into the 21st century.\n  If we don't pass this bill--it is uncertain if people can continue to \njoin credit unions. And there is the possibility that persons could \nlose their right to be a member of a credit union. The district court \nhas not yet decided how this case will be implemented.\n  It is simply wrong to suggest that if we don't pass this, that given \nbenign neglect, it will probably go away. It will not. We have to pass \nthis bill so that current members are assured of keeping their status.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and urge pass passage of the bill. But let \nme comment also on the two pending amendments.\n  First, I support Senator Gramm's amendment.\n  It makes absolutely no sense to put CRA on credit unions. Credit \nunions are member organizations to begin with. The very nature of \ncredit unions is to lend to their members. To put CRA on it is \nredundant, and ridiculous.\n  The provisions in the H.R. 1151 is redundant, as I said, and is, \nfrankly, absurd. Anybody that has looked at it knows it.\n  I strongly support Senator Gramm's amendment. We do not need CRA for \ncredit unions. We need to reduce the burden for small banks. Every bank \nthat I have talked to has a problem with the CRA. It is too subjective. \nThere are too few definitive standards. Small banks spend an inordinate \namount of their time and money complying with Federal law when their \nlending is almost totally local.\n  I support Senator Shelby's amendment because CRA makes no sense for \nsmall banks. Small banks can't survive, if they don't lend in their \ncommunity. That is what CRA says they need to do. But for a small bank, \nwhere else does it lend if it is not in its community?\n  That was the purpose of the CRA to begin with. It simply is not today \nviable. To take deposits and lend in a small community is what \ncommunity banks do.\n  The Senator's amendment exempts 8,000 banks. But they account for \nonly 11 percent of the assets of the industry. In fact, these 8,000-\nplus banks have roughly the same amount of assets as one of our North \nCarolina banks. It is not an unreasonable amendment. Small banks are \nshrinking, they are disappearing, and the more burden we put on them \nthe less there will be.\n  Just as I don't think credit unions threaten big banks, I don't think \nexempting small banks from CRA is a threat to the CRA.\n  The Shelby amendment only exempts 11.7 percent of the assets of the \nbanks of this country.\n  As I said, we have one bank in North Carolina with roughly the same \namount of assets.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1151.\n  First, I want to begin by thanking Chairman D'Amato for skillfully \nsteering the Credit Union Membership Act through the Senate Banking \nCommittee and onto the Senate floor.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with both him and his staff on this \nSenate Banking Committee. That also is speaking in behalf of my staff \nalso. We have been very appreciative of their work in helping us with \nour issues and what you are doing for credit unions.\n  I am pleased to support this credit union bill in the Banking \nCommittee, and I am pleased to continue to support it now.\n  I have always been a supporter of the credit union movement. The main \nreason I have been supportive is because I felt that any competition \namong financial institutions is vitally important. And, obviously, the \ncredit unions provide the customer another choice out there; another \nway of meeting his banking and financial needs.\n  During my years in the Colorado State Senate I worked closely with \nthe Colorado Credit Union League and the numerous credit unions and \nmembers that we have in Colorado.\n  I have been pleased to continue my work with the Colorado Credit \nUnions as a member of the Senate Banking Committee.\n  Mr. President, there are 185 credit unions in Colorado. There are \n1,321,000 credit union members in Colorado.\n  And the credit unions hold nearly $7 billion in assets in Colorado.\n  Credit Unions play a vital role in our communities. They provide an \nopportunity for groups of people to join together and pool their \nassets.\n  Credit Unions are run by their members. Those members make loans and \nhelp each other to get ahead and build a prosperous life for their \nfamilies and for their communities.\n  Let me turn to several provisions in the Credit Unions bill.\n  I am particularly supportive of the new capital requirements and the \n``prompt corrective action'' requirements that we put in the bill \nduring our deliberations in the Senate Banking Committee. That is \nbecause I feel so strongly that we need to work to make sure that our \nfinancial institutions remain safe and sound.\n\n  I have always felt that we were particularly blessed to be serving in \nthe Senate particularly during a time when our economy is doing very \nwell.\n  As much as I would like to hope that our economy continues to \nprosper, history has shown us that periodically there are fluctuations \nin our economy; there are good times and there are bad times. If we do \nnot make good decisions today to assure safety and soundness, it is \ngoing to create problems in the future. So that is why I have been so \npleased with the safety and soundness provisions that we have added to \nH.R. 1151. These provisions are vital to protect credit union members. \nWe want the credit union members' movement to remain strong and well \ncapitalized.\n  Let me turn to the issue of taxation. From the beginning of this \ndebate, I have opposed the taxation of credit unions. They are \ncollective organizations. They are not-for-profit businesses. They pool \ntheir assets. Their gains go back to the members as assets. They also \ngo back to their members as interest, and that interest is taxable to \nthe credit union members. As I said earlier, credit unions exist to \nhelp their members, and consequently I do not believe that credit \nunions should be taxed. I have been concerned with the tax and \nregulatory burden that remains on small financial institutions, whether \nthey are banks or credit unions. Consequently, I will support \nelimination of the Community Reinvestment Act. I support lifting the \nCRA burden on small financial institutions, and I support reducing the \ntax burden on small banks.\n  I raised this issue during the Banking Committee's hearing last month \non the proposed financial modernization legislation. We need to do \nsomething to make certain that our small community banks can remain \nviable. We do not want those banks to drown in the burden of regulation \nand taxation.\n  At the time of the hearing I had brought up a question about \nsubchapter S corporations and independent banks, and, graciously, the \nchairman says, ``You know, I think maybe you are on to something. We \nought to continue to pursue that.'' Consequently, because of the strong \nsupport from the chairman in trying to give tax relief to small banks, \nI put together some legislation. This has all resulted because a small, \nindependent banker from my State of Colorado decided to share with me \nsome ideas he had about S corporations and how we could help small \nbanks through the Tax Code.\n  So the chairman was very receptive to those concerns. He said, \n``Well, let's work on it.'' We worked on it. We have introduced some \nlegislation that will be helpful to small bankers in Colorado and \nthroughout the country.\n  It has become very clear that small banks do want something done with \ntheir subchapter S corporations. The subchapter S provisions of the \nInternal Revenue Code reflect the desire of Congress to eliminate the \ndouble tax burden on small business corporations.\n  Subchapter S has been liberalized a number of times, and most \nrecently in 1996. Yesterday, I introduced legislation that will expand \nand improve subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, and this is S. \n2346. I am joined in this effort by Senators D'Amato, Faircloth, Hagel, \nEnzi, Bennett, Mack, Shelby, and Grams. This legislation contains \nseveral provisions that will make the subchapter S election more widely \navailable to small businesses in\n\n[[Page S8979]]\n\nall sectors. It also contains several provisions of particular benefit \nto community banks that may be contemplating a conversion to the \nsubchapter S.\n  Financial institutions were first made eligible for the subchapter S \nelection in 1996. This legislation builds on and clarifies the \nsubchapter S provisions applicable to financial institutions.\n  As Congress considers credit union legislation and financial \nmodernization legislation, it is important that we explore ways in \nwhich we can ensure that the tax and regulatory burden on our community \nbanks remains reasonable. This S corporation legislation is reflective \nof that desire, and we will now begin working with the Senate Finance \nCommittee to see if we can get this legislation in a bill this year.\n  Section 403 of this credit union bill will require the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to submit a study to Congress within 1 year that will make \nlegislative recommendations on how Congress can reduce and simplify the \ntax burden on small banks. I hope the Treasury Department will be \nendorsing this S corporation legislation.\n  It seems to me that it is one of the better ways to reduce the tax \nburden on small banks. In the last several months, there has been \nconsiderable conflict between banks and credit unions. They both play a \nvital role in our communities. I hope that in the coming months we can \nproduce legislation that will strengthen credit unions as well as \ncommunity banks, and I support the bill.\n  I thank the members of the committee, particularly the chairman, for \ntheir support of H.R. 1151, and look forward to swift passage. I am \nparticularly pleased to serve on this committee because of the \ncooperation and sincere desire in that committee to make sure that we \nhave strong financial institutions and that we have competition out \nthere, which I think is the real answer to a lot of our problems.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me just take a brief moment because I \nknow the Senator from Missouri has been anxiously waiting to seek the \nfloor.\n  I thank my colleague from Colorado, a member of our Banking \nCommittee, as well as the Presiding Officer, for their support not only \nin this endeavor as it relates to the credit unions but for our overall \nlegislative efforts. Indeed, I believe that Senator Allard has offered \nin a most constructive way an opportunity to begin to give to the small \nbusiness entrepreneur, and in this case the small community bank, an \nopportunity to create meaningful competition, to allow retained \nearnings to be held to avoid double taxation, and to make a very \npositive impact on financial modernization that will lead to greater \ncompetition and in the long run will expand the economy and the tax \nbase for individual small banks, and as a result, benefit all of our \ncitizens. This effort is not only a worthwhile endeavor, it is one that \nall of us should seek to support, Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  Let me simply say this because I feel compelled to do so. I \nunderstand the frustrations of many of my colleagues as we debate the \nquestion of CRA and whether or not it should be a factor for small \nbanks, whether it should be continued, or whether it should be \nmodernized. Indeed, I think we should take a closer look at this issue, \nas Senator Allard has in terms of coming forth with his legislative \nproposal which addresses tax relief.\n  The CRA amendment regarding small banks is a broad brush, shotgun \napproach for those who would support the effort of dealing with this \nissue in the context of a very important legislative matter. It \nbeclouds the issue. Addressing this important matter of CRA for small \nbanks now does not help in attempting to see to it that we remove \nbarriers from honest competition, barriers that maybe should be removed \nand that we should address. But, I repeat, to bring it up in this form \nwith the limited time that we have this Session will be disruptive to \nthe overall effort.\n  I ask all of my colleagues, my Republican colleagues in particular, \nand even those who have signed on and indicated support of the effort \nof the Senator from Alabama to help community banks, not to undertake \nit at this time. It actually distracts from the merits of their \nargument. It will prevent considering their concerns carefully and \nanalyzing what can be done to ease these burdens, to assess if they \nreally are burdensome and if so, in what way. So I am going to appeal \nto my colleagues--I appeal to them today; I will appeal to them on \nMonday--this is not the time to be going forward seeking relief that we \nwill not have the opportunity to act on in any event. It will fracture \nour efforts on the credit union bill. It will at the least, the very \nleast, bog down this effort. The House of Representatives will not \naccept the bill with this amendment. If they do accept it, then what \nwill happen is that the bill will be a vetoed. Now what are we \naccomplishing? Why do we want to confuse whether or not we are really \nsupporting credit unions with this attempt at dealing with another \nunrelated issue? That will only serve to hurt our efforts for credit \nunions.\n  This Senator intends to support the motion of Senator Gramm of \nremoving the CRA provisions from this credit union bill. But my gosh, \nif we are going to begin reaching far back through existing laws, \nwithout doing so in a meaningful way, then what I suggest what we are \ndoing is purely mischief making. We want to be loved by all. We want to \nmake everyone happy. I understand that. That is the nature of those in \npolitics. But there comes a time when we have to take a stand and do \nwhat is right. Sometimes you can't have the adoration of all. Better to \nhave the respect and to do what is right.\n  I will be urging that of my colleagues, and particularly those who \nhave concerns about the application of CRA on the community banks. \nLet's do what is right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed 5 minutes \nas if in morning business to introduce a piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of S. 2354 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I think, as much as we will be returning \non Monday to resume debate and consideration of the credit union \nlegislation, which is so important, and which I believe will be adopted \noverwhelmingly, I urge any of my colleagues who might want to make \nstatements that we will be available to receive those statements at \nthis point. If not, it seems to me we will then be moving, at the \nrequest of the majority leader, to adjourn until Monday.\n  So I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum and hope if there \nare any of my colleagues who would like to make their statements now, \nopening statements or observations, that they would do so within the \nnext 5 to 10 minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know we, in \neffect, have concluded the debate today with respect to the credit \nunion bill, but there were some comments made earlier about the CRA \naspects of this legislation, and I want to put this in the Record.\n  First of all, let me make it very clear, the CRA that is being \napplied to the credit unions is not the Community Reinvestment Act. It \nis a provision drafted especially for the credit unions, and it is \ndesigned to ensure that they pay full attention to the field of \nmembership. I think it is a reasonable provision. I hope it will stay \nin the bill.\n  I know that the Senator from Texas is trying to strike it, but, of \ncourse, he is against any CRA, any version of CRA anywhere and at any \ntime. I disagree very strongly with that. We will have\n\n[[Page S8980]]\n\nan extended debate on the effort to exclude some banks from CRA.\n  There is really a basic philosophical difference. We see the CRA as \nbringing people into the mainstream of economic life and involving them \nin our economic process. I have spoken to many bankers who support CRA. \nThey think it has produced good results. Federal Reserve Chairman \nGreenspan has said:\n\n       The essential purpose of the CRA is to try to encourage \n     institutions who are not involved in areas where their own \n     self-interest is involved, in doing so. If you are indicating \n     to an institution that there is a forgone business \n     opportunity in an area X or loan product Y, that is not \n     credit allocation. That, indeed, is enhancing the market.\n\n  That is Chairman Greenspan.\n  It is being portrayed by its opponents as sort of a mandatory credit \nallocation. It certainly is not that. It is an effort to ensure a \nreasonable amount of money goes back into the community.\n  A number of banks have issued statements in support of CRA. They say \nit has increased their focus on their lending performance. In fact, the \nBank of America said:\n\n       Over the past several years, Bank of America, in \n     partnership with community organizations, has developed CRA \n     lending into a profitable mainstream business.\n\n  And that is really what we are trying to achieve--a profitable \nmainstream business.'' These institutions receive deposit insurance, \nand I earlier indicated the importance of that to the workings of the \nindustry and the fact we had to produce hundreds of billions of dollars \nin the S crisis in order to deliver on that promise.\n  There was a problem with CRA over bookkeeping, recordkeeping, and so \nforth. Secretary Rubin led a major effort to revise the Federal \nregulations. This extended over a 12- to 18-month period. All groups \nwere involved--the bankers, the community groups, academics, the \nadministration. In effect, Members of the Congress were drawn into the \nprocess, and, in the end, very, very significant changes were made. As \na consequence, I think many of the defects that earlier were argued \nagainst CRA were taken care of. Much of the regulatory overburden I \nthink was removed.\n  The argument was made that these small banks hold only a fraction of \nthe assets. The fact is that in 30 States, over 80 percent of the banks \nwould be affected by the Shelby amendment. In other words, it would \nexclude 80 percent of the banks; in 6 States, over 95 percent; in 9 \nother States, over 90 percent; and the remainder, the other 15 States, \nover 80 percent.\n  Most of these are rural States, and there seems to be a perception \nthat CRA benefits only the urban areas of our country. However, rural \nareas, no less than urban areas, are affected by it. We received a \nletter from a coalition of rural and farm groups, including the \nNational Farmers Union, the National Family Farm Coalition, the \nNational Rural Housing Coalition, and the Federation of Southern \nCooperatives, in opposition to the small bank exemption for CRA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 23, 1998.\n       Dear Senator, On behalf of the undersigned organizations \n     representing rural Americans, we are writing to express our \n     strong opposition to legislative efforts to weaken the \n     coverage of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Our \n     understanding is that Senator Shelby plans to offer an \n     amendment to H.R. 1151, the credit union legislation, that is \n     scheduled for floor action. In addition, Senator Gramm plans \n     to offer an amendment that strikes provisions in H.R. 1151 \n     that would ensure that credit unions provide services to all \n     individuals of modest means within their field of membership.\n       The Shelby amendment would exempt banks under $250 million \n     in assets from CRA coverage. This affects over 85% of banks \n     nationally. For citizens in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, \n     Nebraska, and Oklahoma, 95% of the banks would be exempt.\n       Rural Americans need the tools of the Community \n     Reinvestment Act to ensure accountability of their local \n     lending institutions. It is needed to prevent rural banks \n     from abandoning their commitment to serve the millions of \n     Americans living in smaller low and moderate-income \n     communities. Unfortunately, small commercial banks do not \n     automatically reinvest in their local communities. This is \n     documented by national data on reinvestment trends and loan \n     to asset ratios for banks across the country. 50% of small \n     banks have a loan-to-deposit ratio below 70%, with 25% of \n     these having levels less than 58%. The data for 1997 reveals \n     that banks under $100 million in assets received 82% of the \n     substantial non-compliance ratings.\n       We strongly urge you to oppose these amendments to H.R. \n     1151. The Shelby amendment ignores the important regulatory \n     changes since 1995 that have significantly reduced the \n     paperwork and reporting issues for small banks. The Gramm \n     amendment will strike an important provision from the bill \n     that for the first time would require credit unions to meet \n     the financial services needs of their entire field of \n     membership.\n       A vote against these amendments will help meet the credit \n     demand of millions of family farmers, rural residents, and \n     local businesses. Thank you for considering our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n         Center for Community Change, Center for Rural Affairs, \n           Federation of Southern Cooperatives, Housing Assistance \n           Council, Intertribal Agriculture Council, Iowa Citizens \n           for Community Improvement, National Catholic Rural Life \n           Conference, National Family Farm Coalition, National \n           Farmers Union, National Rural Housing Coalition, Rural \n           Coalition and the United methodist Church, General \n           Board of Church and Society.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will quote a portion of this letter:\n\n       Rural Americans need the tools of the Community \n     Reinvestment Act to ensure accountability of their local \n     lending institutions. It is needed to prevent rural banks \n     from abandoning their commitment to serve the millions of \n     Americans living in smaller low- or moderate-income \n     communities. Unfortunately, small commercial banks do not \n     automatically reinvest in their local communities.\n\n  It is a strong view that CRA has really brought investment back into \nthe communities and that this has redounded to everyone's advantage, \nincluding--including--the advantage of the banks.\n  We think that CRA has been remarkably effective in encouraging both \nlarge and small banks to look closely at market opportunities in all of \nthe areas which they serve and in building a better relationship \nbetween the banks and the community. The result has been billions of \ndollars in market-rate profitable loans in urban and rural communities \nthat historically have had difficulty in gaining access to credit.\n  That is the basic, bottom-line message, and it is a very good \nmessage. It is a very good message for the country.\n  I very much hope that as my colleagues think through this issue, they \nwill appreciate the benefits that flow from CRA and reject the Shelby \namendment, which would exclude banks under $250 million in assets--\nwhich, as I indicated, are the overwhelming number of banks in the \ncountry--and reject the Gramm amendment which seeks to eliminate a \nmodest provision in the credit union bill that would require the credit \nunions to take a look at how they are serving their field of membership \nin their community, a provision which, I might note, the credit unions \nhave indicated they accept. In fact, their stated position to us is \nthat they support this bill as reported from the committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I must say that in the areas in which my \nranking member, friend and colleague, Senator Sarbanes and I have \nworked on in the Banking Committee, we have shared rather similar \npositions on--well, just about 80 or 90 percent of the issues we have \naddressed, whether it be on housing issues or mass transportation \nissues or issues regarding financial services. Indeed, I almost \nreluctantly come to the conclusion that this is not the appropriate \ntime to undertake expanding CRA activities by prescribing them for \ncredit unions. And just as I have cautioned my colleagues and friends--\nmost of them on the Republican side--that if we are to look at the \nbenefits, and maybe some of the effects that are not beneficial which \ncould be the unintended consequences of a well-intentioned law--and I \nhave no doubt it is well-intentioned--it is my opinion, overall, that \nCRA has been beneficial in attempting to ensure that financial \ninstitutions that accept deposits from a particular area or community, \ndirect some of those financial activities back into that community.\n\n  Now, let us not kid ourselves. I think we are disingenuous if we \nwould suggest that all institutions are sure to\n\n[[Page S8981]]\n\nmeet both a financial and moral commitment and balance both. Some of \nthese financial institutions have to be conscious of their stockholders \nand conscious of doing business in our very competitive society. And I \nthink that we would be less than candid if we were not to recognize \nthat there have been institutions over the years that have directed \ntheir investment activities with almost a singular purpose--to bring to \nthe bottom line the greatest profits that they can possibly derive, \nwithout attempting to help a community, to derive an investment \nstrategy or portfolio that would only give them the highest possible \nreturn.\n  I think it was as a result of looking at activities where communities \nand banks were gathering deposits from communities and giving little, \nif any, back and, indeed, engaged in the practice of redlining--and \nthere have been studies, these practices are documented. The Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston conducted a study that documented redlining \npractices in Boston, Massachusetts. And that is unfortunate, it is an \noutrage. But those are the facts.\n  Consequently, Congress came forth and passed legislation--and it is \nthe law of the land--that directs credit allocation to these areas that \nheretofore were not receiving it, whether they be the rural areas or \nwhether they be in the inner cities. But let us not kid ourselves. \nRedlining was taking place, and it is, again, disingenuous for any of \nour colleagues to suggest that it was not.\n  Maybe we should provide an opportunity for some of the smaller \ninstitutions that have an exemplary record--and indeed I am very \nconscious of the statements made in the 1997 Federal Reserve report, \nthat there were only nine--only nine out of the thousands of community \nbanks that were cited for inadequate investment, not meeting the goals \nof CRA. That is a great, great record. Maybe we could find a solution \nwhere there is a less frequent accounting or reporting process that \nwould ease the burden, particularly for institutions that have \ndemonstrated that they do care, that they have a concern, and that they \nmeet their social responsibility. That is why CRA came about--to see to \nit that it was not just to get the highest yield every time, because \nCongress said, ``We insure these, and we think there should be some \neffort made at allocating credit, yes, in communities that might not \notherwise be as attractive for investment purposes.''\n  That is what we are talking about. That is how CRA came about. So \nwhile I am sympathetic to the unintended burdens that may have been \ncreated, I also am appreciative of the fact that there have been \nbillions of dollars as a result of this program that have been invested \nin rural areas, in rural America, and in urban centers that may not \nhave otherwise benefitted from investment. This practice has, in turn, \ncreated profits, jobs, opportunity and hope for Americans that \notherwise wouldn't be.\n  Having said that, I am arguing on one side why we should not at this \ntime be looking to simply wipe out CRA legislation affecting community \nbanks. I am willing to discuss this matter, willing to hold hearings \nand willing to go forward and examine, What alternative solutions can \nease burdens that may exist? But by the same token, regarding CRA-like \nimplications for credit unions, I just believe it is wrong. We are \ntalking about groups of people, cooperatives, who come together by \ntheir very nature.\n  When we look at this matter more closely--Monday, I intend to look at \nthe profile of the credit union member. I have to tell you, they meet \nthe description when we try to encourage making available moneys and \nresources and to see to it, whether it be the community banks or all \nthe financial institutions, that they become involved. And that is why \nthey have come together. Their very profile, absolutely in terms of \ndemographics, in terms of per capita income, meets the needs that we \nhave tried to establish overall through CRA.\n  I believe it is absolutely counterproductive to say to the very \npeople of these cooperatives--nonprofit institutions, have moneys that \ngo right back into that institution; it is their capital, not the \nindividual who earns more, or takes out more, or a stockholder--that we \nthen place this requirement on them when it has never been demonstrated \nto be necessary. Indeed a letter from the NCUA attests to that fact. I \nwill just read part of this letter. It was written to Phil Bechtel, \nchief counsel for the Senate Banking Committee, June 1, 1998, signed by \nRobert Loftus, director of Public Congressional Affairs.\n  It says, ``Our investigations have not produced any evidence''--any \nevidence--``that credit unions are guilty of redlining or other \ndiscriminatory practices.''\n  Given that history, let us move forward--I support this legislation, \nbut I believe that the Senator from Texas is right in moving to strike \nthis provision. I also strongly believe that, to those of my colleagues \nwho want to give regulatory relief to the small banks and community \nbanks, as well intentioned as they are, their efforts will absolutely \ndo nothing but delay, bring about more confusion, and the charges that \nin their attempt to do provide relief to small banks, what they are \nreally doing is trying to defeat this legislation. I think whether it \nis an unintended consequence or not, that is exactly how it is going to \nbe portrayed. And I will say on the floor to my colleagues: Recognize \nwhat you are doing, recognize that you want to be loved by all.\n  I think that the point can be made. I think we can fight for \nregulatory relief. There are times and places to do it. But this is not \nthe time nor the place. If this was the last boat going out of town, \nthen fine, we would do it. I think there are a couple other areas where \nI could suggest that my colleagues address this issue of relief for \nsmall banks, if they really want to see this legislation enacted. And \nit would be appropriate to undertake that, but not here, and not on \nthis credit union bill.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is here, \nand I know he wants to speak to this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the distinguished Senator from New York for \nyielding to me. I congratulate him and his colleague, Senator Sarbanes, \nfor bringing this legislation before us.\n  I want to take this opportunity to restate my support for Delaware's \ncredit unions. As we all know, months ago, a Supreme Court decision \nplaced the viability and future of credit unions in limbo. For that \nreason, I am particularly pleased that the Senate will be voting next \nweek on H.R. 1151, a bill to ensure credit unions will be able to add \nnew member groups.\n  Mr. President, I support credit unions because I know how vital they \nare to the financial health of thousands of Delaware families and \nbusinesses. These nonprofit member-run institutions are unique. Their \nsole purpose is to provide financial services to their members at the \nbest rates and under the most favorable conditions possible.\n  Savvy consumers know that credit unions are often a great option. \nTheir ATM fees are reasonable or nonexistent; single-digit credit card \ninterest rates are common at credit unions; and your child's first \nsavings account won't face a monthly low-balance fee. I don't think I \nmentioned, I say to my distinguished Senator from New York, you can \nalso set up a Roth IRA.\n  All Senators have undoubtedly heard from the thousands of credit \nunion members in their States. Their message is one of self-sufficiency \nand of low-cost, low-fee consumer-based financial services. Credit \nunions are good for families, good for businesses, and they are good \nfor Delaware.\n  H.R. 1115 is necessary for these valuable institutions to thrive.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman of the Banking Committee and the \nranking member for their role in bringing this legislation to this \npoint. I look forward to voting for this legislation next Monday.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee for his help and his work. Indeed, he and his \nstaff are working on important legislation with Senator Allard, and I \nbelieve the Presiding Officer and others have signed on to give some \ntax relief to the small community banks.\n  The Senator and his staff have been most cooperative in helping to \nmove it forward. I hope we would even have an opportunity to do \nsomething this year.\n\n[[Page S8982]]\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, notwithstanding all the advice we have \nreceived from Senator Sarbanes and Senator D'Amato in regard to how \nworld banks make their loans or don't, and what is in the minds of \ncountry bankers all throughout the Nation, and without CRA we simply \nwouldn't have ever made a loan in rural America, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support H.R. 1151, the Credit Union \nMembership Access Act, but I strongly oppose the amendments being \noffered by Senator Gramm and Senator Shelby. Credit unions have a \ndistinguished history of providing affordable financial services to \nAmerica's low- and moderate-income communities. This legislation will \nhelp them continue to do that.\n  It is ironic that we are now debating the issue of whether banks and \ncredit unions should serve low- and moderate-income communities and to \nreinvest in the communities in which they receive deposits. \nMassachusetts has 317 credit unions, at 1.7 million members. They have \nhad community reinvestment obligations for many years, and they have \ndone an excellent job of meeting needs of consumers at all income \nlevels. Massachusetts credit unions are a model for the Nation. The \nvast majority of banks take their community reinvestment obligation \nseriously in meeting these obligations.\n  The Massachusetts Bankers Associations, whose member banks are doing \nexcellent work in community reinvestment, does not support the Shelby \namendment. Institutions which have received outstanding ratings, like \nBank of Boston and Citizens Bank, are using the Community Reinvestment \nAct to provide profitable lines of business.\n  Senator Shelby's amendment to eliminate the Community Reinvestment \nAct for 85 percent of the banks would eliminate an important source of \naffordable credit and financial services from low- and moderate-income \nfamilies who are bankable. Massachusetts banks do not support this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Senator Gramm's amendment would say to credit unions who are being \ngranted expanded power, they have no obligation to serve members of \nmodest means. Both these amendments are bad policy.\n  In this period of sustained economic growth, it is vital that all \nfamilies have the opportunity to obtain credit in order to buy a home, \nstart a small business, or send a child to college. The Community \nReinvestment Act has a long history of success. Since 1992, it has \nhelped banks to extend over $800 billion in loans for housing, small \nbusinesses, economic development and local communities across the \nNation.\n  As many have said, there is no capitalism without capital. We should \noppose any effort to reduce access to credit which families need in \norder to buy a home, to start or expand a business, and send their \nchildren to college. The Community Reinvestment Act is not charity. It \ncreates a positive obligation for banks to reinvest in communities from \nwhich they receive deposits. It is good business and it helps \ncommunities, businesses, and families nationwide; requiring similar \ninvestments by credit unions is good policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this important piece of legislation and \nto oppose these two amendments. It hurts all those who want a better \nfuture for themselves and their families, and it hurts our inner cities \nand rural communities who are rebuilding. Most of all, they reverse 20 \nyears of successful reimbursement in our neighborhoods, and it deserves \nto be defeated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/24/senate-section/article/S8956-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, since the Republican leadership plan on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights was introduced a week ago, we have been \nholding meetings and forums with doctors and nurses and patients to \nexplore the critical issues that must be addressed if a Patients' Bill \nof Rights is to be worthy of the name.\n  In each case, the message has been the same. The problems created by \nHMOs and managed care are pervasive in our health system. Every doctor \nand patient knows that. Too often, managed care is mismanaged care. \nEvery doctor and patient knows that medical decisions that should be \nmade by doctors and patients are being made by insurance company \naccountants, and every doctor and patient knows that profits, not \npatients' care, have become the priority of too many health insurance \ncompanies.\n  And at each of the forums we have held, the message from doctors and \nnurses and patients has been the same: Pass the bipartisan Patients' \nBill of Rights. Reject the Republican leadership plan; it leaves out \ntoo many critical protections and it leaves out too many patients. Even \nthe protections it claims to offer are full of loopholes. It is a \nprogram to protect industry profits, not patients.\n  One of the most critical issues that needs to be addressed in \nlegislation is the right of people with serious illnesses, like cancer, \nto get the high-quality specialty care they need. If the conventional \ntreatments fail, they should have the opportunity to participate in \nclinical trials that offer them hope for improvement or a cure, and \nthat can contribute to finding a better treatment for future patients. \nOur legislation provides for these rights; the Republican plan does \nnot.\n  Yesterday, we heard from Dr. Casimir, a distinguished Texas \noncologist. Dr. Casimir talked about some heartbreaking stories of \ncancer patients whose HMOs delay and deny access to specialty care, \noften until it is too late. She said that when she gets a patient whose \ncancer progressed substantially from the initial diagnosis to the time \nthey are allowed to receive specialty care, she often flips to the \nfront of the chart, and 9 times out of 10, the insurer is an HMO. Every \ncentimeter a cancer grows can mean the difference between a good chance \nat life and the likelihood of death. Every centimeter represents \npotentially devastating and avoidable pain, suffering and sometimes the \ndeath of a patient. Dr. Casimir's message was clear: Pass the Patients' \nBill of Rights so that more patients will not die needlessly.\n  Today, we heard from Dr. Bruce Chabner, a distinguished clinical \noncologist and cancer researcher. This is what the doctor had to say:\n\n       My name is Bruce Chabner and I am a medical oncologist and \n     cancer researcher. I am here to support the Patients' Bill of \n     Rights that would require HMOs and insurance companies to \n     support clinical research. I would like to explain briefly \n     the role of insurance coverage in research. Most of the costs \n     in clinical research are associated with the cost of \n     discovery. Laboratory experiments in the development of new \n     treatments are supported by the Government grants, by \n     industry, and by institutional commitments by hospitals and \n     medical schools.\n       These contributions provide the hundreds of millions of \n     dollars that lead to new treatments and new hope to millions \n     of our patients with cancer. However, the clinical treatment \n     of these patients requires support for the routine care \n     associated with these clinical trials. The only source of \n     such support for routine care costs is health insurance and \n     HMO contributions.\n       This is the final step in proving that a new treatment or a \n     new device actually works in people. Without this step, \n     research is meaningless and has no impact on people, nor does \n     it save lives. We are not asking the insurance companies and \n     HMOs to support the vast effort to discover new treatments or \n     to bring them to the clinics. We are not asking for support \n     for the cost of analyzing data and support during the \n     clinical trials. We are only asking them to continue support \n     for the patients' care costs.\n\n[[Page S8983]]\n\n       I am sure that every Member of Congress who is faced with \n     the awful dilemma of cancer would want this kind of continued \n     support for their family members. The research provides the \n     only hope our patients have of conquering this disease and \n     the only hope our society has for curing cancer.\n\n  Now, I just want to mention this one more time, Mr. President. Under \nour Patients' Bill of Rights, we are guaranteeing the specialty care \nand clinical trials. For example, if your family or you were affected \nby cancer, you would not only be able to go to an oncologist, but you \nwould be able to go to one of the great cancer centers that we have in \nthis country to be able to get treatment. You would be able to get the \nspecialty care that you need. If you believe you are being denied that \nparticular care, you are able to go in to have an internal appeal and \nan external appeal, which must be responded to promptly. But you will \nget it; we guarantee it, under the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  We guarantee that you will be able to participate in a clinical trial \nif it is medically necessary--if your doctor says it is medically \nnecessary. Clinical trials can be the source of enormous hope for \nmillions of Americans who are afflicted by cancer. There are 47,000 \nwomen who die each year from breast cancer, and there is extraordinary \nresearch that is taking place that offers great hope for millions of \nwomen.\n  Under this proposal, under the Patients' Bill of Rights, we are \nguaranteeing that if it is medically proven, you can get into a \nclinical trial. What kind of financial burden does this place on an \nHMO? Does it say to the HMO, well, you are going to have to pay all of \nthese additional expenses? Absolutely not. The clinical trial is being \npaid for by the medical center; the clinical trial is being paid for by \nthe pharmaceutical company; the clinical trial is being paid for by the \nfinancial strength of the particular clinical center.\n  The only thing that the HMO would have to pay for is routine \nservices--do we understand that?--which they would otherwise be \nrequired to pay. Those that oppose this provision say, well, if you \nrequire that they get clinical trials, it is going to bankrupt the HMO. \nThat is preposterous, that is wrong, that is deceptive, and that is a \ncritical misinterpretation of our legislation.\n  As our distinguished clinical researchers pointed out today, once \nagain, the kind of treatment that is necessary for these clinical \ntrials is provided by the center, not by the patient or the HMO. The \nonly requirements by the HMO would be routine care. Quite frankly, the \nHMO would be obligated to provide routine care in any event. So that \ndoes not adversely impact the HMO financially. Still, we have the \nreluctance and resistance to guarantee this in the Patients' Bill of \nRights. I don't understand it. That is one of the reasons we ought to \nhave a debate on this issue.\n  How many Members in this body know the allocation of expenditures on \nclinical trials? I doubt if there are 5 or 10. I cannot understand why \nany Member of the Senate is saying not do it if it is medically \nnecessary, because the HMO is not going to be burdened with substantial \nadditional costs. That isn't the way it works.\n  As I mentioned, 47,000 women die every single year. There are these \nclinical trials that are taking place in the great medical centers all \nover this country. And if a doctor says he believes, based upon the \ntype of clinical trial and the kind of need that you are facing--to a \nwoman that has been biopsied in her breast, and where a tumor is \npresent--there is an opportunity and likelihood that you might survive, \nwe believe that ought to be available. That is the best medical \npractice. Insurance companies were providing that protection for years \nbefore we had the HMOs. This wasn't even an issue for years and years, \nMr. President. Now it is. And the principal reasons that the cancer \noncologists and the cancer organizations support our proposal is \nbecause they see the fact that HMOs are denying this kind of treatment.\n  Mr. President, we had Ms. Stekley, who was the head of clinical \nresearch at the Lombardi Center out here in Washington, D.C. She said \nthat 80 percent of their administrative time is spent arguing with the \nHMOs to let people into their clinical trials--not because they are \nprofiting financially, but because they believe that they can help the \npeople, from a health point of view--80 percent of their administrative \ntime. This person was almost in tears saying, ``Senator, we can help \npeople survive, and it isn't going to cost the HMO any additional \nresources. Your proposal does the trick.''\n  What is possibly wrong with having that particular inclusion in any \nprotection for a Patients' Bill of Rights? I cannot understand it, Mr. \nPresident. I cannot believe that we don't have a full opportunity to \ndebate this issue in this body on this one issue, and that we will not \nbe successful. It is enormously important to do two things: One, to \nhave a guarantee that you can have a specialist; and, two, if it is \nmedically recommended, you can have a clinical trial based upon medical \nevidence. And if you do not, then you are going to get a speedy right \nof appeal. And you contrast that with the top researchers who testified \njust yesterday, how they look at their patients, and have seen the \nvarious tumors that have grown day by day, week by week, month by \nmonth, and seeing the chance of these women's survival declining \ndramatically--because of what? Because of two things.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  For two things: Because they were late getting to a specialist, and \nbecause they were excluded from any opportunities for the clinical \ntrials.\n  The HMOs thought they could handle it. The HMOs thought they had \nsomeone on their panel who could handle this particular kind of cancer, \neven though right down the street there was a major international \ncenter that specialized in this very program.\n  Under the Republican program, access to clinical trials is not \nguaranteed--it isn't even an appealable item. Even if it were, will the \nappeal be established by an independent group? No. It will be \nestablished by the HMO. They name the people whom this will be appealed \nto. Then, if that person is harmed with grievous bodily injury, or \ndeath, under our Republican program there is no remedy.\n  Mr. President, this is the kind of issue that we ought to have an \nopportunity to debate. We just took one provision today with regard \nespecially to clinical trials. We had a few others. But the time has \nmoved on and I will wait for another time.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to the \nspeech by Mr. Kennedy, and I look forward to hearing him speak on \nfurther decisions on this subject.\n  And I wish to thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nGrams, who has stated that his speech today might last 40 minutes, and \nhe was very considerate to ask me how long I would be speaking. And he \nsuggested that I proceed with my remarks ahead of him, because he would \nwant to speak for about 40 minutes. I think it is most gracious and \nconsiderate of the Senator, and I thank him. And his good deeds will be \nrepaid in kind at some future date.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I, too, want to thank my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia, because the Senator heard that I wanted to address the Senate \non this matter, which I considered of some importance, and was willing \nto accommodate my schedule as well, for which I am very grateful. It is \ntypical of the great thoughtfulness that all of us have understood to \nbe a part of the Senator from West Virginia but which we are reminded \nabout so frequently. I thank the good Senator for his generosity and \nfor his thoughtfulness.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Massachusetts. I am \nmerely repaying a good deed that he did for me a week or so ago when he \nallowed me to go ahead of him. And by virtue of his doing so, when I \ncompleted my remarks and other Senators got recognition, Senator \nKennedy had to wait still longer. Well, I thank all Senators. And this \nis one of the things that makes it a joy to serve in this body.\n  Mr. President, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The general orders are that speeches are \nlimited to 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S8984]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I may need a little longer than 10 minutes. \nI ask unanimous consent that I may speak not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I may not use that much time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/24/senate-section/article/S8982-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8984-S8985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MIXED SIGNALS FROM THE PENTAGON\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, one week ago today, a small ceremony took \nplace in the Pentagon at which the three senior leaders of the United \nStates Army unveiled a series of posters depicting each of the seven \ncore values of the Army. They are noteworthy values--Loyalty, Duty, \nRespect, Selfless-Service, Honor, Integrity, Personal Courage. They \nsend a strong message to the world about the values that shape \nAmerica's fighting forces.\n  Three days later, Defense Department officials sent a very different \nmessage from the Pentagon regarding core values when they took the \nwraps off a proposal that would relax the military code of honor \nconcerning adultery. According to the news accounts I have read, \nSecretary Cohen is expected to propose within the next few weeks a new \napproach to dealing with cases of adultery in the military that would \nlimit prosecutions--limit prosecutions--and ease automatic penalties.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully ask, what on earth has gotten into the \nleadership of the Defense Department?\n  Each of our services is founded on a set of bedrock principles. I \nhave just recited the Army's. For the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, the \ncore values are honor, courage, and commitment. The core values of the \nAir Force are integrity, service, and excellence.\n  These values form the moral guideposts for the men and women of \nAmerica's armed forces.\n  Whether we are talking about the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marines, \nwe are talking about a group of exceptional individuals in whom we as a \nnation place extraordinary trust and from whom we exact exceptional \nstandards of courage, leadership, and moral conduct.\n  These standards, demanding though they are, have served our nation \nwell for more than two hundred years. They are the virtues that \nundergirded the American Revolution and helped General George \nWashington's Army endure the bitter winter at Valley Forge. They are \nthe principles that elevated the American Civil War from a duel between \nstates to a crusade that cemented the unity of a nation. They are the \nvalues that guided our troops to victory over the most evil power of \nthe twentieth century--the forces of Adolph Hitler--during World War \nII.\n  Honor, Duty, Respect, Integrity, Courage and Commitment make up a \nnoble list. This roster of virtues is one that our men and women in \nuniform have, from this nation's founding, embraced with pride.\n  I admire the dedication of our military forces. I admire their \nwillingness to hold themselves to a higher standard. I believe that the \ncore values they embody are as important as all the skills and training \nand equipment this nation can marshal in making America's armed forces \nmighty and powerful, the best in the world. That has always been the \nway with American military forces. We saw in World War II the most \npowerful, the mightiest armed force in the world, the best armies that \never walked the earth.\n  And so I ask again, what on earth has gotten into the leadership of \nthe Department of Defense?\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to note that the Marine Corps has \nresponded to the call to lower the bar on adultery with the equivalent \nof Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe's response to the Germans' \ndemand to surrender during the Battle of the Bulge. In a word, \n``Nuts!''\n  And so I salute the Marine Corps for taking that stand.\n  Let me just say that again. I think it needs to be said, and I hope \nthat the Secretary of Defense will hear me.\n  I am pleased to note that the Marine Corps has responded to the call \nto lower the bar on adultery with the equivalent of Brigadier General \nAnthony McAuliffe's response to the Germans' demand to surrender during \nthe Battle of the Bulge. In a word, ``Nuts.''\n  God bless the Marines. God bless the Marine Corps. And God bless that \nword ``Nuts,'' because that is the response of the Marine Corps.\n  For a service whose motto, Semper Fidelis, means ``Always Faithful,'' \nthe Marine Corps' unwillingness to compromise its core values is \ncommendable. I salute the Marine Corps. I hope that the leadership of \nthe Army, Navy, and Air Force will follow suit. At a time when the \nreputation and the morale of the military have taken a serious \nbattering as a result of the conduct of some of its leaders, I am \nfrankly amazed that the Secretary of Defense would even entertain such \nan ill-conceived proposal.\n  The recent and highly publicized instances of adultery, sexual \nharassment, and rape within America's military have wounded the \nprestige of our armed services and have ruined individual lives, \nfamilies, and careers. The uneven handling of several high profile \ncases--ranging from swift and harsh punishment meted out to enlisted \npersonnel and junior officers to an apparent blind eye turned to the \nmisconduct of certain high-ranking officers--has only exacerbated the \nproblem and led to the perception of a double standard in the military.\n  I sympathize with the many problems facing our military leadership in \ntoday's volatile international environment. Resources are scarce, \nforces are stretched thin, and tensions are mounting in potential \ntrouble spots around the world. But leadership requires the ability to \nset a good example and stand by one's principles, regardless of how \ndifficult that may be. The solution to the moral and ethical turmoil \nthreatening to engulf today's U.S. military forces is not to lower the \nstandards to the level of the least common denominator. The solution is \nto restore and to apply the discipline and unique military code of \nconduct equally and across the board.\n  In this country, we have always looked up to the military for \nleadership and role models. What kind of a message does this proposal \nsend to our young people, who are struggling to define their values in \na society that increasingly seems to hold core values in contempt? How \nare parents supposed to explain this sea change in the military's moral \ncode to their children? What is the Defense Department thinking? Why on \nearth is the Pentagon sending such mixed messages to the men and women \nin uniform? Even that nonsensical term ``political correctness'' does \nnot require this.\n  If the Secretary of Defense is willing to entertain a proposal that \nwould essentially treat adultery--conduct that inherently involves \ndishonor, lying, and cheating--with a wink and a nod, what comes next? \nWill it be okay to cheat on an exam at the military academies if the \ninstructor is too tough? Will ``little white lies'' be acceptable to \nget out of unpleasant duties? Will the occasional dereliction of duty \nbe overlooked as long as no one gets hurt? Will the Marines be asked to \nchange their motto from ``Always Faithful'' to ``Usually Faithful'' or \n``Sometimes Faithful''? If so asked, I have a feeling the Marines will \nsay ``nuts.''\n  The core values of America's military services are not there for \nwindow dressing. Taken together, they form the basis of a sacred trust. \nIt is a trust that must extend to placing one's life in the hands of \none's comrades. It is a trust that goes up the chain of command and \ndown the chain of command and across the chain of command. It is trust \nthat is absolute--there can be no shades of gray on the battlefield. \nThere can be no shades of gray at the helm of the ship in the storm. \nThere can be no shades of gray in the cockpit.\n  I hope that the Secretary of Defense will rethink this misguided \nproposal to weaken the rules governing adultery and fraternization in \nthe military. The effect can only be to erode the time-honored military \nprinciples that have served our Nation throughout its history, in \npeacetime and in war. Our nation's military leadership, including the \nSecretary of Defense, who once served here as a very able Senator and \nrespected colleague, must draw a line in the sand when it comes to the \nmoral conduct of the armed services. The services must not be seduced \ninto exchanging their code of conduct for a code of convenience.\n  Again, I salute the Marines for their unwillingness to compromise \ntheir\n\n[[Page S8985]]\n\nstandards, and I call on Secretary Cohen to reject this and any other \nproposal that would compromise the integrity of this nation's military \nforces.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I again thank my friend from \nMinnesota, Senator Grams, for his kindness and courtesy.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for \nup to 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? The Chair hears none, \nand it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to make three separate statements, \none dealing with Social Security, looking at the background and the \nhistory of the program as we move toward possible debate on change and \nreforms. Also, a statement supporting Senator Shelby on his amendment \ndealing with CRA and small banks. And also a brief statement on the \nGovernment Shutdown Prevention Act, which is aimed at trying to pass \nlegislation that will prevent the Government from shutting down in the \nfuture even if Congress cannot reach an agreement on budget or \nappropriation matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/24/senate-section/article/S8984-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8985-S8987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE GENDER/RACE GAP\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in my continuing series of statements on \nthe troubled Social Security program, I have discussed the history of \nSocial Security, the program's looming crisis, and the old-age \ninsurance reform efforts undertaken by other nations.\n  Today, I want to discuss an aspect of Social Security that often gets \ndistorted in the reform debates going on throughout this great nation.\n  It is the issue of how the current Social Security system puts women \nand minorities at a greater financial risk and disadvantage than other \nretirees face today.\n  We must address the questions of how these Americans will fare under \nany reform of the current system, so we can empower them with the \nability to have a more secure retirement future than that which Social \nSecurity promises today.\n  First, it is essential to understand why these Americans were put at \na disadvantage in a system supposedly established to help them. To do \nthat, we must go back to the beginnings of the Social Security program.\n  When Social Security was first enacted in the 1930s, the \ndiscriminative elements were inherently built into the system. \nProfessor Edward Berkowitz of George Washington University has done \nexcellent research on this subject.\n  According to his studies, policy makers taking part in the first \nSocial Security advisory council freely indulged in racial and sexual \nstereotypes. They made a widow's benefit equal to only three-quarters \nof the value of a single man's benefit.\n  Their rationale for the decision was, according to one member, that a \n``widow could look out for herself better than the man could.''\n  Douglas Brown, the chairman of the advisory council, even suggested \nthat a single woman could adjust to a lower budget ``on account of the \nfact that she is used to doing her own housework whereas the single man \nhas to go to a restaurant.''\n  Another example of Social Security's inherently discriminative nature \nis that domestic workers were not covered by Social Security when the \nprogram was set up.\n  One early policy maker explained that it was difficult to collect \ncontributions from the ``colored woman . . . who goes from house to \nhouse for a day's work here and a day's work there.''\n  Clearly, things were different then.\n  At that time, most women stayed home, and only 6 people out of 10 \nreached age 65.\n  Despite the fact that the Social Security program provided an \nopportunity to redistribute income from wealthier individuals to low-\nincome retirees--an effort to help provide assistance to those less \nfortunate--the inequality of women and minorities was never adequately \naddressed.\n  In fact, the disparity has grown under the current Social Security \nsystem.\n  The profile of today's retiree is quite different than it was in the \n1930s and continues to change.\n  More women today are working outside the home, less than half of \nAmerica's working women receive pensions today, life expectancy is \nincreasing, while minority populations continue to grow in number.\n  But our Social Security system has failed to make the needed \nadjustments. As a result, financial gender and racial gaps are growing \nlarger for those retired or nearing retirement. Women and minorities \nare suffering under the current Social Security system.\n  For women and minorities, average income continues to remain low. \nThis means there is less money available to personally save for one's \nown retirement.\n  Furthermore, payroll taxes have increased 36 times over the last 27 \nyears, forcing families to squeeze more out of less take-home pay.\n  According to the Heritage Foundation, today's payroll taxes consume \nas much of the family budget as do costs for housing, and nearly three \ntimes more than annual health care.\n  So it is not surprising that growing numbers of women and minorities \nare becoming increasingly dependent upon their Social Security checks. \nIf we are going to successfully raise their quality of life once they \nreach retirement age, we must begin to look outside the proverbial box \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I would like to begin by focusing on women, since they \nare disproportionately dependent upon Social Security. There are a \nnumber of factors that create this reliance.\n  While we can rally around the idea that our Social Security system is \nsupposedly ``gender neutral,'' issues such as income levels, years out \nof the workforce, and marital status all impact a woman's retirement \nsecurity.\n  At the forefront of the issue is the fact that women tend to outlive \nmen, just as they have been doing for the past 500 years. With today's \nretirees beginning to collect benefits at age 65, it is not unlikely \nfor a woman to spend nearly one-fourth of her life on Social Security.\n  And because women statistically receive lower benefits than men, \ntypically have fewer saving, and are less likely to have a pension, it \nmeans they are forced to live longer on less.\n  We are finding that a retirement security system that was termed a \nsuccess in the past threatens future female retirees the most.\n  Over the past few decades, women have made great progress in the \nworkplace.\n  Today, there are more women working at higher-paying jobs. But \naccording to the General Accounting Office, the labor force \nparticipation rate for women aged 25 to 34 remains at 75 percent, and \nonly four-fifths that of men.\n  Further complicating the issue is that when women do work, 25 percent \nwork part-time. There are a variety of reasons for this, including the \nfact that women are more likely to take time off for family reasons.\n  However, it leads to fewer opportunities for benefit coverage--\nincluding pensions--and lower earnings, and ultimately, less reserve \nmoney to save for themselves and their future.\n  Today, the average female retiree earns approximately $621 per month, \ncompared to her male counterpart at $810 per month.\n  The formula used to calculate benefits for women, as well as men, \nassumes the highest 35 years of earnings. Today, nearly 75 percent of \nwomen earn $25,000 or less. For those years an individual is out of \nwork--for instance, taking time off to raise a family or care for an \nailing loved one--the salary is counted as ``zero.''\n  In addition, any length of time less than 35 years of working count \nas ``zero'' earnings. As a result, the median number of years with \n``zero'' earnings for workers turning 62 in 1993 was 15 years for \nwomen, compared to only 4 years for men.\n  This means nearly half the years being considered in the benefit \nformula for women are counted as ``zero'' earnings years and the \naverage salary for earning years is $25,000 or less.\n  Currently, there are some advocating the benefits formula be raised \nto 38 years.\n  While the number of working women continues to grow, the Social \nSecurity Administration's own projections reveal that only 30 percent \nof female retirees in 2020 will have 38 years of earnings--compared to \nabout 60 percent of their male counterparts.\n\n[[Page S8986]]\n\n  This is extremely detrimental to unmarried women who either divorced \nbefore 10 years of marriage or never married, because their benefit \ncalculations are exclusively dependent upon their own earnings \ncalculations.\n  And currently, the poverty rate for elderly divorced, separated, or \nnever-married women is the highest of any group--nearly 30 percent.\n  But marriage in and of itself doesn't always improve a woman's \nsituation.\n  In fact, 64 percent of all elderly women living in poverty are \nwidows. This is because when a spouse dies, the widow's benefits are \nreduced by up to one-half. Meanwhile, statistics show that to live \nalone, a widow requires at least 75 percent of what it costs as a \ncouple.\n  Furthermore, if a widow has yet to reach age 65 when a spouse dies, \nand has no dependent children, she is not entitled to any survivor \nbenefits. Thus, without private savings, the benefit reduction leaves \nmost widows financially unprepared for retirement.\n  Let me share with you the real story of two women. Susan of Colorado \nmade an annual income of $20,000, and she paid the 12.4 percent payroll \ntax into the Social Security system from each of her paychecks while \nraising kids, sending them to schools, and seeing them married.\n  But when Susan died at age 64, she left nothing from Social Security \nfor her children.\n  Joan of New York, a 46-year-old homemaker, never worked outside the \nhome after being married, and instead chose to raise her children.\n  Her husband was self-employed, and paid a 15.3 percent payroll tax \ninto the Social Security and Medicare programs. When Joan's husband \ndied of a heart attack at age 49, all she received from Social Security \nwas $200 for his funeral.\n  Since she has no skills to help her find a job, no savings, and gets \nno help from Social Security despite the thousands and thousands of \ndollars her family poured into the system, Joan is now helpless and \nsuffering from depression.\n  I then ask if the system is so harmful to women, why are there so \nmany out there arguing against change? How can we sit back and hold \nwomen hostage to a program for nostalgia's sake?\n  I would argue we cannot, and it is our job to ensure that every woman \nhas an opportunity to live out her golden years in financial security. \nAnd I agree we must dispel the ``myths'' that threaten efforts to \nimprove women's retirement security.\n  One fact-based ``myth'' is that because women may feel less confident \nabout their retirement security, we will be unable to change it for the \nbetter.\n  First and foremost, it is critical to ensure that current and future \nbeneficiaries remain unaffected by any change to the Social Security \nprogram if they choose to stay with the traditional system. We made a \ncovenant with our older Americans and have a responsibility to protect \nthem from any uncertainty during the transition from a pay-as-you-go \nsystem to a future funded one.\n\n  But we also have a responsibility to future beneficiaries to clearly \nnotify them that without dramatic change to the system, they will not \nreceive adequate benefits from Social Security.\n  They are more likely to see reductions in alternative means of \nsavings as a result of the economic impact of the system going \nbankrupt. Because women are living longer than men, they are most \nlikely to experience the hardship longer.\n  As Members of Congress, we owe it to women to preserve and improve \ntheir retirement security.\n  The next fact-based ``myth'' is that because women are less likely to \ntake financial risks, their earnings may be less than their male \ncounterparts under a market-based system.\n  It is true, statistically, that women have historically invested more \nconservatively than men. Furthermore, women may have less invested in \noutside accounts than men.\n  But it is interesting to note that according to the National \nAssociation of Investors Corporation, all-women investment clubs earn \nhigher returns than all-men clubs do. Who says women cannot make \nfinancial decisions?\n  Even under the most conservative investment strategies, such as \nsuper-safe U.S. Treasury Bonds, women fare better than they would under \nthe current system.\n  According to a recent Cato Institute study, if women retiring in 1981 \nwere provided the opportunity to invest their savings in personal \nretirement accounts with earnings sharing, the average single woman \ncould expect to receive 57.9 percent more in retirement benefits and \nthe average female divorcee could expect 67.2 percent more.\n  The average widow could expect 96.5 percent more, nearly double the \nbenefits than under Social Security. The average wife could expect to \nreceive 207.5 percent more than under the existing Social Security \nprogram.\n  While the National Center for Women and Retirement Research has found \nwomen may feel less confident about making financial decisions, there \nis no reason to believe women lack the skills to understand the \nchallenges and long-term benefits of investments. Pension experts agree \nthat education is a critical factor in helping individuals make better \ninvestment choices, and the GAO has found evidence that investor \neducation can help to alleviate the problem.\n  So even though some advocates of the status quo argue men may fare \n``better'' than women under a market-based system, I believe they are \nmissing the point that both would fare better than they do under the \ncurrent system. It appears as though some would prefer ``equality'' in \nmisery than the potential for some ``inequality'' at a much higher \nstandard of living for all. Furthermore, there is nothing to show that \nwomen retirees could not fare better than men, even though, \nstatistically, they are not doing so now under the current system.\n  One of the most troubling fact-based myths is that the current system \nprotects women from running out of benefits before they die more than a \npersonal retirement account would. The premise is that since women live \nlonger than men do, they will need benefits longer. Under the current \nsystem, retirees are promised benefits until death, even though on \naverage, they exhaust their contributions within the first five years \nof retirement. In a system of personal retirement accounts, benefits \nwould be based upon one's own contributions, the age at which one \nretires, and the performance of their account.\n  It is true that women, again, tend to outlive men. And yes, it is \ntrue that an independent study found women are more likely than men to \nspend a lump sum distribution from a defined contribution plan. \nHowever, that should not imply that women could not be trusted with a \nprivate savings account. In fact, that same study showed women are \nequally as likely as men to rollover lump sums from a defined benefit \nplan into an IRA, or to save and invest the money. We must also \nremember these studies are based upon the current situation, where \nthese men and women anticipate uninterrupted benefits from Social \nSecurity.\n  In the future, however, if the current system remains unchanged, a \nmaximum of 75 percent of the current benefit level will be available to \nretirees. In other words, future retirees could expect to lose 25 \npercent of retirement benefits. Once the IOU's that now make up the \nSocial Security trust fund begin being cashed in, the economy will \nsuffer, employment rates may suffer, taxes may need to be raised, and \nthe ability for an individual to prepare for the reduction in Social \nSecurity benefits will be significantly reduced.\n  Mr. President, I would say to those arguing for the status quo that \nurging women to hold out for some future promise of benefits that are \nnot likely to be there is folly. And in fact, holding out will likely \nleave women increasingly dependent upon their benefits at the same time \nthose benefits are being reduced.\n  But as I mentioned earlier, women are not the only individuals being \nmisled by some in the debate. Race continues to be an important factor \nin determining the retirement security for some Americans. Retirement \nstudies similar to those that focus on women have looked at minority \nworkers, and I would like to briefly touch on the Hispanic and African-\nAmerican populations.\n  By all accounts, the Hispanic population is relatively youthful. \nHowever,\n\n[[Page S8987]]\n\nas the Social Security system approaches insolvency and the rate of \nreturn on these workers' investments declines, Hispanics will be forced \nto bear a disproportionate share of that growing financial burden. The \nCensus Bureau estimates that by the year 2050, Hispanics will make up \nnearly 25 percent of the work force, compared with only 11 percent last \nyear. This will come at the same time tax rates, if the system stays \nthe same, will need to be increased to cover the bankrupt trust \nfund. Some have estimated that the tax rate increase would have to be \nnearly 40 percent by then to cover benefit expenses--40 percent first \nfor Social Security expenses. Such a tax burden promises to severely \nhamper the ability of young Hispanics to save for themselves.\n\n  But what do all those numbers mean? The Heritage Foundation did a \nmodel of a Hispanic community. They assumed 50,000 people lived there--\nall families of four made up of dual- income 30-year olds with two \nkids. By forcing these families to throw their payroll taxes into the \nSocial Security system, the analysts estimated the community, as a \nwhole, lost $12.8 billion in 1997 dollars over what it could have \nearned had they invested in a conservative portfolio. This small \nminority community, in effect, lost nearly half--this is just this \nsmall community--lost nearly half what the federal government spends on \nfood stamps or education for this entire Nation!\n  But if an Hispanic couple from that community were able to take the \ndollars they would be required to pay into the current Social Security \nsystem and instead invest them in a portfolio, the outcome would have \nbeen remarkably different. Under the current system, the couple could \nexpect about $420,000 in exchange for a lifetime of contributions. But \nwith a conservative portfolio comprised of 50 percent U.S. Treasury \nBonds and 50 percent blue chip equities, that same couple could nearly \ndouble their benefit to $767,000 in today's dollars. Treasury Bonds \nalone would yield over $100,000 more in benefits. That means this \nfamily would have enough to convert their benefit to an annuity paying \nout exactly what Social Security promised and still have more than \n$200,000 left over for any expenses --long-term health care or even \njust passing along to their children--something impossible under \ntoday's Social Security system.\n  The findings within the African-American community are similarly \nstunning. Like single Hispanic males, single African-American males \nhave a lower life expectancy and are especially disadvantaged by the \ncurrent Social Security system. Although the system aims to transfer \nfunds to low-income individuals, these minorities are particularly hard \nhit.\n  According to the Heritage Foundation, a low-income, African-American \nmale born after 1959 can expect to receive less than 88 cents back on \nevery dollar he contributes to the Social Security trust fund. This \ntranslates into a lifetime cash loss of some $13,377--a loss these \nindividuals can hardly afford Not a gain on their investment, but an \nactual loss on their investment. If we allowed that same male to invest \nhis Social Security taxes in T-bonds, he would receive a post-tax \nincrease in his lifetime income of nearly $80,000.\n  African-American women are similarly disadvantaged by the current \nsystem. Enabling a 21-year-old single mother to invest her payroll \ntaxes into low-risk/low-yield government bonds, rather than the Social \nSecurity system, would more than double her rate of return. That means \nthis woman could expect to get back $93,000 more, after taxes, than she \nwould under the current system. And with a little risk, the numbers \ncould even more than double.\n  Mr. President, many solutions have been proposed to stave off the \nimpending Social Security trust fund crisis: raising retirement ages, \nincreasing payroll taxes, decreasing benefits--the list goes on. But we \ncannot forget that those choices will only exacerbate a problem that is \nalready becoming progressively worse. Such proposals put at greatest \nrisk those the system was aimed to help the most.\n  When our Founding Fathers created this great Nation, they declared \neach American had the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness. If we continue on our present track with the current Social \nSecurity system, we are truly undermining those principles. Sentencing \nwomen and minorities to a retirement life of poverty is unfair. The \nthreat of raising payroll taxes by nearly 40 percent to fund a bankrupt \nretirement system threatens to steal away our children's liberty. And \nturning our backs on the reforms we have the power to undertake--\nreforms that will truly revive our ailing system--steals away every \nAmerican's right to pursue happiness. Mr. President, rather than \nscaring women and minorities away from the options we have before us, \nlet us give them the freedom that comes with personal retirement \nchoices, the peace of mind that retirement security provides, and the \nability to lead a better life in retirement than the one they are being \npromised today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/24/senate-section/article/S8985-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8987-S8988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CREDIT UNION MEMBERSHIP ACCESS ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit, as I mentioned \nearlier, on an amendment offered by Senator Shelby dealing with the \nCRA.\n  I take a few moments today to rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Alabama and urge my colleagues to support \nit as well.\n  Senator Shelby's leadership on this issue is well-established and he \nshould be commended for his perseverance, even in the face of fierce \nopposition by some of his colleagues and the Clinton administration.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a simple and appropriate step to \nremoving an inappropriate and unnecessary burden from our Nation's \nsmall banks and thrifts. The amendment exempts small banks and thrifts, \nunder $250 million in assets, from the grasp of the Community \nReinvestment Act, or CRA.\n  I am sure that some of my colleagues may come to the floor and argue \nthat the Federal banking regulators have taken steps to remove the \nburdens from banks, and thus, this amendment is unnecessary. Although I \ncommend the regulators for easing the burden of CRA, this contention \ndoes justify the appropriateness of the underlying arguement that \ngovernment-mandated credit allocation is inappropriate. As we have seen \nmost recently in Asia, when the government mandates that the private \nmarkets allocate their resources in set ways--capital in this case--the \nresults can be disasterous.\n  I think there are three arguments which must be considered regarding \nSenator Shelby's amendment.\n  The first is, What was the justification for enactment of CRA in the \nfirst place? The Community Reinvestment Act was enacted in 1977 in \nresponse to rumors of redlining in the banking industry. The debate at \nthat time shows that supporters felt there were three factors \njustifying enactment, and they are: first, that banks enjoy a semi-\nexclusive franchise--due in part to interstate banking restrictions and \nactivity restrictions on competitors such as thrifts and credit unions; \ntwo, that the government limits competition within the banking sector \nby limiting interstate banking and limiting the acitivities of \ncompetitors such as credit unions and thrifts; and, third, that the \nGovernment restricts the cost of money to banks through interest rate \ncaps on savings accounts and a prohibition on paying interest on demand \ndeposits. If these three points, as the record shows, truly were the \njustification for imposing CRA on banks, the authors would certainly \nhave to reconsider their action in light of the current environment \nfacing banks.\n  Banks no longer enjoy the limited competition they did in 1977. The \nReigel-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 \nopened the doors to interstate banking, thus providing competition not \nonly among banks within a state but with banks across the country as \nwell. Also, the bill we are considering today will throw open the doors \nof competition to another set of competitors--credit unions--which will \nbe able to add any group of individuals they choose, limited only by \nits size. Also, these two examples I have just explained do not take \ninto account all of the non-bank financial services which have evolved \nand expanded since 1977--including money market accounts, mutual funds, \nand deposit-like insurance products.\n  Banks also no longer enjoy protection against set costs which had \nbeen\n\n[[Page S8988]]\n\nimposed through interest rate controls. The 1980 Depository \nInstitutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 \nappropriately removed these price controls which inhibited competition.\n  The second argument which must be considered when we discuss the \nShelby amendment is the claim that the amendment will exempt 88% of the \nbanks from coverage under the CRA. Although this percentage seems \nstaggering--and may sway someone who feels that CRA is okay in some \ninstances--a closer look reveals that opponents of the amendment are \nusing sleight of hand to give the impression that this amendment will \nhave a deeper impact than it truly will. Although it may be true that \n88% of banks are exempted, in terms of the number that really counts--\nthat is, assets--the impact that this exemption will have is \noverstated. That is because less than 12% of bank assets are exempted.\n  The approximately 8,100 banks exempted have $593 billion in assets, \nbut that accounts for only 11.7% of bank assets in this country. These \nassets are only one-half-of-one percent, or $3 billion, more than the \ncombined assets of the soon-to-be-completed Bank of America--\nNationsBank merger. In other words, one bank in the country will soon \nhave close to the same number of assets as the 8,100 banks which would \nbe exempted under this amendment. When you realize that the overall \nimpact of this amendment on the CRA is so small, you must question why \nit is being contested with such vigor.\n  The third contention which must be contemplated in considering this \namendment is whether it will have a negative impact on preventing \ndiscrimination. To listen to the critics of the amendment, one would \nbelieve that the amendment gives banks a ``get out of jail free'' card \nwhen it comes to discrimination.\n  However, you must understand that this amendment in no way restricts \nthe enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity \nAct, or the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. These acts, designed to \nprevent discrimination, will remain unfettered in detering \ninappropriate practices of financial institutions. The amendment in no \nway weakens laws designed to protect individuals; instead, it removes \nthe inappropriate policy of dictating where banks must operate.\n  Mr. President, I realize that some in the credit union movement are \nconcerned that adoption of the Shelby amendment may endanger swift \nenactment of this legislation. However, after contemplating the points \nraised, I do not understand how the President could consider vetoing a \nbill based on this appropriate and narrow relief and I do not \nunderstand how any of my colleagues can argue the doom and gloom \nscenarios they are painting about this amendment.\n  So, again, Senator Shelby should be commended for his leadership and \nhis amendment should be adopted, insisted on in conference, and signed \ninto law by the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/24/senate-section/article/S8987-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8988-S8989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment and frustration about the Senate's inaction to consider \nand pass the Government Shutdown Act.\n  Mr. President, this week I sought to offer S. 547, the Government \nShutdown Prevention Act, as an amendment to the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations. This amendment, originally sponsored by Senator McCain, \nwould create an automatic procedure for a CR at the end of each fiscal \nyear. The essence of the amendment is that we cannot and will not allow \na Government shutdown, we will not allow disruption of the services we \nrely on from the Government, and we will simplify and facilitate the \nprocess of passing a continuing resolution.\n  What issue is more relevant to the legislative branch than acting \nresponsibly to keep the Government in business? This amendment would \nhave ended the annual battle we have each year on what is included in a \nCR and at what level of spending. It would end the last-minute mischief \nof adding new pork and new spending into a CR because everybody wants \nto avoid a shutdown. So you are blackmailed into doing something you do \nnot want to do.\n  Unfortunately, I was unable to offer this amendment due to \ngermaneness concerns and lack of leadership support.\n  In May of 1997, during the debate on the Supplemental Appropriation \nbill--this was covering the flood disasters that occurred in Minnesota \nand the Dakotas of that year, and others around the country--Senators \nMcCain and Hutchison offered this amendment, but later withdrew it \nbased on a commitment made by both Senate majority and minority leaders \nthat the Government Shutdown Prevention Act would be allowed to be \nconsidered as a separate measure in the near future. The leaders \nspecifically promised a full debate on the legislation with one \nrelevant amendment for each leader.\n  Mr. President, I would remind my colleagues of the word of the \nMinority Leader at a news conference he held back on June 11, 1997. I \nam quoting here from a transcript of the news conference:\n\n       Senator Rod Grams sent a letter to all leadership yesterday \n     which offers a very simple, yet I think extraordinarily \n     acceptable solution: strip out the legislation that is the \n     source of the controversy.\n\n  So back again to why the President vetoed the emergency supplemental, \nit was because of this very part.\n  The minority leader went on to say:\n\n       Have an up or down vote on the census, have an up or down \n     vote on the CR, have an up or down vote on the disaster bill. \n     I cannot think of anything more simple than that. I think it \n     is the right thing to do. I have indicated to Senator Lott \n     this morning that I think it is the right thing to do.\n\n  In a news conference the following day, the Minority Leader repeated \nhis support again:\n\n       We would be willing to set a time certain for each of the \n     pieces of legislation, very short time limits for debate \n     ended. I think it is an excellent proposal, and I am hopeful \n     that that is ultimately what we agree to.\n\n  Mr. President, that was indeed what we ultimately agreed to.\n  It has been over a year now since that debate ended. The Senate never \nhad an opportunity to consider this as a separate measure, so I have \nchosen to again raise this as a non-controversial measure that will \nforce the Congress to act responsibly to avoid a government shutdown, \nand also for those who made those promises to live up to their word.\n  During last year's debate, some of my colleagues argued that since a \nbudget agreement was reached between the White House and Congress, \nthere was no need for this amendment anymore. I argued at the time that \nthe budget agreement made the amendment even more crucial for a \nresponsible government. And here we are again, with just a few weeks \nleft in this session to consider 10 appropriations bills and all 13 \nconference reports.\n  My major concerns were, and still are, that the many economic \nassumptions and spending priorities within the budget agreement make \nour budget and appropriation process uncertain. The current budget \ndisagreements have again clearly proved my point.\n  Mr. President, as you know, during this year's budget debate, some \nmembers are calling for more spending for their favorite programs. \nOthers, like myself, prefer larger tax cuts and larger spending \nreductions. As a result, the House and the Senate have approved a \nbudget resolution with significantly different tax and spending \npriorities. Those differences have prevented us from completing the \nbudget resolution conference report, which is long overdue in \naccordance with our budgetary rules. It is possible that Congress may \nnot be able to produce a budget this year at all, or finish the regular \nappropriations legislation before the fiscal year ends on September 30 \nof 1998.\n  What would this mean, Mr. President? This means the American people \nwill have once again been held hostage to a government shutdown simply \nbecause Congress and the White House, or the House and the Senate, do \nnot agree on tax cuts and spending priorities, or seek to slow down the \nappropriations process by offering controversial or non-germane \namendments.\n  In 1995, we witnessed the longest federal government shutdown in \nhistory, which caused financial damages and inconvenience to millions \nof Americans simply because of disagreements between the Congress and \nthe President in our budget process.\n  That was a very costly shutdown. The shutdown disrupted the lives of\n\n[[Page S8989]]\n\nhundreds of thousands of Americans. Some retirees and veterans could \nnot promptly receive their social services, such as Medicare benefits. \nFamilies could not obtain passports, or visit national parks and \nmuseums. Millions of dollars were lost to small business owners and \nlocal communities. Federal employees were furloughed with a fear of not \ngetting paid, although they were--at again, a loss to the taxpayer. \nEven our troops stationed overseas were affected by the shutdown. The \ninterruption caused immeasurable financial damage to the American \npeople and to this country, bottom line.\n  The most serious damage done by the 27-day shutdown was that it shook \nthe American people's confidence in their government and in their \nelected officials. Even today, we have not yet undone this damage. We \nneed to restore the public's faith in its leaders by showing that we \nhave learned from our mistakes. Passage of this good-government \ncontingency plan will send a clear message to the American people that \nwe will no longer allow them to be held hostage in budget disputes \nbetween Congress and the White House or among ourselves.\n  We all have different philosophies and policies on budget priorities, \nand of course we will not always agree. But there are essential \nfunctions and services of the federal government we must continue \nregardless of our differences in budget priorities.\n  More often, without a good-government contingency plan, the \ncontinuing resolution has become impossible as we argue over funding \nlevels and whether pork project ``A'' or pork project ``B'' deserves \nour support. Debate on program funding is not based on merits but on \npolitical leverage. As a result, billions of the taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars are wasted in this process.\n  The virtue of this amendment is that it would allow us to debate \nissues about our spending policy and the merits of budget priorities \nwhile we continue to keep essential government functions operating. The \nAmerican people will no longer be held hostage to a government \nshutdown. So, as I said earlier, there are still plenty of \nuncertainties involved in our budget and appropriations process, \nparticularly this year. If we continue on our current course and the \ngovernment again shuts down as it did three years ago, it will be \nanother devastating blow to the American people, from senior citizens \nto disaster victims.\n  We must ensure that a good-government contingency plan is in place to \nkeep the government up and running in the event that a budget agreement \nis not reached.\n  Mr. President, this good-government contingency plan is sound policy, \nI believe it is wise policy, and it is responsible policy. With a \ndwindling number of legislative days left in this Congress, I strongly \nbelieve that it is vitally important to immediately consider and pass \nthis overdue measure to end the annual shutdown battle we face every \nyear. This should be non-controversial legislation we can all support. \nI therefore strongly urge the Senate leadership to bring this \nlegislation up for a full debate and vote as earlier agreed.\n  Is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes and 19 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I yield back my remaining time, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights, a bill that was introduced last week by my colleague from \nOklahoma, Senator Don Nickles, and members of the Senate Republican \nTask Force on Health Care Quality, our distinguished majority leader, \nTrent Lott, with a total of 47 cosponsors.\n  I am really quite pleased with this particular bill. I have had the \nopportunity to work on the task force because it is a product of months \nand months of very thoughtful discussion, vigorous debate among \nourselves. I think, as most people know, on the task force were some of \nour most conservative members and some of our most moderate members \nwithin our caucus. It really is a consensus proposal to improve health \ncare quality. As a practicing physician, I am absolutely convinced that \nhealth care is delivered best when that relationship between the doctor \nand the patient is given the very highest priority. My goal in this \ndebate, the debate that we will have over the coming weeks, is to do \neverything possible to empower patients and doctors to be that focal \npoint, to be that place where ultimately the quality of care is \ndecided.\n  Much of the debate will center around who is practicing medicine \ntoday. Is it bureaucrats in Washington? Is it bureaucrats in health \nmaintenance organizations? Is it bureaucrats in the U.S. Congress? \nUltimately, I think that we can address this issue, if in coming \ntogether in a bipartisan way with a reasonable, timely voice, with a \nreasonable thought, come back to that central premise that the doctor \nand the patient or the nurse and the patient, at the level where that \nreally very intimate interaction is carried out, where one's problems \nare professed and treatment plans and diagnoses are generated, if we \nkeep coming back to that as being the central focus of the Patients' \nBill of Rights in everything that we do over the next several weeks, we \nwill be doing a great service to the public, to all Americans.\n  Now, our proposal that has been put forth is grounded on a Patients' \nBill of Rights. It offers a number of protections for individuals, for \npatients, for potential patients, and that is No. 1, by guaranteeing \nfull access to information as to what is in one's health plan.\n  If you ask your typical Tennessean or American, you say, what really \ndoes your plan cover and what does it not cover, most of us, including \nme, throw up our hands and say, ``I don't know.'' If you, going back to \nmy own field, develop a cardiomyopathy and a sick heart, it \ndeteriorates over time and you need a heart transplant, does your plan, \nI could ask any of my colleagues, cover heart transplants? And they \nwill probably say, ``I don't know. I understand it is very expensive. I \nalso understand it could save my life. But I don't know the answer to \nthat question.''\n  We need to guarantee full access to everybody. Whether it is a health \nmaintenance organization, a managed care plan, any type of plan, we \nneed to guarantee that patient full access to that information. We do \nthat in our bill.\n  Secondly, we do need to make sure that patients receive the necessary \nemergency care, and it really does boil down to the fact that if a so-\ncalled prudent lay person, meaning somebody with average intelligence, \ncommon sense, develops chest pain, they don't know whether it is \nindigestion or a massive heart attack. They go to the emergency room. \nThey should be able to walk into that emergency room and be taken care \nof without fear that coverage will be denied for that particular \nservice. We address that right up front. We allow patients to keep \ntheir doctor during a pregnancy or extended illness even if their \ndoctor for some reason leaves a plan or is terminated from a plan, so-\ncalled continuity of care. We allow individual patients direct access \nto that pediatrician without having to go through a gatekeeper or to \nthat obstetrician or gynecologist without having to go through a \ngatekeeper first.\n  The great fear I think that all of us in America have today, and I \nthink it is the fear that, again, drives much of the debate, is that \nour health plan will not be there for us if we get sick. If my young \n11-year-old son develops a heart murmur, a virus, will there be \nsomebody there to help him? Will that health plan respond to those \nneeds? Or will my HMO deny me seeing the doctor who I feel is the very \nbest person to take care of my son, who I know and people have told me \nis a better doctor. Will I be denied the opportunity to see that doctor \nby my health plan?\n  Many people fear that they will be denied the benefits they have even \npaid for and that they have been promised. Others are absolutely \nconvinced today that their health plan cares much more about cost, \ncares much more about profits, cares much more about the\n\n[[Page S8990]]\n\nbottom line than about quality. And that is because of the focus on \ncost and saving money.\n  We in this body talk about how we have to slow the cost of health \ncare, we have to reduce health expenditures because of all of those \npressures. HMOs have been allowed to go too far. They have not been \nheld accountable. Our bill takes that focus and puts it right on \nquality, on quality. I say that because you can list 10 rights, and you \ncan list 400 mandates, and you can say we have licked the problem. \nUnless you come back to focusing on quality, you have made yourself \nfeel good. We have responded to the public sentiment of let's bash the \nHMOs, but you have done nothing for that next generation, nothing for \nthe overall health care system unless you come back to those two \nprinciples: The doctor-patient, the primacy of that doctor-patient \ninteraction, No. 1, and, No. 2, focus on quality.\n  Therefore, you will see in the bills that are before us--and there \nare basically two bills, one from each side of the aisle, although I \nhope that both sides will end up to some degree through debate coming \nto a bipartisan agreement, but the bills are very different, and I \nthink that is where the debate is going to have to play out because \nevery day you are exposed on this floor and through press conferences \nto ``Let's kill the HMOs, capture that sentiment, put these mandates on \nthe people and we fix the system.''\n  What we have to do as a body is figure out really how to fix the \nsystem with the help of the American people, recognize that our health \ncare system is changing and changing dynamically, and what we define as \nquality is changing dynamically. And thus whatever we do we cannot \nestablish a system through well-intended mandates which rigidify this \nsystem and destroy the dynamism that is inherent in the public \nmarketplace, in the private marketplace, in private industry, in \nGovernment-run programs today which recognize that quality is a new \nscience, it is an evolving science, it is dynamic, it is energetic, \neveryday breakthroughs are made on how we determine quality. So let's \nbe very careful and make sure that we, through well-intended mandates, \ndon't come and box in this dynamism which is so important to the future \nof health care delivery.\n  Our bill focuses on quality. Now, any physician today--and I am a \nphysician. I have worked with managed care before coming to the \nSenate--any physician will tell you that managed care--and we use the \nword ``HMOs'' and everybody needs to recognize that managed care is a \nbroad spectrum of entities. But a physician will tell you, anybody who \nhas worked with an HMO, HMOs have gone too far. Not all of them. HMOs \ntoo often control the whole issue of what service is covered and what \nis not, regardless of what that physician may feel is in the best \ninterest of the patient. And that same physician will very quickly tell \nyou that what coverage you are allowed to give that patient ultimately \ndefines the care and the outcome of that patient.\n  Therefore, I don't blame my fellow physicians coming forward and \nsaying, listen, I am being held accountable for decisions that I am not \neven allowed to make, whether it is coverage or admission to a hospital \nor the number of days in a hospital. I am not making that decision, yet \nI am held accountable.\n  Well, our bill hits this inequity head on. Basically, it says it is \nnot fair. That is inequitable. You, physician, you should not be held \naccountable. The HMO should be held accountable.\n  We need to fix the system. The critical measure of this bill that we \nhave put forward is to hold the health plans accountable for the \ncoverage decisions they make and to take the whole essence and the \npower of denial of care out of the hands of the HMOs and place it in \nthe hands of the way we fix the system--a strong appeals process \ninternally and a strong external appeals process where decisions can be \nmade by medical experts--yes, physicians--medical experts independent \nof the plan.\n  Our bill requires that health plans make coverage determinations \nrapidly, quickly, not weeks later or months later or years later. We \nput some time specifically, actually in the bill; we say it must be \nmade sometime but definitely not later than 72 hours after the request. \nWe want to protect patients, before harm occurs, by setting up a \nprocess that is not present in many--I don't know whether to say most \nor not--but it is simply not present in many of the HMOs today. But it \nis a process for patients and their families to get an immediate answer \nover what is covered and what is not covered and, if there is a \ndisagreement, resolution right then and there, not a year later or 5 \nyears later or 2 years later, after whatever potential for harm may \noccur.\n  Furthermore, we require health plans to provide quick internal \ngrievance, as well as these independent, external, appeals processes in \nareas where there might be some question, like: Is a particular \nprocedure or use of a device investigational or experimental? The whole \npoint is, we need to hold the plans accountable. And we do it by fixing \nthe system.\n  Our bill provides protections for patients who rely on health plans \nthat States do not. This will be another issue, but our bill basically \nsays that there are a group of people who are unprotected today. Yes, \nthe purpose of our bill, and where we see the Federal responsibility as \nbeing, is to protect the unprotected, the people who, by law, are not \nbeing protected by an entity. That is the group that we focus on. We \nfix the system where it is broken, without this whole issue--which has \nreally captured the attention of the press and really taken focus away \nfrom the quality issue, which is the really important issue--this issue \nabout lining the pockets of trial lawyers in the process of the bills \nthat are discussed today.\n  We do demand that all 125 million Americans have this strong internal \nappeals process, grievance process, as well as external appeals \nprocess. We want the questions answered up front, when it really \nmatters, and not years later by a trial lawyer.\n  Our bill guarantees patients the right to access their own medical \ninformation. It gives them the right to make modifications and to amend \ntheir medical information if they find something that is incorrect. In \naddition, we require health plans to inform you of the plan's practices \nwith regard to confidentiality of medical information, with regard to \nprivacy of your medical record. We require health plans to establish \nsafeguards to protect that confidentiality, to protect that privacy, to \nprotect that security of your health information.\n  As you can tell, I just believe the heart of the problem that we have \ntoday with HMOs is that they focus too much on cost, on the bottom \nline, without anybody coming in and demanding that they look at \nquality--quality. Our bill, more than any other bill, focuses on this \nissue of quality.\n  Some believe that quality can be legislated today. It is a subtle \nissue, but it is a point that I have a real obligation to make because \nI have been so intimately involved. That is, the science of quality and \nunderstanding what quality is today in health care is a relatively \nyoung science. It is a science that is maybe 10 years old. I think you \ncan crystallize that by asking yourself, What is quality today? How did \nI choose my doctor? Did I choose my doctor because I knew that he was a \nbetter doctor than the doctor across town? If you feel your doctor is \npretty good, step back and ask yourself, Do I really know he is a good \ndoctor? Or is he just a nice guy? Does he just answer the telephone \nwhen I call? What are the standards that we, as a society, have to \ncompare one doctor to another doctor? We are entrusting our lives to \nthem for a heart transplant or heart surgery. How do we judge them? The \ninformation is not there. The answer is: We don't have the answer.\n  Therefore, we as a body have to be very careful before we come in and \nmandate what quality is, because we don't know what quality is. We are \nlearning about it, but it is an evolving science. It is something we \nare learning about on an ongoing basis. It is important because one \napproach mandates quality, the other says let's support and figure out \nwhat quality is. That is the Federal responsibility: Let's pull \ntogether the private entities, the public entities; let's take \nadvantage of state-of-the-art information systems; let's coordinate \nthis information and determine what quality is and then disseminate \nthat information out so we\n\n[[Page S8991]]\n\ncan educate people broadly so they can answer that very basic question, \n``Do I have a good doctor or do I not have a good doctor?'' Or, ``Is \nthat plan a good plan for me and that one a bad plan for me?''\n  Mandating data collection: Right now, there are plans being proposed \non both sides in the House and Senate that just say let's collect more \ndata, let's have all information from a health plan--demographics and \nage and gender and outcome and results and patient satisfaction \nsurveys--let's just collect all that data and send it to the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services. It sounds pretty good, if we knew what it \nmeant, if it didn't mean that a doctor is going to have to sit down and \ntalk to a patient and then go take a piece of paper and fill out a 20-\npoint questionnaire and then give it to a bureaucrat, whom he has had \nto go out and hire to sit in his office to compile it for a health care \nplan that has another whole system, to send it to the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, who gets this data from millions and \nmillions of doctor-patient interactions. And what are we going to do \nwith it? Let's invest in the science of figuring out what we do with it \nbefore we mandate the collection.\n  Our legislation promotes quality improvement by supporting research, \nto give patients and physicians better and more useful information to \njudge quality. Our Patients' Bill of Rights establishes an agency. We \ncall it the Agency for Health Care Quality Research, AHQR. I hate to \nuse those initials, but by the time this debate is finished, I hope \neverybody in America knows what AHQR is. Its purpose is to foster \noverall improvement in health care quality through supporting pertinent \nhealth sciences research, then disseminating that information through \npublic and private partnerships--pretty simple, pretty straightforward. \nI believe it is the fundamental problem we have today with managed \ncare, with HMOs, with focusing on dollars, with focusing on the bottom \nline, because nobody is focusing on quality.\n  Some of my colleagues will come forward and say, ``You mean as a \nRepublican you want to create a whole new Federal bureaucracy and \nagency?'' The answer is no. We don't do it very well, I think, in \nWashington. But when we go in one direction, I think it is important to \nbuild on the past, and we have done just that. The agency that we \npropose is built on the platform of a current agency which I feel is \ndoing a very good job. But we take that agency, called the Agency for \nHealth Care Policy and Research, we refocus the agency on quality, \nbecause quality is the issue today. It may have been ``cost'' 5 years \nago, but it is ``quality'' today. Then we enhance that agency to become \nthe hub and the driving force of all of the many quality efforts that \nare going on in Federal programs today.\n  There are many different agencies all across this country, Federal \nagencies, that do focus on health care. They all have--not all of them, \nbut many of them have programs and a little subdivision devoted to \nquality. Our Agency for Health Care Quality Research will help \ncoordinate all of those many very positive efforts. We will focus on \nnot just HMO quality, where so much of the debate and anger is, but we \nwill focus on quality on the managed care setting, the urban setting, \nthe rural setting, the setting of the solo private practitioner. This \nagency will have, as its mission, improving quality, and the \ndisseminating of that information to everybody in health care today.\n  Thus, if we agree that this fundamental issue on our debate is that \nHMOs have, to some extent--I don't want to sort of categorize them \nbecause I don't think that is fair--but if the debate is that HMOs have \nignored quality because of an almost obsession with cost, then let's \nhit the problem; let's go after how we, as a nation, can improve \nquality and what is our Federal responsibility. If we are talking about \na Patients' Bill of Rights, the ones that we have in our bill are very, \nvery important. But I think the most basic right for a patient is that \nright to quality health care. That is what our bill, like no other \nbill, addresses.\n  This particular agency has a role that is not to mandate. It is not \nto mandate a national definition of ``quality,'' but, rather, it is to \nsupport the science that is necessary to provide information to \npatients so they will know whether or not they are receiving good \nquality of care, to provide information to physicians so they can \ncompare what they are doing to the next physician and modify their \nbehavior, so they will know what good quality is and modify their \nbehavior so they can deliver better care to all of their \npatients, information to enable employers and individuals to become \nwise purchasers or wise shoppers of health care based not on cost, or \nnot on cost alone, but on cost and quality.\n\n  The agency will stimulate public-private partnerships to advance and \nshare what we learn about quality. Quality just means different things \nto different people. It is constantly being refined. As I said, it is \njust a few years old as a science; therefore, in collaboration with the \nprivate sector, the agency will conduct and will coordinate health \nscience research that really will accelerate our understanding of what \nquality means to clinicians and to patients, how to measure that \nquality and how to use this information to improve your own health and \nyour own quality of life.\n  This agency will have as a major purpose and objective the sharing of \nthis information. We have medical advances that are made daily. We see \nthem in the newspaper; we see them on the news each night when we go \nhome. In truth, many of these discoveries do not make it out into the \ngeneral practice of medicine for too long. We need to do a better job \nin narrowing the gap between what we know and what we do, and this \nagency will accomplish that.\n  We need to get the science that we know is good science quicker to \nthe American people by sharing this information among public entities \nand private entities, and this effective dissemination will be a major \npurpose of the agency.\n  In addition, the agency will develop evidence rating systems to know \nwhat a good doctor is, what a good plan is, whether or not the \ntreatment that has been recommended for your diabetes is an effective \ntreatment.\n  This agency will play a vital role in facilitating innovative \ninpatient care in this whole area of new technologies and assessment of \nnew technologies. As chairman of the Science, Technology, and Space \nSubcommittee of the Commerce Committee and the Public Health and Safety \nSubcommittee of the Labor Committee, we held hearings and people came \nbefore us again and again about new technologies and the confusing \nmethodologies that our Federal Government has set up, that each agency \nhas set up, hoops through which they need to travel before that new \ntechnology is disseminated or shared with the American people.\n  The agency that we are setting up will establish a consistent \nmethodology with coordination across Federal agencies so that people \nwill know what guidelines they must follow in a consistent way to have \ntechnologies evaluated and then appropriately disseminated.\n  In its mission to promote and facilitate quality and quality \ndevelopment, this particular agency will have a focus on improved \ninformation-based computer systems which are so necessary for quality \nscoring and which will facilitate informed decisionmaking by providers, \nby physicians, by nurses, and by patients. The agency will aggressively \nsupport the development of these state-of-the-art information systems \nfor health care quality which then can be shared both by the public and \nthe private sector. The setting is important. Again, as I mentioned \npreviously, so much of the discussion today, as we talk about bills of \nrights, is focused just on health maintenance organizations.\n  I think it is important for our colleagues to realize that our bill \ngoes beyond just health maintenance organizations and looks at quality \nin all different settings. Quality improvement applies to the care that \nis given in that solo private practitioner's office in the managed care \nsetting or at the health maintenance organization. This agency will \nunderstand that part of its mission will be to specifically address \nquality in rural areas in underserved areas, using such technologies as \ntelemedicine and other long-distance-type technologies.\n  Our bill addresses the fact that patients do want to know if they are \nreceiving good care, but compared to what? Statistically accurate, \nsample-\n\n[[Page S8992]]\n\nbased national surveys will efficiently provide reliable and affordable \ndata without the other approach, which is excessively mandated, overly \nintrusive, potentially destructive mandatory reporting requirements, \nwhich as I have described previously, in the long run take away time \nfrom that doctor-patient interaction.\n  You simply do not need to have a doctor, after every patient \ninteraction, fill out a questionnaire at every visit and then send that \ninformation to Washington. It can be a waste of physician time, taking \ntime away from the patient, and will ultimately drive up what patients \nhave to pay for the care they receive. Our approach is very different.\n  As I mentioned, they are sample-based national surveys. We expand the \ncurrent Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to require that outcomes be \nmeasured and reported to Congress so that as a nation--as a nation--we \ncan better determine the state of quality and the cost of quality in \nour Nation's health care.\n  The role of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research is not to \nmandate national standards of clinical practice. Definitions and \nmeasures of quality, as I said, are an evolving science, a science that \nis critically important to our ability to make educated, informed \ndecisions.\n  Another aspect of our bill that is important for our colleagues to \nunderstand is a part of the bill--because it is a very important part \nof the bill--is the strong focus on women's health issues. As a nation, \nit is time that we focus on diseases and health issues that are faced \nby women. In our bill we specifically emphasize women's health research \nand prevention activities at the National Institutes of Health and at \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The goal is to support \nthe critical role that our public health agencies--the NIH and the \nCDC--play in providing a broad spectrum of activities to improve \nwomen's health. That includes research, screening, prevention, \ntreatment, and education.\n  Among others, these provisions in women's health promote basic and \nclinical research for the aging process in women, for osteoporosis, for \nbreast cancer, Paget's disease, for ovarian cancer. We expand our \nresearch efforts in the important area of cardiovascular disease. Many \npeople--in fact, I am sure many of our colleagues--do not realize that \nthe No. 1 killer, cause of death for U.S. women is cardiovascular \ndisease. We need to expand our research efforts there. We do that in \nour bill.\n  Our bill reauthorizes the National Breast and Cervical Cancer \nScreening Program which provides crucial screening services for breast \nand cervical cancers to underserved women. Our bill supports data \ncollection through the National Center for Health Statistics and \nNational Program of Cancer Registries, which are the leading sources of \nnational data on the health status of women. Support of these valuable \nprograms will help ensure scientific progress in our fight against \nthese diseases and will lessen the burden of these diseases on millions \nof women and their families.\n  Another component of our bill which is not in any bill currently \nbefore the U.S. Senate except for ours--which is not a part of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights in the House of Representatives--it is a part \nof the bill, again, which I feel demonstrates that this piece of \nlegislation is forward thinking; it fulfills our responsibility, I \nbelieve, of looking ahead and seeing what obvious challenges there are, \nchallenges that could potentially disrupt the delivery of health care \nin this country--that is our responsibility--and to respond, and to \nrespond now, before they become potentially debilitating, have a \ndebilitating effect on health care in this country.\n  This provision is one--and it is a right--it is one of the Bill of \nRights, and it is a right that every woman and every man and every \nchild should be free from the fear that an insurance plan or an HMO \nwill discriminate against them because of a positive genetic test.\n  The human genome project, a 15-year, very successful project, \ninitiated by our Federal Government, being carried out in a wonderfully \nunique public-private partnership, by the year 2005, we will have \ndefined over 3 billion bits of genetic information called DNA which \ncomprise the human genome which explains in large part our genetic \nmakeup--3 billion bits of information defined over this very successful \nprogram.\n\n  We have learned tremendous scientific progress, but it has introduced \nthe fact that once we link these genes to diseases and conditions--and \nwe see it happening almost every day; there was an article in the \nWashington Post just yesterday about linking several genes with \nAlzheimer's disease and the onset or when Alzheimer's disease comes \nbeing linked to these genes.\n  Again, tremendous science, yet it strikes right at the heart of this \nfear that the information in some way will not be used to help you but \nwill be used to hurt you, that access to that information and the \nresult of whether or not you have that gene will be used by an HMO or \nan insurance company to deny you coverage, to increase your premium, to \nuse against you that fear in not getting a test, a potentially \nbeneficial test. If you had a test which, with 80 percent \npredictability, said you were going to have breast cancer, wouldn't you \nwant to know the result of that test? I would, because it means I might \nget a mammogram once a year instead of once every 2 years, or I might \ndo a breast exam once a week instead of once a month, because we know \nthe earlier diagnosis of best cancer, earlier detection, means earlier \ntreatment, and earlier treatment means cure instead of delay, which \nmeans, many times, it cannot be cured.\n  The promise of that test will be defeated unless we act, and we act \ntoday, to eliminate the fear of genetic discrimination based on genetic \ntests which are coming online at a rapid pace. Our ability to predict \nwhat diseases individuals may be at risk for in the future has caused \ngrave concern that this powerful information--information that affects \nevery one of us in the room; we all have this genetic information; we \nall carry it in our genes--the fear that that information might be used \nagainst you.\n  I am really troubled when the Tennessee Breast Cancer Coalition tells \nme that genetic counselors right now are facing women every day who are \nafraid to even have these genetic tests performed. Women are avoiding \ngenetic testing due to concerns that they will lose their insurance \ncoverage even though that genetic test might be saving them. We must \nprohibit discrimination in health insurance against healthy individuals \nand their families based on genetic information.\n  Think about it--3 billion of these little bits of information on a \nsingle human genome; we all carry genetic mutations that may place us \nat risk in the future for some disease, even if we are healthy today. \nTherefore, each of us is at potential risk for discrimination.\n  If I receive a genetic test that shows I am at risk for cancer, \ndiabetes, or heart disease, should this predictive information be used \nagainst me or my family? The answer is no. That is a right. We address \nthat right in our bill. I think it an important point because it shows \nour bill is forward looking, looking to the future, not a set of rigid \nmandates based on what we think we know about quality today, but we \nlook to the future.\n  I want to commend the Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, whose \noriginal bill provided the framework and really the sound principles \nupon which this legislation is based. She has supported our task force \neffort and worked with us in a step-by-step way to craft this \nlegislation. I also would like to mention Senator Jeffords, who had the \nforesight to include these provisions, since we are talking about basic \nrights.\n  Our bill very specifically prohibits health insurers from requiring \ncollection of the results of these predictive genetic tests. It \nprohibits them from using that information, if they do have it, to deny \ncoverage. And it prohibits insurers from using that information, if \nthey do have it, to adjust rates or to increase rates.\n  Preventing genetic discrimination does have enormous implications \nthat I will continue to come back to, and that is improving quality. It \nimproves the quality of care to an individual patient. But also, if one \nis afraid to have the results of a genetic test released to somebody \noutside or participate in a large protocol, investigational protocol, \nthat means that research overall\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\ninto what these tests mean and how they might be beneficial will be \nslowed down, thus affecting the quality of health care for all \nAmericans.\n  Lastly, our bill enhances access and choice of health insurance \ncoverage in a number of ways which we will debate on the floor, areas \nthat increase access to and affordability of health care of several \nareas, that include provisions which I am very excited about, and that \nis to allow the self-employed individuals, for the first time, to fully \nconduct their health care expenses. It only makes sense. We have really \nbeen punishing self-employed individuals, not giving them the same tax \ntreatment that somebody has if they are working for a large company. It \ndoesn't make sense. What we want to do is level that playing field and \nallow these self-employed individuals to fully deduct their health care \nexpenses, just like people who work for large companies. It addresses \naccess, because it means that these self-employed individuals are more \nlikely to go out and enter the insurance market.\n  Our bill provides greater flexibility to employees who use the so-\ncalled flexible spending accounts to pay for health care. Our bill \ngives individuals the opportunity to have control over the health care \ndecisions and costs through medical savings accounts. Medical savings \naccounts allow a patient to access the physician of their choice and to \nchoose the medical treatment that they want if they choose that option.\n  As you can tell, our bill contains a lot. The reason that I wanted \nthis afternoon to outline our bill is to make sure that our colleagues \nspend the next several days looking very carefully at the differences \nbetween the two bills that are before us, because the approach is very, \nvery different. Both bills are well intended. I will say that I am very \nhopeful that we can pass a bill, a strong Bill of Rights. But that Bill \nof Rights needs to include a right to quality health care for all \nAmericans. Our approach is very, very different. The intentions, I \nbelieve, of both bills are the same.\n  I am hopeful that we can engage in this debate without too much in \nthe way of rhetoric. There is a lot of rhetoric that has been thrown on \nthe floor here and in press conferences, but I hope we can come back \nand say this is an important issue. It is not one, really, to play \npolitics with. It is not one to defer to another Congress or to \nfilibuster or to make a part of the next elections. It is the sort of \nissues that we, as trustees to the American people, have an obligation \nto address and to address in this Congress.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights offers all Americans quality improvement \nbased on the foundation of strong science. Our Patients' Bill of Rights \noffers all Americans patient protection, to access the care they need \nfrom the doctor they choose. Our Patient Bill of Rights offers all \nAmericans trust in that doctor-patient relationship, that central point \nthrough which I believe quality needs to be defined and health care \ndelivered. We reinstate that trust. Our Patient's Bill of Rights offers \nall Americans access to more affordable health insurance coverage. Our \nbill does represent a forward-looking approach to provide for \ncontinuous improvement in health care quality, and it meets our goal of \nassuring that the doctor and the patient define quality--not HMOs, not \nbureaucrats, not trial attorneys, and not the U.S. Congress.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/24/senate-section/article/S8989-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8993-S8994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n VETO OF COVERDELL LEGISLATION AND RELEASE OF HOUSE EDUCATION AND THE \n     WORKFORCE SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS REPORT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, our self-proclaimed ``Education \nPresident'' has just seen fit to veto the most significant bipartisan \neducation legislation passed by the 105th Congress--the Education \nSavings and School Excellence Act. As many Americans know, this \nlegsilation's main feature is to allow families to establish education \nsavings accounts in which parents can invest $2,000 a year and allow \nthat money to grow tax free. Parents can use the money to pay for \nschool expenses including tutoring, computers, school fees and private \nschool tuition.\n  Why has the President seen fit to veto this legislation? Well, he has \nreceived a great deal of pressure from those who believe that we should \nnot increase the control parents have over the education of their \nchildren.\n  In addition to providing tax-free education savings accounts for \nfamilies, this legislation includes provisions that would: authorize a \nliteracy program to improve the reading skills of America's youth; \nallow Federal funding for education reform projects that provide same \ngender schools and classrooms; allow States to make awards to public \nschools that demonstrate a high level of academic achievement; and \nallow states to test teachers and provide merit pay programs.\n  With the recent news that 60 percent of prospective teachers in \nMassachuesetts taking a basic certification test were unable to pass, \nit is unfortunate that the President's veto will not allow States like \nMassachusetts to help current and prospective teachers reach their full \npotential, as well as reward those who perform in a superior manner. I \nsigned a letter to the President along with 42 other senators asking \nthat he sign the education savings account legislation and pointing out \nthis very feature. Unfortunately, our plea fell on deaf ears.\n  Mr. President, I have worked diligently to fashion, over the past \nyear a return to our parents, teachers, principals, superintendents and \nschool board members control over the education of their children. The \nFederal Government has too much influence and misuses too many \nresources that would be better spent in classrooms across America.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee Education Task Force, I \nfound that no one in the Federal Government even knows exactly how many \neducation programs are overseen by the Federal Government. Although the \nDepartment of Education annually publishes a ``Digest of Education \nStatistics,'' the most recent version of which is over 500 pages in \nlength, there is no mention of how many education programs are \nadministered by Federal agencies.\n  I have, however, heard testimony from the General Accounting Office \nabout the duplication of Federal education programs. In January of this \nyear Dr. Carlotta Joyner of the GAO appeared before the Senate Budget \nCommittee Education Task Force and presented us with a graphic that \nhighlights the web of Federal education programs in only three areas of \neducation: at-risk and delinquent youth, early childhood programs, and \nteacher training programs. Dr. Joyner explained to us that 15 Federal \ndepartments and agencies administer 127 at-risk and delinquent youth \nprograms, 11 Federal departments and agencies administer more than 90 \nearly childhood programs, and 9 Federal departments and agencies \nadminister 86 teacher training programs.\n  It is no wonder that more and more, States and local school districts \nare suffocated by a tidal wave of papers, forms and programs, each of \nwhich no doubt began with good intentions. The net result of this tidal \nwave, however, is precisely what makes it difficult to set priorities \nin each of the states and school districts across the country to \ndetermine that which will best serve their students.\n  As I have stated previously, the only reason I can discern that the \nPresident would veto this legislation is that he believes that schools \nwill be improved through more control from Washington, D.C. Unlike the \nPresident, however, I believe our best hope for improving the education \nof our children is to put the American people in charge of their local \nschools.\n  I also believe it is appropriate at this time to give my colleagues \nin the Senate some good news on the education front. Last Friday, the \nHouse Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and \nInvestigations adopted a report entitled ``Education at a Crossroads: \nWhat Works and What's Wasted in Education Today'' by a vote of 5-2. \nThis report is a result of two-and-a-half years of work by that \nsubcommittee and the dedication of it's chairman, Congressman Hoekstra. \nThe report is more than 70 pages long and I will not touch on all the \nissues it discusses, but I do want to point out some of the conclusions \nthe subcommittee reached.\n\n[[Page S8994]]\n\n  The report's conclusion states in part:\n\n       . . . the central theme of what we learned is that the \n     federal government cannot consistently and effectively \n     replicate success stories throughout the nation in the form \n     of federal programs. Instead, federal education dollars \n     should support effective State and local initiatives, \n     ensuring that neither impedes local innovation and control, \n     nor diverts dollars from the classroom through burdensome \n     regulations and overhead.\n\n  The report goes on to give specific steps for Congress to take to \nimprove education in America. The report advocates increasing the \nability of States and local communities to waive federal education \nregulations, reducing the tax burden on families, passing tax-free \neducation savings account legislation, improving federal support for \ncharter schools, and otherwise encouraging more parental choice in \neducation.\n  I have long been an advocate of many of the suggestions outlined in \nthis report. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will take the time \nto review the report Congressman Hoekstra's subcommittee has prepared \nand consider where they stand on these issues. It is long past time for \nboth parties in Congress to stop simply giving lip service to the idea \nof local control of education, and to put our money where our mouths \nare.\n  Finally, I want to remind my colleagues that although I have \nintroduced and passed twice in the last year an amendment that would \nallow States and local school districts increased control over the \neducation of their children. Because of the insistence of Democrats in \nthe Senate, the President, and even some Members of my own party this \nlegislation has not yet survived a conference committee. Although I \nhave not yet been successful in passing this legislation into law to \ngive States and local communities the relief they deserve and need to \nimprove education in America, I will again in the near future propose \nlegislation that moves us toward this goal. Whether through block \ngrants or some other means, I am committed to the belief that real \neducation reform will not take place through ''. . . guidance from \nabove . . .'', but from parents and educators in communities across \nthis land as they are empowered to direct the education of their \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I note also present on the floor is Senator Frist, the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee task force on education, whose \nwork is of equal importance to that of Congressman Hoekstra's and whose \nreport I also commend to the Members of this body. He is our great \nexpert on health care, but he is also a major leader in education \nreform in the U.S. Senate, and we all owe him a great debt of \ngratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/24/senate-section/article/S8993-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimpose a moratorium on the implementation of the per beneficiary limits \nunder the interim payment system for home health agencies, and to \nmodify the standards for calculating the per visit cost limits and the \nrates for prospective payment systems under the medicare home health \nbenefit to achieve fair reimbursement payment rates, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         medical home health beneficiary protection act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Medicare \nHome Health Beneficiary Protection Act of 1998'' on behalf of myself, \nMr. Hollings, Mr. Faircloth, and Mr. Cochran.\n  I have long believed that home care is the key to fulfilling the \ndesire of virtually all seniors and those with disabilities to remain \nindependent and within the comfort of their own homes. Home care is \nalso often the only source of care for many disabled individuals and \nfrail elderly, especially those living in underserved rural and urban \nareas of our country.\n  Today, however, home health care is facing a crisis.\n  In an effort to reduce Medicare home health expenditures and fraud \nand abuse, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 replaces cost-based \nreimbursement for home health services with a Prospective Payment \nSystem (PPS), effective October 1, 1999. In the meantime, Congress, at \nthe recommendation of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), \nimposed an Interim Payment System (IPS), or new per beneficiary caps on \nhome health agencies.\n  There is no question that transitioning home health into a PPS is \nneeded to ensure that all home health providers are cost-effective in \nthe deliverance of services. But is also quite clear that the current \nIPS, coupled with HCFA's interpretation of the surety bond statute, is \nthreatening access to these invaluable services throughout our nation. \nQuite simply, the IPS is fatally flawed and works tremendous injustice \nand hardship.\n  In my home State of Missouri, reputable home health agencies provide \nhigh quality care to over 124,000 seniors and disabled are facing a \ncrisis. I support making the deliverance of services more efficient and \nrooting out bad actors in the Medicare home health program, but I am \ndeeply concerned about a punitive IPS which is driving scrupulous, \nquality providers out of business. In Missouri alone, over 35 home \nhealth agencies have shut their doors since enactment of the BBA of \n1997. Nationwide, over 1000 home health providers have closed or \nstopped accepting Medicare patients.\n  In St. Louis, the two largest, freestanding home health providers \nclosed their doors this year--leaving hundreds of elderly and disabled \npatients searching for a new provider. The Visiting Nurse Association \nof St. Louis which served the St. Louis area for 87 years eliminated \nall of their Medicare home health services as of May, forcing over 600 \npatients to find a new source of care.\n  It is imperative that Congress act now to impose a moratorium on the \nIPS. My bill not only accomplishes this equitable goal, but it also \nputs pressure on HCFA to move expeditiously towards the establishment \nof PPS for home care.\n  I have written a letter to Secretary Shalala outlining the concerns \nand outlining the serious situation and I have asked she move \nexpeditiously on this.\n  A study conducted by The George Washington University Medical Center, \nCenter for Health Policy Research, entitled ``Medicare Home Health \nServices: An Analysis of the Implications of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 for Access and Quality'', confirms why Congress must take \nexpedited action in removing the IPS.\n  Summarizing, the study concluded that:\n  The home care population represents an increasingly sicker population \nrequiring more acute management of chronic illness and higher intensity \nacute care;\n  The BBA's reductions in Medicare home health coverage and financing \ncan be expected to affect the sickest and highest cost patients and \npunish the very agencies that specialize in the provision of care to \nthis population;\n  The most severe effects of the interim payment system fall on the \nsickest patients living in states with the lowest utilization patterns;\n  The BBA's interim payment system will shift costs to other payers \n(notably Medicaid) while rewarding inefficient agencies who care for \nrelatively healthier patients; and\n  The interim payment system will make it more difficult to design and \nimplement the permanent prospective payment system scheduled to become \neffective in FY 2000.\n  To those, I might add, Mr. President, when you take a look at cost \nwhen you force people out of home health care if they are Medicare-\neligible beneficiaries, you are going to wind up putting them in \ninstitutions where the cost will be significantly greater and the \nbenefits to the individuals served and to the communities will be far \nless.\n  This is false economy and it is causing a real crisis in communities \nthroughout our country. So not only are beneficiaries and providers of \nhome health alerting us to the devastation of this system, but outside \nexperts are also telling us why we must revisit this issue.\n\n  Reducing Medicare's growth rate is a worthy and much needed goal; \nhowever, doing it in such a way that threatens access to critical home \nhealth services is downright unconscionable. Truly reforming Medicare \nmeans more than simply ratcheting down payments to providers and \nservices to beneficiaries. While this approach is the short-term \nsolution, it has serious consequences for many vulnerable patients and \nhonest providers.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude my remarks by recognizing the \nefforts of my distinguished colleague from Iowa and Chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Aging, Senator Chuck Grassley, who first \nhighlighted the devastating impact of the IPS and HCFA's surety bond \nrule on Medicare beneficiaries and home health providers. I thank him \nfor his dedication and leadership and look forward to working with him \nto rectify this problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the National Easter Seal \nSociety and the National Council of Senior Citizens as well as my \nletter to Secretary Shalala dated July 24, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     National Easter Seal Society,\n\n\n                                     Office of Public Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: Easter Seals is pleased to support your \n     legislation to place a moratorium on the Medicare interim \n     payment system (IPS) for home health agencies\n\n[[Page S8997]]\n\n     and the automatic payment reductions slated for 1999. These \n     Balanced Budget Act (BBA) measures threaten access to \n     essential home health services for Medicare beneficiaries, \n     particularly those with significant disabilities and chronic \n     conditions. They represent flawed approaches to reducing \n     Medicare spending that will have a devastating impact on \n     beneficiaries and families, and force high-quality providers, \n     including Easter Seals, from the Medicare program.\n       Easter Seals is dedicated to assisting people with \n     disabilities to live with equality, dignity, and \n     independence. Each year, Easter Seals serves more than one \n     million persons through a nationwide network of 106 \n     affiliated organizations that offer a wide range of home and \n     community-based services, including medical and vocational \n     rehabilitation, early intervention and special education \n     services, assistive technology, housing, and camping and \n     recreation services. Easter Seals provides quality care, \n     including home health care, to thousands of Medicare \n     beneficiaries annually. A significant percentage of these \n     beneficiaries have catastrophic, chronic, and/or medically \n     complex conditions. It is these individuals that will suffer \n     most under BBA.\n       Easter Seals' supports a transition to prospective payment \n     in home health that is responsible, cost-effective, and \n     consistent with high quality care. Payment methodologies \n     should reflect the varying, legitimate service needs of \n     medicare beneficiaries.\n       Easter Seals greatly appreciates your efforts to halt \n     implementation of IPS by the Health Care Financing \n     Administration until such time that an appropriate \n     prospective payment system can be adopted. Easter Seals also \n     opposes the sweeping reduction of payment for home health \n     services, that may take effect in 1999, as a flawed strategy \n     that will cause undue harm to beneficiaries and service \n     providers. These BBA provisions undermine appropriate, \n     quality home and community services for Medicare \n     beneficiaries and drive away efficient and caring providers, \n     such as Easter Seals, that serve them. Thank you very much \n     for your leadership with this important legislative \n     initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Randall L. Rutta,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Council of\n\n\n                                              Senior Citizens,\n\n                                 Silver Spring, MD, July 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The National Council of Senior Citizens \n     applauds your leadership and commitment to addressing the \n     very serious problems that the new Medicare interim payment \n     system (IPS) poses for disabled and elderly individuals in \n     need of home care.\n       As you so well know, home care patients are among America's \n     most vulnerable citizens. They tend to be people who are \n     sick, frail, lower income, and who depend upon this care for \n     their very existence and dignity.\n       The interim payment system has threatened to take away this \n     vital lifeline. Our Board has taken a position that IPS must \n     be reconsidered on an urgent basis. We urge you to introduce \n     legislation to impose an immediate and retroactive moratorium \n     on IPS. Only in this way can Congress bring about a speedy \n     solution to this pressing problem.\n       Thank you again for your vision and leadership. America's \n     Medicare beneficiaries are looking to you and the Congress \n     for a remedy to this devastating system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Steve Protulis,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Small Business,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 1998.\n     Hon. Donna E. Shalala,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: It has become clear that the Health \n     Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) implementation of the \n     home health Interim Payment System (IPS) and the surety bond \n     requirements is having a devastating impact on thousands of \n     conscientious and cost-effective home health agencies and the \n     Medicare home health beneficiaries, especially the most \n     medically complex patients.\n       As you know, the Senate Committee on Small Business held a \n     hearing on July 15 to give home health providers, HCFA, and \n     others the opportunity to examine these issues and explore \n     possible solutions. Nine witnesses, including representatives \n     of small freestanding home health agencies, testified about \n     the crippling effect HCFA's rules are having on reputable \n     small agencies and their ability to provide high-quality care \n     to their patients.\n       I remain extremely disappointed that HCFA turned down the \n     Committee's invitation to attend this important hearing. \n     Unfortunately, HCFA's decision not to testify was interpreted \n     as indifference to the impact its actions are having on small \n     home health providers and patients. This decision was \n     characterized by members of our Committee as ``reckless, \n     arrogant, and disgraceful.''\n       It is imperative that the Department of HHS and HCFA work \n     with Congress to enact an immediate moratorium on the IPS, \n     until, home health moves into a prospective payment system, \n     to stop the unjustified closure of scrupulous home health \n     agencies and further loss of beneficiary access to home care \n     services. The IPS is fatally flawed and does not comport with \n     what Congress intended. Rather than reduce the rate of growth \n     of the Medicare home health benefit, as we were led to \n     believe would be the result, the IPS is causing a precipitous \n     decline from last year's reimbursement, leading to serious \n     dislocation all over the country.\n       Hundreds of home care providers are literally on the brink \n     of closure. Many have already closed, leaving the sickest \n     patients searching for new home health care providers. I am \n     aware of at least one state where the IPS-related closure of \n     a home health agency has led to the loss of all home health \n     services for many rural patients.\n       Imposing a moratorium on the IPS would give Congress an \n     opportunity to work with the Department of HHS and HCFA, \n     Medicare consumers, and the home health industry to develop a \n     solution to this critical situation, which must be solved by \n     the end of the 105th Congress. This crisis requires your \n     immediate attention.\n       As you are aware, our July 15 hearing also focused on \n     HCFA's regulations to implement the surety bond requirements \n     in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The recent suspension of \n     the deadline for compliance with these regulations narrowly \n     averted a further crisis in home health care. It was the \n     intent of Congress that the home health surety bond \n     requirement act as a guarantee against fraud by home health \n     agencies. HCFA took this reasonable tool intended to curb \n     home health fraud and, as implemented, turned it into an \n     unworkable, punitive vehicle for the collection of routine \n     overpayment. HCFA's distortion of Congressional intent has \n     now forced the agency to suspend its flawed bond regulations. \n     Pending further rulemakng, HCFA should withdraw its surety \n     regulations and immediately release all existing bonds from \n     potential liability for recovery of overpayments.\n       I urge HCFA to work with Congress, home health providers, \n     and the surety bond industry in developing new surety bond \n     regulations in full compliance with the Administrative \n     Procedures Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act as amended \n     in 1996. There must not be a repetition of the chaotic \n     situation which caused Congress to intervene in the surety \n     bond crisis in the first place.\n       Your prompt reply is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Christopher S. Bond,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2355. A bill to prevent truancy and daytime juvenile crime; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n      truancy prevention and juvenile crime reduction act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Truancy \nPrevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998. In doing so, I \nwould like to discuss the importance of this measure and how I believe \nthe issue of truancy, as it relates to juvenile crime, has long been \nneglected.\n  More people are realizing that truancy often is the first sign of \ntrouble in the life of a young person. It is the first indication that \na young person may be on a sad track to a life of crime, drugs, and \nother serious problems.\n  Of course, in most every case, it is an early indication that a young \nperson has no interest in school and inevitably will drop out. This is \nespecially sad because many truants and eventual drop-outs are two and \na half times more likely than high school graduates to be on welfare \nand twice as likely to be unemployed or to be paid at the lower end of \nthe wage scale.\n  Truancy is the top-ranking characteristic of criminals--more common \nthan such factors as coming from a single-parent family and being \nabused as a child. High rates of truancy directly are linked to high \ndaytime crime rates, including violence, burglary and vandalism. As \nmuch as 44 percent of violent juvenile crime takes place during school \nhours, and as much as 75 percent of children ages 13 to 16 who are \narrested and prosecuted for crimes are truants. It is startling to know \nthat some cities report as many as 70 percent of daily student absences \nare unexcused, and the total number of absences in a single city can \nreach 4,000.\n  Moreover, society pays a very heavy social and economic price due to \ntruancy. Only 34 percent of inmates have completed high school \neducation, and we all are well aware of the staggering costs \nassociated with incarcerating an individual. Sadly, as many as 17 \npercent of youth under the age of 18 that enter adult prisons have not \ncompleted eighth grade, 75 percent have not completed 10th grade.\n\n  Put in graphic economic terms, it is estimated that truants and high \nschool drop outs cost the nation $240 billion in lost earnings and \nforegoing taxes over their lifetimes, and the cost of associated crime \ncontrol is staggering and perhaps immeasurable.\n  In most cases the parents may not be aware their child is truant, and \nwe\n\n[[Page S8998]]\n\nhave to do a better job of notifying them when a child is not in \nschool. Most studies indicate that when parents, schools, law \nenforcement and community leaders all work together to prevent truancy, \nto intervene at its early stages, and to create meaningful \naccountability, we can increase school attendance and reduce daytime \ncrime rates.\n  Because truancy is usually an indicator of later delinquency and \ncriminal behavior, we have one of the best opportunities to identify \nthe kids that are on track to later problems and to intervene before \nthe problems get too serious. The unfortunate truth, however, is that \nis addressing juvenile crime, we have not focused enough attention on \nthis specific issue, and although prevention programs can work, there \nis a lack of targeted federal funding for effective truancy prevention.\n  The Departments of Justice and Education both have recognized truancy \nprevention as a key reducing juvenile crime. The Departments jointly \nhave issued a series of reports called ``Youth out of the Education \nMainstream,'' that shine a positive spotlight on various proven \ncomprehensive, collaborative truancy models from around the country.\n  Once such program is the Daytime Curfew Program in Roswell, New \nMexico, and the Truancy Intervention Project in Fulton County, Georgia, \nadministered by Judge Glenda Hatchett. Another successful program \nincluded in this Act is the Grade Court, which is Farmington, New \nMexico, administered by Judge Paul Onuska. All of these programs \nintegrate parental involvements with schools, law enforcement, \njudiciary, and other community stakeholders in a collaborative effort \nto reduce truancy and juvenile crime.\n  This Act authorizes $25 million per year targeted at building upon \nintegral partnerships between local government, schools, law \nenforcement, and the courts. Without a doubt, $25 million is a very \nsmall price to pay when you consider the dividends we expect when young \npeople stay in school and out of trouble.\n\n  In general, this Act provides incentives for partnerships between \nschools and local government, including local law enforcement to build \nparental involvement in situations where they may be useful and \nparental responsibility when necessary. The Act also provides \nincentives for these partnerships to develop meaningful penalties for \nyoung people and even their parents when truancy has become a chronic \nproblem, and to allow schools the means to develop in-school \nalternatives to suspension and expulsion for chronic truants. This Act \nalso will give schools the resources to acquire the technological tools \nto notify parents automatically in the event of an unexcused absence.\n  The Act is endorsed by the Youth Law Center, the Children's Defense \nFund, and the National Network for Youth, which has more than 500 \ncommunity youth-serving organizations and personnel nationwide all \ncommitted to helping keep our young people on track and keeping our \ncommunities peaceful. I thank these organizations for their assistance \nand know this Act will be enthusiastically received by many more \nimportant organizations. I urge my Senate colleagues to support the \nbill for passage this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Truancy Prevention and \n     Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Truancy is the first sign of trouble--the first \n     indicator that a young person is giving up and losing his or \n     her way.\n       (2) Many students who become truant eventually drop out of \n     school, and high school drop outs are two and a half times \n     more likely to be on welfare than high school graduates; \n     twice as likely to be unemployed, or if employed, earn lower \n     salaries.\n       (3) Truancy is the top-ranking characteristic of \n     criminals--more common than such factors as coming from \n     single-parent families and being abused as children.\n       (4) High rates of truancy are linked to high daytime \n     burglary rates and high vandalism.\n       (5) As much as 44 percent of violent juvenile crime takes \n     place during school hours.\n       (6) As many as 75 percent of children ages 13-16 who are \n     arrested and prosecuted for crimes are truants.\n       (7) Some cities report as many as 70 percent of daily \n     student absences are unexcused, and the total number of \n     absences in a single city can reach 4,000 per day.\n       (8) Society pays a significant social and economic cost due \n     to truancy: only 34 percent of inmates have completed high \n     school education; 17 percent of youth under age 18 entering \n     adult prisons have not completed grade school (8th grade or \n     less), 25 percent completed 10th grade, and 2 percent \n     completed high school.\n       (9) Truants and later high school drop outs cost the Nation \n     $240 billion in lost earnings and foregone taxes over their \n     lifetimes, and the cost of crime control is staggering.\n       (10) In many instances, parents are unaware a child is \n     truant.\n       (11) Effective truancy prevention, early intervention, and \n     accountability programs can improve school attendance and \n     reduce daytime crime rates.\n       (12) There is a lack of targeted funding for effective \n     truancy prevention programs in current law.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, as the Senate conducts its \nbusiness today, South Carolina mourns the passing of one of its \ngreatest citizens. Buck Mickel, a man who stands as a giant in the \nhistory of the Carolina Upstate, passed away Thursday morning, July 23. \nOne of the greatest pleasures of my life has been my long friendship \nwith Buck. I count it a privilege to have known him and to have learned \nfrom his example.\n  Every moment of Buck's 72 years was spent in dynamic enterprise and \nproductive activity. He was a tireless dynamo, a man whose vigor and \nenergy was rivaled only by his bold ideas, humanitarian impulses, and \nsincere humility. No simple description of Buck does justice to the \nscope of his activities or the importance of his full life to the lives \nof everyone who lives in the Upstate.\n  Buck was a savvy businessman. When he took the reins of Daniel \nConstruction Company in the early 1960s, he steered it from its \nposition as a successful, regional business to a thriving, global \ncompany. By the time he retired from active management of the company \nin 1987, he had expanded Daniel Construction's business, taken it \npublic in 1969, and merged it with Fluor Corporation in 1977 to create \ntoday's construction and engineering giant, Fluor Daniel Corporation. \nIn the meantime, he created thousands of jobs for South Carolinians and \nother Americans and helped lead the way in the creation of overseas \noperations for U.S. companies.\n  In fact, after Buck ``retired'' (any use of this word in connection \nwith Buck Mickel must be taken with more than a grain of salt) in 1987, \nhe continued to travel the world to help groom young Fluor managers for \neventual leadership within the company.\n  Leadership was the theme of Buck Mickel's extraordinary life. His \nsense of duty and responsibility, with the recognition that he was a \nnatural-born leader if ever there was one, informed every aspect of \nBuck's life.\n  Buck's prodigious achievements as a businessman and his famed savvy \nqualify him as a great success on their own.\n\n[[Page S9000]]\n\n Les McCraw, who succeeded Buck as head of Fluor, summed up Buck's \nposition in his field. ``To say that he was a giant in the construction \nindustry is a gross understatement,'' Mr. McCraw said. ``He clearly was \none of the all-time leaders in that industry and had been for 40 \nyears.''\n  But Buck's friends know his greatest passion was not commerce. He was \nconsumed by a desire to enrich and expand the economic and cultural \nlife of South Carolina, and he devoted every waking minute to those \ntwin tasks. Robert Royall, South Carolina's Secretary of Commerce, said \nBuck ``loved South Carolina as much as anyone I have ever known and \ncontributed more to developing the state than anyone in my lifetime. . \n. . He was constantly thinking about ways to help the state.''\n  Buck stayed in regular contact with almost everyone in public life in \nSouth Carolina. I spoke to him just last week, and as always, he was \nspinning ideas about how to help the state. In fact, Mr. President, the \nuniversal reaction among public figures in South Carolina since Buck's \ndeath has been disbelief. It's just hard to believe that a man so \nvital, so full of ideas and concern for others, could pass from among \nus. It may take awhile for us to realize the full import of his death, \nbut when we do, I believe Buck's death will hit us as hard as any in \nour state's history.\n  Highest on the list of Buck's achievements is the revitalization of \ndowntown Greenville, SC, and the tremendous development of the region's \neconomy. As the Greenville News wrote, Buck ``put his imprint on \nvirtually every civic project in Greenville for almost half a \ncentury.'' Buck was instrumental to Greenville's building its Peace \nCenter for the Performing Arts, which has won national acclaim as a \nvenue for the live arts; restoring numerous dilapidated buildings in \nGreenville proper; luring important businesses back to the downtown \narea; and raising funds for a new sports arena. These developments have \ntransformed Greenville in a way impossible to imagine if you haven't \nlived there, Mr. President.\n  Of course, Buck's beneficence and energy were by no means limited to \nGreenville. He helped attract Michelin, BMW, and other international \nbusinesses to the state. Buck supported secondary education--his \nsupport helped make the Governor's School for the Arts possible--and \nhigher education. He and his wife, Minor, were active with Furman, \nClemson, and Wofford Universities, as well as with the University of \nSouth Carolina. Buck rose from humble origins and relied on a \nscholarship to Georgia Tech University, so he knew the importance not \nonly of education but of financial support for those in need of aid. He \nand his wife gave generously of their time and money to South Carolina \ncolleges and endowed many scholarships.\n  Buck Mickel's life has touched almost every life in my state. Because \nBuck was so humble and modest, most of those he helped do not even \nrealize the debt they owe him. With Buck Mickel's passing, South \nCarolina has lost one of its greatest civic and business leaders. Quite \nhonestly, Mr. President, I don't know how we will replace him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/24/senate-section/article/S8999-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING TRACIE MITCHELL\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, in 1995, when I was \nprivileged to serve as President of the Oregon State Senate, I was \ninvited by State Representative Margaret Carter to tour Portland \nCommunity College, which was located in her district, in the heart of \nOregon's largest city. As I represented a rural Eastern Oregon \ndistrict, I looked upon this tour as a valuable learning opportunity. \nAnd what I learned was that PCC was offering a lifeline for many \neconomically disadvantaged students who were seeking to build a better \nfuture for themselves and their family.\n  I was so impressed with the work of PCC, that when I was elected to \nthe United States Senate, I approached PCC with the idea of each year \ngiving one of their students the opportunity to serve as an intern in \nmy Washington, D.C. office.\n  The student selected to serve as the first PCC intern was Tracie \nMitchell, whose final day in my office is today. I just want to take a \nminute to salute Tracie, not only for her outstanding work in my \noffice, but also for the outstanding accomplishments at home and in her \ncareer. Through the programs at PCC, Tracie, a mother of two wonderful \nchildren--Ruben and Shea, earned a degree in Microelectronics, and has \ngained employment at Tektronix, one of Oregon's outstanding high tech \ncompanies.\n  I know that Tracie is anxious to return to her children, her job, and \nher classes at PCC, and I thank her for her service to my office and to \nall Oregonians. If she has learned as much from her internship as my \noffice as learned from her, then I know this summer has been a very \nrewarding experience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/24/senate-section/article/S9000-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JULY 27, 1998\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
