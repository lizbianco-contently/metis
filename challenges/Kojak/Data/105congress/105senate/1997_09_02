Mr. President, today, the Senate will be returning from the \nAugust recess and will begin immediate consideration of S. 1061, the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill. The chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Specter, is here and is ready to go with the opening debate. As \nannounced prior to the recess, there will be no rollcall votes during \ntoday's session. Members will be offering amendments, hopefully, to the \nbill. Today, however, any votes ordered on those amendments will occur \nduring Wednesday's session.\n  Also under the order, at 2:15 p.m. today, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Agriculture appropriations bill to allow Senator \nHarkin to offer an amendment regarding the FDA. A rollcall vote will \noccur on or in relation to Senator Harkin's amendment at approximately \n9:50 on Wednesday morning, tomorrow morning.\n  I remind my colleagues, in addition to the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill this week the Senate needs to consider and complete action on the \nInterior appropriations bill as well as the Food and Drug \nAdministration reform bill. If there is difficulty continuing with the \nFDA reform, it would be my intent to file a cloture motion tomorrow, \nwhich would then ripen on Friday morning, and unless some agreement can \nbe worked out we would have to have that vote on Friday morning.\n  Therefore, after today's session, votes will be occurring each day. \nThe chairman just indicated to me he would hope to finish the Labor-HHS \nbill tomorrow night, but we will stay on the bill and get it completed \nexcept for the one vote at 9:50 on Wednesday, and of course, if we have \nto go to FDA reform--we can complete the bill, although I hope it can \nbe completed by the time we get to FDA.\n  I urge Senators that are back in town that have amendments to the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill to please come to the floor, offer those \namendments today, so that you can have them debated now and not get \nunder a time pressure late tomorrow afternoon or tomorrow night or \nwhenever we get to the close of the debate. I think you get a lot \nbetter consideration of amendments if you come and offer them early \nrather than later.\n  I want to thank all Senators for their past and hopefully continued \ncooperation during the remainder of the first session of the 105th \nCongress. As all Members are aware, as we approach adjournment at the \nend of this legislative session it will be very busy and will \nnecessitate everyone working with the leaders as we try to complete the \nremaining schedules. We have not had an opportunity to meet with the \nleadership and to talk with the leadership on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle about exactly when our target adjournment will be, but during \nthe remainder of the week we will be doing so. Later on this week, to \nearly next week, we will give Senators some idea of our hoped for \nadjournment.\n  I do want to say again how much I appreciate the cooperation that we \nhave had this year. We did complete the Balanced Budget Act and the tax\n\n[[Page S8632]]\n\nrelief package. We also have already passed 10 of our 13 appropriations \nbills, with only 3 remaining, this bill, the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill, Interior, and the District of Columbia. We would like to finish, \nin fact, we plan to finish, all three of those bills by the end of next \nweek. Then we will begin to take up conference reports and other bills \nthat are necessary before we end the session for this year. It did take \ncooperation from all Senators and it took cooperation of the leadership \non both sides of the aisle. I hope we can continue that and do the \npeople's business in a way that produces results that will help the \nquality of life of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see Senator Harkin is here. \nTherefore, the managers of the bill are now ready. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8631-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8632-S8640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senate will now proceed to \nthe consideration of S. 1061, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1061) making appropriations for the Departments \n     of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \n     related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1998, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are prepared now to proceed with \nconsideration of the legislation on appropriations for the Departments \nof Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.\n  I have just conferred with my distinguished colleague, Senator \nHarkin, the ranking Democrat, after having conferred with the majority \nleader, and it is our plan to complete action on this bill by tomorrow \nevening, Wednesday evening. That is not to say that the plan will \nconclusively be fulfilled as of that time, but it is our plan to \nproceed in that manner.\n  It would be our hope that we would have a firm idea of all the \namendments which would be offered by the end of business today or if \nnot, no later than noon tomorrow, since we are scheduled to have a vote \ntomorrow morning at 9:30, and as is the custom, Senators will be \narriving today. Some are obviously present now, but as our practice has \ndemonstrated in the past, when the rollcall vote is taken, Senators \nwill be present.\n  We have had some substantial period of time--obviously, slightly more \nthan a month--to prepare for this bill, because the majority leader \nannounced at the conclusion of our session on July 31-August 1, that \nthis would be the first order of business taken up.\n  I recall the comment of then majority leader Howard Baker on some \nlegislation back in 1982, when we had a tax bill on the floor of the \nSenate and the question was whether we were going to proceed all night, \nwhich Senator Baker was wont to do, or whether we would go into the \nnext morning. I recall Senator Baker said that amendments, like \nmushrooms, grew overnight, and it was his determination to proceed that \nevening. I remember there were about 70 amendments pending. Senator \nDole was the manager of the bill. It was a tax bill. We proceeded all \nnight and finished action about 6:30 in the morning.\n  Well, there has been more time than overnight for these amendments, \nlike mushrooms, to grow, but we have a bill here which is very \nimportant.\n  There is a lot of business in the Senate, and speaking from a \npersonal note, we will be moving ahead with hearings on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on campaign finance reform, and I serve \non that committee. I hope to be finished with this bill by tomorrow \nnight, whatever time it takes to proceed with the other work of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. My colleague asks me to yield for unanimous consent. I \nam willing to do that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                        Privileges of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ellen Murray, \nPeter Reinecke, and Bev Schroeder be permitted privileges of the floor \nfor the duration of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, moving now to consideration of the \npending bill, the pending committee report, we have legislation before \nthe Senate for the three departments, the Department of Labor, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and the Department of \nEducation for fiscal year 1998, which totals $79.7 billion in \ndiscretionary budget authority. That is a large sum of money. Mandatory \nspending under this totals $189.3 billion, which is a decrease of $15.2 \nbillion from the fiscal year 1997 levels.\n  We have gone through the budget with great care. We have been \nfortunate enough to have outstanding staffs, both on the Republican \nside of the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle, and we have \ncome forward with these proposals here today. It is my view, Mr. \nPresident, that when we have a total Federal budget of $1.7 trillion, \nthat should provide for the needs of the American people through the \nFederal Governmental operations, if we assess our priorities in a \nproper way. We have just seen landmark legislation with the balanced \nbudget legislation, and the tax reduction legislation passed by the \nCongress before we adjourned on August 1, and signed by the President \ninto law on August 5. It is very important that we do reach that \nbalanced budget. We should not, as a nation, spend beyond our means. I \nbelieve it is possible to achieve that goal if we work with a scalpel \nand not a meat ax and take care of the important needs for all of \nAmerica.\n  We deal here with the subjects of health and education and there are \nno priorities higher than those two items. The people of America, the \npeople of the United States, should be healthy and there should be \neducational opportunities so people should have an opportunity to climb \nthe ladder in America.\n  When I talk of education, I talk from a very keen sense personally of \neducation as an opportunity which I have seen. Both of my parents were \nimmigrants. My father literally walked across Europe from Russia, \nbarely a ruble in his pocket, at the age of 18 in 1911 to make a new \nlife for himself and the family which he hoped to have and did have. My \nmother, coming with her parents to the United States from a small town \non the Russian-Polish border at the age of 5, education was heavily \nemphasized in the Specter household because our parents had so little \nof it. My brother, my two sisters, and I have been able to share in the \nAmerican dream because of that educational opportunity.\n  As Senator Harkin and I and our staffs have crafted this legislation, \nwe have done our utmost to provide for that educational opportunity. We \nhave provided for increases in the maximum Pell grant to $3,000 per \nyear. We have provided for guaranteed student loans. It would be \npreferable if we could provide scholarships for all young people, and \nolder people who want additional education, but that is not possible in \na practical sense, so we have a revolving sum where at least the \neducation can be obtained, even if there are obligations that would \nhave to be paid at a later time.\n  We have come to this budget with very deep concerns over the issue of \nhealth. Regrettably, when the budget resolution was presented to us, \nthere was a cut of some $100 million on discretionary health spending \nwhich required a considerable reallocation of priorities, which Senator \nHarkin and I and our subcommittee and then the full committee and our \nstaffs have undertaken. That was especially problemsome when it came to \nthe issue of the National Institutes of Health where it was our desire \nto continue to increase the funding on medical research which has been \nso marvelous for America and our advances benefiting the entire world.\n\n  Early in the 105th session, we passed a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, or a sense-of-the-Senate resolution was introduced and, I \nbelieve, passed--we will check the Record on that to be sure--to double \nNIH funding over 5 years. If it wasn't passed, the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions pass pretty easily around here because they talk about our \ndruthers as opposed to our dollars. Then, when we took up the budget \nresolution, and a sense-of-the-Senate resolution passed to increase NIH \nfunding\n\n[[Page S8633]]\n\nby some $2 billion. Then Senator Harkin and I offered an amendment to \nincrease it--not a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, but hard dollars of \n$1.1 billion. That would have left us with a net of about $950 million \nto achieve the 7.5-percent increase Senator Harkin and I committed to \nearly in the session for the NIH.\n  When we brought that amendment to the floor, it was roundly defeated \n63-37, which was somewhat disappointing. But it was an illustration of \nwhat happens in the Senate when you have a sense of the Senate, which \nis an expression of what you would like to see, or druthers, as opposed \nto a hard amendment which puts up money. And when we balance the \nbudget, if we put up 7.5 percent, which is $952 million, we have to \nhave someplace to take it from. When that choice is made, it isn't too \neasy to get the votes. That amendment went down to defeat, as I said, \n63-37. But then we went back to the drawing boards with our sharp \npencils--mainly staff's sharp pencils--and figured out a way on the \nallocation of priorities to find that 7.5 percent, or $952 million, and \nwe did find it. It was not easy to do, but we thought that that was \nwhat ought to be done.\n  In the United States, it is my view that we have the best health care \nsystem in the world, but it continues to need improvement. I personally \nwas the beneficiary of that health care system about 4 years ago when \nan MRI detected a life-threatening problem that I had, and I was able \nto get my medical situation corrected. There is nothing like having a \nproblem and using the MRI personally to do a little research to find \nout about its development. I was surprised to find that it had only \nbeen developed in 1984, less than a decade before I found the need to \nuse it.\n  Within the course of the past week, I had occasion to return to my \nhome State of Kansas for my 50th high school reunion. I probably should \nnot have given the date. I may get leave to amend and revise the \nCongressional Record on that. Just kidding. It was my 50th high school \nreunion. My Aunt Rose Isemberg, in Wichita, who is 85, was the \nbeneficiary of a serious operation and is well on her way to recovery. \nI focused on that factor and mentioned to my Aunt Rose that in some \ncountries you can't get an operation when you are that old. In some \ncountries you can't get one if you are past 60. So we have a marvelous \nhealth system in the United States, but, again, one which needs \nimprovement.\n  When I returned to my hometown of Russell, KS, to my high school \nreunion, I was reminiscing with my sister-in-law, Joyce Specter, about \nthe medical care in Russell, KS. My brother had some serious ailments \nseveral years ago, and I was with him. Unfortunately, he passed away. \nBack then, I wanted to talk to Dr. Merkel, and it was 6:45 on a \nSaturday night. I asked for his home number and I was told, ``You can't \ncall Dr. Merkel at home at 6:45 on a Saturday. You will find him in the \noffice.''\n  Notwithstanding our graduations of doctors and medical experts, rural \nAmerica still doesn't have as much by way of health care providers as \nrural America needs. So we do have significant improvements to be made \nin our health system in America. This is something which we have \nfocused on as we have moved ahead in this bill and our efforts to \nprovide health care coverage for all Americans.\n  Again, on a personal note, I was fascinated to hear of the health \ncoverage offered by Israel, without regard for preexisting conditions \nor without regard for age--a factor called to my attention by my \nsister, Hilda Morgenstern, and my brother-in-law, Arthur Morgenstern, \nwho have dual citizenship in the United States and in Israel. There are \nexamples around the world as we try to extend health coverage and \nservices to the 37 to 41 million Americans who are not now covered. It \nis appropriate to note that in the reconciliation bill we passed, the \nBalanced Budget Act, we have taken action to provide some $24 billion \nto cover America's uninsured children, numbering about 10 million. \nThere is a question, as we work through the program, as to how many of \nthose children we will be able to cover.\n  Mr. President, during the course of our deliberations, Senator Harkin \nand I received requests from Members, totaling more than 700 such \nrequests, for expanded funding for programs within the subcommittee's \njurisdiction, and, to the maximum extent possible, we tried to honor \nthose requests. We had very substantial support for increasing the \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health and, as noted, we have \ndone that with an increase of 7.5 percent, some $952 million. So that \nnow we have nearly $13.7 billion for the National Institutes of Health, \nand their achievements have been near miraculous as they have moved \nahead with research on breast cancer, ovarian cancer--very serious \nailments for women--and prostate cancer for men, Alzheimer's disease--\nvery substantial advances in research there--mental health research, \nresearch on heart conditions, and virtually every known ailment that \nhas come within the scope of the National Institutes of Health.\n  One of the really educational experiences that I personally have had \non the job as chairman of the subcommittee is we have received so many \nrequests from so many people around the United States who have ailments \nthat I had never heard about. I do believe that we have a budget which \ncan accommodate research along those lines. If this recommendation is \ninsufficient, I believe the Congress of the United States is prepared, \non a priority basis, to allocate whatever it takes on medical research \nin the United States to do the job. Even with that kind of a funding, \nthere are many applications which are not granted. We have moved ahead \nvery substantially in the time that I have been in the Senate, whether \nthe chairman was Senator Weicker, later Governor Weicker, or Senator \nChiles, later Governor Chiles, or whether Senator Harkin was chairman, \nor during my chairmanship.\n  The committee has placed a very high priority on women's health. The \nbill provides for increased funding. There will be funding for expanded \nprograms to develop mental health care services for women, to provide \nmoneys for a comprehensive review of the impact of heart disease on \nwomen, where in the past less attention was paid to that important \nitem. Women do have different problems, very different from men, when \nit comes to heart ailments. For so many years, the research had been on \nmen alone. The additional funding will help launch an osteoporosis \npublic education program aimed at teenagers.\n  In our legislation, we have provided funding for both family planning \nand for abstinence programs. One of the most controversial issues \nfacing America is the controversy of pro-choice/pro-life. But there is \none item that can be generally agreed upon, and that is if we can cut \ndown on premarital sex among teenagers and unintended pregnancies, and \nthe abortions which follow, that is an objective where there is general \nagreement, and we have produced additional funding here for those \nprograms devoted to abstention.\n  One of the items on which we continue to increase funding is our \nprogram on Healthy Start. That is an initiative to try to give prenatal \ncare to women and avoid having low-birthweight babies. I saw my first \n1-pound baby at Alma Illery Medical Facility in Pittsburgh more than a \ndecade ago, and I was shocked to see a child no bigger than my hand, \nwhich weighed less than a pound. When you have a child with that low \nbirthweight, there are medical problems that last a lifetime and \nenormous costs to society. Those children frequently cost as much as \n$300,000 by the time they are out of the hospital in a few weeks or a \nfew months. Thousands are born each year. It is a multibillion-dollar \nexpense. The program of prenatal care has had great results and is one \nwhich we are pushing ahead in the legislation pending.\n  The issue of AIDS continues to be a matter of overwhelming importance \nin the United States. Today's front page of the Washington Post is \ndevoted significantly to it. Our bill contains some $3.265 billion for \nresearch, education, prevention, and services, including an $81 million \nincrease for the Ryan White CARE Program, named after the young man who \ndeveloped AIDS on a blood transfusion--nothing at fault even remotely \nthere. This issue continues to be of enormous importance in the United \nStates.\n  Our legislation provides further assistance in funding for substance \nabuse, both alcohol and drugs, a major problem in our country.\n\n[[Page S8634]]\n\n  We have taken the initiative with some $50 million for new programs \nto assist communities in preventing juvenile crime. That is an issue of \ngreat concern in the United States and one which falls partially within \nthe jurisdiction of our subcommittee. It is not inappropriate to note \nat this time that pending before the Judiciary Committee is extensive \nlegislation on juvenile crime. It is my hope that we will craft a bill, \nwhen the issue comes to the floor of the U.S. Senate, which will take \ninto account not only tough measures to try juveniles as adults, where \nthey are, in fact, adults by size or inclination and prior record, but \nalso to work on the literacy training and job training.\n  Based on the experience I have had on the Judiciary Committee, and \nbefore that as district attorney of Philadelphia, it is my view that we \ncan control violent crime in America if we approach it at two levels. \nOne, where we have career criminals, to have life sentences. The armed \ncareer criminal bill that I offered, which passed back in 1984, has \nmade a significant effort in that regard. Where you have a career \ncriminal with three or more violent offenses, now, by Federal law, \nthere is a mandatory sentence in the Federal courts of 15 years to \nlife. We have been putting more people in jail, and there has been a \ndecrease in the crime rate. In my judgment, that is attributable to the \nfactor that there are more violent criminals now in prison. The other \nhalf of the equation, though, is to provide realistic rehabilitation \nfor those who are not career criminals, where they are going to be \nreleased. It is no surprise that if you have a functional illiterate \nwithout a trade or skill, a person who goes back onto the street \nwithout training, without a job, that person is likely to go through \nthe revolving door and become a recidivist.\n  That is why one of the first bills I introduced when I came to the \nSenate, alongside the armed career criminal bill, was legislation for \nrealistic rehabilitation, for job training and literacy training. As we \ncraft that juvenile crime bill, it is my hope that we will have an \nappropriate balance on the juveniles, on literacy training and job \ntraining, because we know that 1 day they are going to be released from \njail. A societal option is either to have them as law-abiding citizens, \nworking their way and contributing to society, or becoming criminals. \nSo it is in the interest of law-abiding citizens, as well as the \nindividuals themselves, that appropriate attention be given to literacy \ntraining and job training.\n  Also included in this bill is our allocation of funding for Head \nStart. Some $4.3 billion is included here, which is an increase of some \n$324 million. We increase the number of children by 36,000, to a total \nof 836,000, on our planned route to having 1 million covered by Head \nStart by the year 2002.\n  Also in our budget is funding to protect women against violence when \nwe talk about the categories of battered women's shelters, rape \nprevention, runaway youth prevention, domestic violence community \ndemonstrations, and the domestic violence hotline.\n\n  Another important item--controversial, as many are in this bill--is \nour program on low-income heat and energy fuel assistance. We have \nmaintained funding of some $1 billion for this winter, and advanced \nfunding of $1.2 billion for next year's winter program. This is a \nprogram which is controversial because in some States the needs are not \nas great as they are in other States. But what we have essentially for \nmany Americans, especially elderly Americans, is a choice on either \nheating or eating. With many elderly in the program with annual incomes \nof $8,000 or less, they are totally unable to cope without some \nassistance on fuel costs.\n  We also have within this bill important programs for the elderly, \nincluding community service employment programs, part-time employment \nopportunities for low-income elderly, home delivered nutrition \nservices, and the National Senior Volunteer Corps.\n  We have as well school-to-work where there is a transition moving \nfrom school to work, coordinated also with the job training programs \nand Job Corps which provide educational opportunities and vocational \ntraining for those young people in our society who may not prefer that \nto the college education and may be more appropriately directed in that \nline.\n  On education, Mr. President, we have moved ahead with an increase of \nsome $3.1 billion in our discretionary education funds.\n  I especially commend my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, for \nhis leadership in this very, very important line.\n  We have had difficulties in bringing this particular bill to the \nfloor in the past. It was not until April 1996 when we were able to--\nafter an amendment offered by Senator Harkin and myself to increase \nfunding for this subcommittee by $2.6 billion --move ahead.\n  I commend the President for his initiatives and priority setting on \neducation, which is, as I noted earlier, a priority second to none for \nthe United States.\n  In this line, we have special education programs funded at some $921 \nmillion. And I commend the chairman of the Educational Opportunities \nCommittee in the House, my colleague, Bill Goodling from Pennsylvania, \nand also our colleague, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, for their \nleadership in this item where we are trying to maintain the Federal \ncommitment to special education. We are coming very close to the high \nmarks set in S. 1. Again, it is a matter of establishing priorities, \nwhich we have done here.\n  On our student aid programs, the bill provides some $8.5 billion, \nwhich is an increase of almost $1 billion--$997.3 million over last \nyear's appropriations. The Pell grant is going up by some $300 to a \nmaximum grant of $3,000. The Supplemental Educational Opportunity \nGrants Program is increased by some $51 million.\n  I go into some detail for at least two reasons, Mr. President. These \nare important programs, and we are not taking up anybody's time, \nSenator Harkin and I being the only two Senators on the floor. I will \nyield in a few minutes for Senator Harkin's opening comments.\n  On job training, we have provided $5.2 billion for the job training \nprograms, which is more than $500 million over the 1997 level. That \nincludes increases for Job Corps, adult training, and training for \ndislocated workers, which is a very, very important problem for \nAmericans, especially in my home State of Pennsylvania where we have \nseen the demise of the steel industry and the coal industry and the \nglass industry.\n  So many of the problems of the dislocated workers are caused by \nimports which are coming into the United States, which really ought not \nto be coming into the United States, where we are dealing with concerns \non defense policy or on foreign policy. And so many American workers \nare taking it on the chin. The least we can do is to have retraining \nfor the dislocated workers.\n  Our bill provides very important funding for worker safety programs \nin the Department of Labor where we are now providing almost $1 \nbillion--just $1 million short; $999 million--for worker safety \nprograms. This is an increase of some $37 million above 1997's level \nfor worker safety activities.\n  Mr. President, I have gone over, believe it or not, just a few of the \nhighlights of this bill, which totals almost $80 billion. We have in \nexcess of $11 billion for the Department of Labor, almost $32 billion \nfor the Department of Health and Human Services, and almost $30 billion \non the Department of Education, coming to a total of almost $80 billion \nin discretionary funding.\n  To repeat, Mr. President, on the schedule, which the majority leader \nand Senator Harkin and I have discussed earlier, it would be our plan--\nour optimistic plan, but our plan nonetheless--to conclude action on \nthis bill by tomorrow night. We would like to have all amendments filed \nby the close of business today and, in any event, no later than noon \ntomorrow. All the Senators will be here, as we have every expectation \nfor the vote scheduled at 9:30 tomorrow so that we can make our plans \nand scheduling for any amendments which may be filed.\n  At this time, I am pleased to yield to my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for his leadership on \nthis plan and for outlining in great detail the various aspects of the \nbill that he\n\n[[Page S8635]]\n\njust covered, in our efforts to craft a truly bipartisan bill to bring \nto the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, S. 1061, the Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation and related agencies for fiscal year 1998, is now before us.\n  Again, I want to start by commending our chairman for his skill and \nhis craftsmanship in putting this bill together.\n  Senator Specter has ably balanced the many, often competing requests \nwe have received--as he mentioned, over 700 different types of requests \nfrom Senators. It is always a very tough job, and I appreciate how \nclosely he has worked with me and my staff in crafting a truly \nbipartisan plan.\n  For example, the bill's broad support was reflected in its unanimous \napproval by the full Appropriations Committee.\n  I am especially pleased that the bill provides significant increases \nin funding for key education programs.\n  Senator Specter quite ably went over those. I will not repeat those \nagain. I will just mention what Senator Specter had said in terms of \nthe bill grants--the increase in the stipend from $2,700 to $3,000. \nThis will help over 3.6 million low- and moderate-income students in \ncolleges and institutions of higher learning this next year. This is \nthe highest level of Pell grant support.\n  The bill exceeds the support for education recommended by the \nbipartisan budget agreement by $164 million. It includes significant \nincreases for special education and education technology and, in \nparticular, funds to support teacher training. Computers in the \nclassroom are of no value if teachers don't know how to use them \neffectively.\n  The mark in the bill puts special emphasis on early intervention. The \ncornerstone, as we know, for educational success are the first years of \na child's life. Recent research on the brain provides irrefutable proof \nabout the dramatic development in children before the age of 3. So we \nmust intensify our efforts to make sure that all children enter school \nready to learn. We have begun to lay the foundation in this bill by \nincreasing Head Start funding by $324 million, and we have doubled the \nset-aside for early Head Start which serves children up to the age of \n3.\n  This bill also provides an 11-percent increase in funding to $350 \nmillion for the early intervention program for infants and toddlers \nwith disabilities served by part H of the Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act.\n  Again, Mr. President, as we know, it is vital for children without \ndisabilities to have early educational services. We know that it is \ndoubly vital for kids, infants, and toddlers with disabilities to have \nthose early intervention programs before the age of 3.\n  I am also very pleased that we are able to make a start--not a big \none, but at least a start--on the Education Grant Infrastructure \nProgram. I think we can all agree that the infrastructure needs of our \nschool systems are truly staggering. Most estimates of nationwide \nschool repair and construction costs exceed $100 billion. Again, \nclearly, school construction and repair will and should remain \nprimarily a State and local responsibility. Nevertheless, I think there \nis a limited Federal role here, and it is one would that is connected \nto the longstanding Federal support for the education of disadvantaged \nchildren through the title I program.\n  I am often asked the question, Mr. President, ``Where is it indicated \nin the Constitution of the United States that education funding must \ncome out of property taxes?'' I have here a little pocket copy of the \nConstitution that I try to carry with me at all times. I find it a very \ngood reference. A lot of times I hold it up, and ask people, ``Where? \nShow me where in the Constitution of the United States, as amended, \nthat it says that education in America is to be funded on the basis of \nproperty taxes.''\n  You can read every word in the Constitution of the United States and \nthe Bill of Rights, all the amendments thereto, and you will not find \none thing in the Constitution that says how education is to be funded. \nIt doesn't say we have to pay for it through property taxes. But that \nis sort of the system that evolved in our country over the years. So \nwhat we have are these anomalies.\n  I happen to maintain a residence, as many of my colleagues do, in \nsuburban Virginia, in Fairfax County. To be sure, both of my daughters \nhave gone to public schools in Fairfax County, and I can tell you the \nschools here are wonderful. They are great schools. That is 12 miles \nfrom where we are standing right now.\n  Five blocks from here, in the District of Columbia, are some of the \nworst schools in our country. Why is it? Why the difference in 12 \nmiles? Well, it is because in Fairfax County, you have a lot of high-\nincome people who pay a lot of property taxes. And they have great \nschools. Yet, five blocks from the Capitol, you have very low income \nwith very low property taxes, and no ability to fix up and repair their \nschools. This is true all over our country.\n  I refer those who are interested to a book, of course, written by a \ngood friend of mine, Jonathan Kozol, called ``Savage Inequalities.'' It \nis not a new book. It is at least 10 years old, I guess, by now. That \nproblem is very clearly across America--what it means to be a child \nlucky enough to be born to moderate to well-to-do parents who live in \nan area where there are high property taxes and high property values. \nThe schools are good. If you live in an inner city, or sometimes in \nAppalachia, or rural areas of America where you have low property \ntaxes, you have bad schools.\n  So homeowners who are living in poor school districts have to carry a \nmuch heavier tax burden to raise school construction funds. Where they \nhave the worst schools, they need the most repairs. Yet, they have the \nleast ability to do so because they have a low tax base.\n  Homeowners who live in affluent districts, however, have it much \neasier. So the homeowners who live in the poor areas have a much harder \nburden to carry in repairing and constructing new schools. And so I \nhave long felt it is, indeed, at least part of the responsibility of \nthe Federal Government to equalize this, to equalize it somewhat.\n  Now, in States we have acquisition formulas. In my State of Iowa, for \nexample, yes, property taxes are local, but the State recognizes, as \nmany other States have done, that it provides for a lot of \ninequalities. So the State has stepped in with equalization formulas to \ntry to equalize funding for schools at least in regard to construction \nand repair for those who are in poor areas and those who are in rich \nareas, more affluent areas. But, again, we have anomalies existing \nthroughout the country, and so I think the Federal Government could \nemulate a little bit of what the States have done and have some kind of \nequalization where we will provide funds for repair and construction of \nschool facilities to those areas with the greatest needs and the fewest \nlocal resources.\n  Now, again, I would not want this money to replace money that is \nalready being provided by the States. We do not want to do that. We do \nnot want to provide money to a low-income school district and the State \nwill say, well, good, we are getting all those Federal dollars; now we \ndon't have to do anything.\n  Therefore, there must be an effort at equity by the States to \ncontinue to have their equalization programs. And I would envision that \nthe rules developed by the Department would take that into account in \nproviding this money that we have for school construction and repair.\n  A major concern I have about the bill is our inability to more \nadequately address our health services and training needs while at the \nsame time simultaneously providing generous increases for health \nresearch.\n  Now, again, I will not go into it at length here. I have talked about \nit many times in the Chamber, and I will talk about it and keep talking \nabout it until we do something about it. And that is the need to \nprovide more money for biomedical research.\n  As my friend, the chairman, said earlier, a few months ago the Senate \nwent on record 99 to 0 to double NIH funding over the next 5 years. A \nfew weeks after that, Senator Specter and I offered an amendment, very \nmodest, to provide about a $1.1 billion increase out of our pot for \nincreased funding for NIH. And as Senator Specter pointed out, that \nwent down almost 2 to 1. We got 37 votes for it.\n  So it was sort of the will of the Senate. It is our will to provide a \ndoubling\n\n[[Page S8636]]\n\nof funding for NIH over 5 years, but there is no money there to back it \nup.\n  Now, there are some who say, well, we can take it out of our bill. If \nwe did so, Mr. President, under the constraints of the Balanced Budget \nAct that we have adopted here, under the constraints of that balanced \nbudget agreement, if we doubled funding for NIH out of the pot of money \nthat we have, there would not be one single penny left for any other \ndiscretionary health program.\n  What does that mean? There would be no Centers for Disease Control. \nWe would have no money for that. We would have no community health \ncenters in any States, no substance abuse programs, no family planning \nmoney, no mental health program money from the Federal Government. All \nof that would be wiped out. And we still would not have enough money to \ndouble NIH funding over 5 years. So here we have it, on the one hand, \n99 Senators saying we want to double NIH funding, biomedical research \nfunding over 5 years, but we don't have the money to do it--not within \nour bill we don't, unless those 99 Senators, or at least 51 of those \nSenators want to cut all of the funding for the Centers for Disease \nControl and wipe it out, cut out all Ryan White funding, cut out every \none of our community health centers in America, and on and on and on. \nIf we do that, we get close. We do not get the double, but we get \nclose.\n  Obviously, there are not going to be 51 Senators who will vote to cut \nout the community health centers in America or the Centers for Disease \nControl. That would be ridiculous. As I have said many times, we have \nto go outside the discretionary fund that we have for the National \nInstitutes of Health. We have to provide a different source of \nfunding--outside of our appropriations process.\n  What I have advocated, along with our former colleague, Senator Mark \nHatfield--we advocated it at least since 1991, 1992--is setting up a \nmedical research trust fund that would be funded out of the premiums \nthat we pay in for our health insurance coverage.\n  Again, Mr. President, you and I and all the rest of us here and \nAmericans throughout the country who have insurance programs, we pay in \nevery year and our employer pays in, matches it. It varies how much is \nmatched, but we pay in, both employers and employees pay in for health \ninsurance to the tune of about $700-some billion a year.\n  I always ask audiences when I talk about this, do you know how much \nof that money goes for health research, to find the causes and cures \nfor things like diabetes and Alzheimer's and cancer and AIDS and \nParkinson's disease and mental health? How much of that money that you \nput into your premiums goes to pay for medical research?\n  The answer is zero. Not one single penny. No corporation in America \nwould try to continue to move along without putting some money into \nresearch. And yet we sort of stagger along in this country every year \nputting more and more money into health insurance programs to pay for \ntaking care of people with Alzheimer's or with cancer or with \nParkinson's disease or with diabetes, et cetera, et cetera. We pay all \nthat money in to take care of those illnesses once they occur, but not \none penny is used to find the causes and cures.\n  It does not seem to make sense. So what Senator Hatfield and I \nadvocated for several years was that just one penny, just one penny out \nof every dollar that we put into our health insurance programs go to a \ntrust fund.\n  Think of it like this. We have a highway trust fund. Every time you \nbuy a gallon of gas, some of that money goes into the highway trust \nfund. It cannot be used for anything else. It must be used for \ntransportation purposes. We have an airport and airways trust fund. \nWhen I buy an airplane ticket, some of that goes into the airports and \nairways trust fund. So it is not new. Well, we have a Social Security \ntrust fund, obviously, but we have a lot of different trust funds to \nmeet what we have determined to be national priorities that otherwise \ncould not get sufficient funding through the appropriations process. \nAnd the American people by and large have supported us. Most everyone I \nknow supports the highway trust fund and airways trust fund.\n  What they do not support is us using the money for something else. \nBut they support us using that trust fund money for highways and for \nbridges and for airports and for airways because that is what the money \nwas put in there for. And so we have proposed that we set up that trust \nfund. That one penny a year would provide us a little over a 50-percent \nincrease in funding for NIH. That would get us a long way toward \ndoubling that funding in 5 years.\n  Now, Senator Hatfield is no longer in the Senate, but my cosponsor on \nthe bill is now my colleague and our esteemed chairman, Senator \nSpecter. We are both pushing very hard again to find another source of \nfunding for biomedical research, and I believe the trust fund concept \nis the way to go. We have hundreds and hundreds of different entities \nthroughout America supporting that concept.\n  We had a vote in the Senate a few weeks ago on this concept of having \nthis trust fund. I believe we got--we got over 51 votes, I know that, \nfor it, but we needed 60 votes because of a point of order. So over 50 \nSenators have, indeed, voted at least in concept for setting up this \ntype of a trust fund and funding it this way. I know I can speak for \nSenator Specter in saying we will continue our efforts to enlist the \nsupport of other Senators to set up this form of a trust fund. \nOtherwise, we are simply never going to have the kind of funding for \nbiomedical research that we need. What we are going to do basically is \nto keep raising insurance premiums to pay for the illnesses that \ncontinue to plague us. But if we put the money into research and find \nthe causes and cures--Mr. President, we all struggle around here trying \nto figure out what is the long-term solution to the Medicare problem: \nPeople living longer, fewer and fewer people paying into the Medicare \ntrust fund. We know we have a problem. We have to do something about \nit. Every medical expert will tell you, if you want to solve the \nMedicare problem, find the causes and cures; it is early intervention \nof illnesses and diseases.\n  If we, for example, could just delay, delay the onset of Alzheimer's \nby 5 years, we could have no problem in the Medicare trust fund--just \ndelay it 5 years. That is not to mention actually finding the cure for \nAlzheimer's. That is not to mention osteoporosis or diabetes that so \nplagues our culture, or hearing loss or eye loss. All the things that \naffect us in our older age are now coming back and costing Medicare \nmore and more money because people are living longer.\n  These are the things we can do to make sure the Medicare trust fund \nis solvent in the future, but only if we put adequate money into \nbiomedical research.\n  I said I was not going to talk about it, but once I got on a roll I \ncould not stop myself because I feel so strongly that we really are \nshortchanging ourselves when we are not putting the money into medical \nresearch.\n  Finally, Mr. President, in our report we have tried to focus the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services on the issue of fraud and abuse \nin Medicare. Speaking of Medicare, a recent inspector general's report \nfound that improper Medicare billing losses could be as high as 17 \npercent of last year's $194 billion Medicare budget--17 percent.\n  Now, again, let me digress here a little bit, Mr. President. A few \nyears ago, when I held the position that Senator Specter now holds as \nchairman of this subcommittee, I asked for a study to be done on losses \nin Medicare due to waste, fraud, and abuse. Well, we did the study. It \ncame back and said it was as high as maybe 10 to 14 percent. Well, some \nof those in the system challenged those findings. They said, well, your \nsurvey wasn't big enough. You only did one area of the country. You did \nnot sample enough items. And so it was a skewed kind of study--the \nlosses surely are not that big.\n  Well, I said, OK, fair enough criticism. So then, under the \nleadership of Senator Specter, when we changed hands in the Senate, we \nwent back and we asked them to do another study, nationwide. Several \nthousand were sampled. Every region was sampled. Guess what happened. \nThe first study came up short. It was not 10 to 14 percent. It was as \nhigh as 17 percent of Medicare payments were going out for waste and \nabuse.\n  Well, we must make this a priority and address this serious problem. \nWe\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\nhave in this bill; we have focused on it. Senator Specter has taken the \nlead.\n  Let me sum up once again by complimenting our chairman, Senator \nSpecter, and his staff and my staff for their work in putting together \nthis legislation. I look forward to a smooth process, hopefully, as \nSenator Specter said, that will enable us to be done by tomorrow.\n  And I would again just close by referring, as I did earlier, to the \nConstitution of the United States. Time and again I have had people \nquestion why we do what we are doing here in this subcommittee--in \nhealth and in human services and in education, labor, all of the \nvarious things that we cover here. The National Institutes of Health, \nwhat business is that of the Congress? Why are you getting involved in \nall those things?\n  Well, you know, it is interesting, Mr. President, that twice in the \nConstitution of the United States there is mention made of the general \nwelfare of the people of this country--first in the preamble when it \nsays, ``We the people of the United States,'' and it lays out why we \nare developing the Constitution, ``in order to form a more perfect \nUnion, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the \ncommon defense, promote the general welfare''--promote the general \nwelfare--``and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our \nposterity * * *'' Right there in the preamble it says we are doing this \nbecause we want to promote the general welfare of the people of this \ncountry.\n  Well, how do you do that? Article I of the Constitution, which lays \nout the structure of Congress and our responsibility, section 8 of \narticle I lays out what we are supposed to do here, lays out our \nresponsibilities. Congress shall have the power to do all kinds of \nthings--borrow money, regulate commerce, coin money, establish post \noffices, declare a war, et cetera, et cetera. But, in the first \nparagraph it says:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, \n     Duties, Imports and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for \n     the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States. \n     * * *\n\n  Interesting, they put the common defense and the general welfare \ntogether. That is our responsibility--article I, section 8. What we are \nsupposed to do in providing for that general welfare obviously changes \nwith times and circumstances. What was providing for the general \nwelfare in the last century certainly is not what we deem to be \nproviding for the general welfare in this century, and certainly it \nwill change in the future. But, nonetheless, I believe that the bill \nbefore us meets our constitutional requirement in two ways: First, by \npromoting the general welfare, and second, by providing for the general \nwelfare through the appropriations process. So, that is our \nconstitutional obligation and I believe that we have done our level \nbest, in a bipartisan manner, to meet that requirement of article I, \nsection 8 of the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do I understand that there will be a time \nfor general discussion of the spending bill for the Departments of \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education? Am I correct that \nthere is a consent agreement on the time for debate on this legislation \nbefore the Senate moves to the Agriculture appropriations bill? Will \nthe Chair clarify that for me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. When do we move to the Agriculture Appropriations bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 2:15 we take up the agricultural \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this year's spending bill for \nthe Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.\n  I commend Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for their outstanding \njob in developing this bipartisan legislation. This bill also reflects \nPresident Clinton's priorities in his 1998 budget for strengthening our \ncommitment to education, enhancing the productivity of the Nation's \nworkforce, and improving the health of all Americans.\n  Clearly there is an urgent need to allocate increased resources to \nthese important investments if the Nation is to maintain its \ncompetitive edge in the 21st century.\n  We need to ensure that millions of children do not fall behind in \nreading, in math, in science, and technology.\n  We need to make certain that the rising cost of tuition does not put \ncollege education out of the reach for working families.\n  We need to ensure that the rising demand for job training services is \nmet, as 1.7 million welfare recipients leave the welfare rolls and seek \njobs under last year's welfare reform legislation.\n  We must also recognize the need for increased funding for biomedical \nresearch, which holds great promise to cure or prevent so many \nillnesses and can be an important factor in finding a long-term \nsolution to the fiscal problems facing Medicare.\n  This year's spending legislation for the Departments of Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education takes an important step toward making \nthese critical investments for our Nation's future.\n  Most notably, it increases the Pell grant maximum from $2,700 to \n$3,000, which will increase college aid for over 3.6 million low- and \nmiddle-income students.\n  The bill increases Head Start funding by $324 million over last \nyear's level, which will provide essential preschool services to an \nadditional 36,000 low-income children.\n  It increases the education technology funding by $275 million to help \nteachers learn to use technology effectively and help raise student \nachievement.\n  It provides $40 million for the construction and repair of schools in \nneedy areas. The General Accounting Office has found that a third of \nthe Nation's schools, with 14 million students, have one or more \nbuildings needing extensive repair. This was an concern that was \ndebated and discussed during the consideration of the budget. Great \nleadership on this issue has been provided by our friend from Illinois, \nSenator Moseley-Braun.\n  The legislation provides $81 million over last year's level for the \nRyan White AIDS Program and $24 million for the Community and Migrant \nHealth Program.\n  And it provides $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1999 for LIHEAP, which \nwill enable this important program to serve thousands of additional \nsenior citizens, the disabled, and working families by providing them \nwith heating and cooling assistance.\n  Yet the bill falls short in a number of important areas. It fails to \nprovide the additional $700 million that President Clinton requested to \nhelp 218,000 independent students afford a higher education under the \nPell Grant Program. We need to make sure that individuals who are \nmoving through the economy are going to be able to upgrade their \nskills. We know that unlike 30 years ago when an individual had a job \nand kept that job for his or her entire life, individuals who now enter \nthe job market will probably have seven different jobs over the course \nof their lives. What we are attempting to do is recognize the \nimportance of making available to these middle-income Americans the \nopportunities to upgrade their skills and continue their education.\n  None of us can visit the various community colleges without seeing \nthe dramatic change that has taken place in the ages of many of the \nstudents who will be attending. We see the average age increased now to \n26 or 27 years of age. These are individuals who are taking advantage \nof various training programs and educational opportunities to upgrade \ntheir skills so they can participate in the new economy. This issue is \na high priority of the President, but we have seen the funding for \nindependent students fall short.\n  No funds were also appropriated this year for the new child literacy \nprogram. Low achievement in reading is a national problem that deserves \nour immediate attention. Children who lack reading skills by the fourth \ngrade are more likely to fall behind and eventually to drop out of \nschool. We have had extensive hearings in the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee on that particular need. We know the committee has \ndelayed funding for child literacy, and we know that we do not have, at \nthis time, the authorizing legislation needed to ensure that those \nefforts and those resources would be\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\ncarefully targeted to get the most meaningful assistance to children. \nBut we also know that the chairman of our authorizing committee, \nSenator Jeffords, and others--a broad, bipartisan group--are strongly \ncommitted toward developing that literacy program. This issue is a \nnational priority, and we should not delay action.\n  As the ranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I \nam strongly committed to seeing that legislation authorizing the child \nliteracy initiative is enacted this year. We cannot stand by and delay \nthe $260 million needed to implement this important program.\n  The Appropriations Committee also eliminated the Supplemental State \nIncentive Grant Program that helped over 1 million students attend \ncollege last year. Any of us who have had the chance to talk to \nstudents who are using this program know what a difference it makes. I \nthink, given the very modest amount of resources we are talking about--\nsome $50 million--we ought to be able to continue the Supplemental \nState Incentive Grant Program.\n  Both the National Labor Relations Board and the Health Professions \nEducation Program are seriously underfunded in this spending bill. \nThese shortfalls will adversely affect the investigation of unfair \nlabor practices and the access of minority and low-income Americans to \nhealth care services.\n  There is in the country a sense that we have committed large \nresources for the development of professional education in the area of \nhealth care. You can make a case that in certain areas of our country \nwe do have greater numbers of trained professionals in our health care \nsystem than are necessary. But what we do not have is the kind of \noutreach programs which this Health Professions Education Program was \nmeant to have--to ensure that many low-income individuals and \nminorities would be able to access the education and be able to go and \nserve in underserved areas of the Nation.\n  The initial proposal by the administration in the area of health \nprofessions was dramatically even below what has been appropriated--or \nrequested for appropriations in the House or the Senate. Both the House \nand Senate bills have made improvements on the Clinton administration's \nproposal, and I think that Health Professions Education programs ought \nto be strengthened in the final legislation.\n  Also, the appropriations for the National Labor Relations Board will \nmean that the opportunity for investigations of various unfair labor \npractices will be unattended. If we are really interested in the \ncontinued fairness in the workplace, and when we recognize that, over \nthe past year, hundreds of thousands of workers were shortchanged in \nterms of back pay and other types of unfair practices, we want to make \nsure their interests are going to be adequately protected.\n  I commend the Appropriations Committee for its 7.8 percent increase \nfor the National Institutes of Health. But much more funding is needed \nif the Nation is to continue to make progress in the development of new \nand more effective treatments for cancer, AIDS, heart disease, and many \nother serious and debilitating conditions.\n  Both Senator Harkin, Senator Specter, Senator Mack, and many others \nhave worked tirelessly on behalf of the NIH over the years. I have \nwelcomed the opportunity to join with them and others to try to make \nsure that the opportunities that are out there now, which are \nunparalleled in terms of our research history, are taken advantage of \nin order to make an important difference in terms of the health of our \nfellow citizens and American families; but also in terms of reducing \nthe burden of health care for those families, and also to the States \nand the Federal Government.\n  Increased funding for biomedical research will reap other rewards as \nwell. It will encourage more of the best and brightest of America's \ncollege graduates to make their careers in scientific research. It will \nprovide benefits to the larger economy as scientific advances move from \nthe laboratory into the private sector, creating new businesses and job \nopportunities for many individuals.\n  Equally important is a recent study by researchers at Duke University \nthat indicates expanded funding for NIH can help keep Medicare solvent \nfor the long term. Currently, the very ill account for the overwhelming \nmajority of Medicare costs. If we invest in biomedical research to make \nsenior citizens healthier, we can save enormous sums, protect Medicare \nfor future generations, and prevent many of the illnesses of old age.\n  Mr. President, yesterday the Nation saluted its working families on \nLabor Day. This year's spending bill pays tribute to these families by \nmaking a downpayment on important education, labor, and health \nprograms.\n  More still needs to be done. Legislation still can be approved, but \nit should not be weighted down with poison pill amendments, as was the \ncase in the 104th Congress when language was offered which would have \nprohibited Medicaid funding of abortions, and it would have barred OSHA \nfrom considering new ergonomic rules. The bill represents a careful \nbipartisan compromise, and I strongly support its adoption.\n  I mentioned, Mr. President, in my comments, the provisions on the \nincrease in the Pell Grant Program and education technology. We find a \nnumber of States are moving ahead in voluntary ways, such as \nMassachusetts, to make sure that all of their schools are actually \ngoing to be tied into the Internet system. A combination of the \nexcellent cooperation between the software council in my State of \nMassachusetts and the labor unions resulted in every school in the \nState tied into the Internet system. They have laid 50 miles of cable \nin Boston alone, which was the result of voluntary contributions of \nlabor in wiring those schools and voluntary contributions from the \nvarious industries in providing the software.\n  What we need to do is make sure we not only have the education \ntechnology, but have trained educators who are going to be using \ntechnology in various ways that are going to enhance education. There \nare important resources in this bill for that program.\n  The Head Start Program, which under the more recent authorization \nwill help expectant mothers in parenting skills as well as reaching \ndown into the early childhood years. Still, there is enormous need for \nthe expansion of that program which is so important.\n  Years ago, we felt that the principal advantage of Head Start was \njust to equip children with confidence-building measures, so as they \nentered education in kindergarten and the first grade, they would be \nable to move ahead in learning. Now we are finding out that they are in \na position in the very early years--2 years old, 3 years old, 4 years \nold--to actually learn something. That is what the most recent research \nis showing, and we need to make sure we are going to be able to reach \nout to many of the disadvantaged children, the poorest children who do \nnot have the opportunities for the development of that kind of early \nstart and give some help and assistance for them.\n  School construction and repair work has been an issue that has, in \nrecent times, come before us. I can mention in terms of Boston, New \nBedford, Fall River, Lowell, Lawrence, and Springfield--and the list \ngoes on--the number of schools that are closed every day in major \ncities during the wintertime because of poor repairs and temperatures. \nThe need for school repairs are so important.\n  Local school districts are doing something, and we have a modest \nFederal program, as has been outlined, to begin to show that such an \ninitiative is enormously important. If children go to schools that are \ndeteriorating and dilapidated, you are sending a message to the \nchildren--maybe it is a subliminal message, but a message nonetheless--\nthat even though as political leaders we are making speeches about the \nimportance of children and the importance of education, the children \nsee that education is not the priority of a State, a community, or the \nNation as it should be. This is a modest effort to address this \nimportant issue.\n  There is support of the Ryan White bill and community and migrant \nhealth, which is important in reaching out to so many people. And the \nLIHEAP program which is a tried and tested program which is absolutely \nessential for so many of our elderly who live in the colder climates.\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\n  Independent students, as I mentioned, is a key element and needs \nsupport. I believe students--young, middle age, and older--who are \ngoing back to upgrade their skills at community colleges should be able \nto get some help and assistance under the various education programs. \nThe importance of this was understood in the budget agreement. I know \nboth Senators Specter and Harkin understand the importance of these \nprograms. Still, this is an area that we need to give, I think, some \nattention to as we go on into the conference.\n  We will have some opportunity to debate child literacy as we move \nahead. The real question is in timing. I think all of us here \nunderstand the importance of the enhancement of the literacy program. \nThere are many excellent programs that are taking place now, and we \nwant to continue to make progress. We are not making progress \nnationwide, and this is an area of enormous importance.\n  Again, with NIH and health professions education, the appropriations \nexceed what was initially proposed by the administration. The House has \na more favorable funding level. This program is very, very important in \ncreating opportunities for people to go into the health professions who \nwill go out and serve in many different parts of our communities.\n  Mr. President, again, I express strong support for the job that was \ndone, and I commend our committee for those areas where they have, I \nthink, made a very, very important commitment of scarce resources. We \nunderstand that there will be at least an expectation that as we move \ninto the conference, there may be additional resources that will be \navailable that could be used for funding some of these areas where \nthere is an important need.\n  I look forward, as this debate takes place, to try to see if we \ncannot find either offsets to enhance these programs that are a \npriority or at least to work with the committee to see if out of the \nconference we cannot get greater attention.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Mr. Jim Sourwine and Mr. Jack Chow, detailees to this \ncommittee, be granted the privilege of the floor during the \nconsideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had referred earlier to the allocation \nof funding of the various Departments in fiscal year 1998 for the \ncurrent bill, and the specific breakdown is as follows: Labor, $11 \nbillion; Health and Human Services, $31.9 billion; Education, $29.3 \nbillion; and related agencies, $7.5 billion; with the total being $79.7 \nbillion.\n  There is a long list of related agencies made a part of this bill, \nbut illustrative of those agencies are agencies such as the Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting, Federal Mediation Conciliation Service, the \nFederal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, the National Labor \nRelations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, \nthe Railroad Retirement Board. Those are illustrative of the agencies \ncovered by the bill. I make that delineation to give those watching on \nC-SPAN 2 a fuller picture of what this bill covers, and for the Record.\n  Earlier I had referred to certain consolidations and eliminations of \nprograms which Senator Harkin and I have worked on for fiscal year 1994 \nthrough fiscal year 1997. There are a total of 134 programs, according \nto information provided by staff, totaling $1,471,405,000. I ask \nunanimous consent that the programs in the various departments and the \namount of savings be printed in the Record, with this information being \nprovided by staff, as I say, totaling 134 programs and almost $1.5 \nbillion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          PROGRAM TERMINATIONS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    FY '95      FY '95\n                                  originally     post      FY '96    FY\n                                    enacted   rescission            '97\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              LABOR\n \nYouth Fair Chance...............     24,785           0         0      0\nRural Concentrated Employment...      3,861           0         0      0\nJTPA Capacity Building..........      6,000           0         0      0\nNatl Commission Employ.

Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator on \nthe floor at the present time, I will utilize this occasion to discuss \nthe open house town meetings which I held during the course of the past \nrecess in August to share with my colleagues and those who may be \nwatching on C-SPAN 2 some of the observations that I found in traveling \nin my State of Pennsylvania and in meeting with my citizens.\n  I make it a point to have meetings in every one of the Pennsylvania \ncounties as often as I can, and by the end of September, by the end of \nthis month, I will have covered all of my 67 counties, something that I \nfind very, very valuable.\n  What I do as a matter of format--and I think this is similar to what \nmany Senators do--is I make a very brief statement, as to what we have \ndone, and then I throw the floor open for questions. Usually I get \nsomewhere in the range of 15 to 20 questions. Regrettably, our mail \nallocation has been cut down. In prior years, it had been possible to \nsend mail to our entire counties. That mail allocation has been reduced \nso that it is not possible to send mail to all of the counties. This is \nsomething which I think the Senate ought to give serious consideration \nto revising. I believe that we ought to be frugal when it comes to \nmailings which do have some political import, but where a Senator \nhimself or herself goes out into a community to appear to make a \npresentation and respond to questions, I think that is the very essence \nof our democratic process. To the extent that the mail notifies people \nin a very direct way of the presence of a Senator coming into the \ncommunity, my sense is that is well worth doing.\n  The dominant theme that I found in traveling through Pennsylvania, \nMr. President, was a dissatisfaction or a distrust of government. There \nis great cynicism in America today about what is going on in \nWashington, DC. It is my sense that unless you go out and actually talk \nto the people--and not just in shopping centers and not just casually, \nas we have our social contacts during the course of a recess period--\nthat there is not a full understanding as to how much apathy, cynicism \nand outright distrust of our Government there is. I noted the \nWashington Post, on the 29th of August, just a few days ago, had on its \nfront page a survey which noted ``three out of four say they do not \ntrust the Government or its leaders to do what is right.''\n  My own findings would confirm that, as I have been in many open house \ntown meetings during the course of the past month and throughout the \npast year. At one of my open house town meetings, one of the citizens \nwas wearing a cap that had the word ``militia'' printed on it. There \nare many people in the militia in the United States today. How many \nexactly, we do not know.\n  In my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nTerrorism, we had hearings concerning militias during the 104th \nCongress. We had Colonel Olson from the Michigan militia come in and \nspeak in very unflattering terms about the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  There have been estimates into the millions as to how many militia \nmembers there are.\n  And in one of my open house town meetings, the word ``revolution'' \nwas used in expressing very grave disagreement with what the Government \nwas doing, on this occasion the importation of sludge from New York and \nNew Jersey to fill abandoned mines in Pennsylvania. And there is great \nconcern in my State, as there is I think in this country generally, \nabout limitations on so-called second amendment rights, and great \ndistrust as to what the Government is doing.\n  During the course of the past month, Ruby Ridge was again in the news \nwith a report by the Department of Justice. The report stated that \nthere would not be any prosecutions as to the investigation which had \nbeen conducted by the Department of Justice. This investigation lasted \nalmost 2 years after it was initiated in the fall of 1995, a period of \ntime which I think is unwarranted on the facts as I know them.\n  I have had discussions with both the Attorney General and the U.S. \nattorney in charge of that investigation and will talk about that in \nsome greater detail. After the Department of Justice report was issued, \nthe prosecuting attorney in Boundary County, ID, returned an indictment \nagainst Special Agent Lon Horiuchi of the FBI on the charge of \ninvoluntary manslaughter on the killing of Mrs. Vicki Weaver which \noccurred in that confrontation back on August 21, 1992.\n  The DA for Boundary County returned the indictment of murder in the \nfirst degree against Mr. Kevin Harris for the killing of Deputy Marshal \nWilliam Degan. The incidents which we have seen in Waco and in Ruby \nRidge have fanned, I think, really great distrust for the Government, \nsomething which we are going to have to address in greater detail.\n  In my personal opinion, the Congress has not yet had appropriate \noversight hearings on Waco, notwithstanding the fact that we have done \nsomething there. I think we have made a start on Ruby Ridge when the \nsubcommittee which I chaired back in September and October of 1995, \nwith 14 days of hearings, heard from about 60 witnesses and published a \n150-page report. I intend to talk about that in greater detail on the \nfloor of the Senate when we have some time, perhaps yet this afternoon.\n  But I do want to comment about the grave concerns which I have found \nin my State about distrusting the Government and how the Ruby Ridge \nsubject came up because it was very much in the news during the weeks \nof mid-August, August 13, 14, and 15, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. \nAnd I was in western and central Pennsylvania, August 20, 21, and 22 \nwhen I was again doing open house town meetings.\n  I also found great concern in the open house town meetings I \nconducted about the way campaigns are financed. And I believe that the \nhearings we have had before the Governmental Affairs Committee during \nthe month of July have resonated more in America than many people \nbelieved. It is unfortunate, I think, that there has not been more \ntelevision coverage because that is the way the American people get \nmost of their information these days.\n  Only Fox has carried them live, the Fox cable channel. And CNN has \ncovered to a slight extent, and C-SPAN has not covered them live but \nhas replayed them. And there are many people who watch C-SPAN. \nInsomniacs are people who watch during the late hours of the night. You \ncan probably catch the Governmental Affairs hearings if you watch at \nabout 3 a.m. to see what is going on. But I found that many people have \nbeen watching them and were very concerned about what is going on.\n  My view is that we ought to have campaign finance reform. And I voted \nfor cloture last year to bring the legislation offered by Senator \nMcCain and Senator Feingold to the floor. I believe that there is a \ndifficulty with that particular piece of legislation on calling for \ntelevision stations to give free time because I think that is a taking \nof property without compensation required by the fifth amendment of the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  But I have been working on legislation, some of which has been \nmotivated by what I have seen in the Governmental Affairs hearing. I \nintend to talk about that as well, perhaps later this afternoon if \nthere are no other Senators on the floor who come to offer amendments.\n  I have also heard, Mr. President, considerable concern about what is \nhappening with Social Security and Medicare. And regrettably there has \nbeen a practice of using those issues for campaign purposes, something \ndone by both political parties. I do not suggest blame in what has been \ndone in the campaign sense. But I think we would be better advised if \nwe tailored our representations a little closer to what the facts are.\n  But these open house town meetings are populated very significantly \nby our senior citizens who have more time to come to the open house \ntown meetings. And perhaps there is greater interest among senior \ncitizens in what is going on in Government because of Social Security \nand Medicare.\n  But people are questioning whether Social Security is really secure. \nAnd\n\n[[Page S8641]]\n\nmy view is that it is. They are questioning about what is happening \nwith Medicare. And I think the American people have not understood that \nwhen we have considered changes in Medicare that we have not sought to \ncut Medicare but instead to restrain the growth of Medicare. We have \nlooked at an increase in funding for Medicare in excess of 10 percent a \nyear. We have sought to reach compromise between Democrats and \nRepublicans to restrain the growth somewhere in the 7-percent range, \ngive or take a little. And that is two or three times the rate of \ninflation. But if we are to maintain Medicare, we are going to have to \nbe able to pay for it and to contain the rate of growth on Medicare.\n  I am pleased that we have established in the recent legislation a \ncommission which will take up Medicare in some detail on a bipartisan \nbasis to try to give assurance to the public that what we are doing \nhere is sound governmentally and sound financially. It is not for \npolitical scare tactics. We had the Commission for Social Security back \nin 1983 which put Social Security on a solid basis.\n  We had then Senator Pepper as a Member of the House, a very \ndistinguished representative of senior citizens, someone the senior \ncitizens had a lot of confidence in. We had a slight increase in the \ntax on Social Security and a slight delay in receiving benefits and put \nSocial Security on a sound basis back in 1983. And it is my hope that \nwe will be able to do that again.\n  People want to know about a trust fund, why we do not have Social \nSecurity off budget. That I believe, Mr. President, is something we \nought to be doing. It is currently part of the unified budget so that \nit makes the deficit appear smaller. But it really ought to be \nsegregated in a trust fund.\n  Similar concerns were expressed about the highway trust fund. Across \nPennsylvania, and I think reflective of America, people want the moneys \nused for the gasoline tax to be used for the highway trust fund or mass \ntransit. Across my State, I hear enormous concerns about Continental 1, \na major highway, transcontinental highway, which will start in Toronto, \nCanada, and go all the way to Florida. It picks up a stretch of highway \nknown as U.S. 219 in Pennsylvania where people are very anxious to have \nthat on the books. And we would have the money, if we use the highway \ntrust fund, for that purpose.\n  We had amendments narrowly defeated in both the Senate and the House \nby 2 votes, I recollect, 216 to 214 in the House, and I know it was 51 \nto 49 here in the Senate where we attempted to allocate more funds for \nhighways. I hear concerns all over my State about the need for more \ntransportation funding. And the Mon Valley Expressway linking Fayette \nCounty, Uniontown to Pittsburgh would be a bonanza to develop that \nsection of southwestern Pennsylvania which has been hit so hard by the \nlosses of the steel industry, the coal industry, and the glass \nindustry.\n  And all over the State there is this interest in highways. I can \npersonally attest, traveling around the back roads of my State, how \ntough it is to travel, to get behind a big truck. It happens all the \ntime on a two-lane highway, and what had been planned as a 45-minute \ntrip takes an hour and 10 minutes. The infrastructure is so very, very \nvital. We ought to be taking a much closer look there.\n  There are similar concerns on airports, as I traveled through the \nState, where airports ought to be improved. Infrastructure would \nimprove job opportunities. Major corporations, companies want to settle \nin communities which have access to air service.\n  I also heard grave concern about what is going on with the managed \ncare and with HMO's and with the issue of the so-called gag rule where \nfamily doctors are not permitted to have a referral to a specialist. We \nlegislated on what was called the drive-by deliveries, requiring that \nwomen giving birth spend at least 48 hours in the hospital. Further, we \nhave pending legislation on so-called drive-by mastectomies, where \nwomen who undergo that very difficult operative procedure are not \nousted from the hospital. These complicated issues are obviously \nmatters which are better left without congressional micromanagement, \nbut something which we may have to get into, to some extent. But there \nis grave concern as managed care move across America, that there be \nfair access for the people who are insured and concern about HMO's \npaying their fair share on medical education and the so-called DSH \nproposals of disproportionate share for care for the indigent.\n  These are some of the items which I heard a great deal about as I \ntraveled through my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8640-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8641-S8643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               RUBY RIDGE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I see no other Senator on the floor \nseeking recognition, so I will amplify my remarks at this time about \nthe concerns which I have on the congressional oversight and the need \nfor additional congressional oversight on the incidents arising out of \nRuby Ridge.\n  Mr. President, the incident at Ruby Ridge has been very heavily \npublicized. And there have been a number of investigations on this \nsubject. And investigations are continuing at the present time.\n  This incident occurred back on August 21, 1992, which is more than 5 \nyears ago. With the possible exception of the incident at Waco, this \nincident at Ruby Ridge has caused tremendous consternation with respect \nto action by the Federal Government.\n  The essential events at Ruby Ridge were that a man named Randy Weaver \nhad been arrested for selling two sawed-off shotguns and had not made \nhis court appearances. A large contingent of Federal law enforcement \nofficers went to his home at Ruby Ridge in Idaho to take Mr. Randy \nWeaver into custody. It is a very complex matter, a very lengthy \nmatter. I will only summarize the essential factors. A firefight broke \nout on August 21, 1992. In the course of that firefight, a Federal \nmarshall, deputy marshall, Mr. William Degan, was killed, 14-year-old \nSammy Weaver, son of Mr. Randy Weaver and Mrs. Vicki Weaver, was \nkilled, and Mrs. Vicki Weaver was killed.\n\n  The large force which had assembled there to take Mr. Randy Weaver \ninto custody did so because of reports by the Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms agency, which were false, that there had been prior \nconvictions as to Mr. Randy Weaver--and he had not been convicted of \nanything--and that Mr. Weaver was a suspect in bank robbery cases, \nwhich is untrue.\n  The essential findings, the essential overstatements, were summarized \nby FBI Director Louis Freeh, who testified at our Judiciary \nsubcommittee hearings on October 19, 1995, as follows: ``One \nmisstatement of fact exaggerated to another one, into a huge pile of \ninformation that was just dead wrong.'' As a result of those erroneous \nstatements, this firefight occurred and these deaths occurred.\n  There have been a number of investigations conducted. Most recently, \na brief report was filed by the Department of Justice on Ruby Ridge, \nwhich is only a small part of the full report which was filed. This one \nis eight pages. It was issued back on August 15. In the course of this \nreport, there is a notation of some six prior investigations on this \nmatter. There had been an exhaustive report by the Department of \nJustice task force that was issued on June 10, 1994. There was an \ninvestigation conducted by the FBI Inspection Division. There was an \ninvestigation initiated by the Department of Justice Office of \nProfessional Responsibility, following a letter from special agent \nEugene Glenn, who was the on-scene commander in Idaho. He was an FBI \nagent in charge in Idaho. Then the Judiciary subcommittee conducted its \ninquiry, and then there was an investigation conducted by U.S. attorney \nMichael Stiles, who is the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of \nPennsylvania. He took over for the U.S. Attorney for the District of \nColumbia. Mr. Eric Holder had recused himself because he knew some of \nthe agents who were involved.\n  I had expressed my own concern on a number of occasions about the \nlength of time that the Department of Justice investigation was taking \nbecause there were a number of FBI officials who had been suspended, \nwith pay, and were simply sitting dormant. Based upon the knowledge \nthat I had of this incident, because of the hearings which we had \nthrough the Judiciary subcommittee, it seems to me that the matter \nshould have been concluded a long time ago.\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\n  Our subcommittee held 14 days of hearings from September 6 to October \n19, 1995, heard testimony from 62 witnesses, interviewed many others, \nreviewed thousands of documents, including the entire transcripts and \nexhibits from the trial of Mr. Randy Weaver and Mr. Kevin Harris and \nvarious internal reports prepared by the Department of the Treasury, \nthe Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \nBased upon that detailed knowledge of this incident, it seemed to me, \nand also based on the experience I have had as district of attorney in \nPhiladelphia in some background investigations, this is a matter that \nshould have been concluded a long time ago. I took this matter up on \nmany occasions with the Attorney General and, in fact, back on November \n25, 1996, I called for a meeting and had one in my office with Attorney \nGeneral Reno, then Deputy Attorney General Gorelick and U.S. Attorney \nMichael Stiles on November 25, 1996. I continued to discuss this on \nmany occasions to Attorney General Reno and Deputy Attorney General \nGorelick and U.S. Attorney Stiles, and as illustrative of my ongoing \nconcern, wrote to them on February 26, 1997, as follows:\n\n       Dear Attorney General Reno: I again express to you my deep \n     concern about the long delay of the Department of Justice in \n     completing the investigation of certain FBI officials arising \n     out of the incidents of Ruby Ridge. As you know, the \n     Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism completed exhaustive \n     hearings in September and October of 1995 and published a \n     voluminous 154-page report in December 1995.\n       I expressed my concern to you on the Department of Justice \n     delay months ago and met on this subject with you and Deputy \n     Attorney General Gorelick and Michael Stiles on November 25, \n     1996. I would appreciate your prompt response on when you \n     expect this investigation to be completed.\n\n  I had a response from the Attorney General that it would be completed \nsoon. I then brought it up again with her in Department of Justice \noversight hearings on April 30, 1997, and again was told that it would \nbe completed soon. Then this Department of Justice abbreviated report \nwas, as I say, submitted on August 22, but it is not the conclusion of \nthe matter because there has been a referral here to the Department of \nJustice Management Division which will propose what, if any, \ndisciplinary sanctions should be imposed on the individuals under \ninvestigation and also to the Justice Department Office of Professional \nResponsibility, which had been investigating this matter back in August \nof 1995.\n  So the matter is still ongoing and incomplete so far as the \nDepartment of Justice is concerned.\n  When I sought to have subcommittee hearings back in the summer of \n1995, that was opposed in a number of quarters, including the \nDepartment of Justice. We finally moved ahead, but because of the \nAugust recess, we scheduled for immediately after Labor Day, and then \nin late August, we proceeded with our subcommittee hearings. It is not \nan easy thing to do when there is a public statement by the Deputy \nAttorney General that Senate action will impede the ongoing \ninvestigation. That has a certain political overtone which is very \ndifficult to move against. But we did, and I think our investigation \nhas spurred more activity by the Department of Justice because it was \nour inquiry on the so-called rules of engagement which led to further \nthe Department of Justice investigation.\n  I should say, Mr. President, that it is not possible to outline all \nof the things which have happened in this matter, but in the Federal \ntrial which was completed against Mr. Randy Weaver and Mr. Kevin \nHarris, both were acquitted. One of the issues which was an outgrowth \nof that Federal trial was the activity of one of the key FBI agents to \ndestroy a record which had been ordered to be produced by the Federal \njudge. That individual is now awaiting sentencing. In October of 1996, \nSpecial Agent E. Michael Kahoe, of the FBI's Violent Crimes and Major \nOffenders Section, was charged with and later pleaded guilty to \nobstruction of justice relating to his destruction of an FBI after-\naction critique on the Ruby Ridge matter. He is scheduled for \nsentencing on September 11.\n  The FBI has had an extraordinary record for law enforcement in this \ncountry and abroad, and I think it has been a very, very important law \nenforcement agency. From time to time there are problems with the FBI, \nas there are with any agency, but it certainly is a matter of \noverwhelming concern for someone who has the responsibility of being \nthe chief of the Violent Crimes and Major Offenders Section who \ndestroys a report ordered to be produced by a Federal judge. That is \nthe case here.\n  There are other major matters which our subcommittee looked into and \nwhich have been investigated by the Department of Justice where they \nconcluded they did not have sufficient evidence to charge two other \nsenior FBI officials with criminal conduct on falsifying the so-called \nrules of engagement which were a part of the controversy at Ruby Ridge. \nThe rules of engagement provided that if any adult is observed with a \nweapon prior to surrender announcement, deadly force can and should be \nemployed if the shot can be taken without endangering any children. The \nsecond aspect: if any adult in the compound is observed with a weapon \nafter the surrender announcement is made and is not attempting to \nsurrender, deadly force can and should be employed to neutralize the \nindividual. Mr. President, those rules of engagement, simply stated, \nviolate the U.S. Constitution. That was the judgment of the Department \nof Justice task force. That was the judgment of the Judiciary \nsubcommittee, and that was the judgment of the FBI Director, Louis \nFreeh, that those rules did violate the constitutional standard for use \nof deadly force. You just cannot do that in America.\n  To the credit of FBI Director Louis Freeh, those rules of engagement \nwere changed and the procedures of the hostage rescue team were \nchanged. We have yet to see an acknowledgment by the Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms unit of their inappropriate conduct in this matter, either \nfrom the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, or the director of \nthe Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms unit, John Magaw. I know that is a \nstrong statement, but that happens to be the fact. I have met \npersonally with Mr. Rubin and Mr. Magaw, and they have not taken \nresponsibility for what the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agency did in \nthis matter, which was spread false information about Mr. Weaver with \nrespect to saying he had prior convictions, which he had not, and \nsaying he was a suspect in a bank robbery case, which he was not.\n  In any event, Mr. President, the matter goes on in the eight-page \nreport which has been filed by the Department of Justice. As the saying \ngoes, more questions are raised than are answered. I have made a \nrequest to see the entire report and am told that will not be made \navailable until the Office of Professional Responsibility finishes its \nwork, and that may occur at some point in the future, which is very, \nvery difficult to predict. At any rate, we have this eight-page report, \nand as I say, it raised a good many new questions.\n  The scope of the investigation conducted by the Department of \nJustice, headed by U.S. Attorney Stiles, has this to say under the \nsection of Scope of the Criminal Investigation:\n\n       The investigative team used a variety of techniques to \n     collect all available evidence in this matter. They gathered \n     large amounts of documented material that had never come to \n     light during prior internal inquiries into the events at Ruby \n     Ridge.\n\n  Now, the question was raised in my mind, if these documents had not \ncome to light on prior internal inquiries into the events at Ruby \nRidge, why not? The question is raised in my mind as to whether the FBI \nmade available to the Senate Judiciary subcommittee all of the \ndocuments which we had requested. This report goes on to say, ``The FBI \noffices were searched, and more than half a million pages of documents \nwere obtained and analyzed, including previously unreviewed files \ncontaining the bulk of the FBI headquarters' records, including files \nof the FBI's Strategic Information and Operations Section and the \nViolent Crimes and Major Offenders Section.''\n  So a question is raised immediately as to whether the Department of \nJustice task force which worked back in 1994 and whether the FBI \nInspections Division and whether the prior investigation by the Office \nof Professional Responsibility and whether the Senate hearings which \ncalled for all of these documents, whether those documents were \nproduced at that time.\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\n  This is just a brief thumbnail description as to some of the \nquestions that we have and that are pending yet. My sense is that it is \nindispensable that the Judiciary Committee move ahead with the inquiry \nthat was conducted back in 1995 to find out specifically why it took \nthe Department of Justice approximately 2 years to come to this stage \nof their inquiry and take a look at the findings that led to a \ndeclination of prosecution as to some individuals in the face of what \nappears to be significant evidence on a falsification of the rules of \nengagement.\n  We do know that at the hearings conducted in 1995, there was another \nset of rules of engagement which discussed a permissive use of force, \nspecifically noting where deadly force may be used. During the course \nof our subcommittee hearings, we could never determine precisely who \nissued the rules of engagement because no one would take responsibility \nfor them. But the way this investigation has been conducted by the \nDepartment of Justice, certainly in my judgment, urgently requires \ncongressional oversight. We know that the prosecuting attorney of \nBoundary County has now issued an indictment against a special agent \nsharpshooter, whose firing resulted in the death of Mrs. Vicki Weaver, \non charges of involuntary manslaughter.\n  Had I been the prosecuting attorney there, I would not have brought \nthat prosecution, under all the facts of the case. I have been a \ndistrict attorney and have made judgments that involve when a \nprosecution ought to be brought. But I can understand why the district \nattorney of Boundary County brought the charges in light of the bad \nbungling that the Department of Justice has made of this case. And \nthere are many, many collateral matters that have not yet been answered \nsatisfactorily. The Attorney General approved the promotion of Mr. \nPotts to be Deputy Director of the FBI, in a context where red flags \nwere present about Mr. Potts' qualifications for that job, being a very \nclose personal friend of FBI Director Freeh. That was inquired into at \nsome length during the Judiciary subcommittee hearings, but we did not \nhave the benefit of the Attorney General's testimony in that matter. \nShe took the position that she does not testify before subcommittees \nbecause there are so many subcommittees. The point the subcommittee \nraised at that time was that we were not asking her opinion on a \nvariety of legislative issues where there are so many issues and \nsubcommittees, but we asked for her testimony as a fact witness as to \nwhy she personally approved the promotion of Mr. Potts. But she \ndeclined to appear. We declined to issue a subpoena or have a \nconfrontation on the issue.\n  When I discussed this personally with the Attorney General, she \nrestated her position and said maybe she should have appeared. I told \nher at that time, months ago, she might have occasion to appear yet. I \nhope that she does have occasion to appear on the questions relating to \nmany issues in this very complex matter, because as stated in the \nstatement issued by U.S. Attorney Stiles, this was approved by the \nDepartment of Justice and, inferentially, by the Attorney General \nherself. These are matters that have to be inquired into.\n  On the subject of having this matter now taken to the Office of \nProfessional Responsibility, I have grave questions about what will \nhappen there and what the time sequence will be, and their explanation \nas to why they took so long is there are many statutory requirements \nthat may be reviewed by the Congress. The incident involving William \nJewel in Atlanta occurred back in July 1996, and it took a full year to \nget oversight hearings before the subcommittee on that matter. Those \nhearings did not do any credit to the Office of Professional \nResponsibility, where Mr. Shaheen, the director of that unit, \ntestified. Mr. Shaheen testified that Mr. Jewel's constitutional rights \nwere violated, but it was nowhere in the report. I asked the very \nfundamental question, ``Why doesn't the report say so?'' It is one \nthing to testify before a subcommittee that the constitutional rights \nof a suspect were violated. But to fail to do so in the report does not \ngive guidance to other agents in the field. It was in the context that \nMr. Jewel was told he was being questioned for a training film purpose, \nand he was misled by the FBI agents under those circumstances. It was \nlater concluded that his Miranda rights had been violated. In a \nrepeated line of questioning, Mr. Shaheen could not cite any part of \nthe report that said that. He cited sections of the report that did not \nsay what he said he said, and he admitted that. Then, after the hearing \nwas over, on the same day, Mr. Shaheen sent me a two-page letter saying \nthat he had misspoken, that the Office of Professional Responsibility \nhad not in fact found that Mr. Jewel's constitutional rights had been \nviolated--a conclusion which is a little hard to understand in light of \nhis extensive testimony on this subject.\n  Madam President, this is a very important matter. As I have said \nearlier, it is a matter which is still resonating in America. I was in \nPennsylvania, at my open house town meetings on the 13th, 14th and \n15th, when the report came out that the Department of Justice would not \nbring any prosecutions and a week later when the prosecuting attorney \nof Boundary County, ID, brought the indictments against Kevin Harris \nfor murder in the first degree against Deputy Marshal William Degan and \ninvoluntary manslaughter against Special Agent Horiuchi. It is my hope \nthat we will continue this inquiry with congressional oversight, \nbecause only the Congress can really undertake the kind of questioning \nof department heads, the Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, or \nthe Director of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, or the Secretary of \nTreasury, of that rank, to find out what has happened, so that we can \ntell the American people what the facts are. There is tremendous unrest \non this subject, which is part of the unrest and distrust of Government \nthat I have referred to earlier, confirmed by the earlier public \nopinion poll.\n  Madam President, in the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8641-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Madam President, in the absence of any other Senator on \nthe floor, I will utilize this time to comment on the subject of \ncampaign finance reform. I stated earlier that in my travels through \nPennsylvania during part of the month of August, I heard considerable \nconcern about the necessity for campaign finance reform, and I had \ncommented about the overtone throughout my open house town meetings \nabout people of my State being very suspicious of Government, very \ndistrustful of Government. One of those items was Ruby Ridge, and I \nspoke at some length about that. Another item was the subject of \ncampaign finance reform, where I have found very considerable interest, \ndisagreeing with some of the pundits and some of the public comments.\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\n  It is my hope, Madam President, that the hearings before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, on which you and I sit, will stimulate \nan interest in campaign finance reform. I have said with some frequency \nin the past that I do not believe we will have campaign finance reform \nuntil the American people demand it. It is contrary to the interests of \nincumbents to have campaign finance reform. This is a matter of \nconsiderable disagreement within this body, and I respect the views of \nour colleagues who have disagreed. But I do believe that we are awash \nin money. After 6 months of investigation and after 4 weeks of hearings \nby our Governmental Affairs Committee during the month of July, it \nconfirms my conclusion and the view of most Americans that campaign \nfinance reform is necessary.\n  Politics is awash in money, corrupting some, appearing to corrupt \nothers, and making almost everybody in or out of the system uneasy \nabout the way political campaigns are financed. I compliment our \ncolleagues, John McCain and Russ Feingold, for providing leadership on \ncampaign finance reform in Senate bill 25. I believe that the key \nprovision there, which would give candidates free television \nadvertising time, does not measure up to the constitutional standard of \nthe fifth amendment on taking property without due process of law. I \nrecognize the contention that the airwaves belong to the American \npeople. But in the context where television stations and networks have \noperated, I do not see how you can square, constitutionally, the taking \nof that property without compensation.\n  I voted last year for cloture, to bring the issue to the floor so we \ncan debate it, consider it, and it would be my hope that it would be \nbrought to the floor in the month of September. I am aware of the \npublic statements made by Senator McCain and others that it may be \nbrought and attached to other bills. So we will wait to see if that \ndoes occur.\n  My intention is to offer my own bill on campaign finance. I am in the \nfinal stages of the drafting of the bill and the floor statement. It \nwould target some of the specific abuses and would expand upon what any \nother legislation has done in terms of what we have found from our \nGovernmental Affairs investigation.\n  My own sense is that the evidence is conclusive that soft money ought \nto be eliminated. When you take a look at the millions of dollars which \nhave been poured into the American electoral system, including \ncorporate contributions on soft money, it has just totally distorted \nthe Presidential campaigns--and also congressional campaigns--as that \nmoney moves in and out in a variety of contours. But we have public \nfinancing of Presidential elections. That public financing has been \nundertaken on the basis that there will not be private financing. But \nsomehow soft money is not deemed to be a contribution, so says the \nDepartment of Justice of the United States in an inexplicable \ninterpretation--inexplicable, in my opinion. And then according to the \nreports of both Dick Morris and former chief of staff Leon Panetta, the \nPresident of the United States edited and wrote Democratic National \nCommittee campaign commercials. That, obviously, is coordination.\n  There is a constitutional rule that an independent expenditure, \nconstitutionally may not be limited by a statute. But here you have the \nPresident taking money from the Democratic National Committee that was \nraised as soft. And, when I talk about the President, the same thing is \ndone on the Republican side. So that I think there is bipartisan blame \nhere.\n  The specific evidence has been forwarded as to what President \nClinton's personal involvement was. And there are these commercials. \nThey extol the virtues of one candidate, and they criticize the other \ncandidate. And for some reason they are not classified as being \nadvocacy commercials but only issue commercials.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include illustrations of these commercials \non a letter that I wrote to Attorney General Reno dated May 1, 1997, \nher response, and also the response of the Federal Election Commission \non this subject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     U.S., Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1997.\n     Hon.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I have received your letter of May 1, \n     1997, asking that I offer you my legal opinion as to whether \n     the text of certain television commercials constitutes \n     ``express advocacy'' within the meaning of regulations of the \n     Federal Election Commission (``FEC''). For the reasons set \n     forth below, I have referred your request to the FEC for its \n     consideration and response.\n       Under the Federal Election Campaign Act, the FEC has \n     statutory authority to ``administer, seek to obtain \n     compliance with, and formulate policy with respect to'' FECA, \n     and exclusive jurisdiction with respect to civil enforcement \n     to FECA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437c(b)(1); see 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437d(e) \n     (FEC civil action is ``exclusive civil remedy'' for enforcing \n     FECA). The FEC has the power to issue rules and advisory \n     opinions interpreting the provisions of FECA. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 437f, 438. The FEC may penalize violations of FECA \n     administratively or through bringing civil actions. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 437g. In short, ``Congress has vested the Commission \n     with `primary and substantial responsibility for \n     administering and enforcing the Act.''' FEC v. Democratic \n     Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U.S. 27, 37 (1981), quoting \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 109 (1976).\n       The legal opinion that you seek is one that is particularly \n     within the competence of the FEC, and not one which has \n     historically been made by the Department of Justice. \n     Determining whether these advertisements constitute ``express \n     advocacy'' under the FEC's rules will require consideration \n     not only of\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\n     their content but also of the timing and circumstances under \n     which they were distributed. The FEC has considerably more \n     experience than the Department in making such evaluations. \n     Moreover, your request involves interpretation of a rule \n     promulgated by the FEC itself. Indeed, it is the standard \n     practice of the Department to defer to the FEC in \n     interpreting its regulations.\n       There is particular reason to defer to the expertise of the \n     FEC in this matter, because the issue is not as clear-cut as \n     you suggest. In FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign \n     Comm., 839 F. Supp. 1448 (D. Colo. 1993), rev'd on other \n     grounds, 59 F.3d 1015 (10th Cir. 1995), vacated, 116 S.Ct. \n     2309 (1996), the United States District Court held that the \n     following advertisement, run in Colorado by the state \n     Republican Federal Campaign Committee, did not constitute \n     ``express advocacy'':\n       ``Here in Colorado we're used to politicians who let you \n     know where they stand, and I thought we could count on Tim \n     Wirth to do the same. But the last few weeks have been a real \n     eye-opener. I just saw some ads where Tim Wirth said he's for \n     a strong defense and a balanced budget. But according to his \n     record, Tim Wirth voted against every new weapon system in \n     the last five years. And he voted against the balanced budget \n     amendment.\n       ``Tim Wirth has a right to run for the Senate, but he \n     doesn't have a right to change the facts.''\n       839 F. Supp. at 1451, 1455-56. The court held that the \n     ``express advocacy'' test requires that an advertisement ``in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a \n     candidate.'' Id. at 1456. The Court of Appeals reversed the \n     District Court on other grounds, holding that ``express \n     advocacy'' was not the appropriate test, and the Supreme \n     Court did not reach the issue.\n       Furthermore, a pending matter before the Supreme Court may \n     assist in the legal resolution of some of these issues; the \n     Solicitor General has recently filed a petition for \n     certiorari on behalf of the FEC in the case of Federal \n     Election Commission v. Maine Right to Life Committee, Inc., \n     No. 96-1818, filed May 15, 1997. I have enclosed a copy of \n     the petition for your information. It discusses at some \n     length the current state of the law with respect to the \n     definition and application of the ``express advocacy'' \n     standard in the course of petitioning the Court to review the \n     restrictive definition of the standard adopted by the lower \n     courts in that case.\n       It appears, therefore, that the proper legal status of \n     these advertisements under the regulations issued by the FEC \n     is a question that is most appropriate for initial review by \n     the FEC.\n       Accordingly, I have referred your letter to the FEC for its \n     consideration. Thank you for your inquiry on this important \n     matter, and do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any \n     further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Janet Reno.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                            Criminal Division,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1997.\n     Hon. John Warren McGarry,\n     Chairman, Federal Election Commission,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Enclosed for the attention and whatever \n     further reply the Federal Election Commission (FEC) finds to \n     be appropriate is a copy of an exchange of correspondence \n     between the Attorney General and Senator Arlen Specter of \n     Pennsylvania concerning the application of the Commission's \n     rules governing issue advocacy by political parties to a \n     specific advertisement. The Department of Justice regards the \n     subject matter of this inquiry as properly within the primary \n     jurisdiction of the FEC.\n       If we can assist the Commission in any way in this matter, \n     please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mark M. Richard,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, that subject came up in Judiciary \nCommittee oversight with the Attorney General testifying the day \nbefore, on April 30, where the commercials extol one candidate, \ncriticize another, and, yet, are not considered to be advocacy \ncommercials.\n  The first point of the legislation which I am preparing would end \nsoft money.\n  The second point would define express advocacy to enforce the intent \nof the Federal election laws to prevent coordinated campaigns and to \nsay where a commercial praises a named candidate or criticizes a named \ncandidate, that that does constitute express advocacy.\n  The third provision on legislation that I am preparing would require \naffidavits on so-called independent expenditures. In Buckley versus \nValeo, the Supreme Court of the United States said that as a matter of \nconstitutional law Congress could not limit what an individual wanted \nto spend on the campaign--for example, Senator X or Presidential \ncandidate Y--if they were truly independent. But the reality of many of \nthese independent expenditures, if not most, is that they are not \nindependent at all.\n  After surveying the scene and thinking about it, my legislation would \nrequire an affidavit to be taken by the individual who is making the \nindependent expenditure, or the head of the committee making \nindependent expenditure, that the expenditure is truly independent. If \nsomeone sits down and reads an affidavit, takes an oath and understands \nthat person is subject to the penalties of perjury, there may be a \nlittle more credibility or more attention paid to what is said. If you \ngo to jail for 5 years, that may make someone pause on a representation \nthat an expenditure is independent.\n  Then my legislation would provide 48 hours after that affidavit is \nfiled, the individual making the independent expenditure would have 24 \nhours to file the affidavit, and then within 48 hours file the \naffidavit with the Federal Election Commission. And then within 48 \nhours the Federal Election Commission would give that affidavit to the \ncampaign on whose behalf the expenditure was made. And then the \ncandidate and the campaign treasury would have to take an affidavit \nthat the expenditure in question is truly independent. If people are \nprepared to take affidavits, both the person making the expenditure and \nthe person committing on whose behalf the expenditure is made, we might \nsee some independent expenditures which are truly independent.\n  The fourth provision in the bill, which I intend to offer and \nhopefully becomes statute, would eliminate foreign transactions which \nfunnel money into the U.S. campaigns. This would be along the line of--\nwe heard the testimony as to what happened in the famous transaction \nwhere the former Republican National Chairman, Mr. Haley Barbour, \ntestified. There, if you collapse the transaction, money did come from \na foreign source into the Republican National Committee. I think that \nMr. Barbour got bad advice as to what was going on there, and details \nof that evidence show that when advice of counsel was obtained that the \ntransaction was lawful. It was on the condition that the money not go \nto a political committee. But, in fact, that is what happened. The \nattorney who received that letter, saying that the legitimacy of the \ntransaction would depend upon the money not going to a political \ncommittee, testified at our Governmental Affairs Committee that he \ndidn't notice that provision, even though a letter was to him, or read \nthat provision. The letter was, in fact, going to someone else. So \nthat, if we tighten up on that provision so that the transaction is \nviewed as a whole, those kinds of foreign contributions would be \neliminated.\n  A fifth provision of the legislation which I will propose would seek \nto deter massive spending of personal wealth which adopts a new standby \nfinancing framework similar to the one recently enacted in Maine, the \nState represented by our distinguished Presiding Officer at the moment.\n  Buckley versus Valeo provides as a constitutional matter that an \nindividual may spend as much of his or her money as he or she chooses. \nFor many years, Senator Hollings and I have sought to have a \nconstitutional amendment. That split decision by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, in my opinion, does not accurately state what is \nmeant by ``freedom of speech.'' Freedom of speech does not give, in my \njudgment, the right of an individual to spend as much of his or her \nmoney as he or she may choose when the Supreme Court acknowledges at \nthe same time that any other individual may be limited by what that \nindividual may give to a Senator's campaign--$1,000 in the primary, or \n$1,000 in a general election.\n  I personally was running against Senator Heinz for the U.S. Senate \nseat in 1976 on a campaign which started with a limitation as to how \nmuch money an individual could spend. For a State the size of \nPennsylvania it was $35,000, which was close to my amassed wealth. I \nwas prepared to spend it. In the middle of that campaign, on the end of \nJanuary 1976, the Supreme Court of the United States said that an \nindividual could spend as much of his or her money as he or she chose \nbut that my brother, Morton Specter, who could have financed my \ncampaign rather generously had he chosen to do so, and I think was \nprepared to do so, was limited to $1,000. Where were Morton Specter's \nconstitutional rights for freedom\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\nof speech contrasted with the rights of a candidate? But that is the \nconstitutional law.\n  But Maine has a very interesting way of handling excessive spending \nby providing matching funds to candidates when an opponent exceeds \ncertain spending limits. I personally oppose public financing of \nFederal elections. But I think in a situation where a wealthy \nindividual knew that a multimillion-dollar expenditure would be matched \nby the State, it would be a deterrence, and, in fact, the State would \nnot have to put up that money. I think that provision is well worth \nconsidering.\n  The final provision of the statute which I have in mind would subject \ncontributions for legal defense funds to be reported. And our \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has heard incredible testimony about \nmoneys brought in by Mr. Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie, something in the \nneighborhood of $639,000. He brought it in to the trustees of the \nPresident's legal campaign fund. Those moneys were not subject to any \nreporting requirements. And an article, which appeared in yesterday's \nPhiladelphia Inquirer, points out how these suspect funds were known, \nand that reporting was delayed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this article be printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Philadelphia, Inquirer, Sept. 1, 1997]\n\n           Clinton and Wife Reportedly Knew of Suspect Funds\n\n\n Questionable donations to the Clinton defense fund were hidden until \n                    after the election, a paper says\n\n       Los Angeles.--Trustees of President Clinton's legal defense \n     fund acted with the knowledge of the President and Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton in hiding $639,000 in contributions funneled \n     through Democratic fund-raiser Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie, the \n     Los Angeles Times reported yesterday.\n       The trustees of the Presidential Legal Expense Trust in \n     June 1996 used accounting measures that would allow them to \n     refund the money from a Taiwan-based religious sect Suma \n     Ching Hai, without reporting the transactions until after the \n     November election, the newspaper reported.\n       A month earlier, the Times said, the trustees met to \n     discuss the contributions with six administration officials \n     including presidential aides Bruce Lindsey and Harold Ickes \n     and White House attorneys.\n       The Clintons were informed last spring about the delivery \n     of Trie's checks, as well as the decision not to inform the \n     public, the Times reported.\n       The trust--which was established in 1994 to raise money for \n     the Clinton's legal bills from Whitewater investigations and \n     a sexual harassment suit brought by Paula Corbin Jones--is \n     supported to operate independent of political influence.\n       When the donations and refunds were revealed in December, \n     the defense funds and the White House said trustees needed \n     nine months to scrutinize the contributions.\n       However, confidential congressional records, defense-fund \n     papers and meeting notes show an effort by the White House to \n     deal with the issue months earlier, the Times reported.\n       White House special counsel Lanny Davis said there was no \n     attempt to withhold information about Trie's activities. And \n     the executive director of the trust, Michael Cardozo, said \n     its decisions were never influence by the White House or \n     steered by political motivations.\n       Although the private trust is not subject to federal laws \n     governing political contributions, the Clintons imposed their \n     own rules, Individuals were limited to contributing $1,000 a \n     year, and foreigners, corporations, labor unions, political \n     organizations, lobbyists, and federal employees were \n     prohibited from making donations.\n       Between March and May of last year, Trie made three trips \n     to the trust to deliver a total of $789,000 mostly in $1,000 \n     and $500 checks and money orders. Some money was rejected \n     after some of the money orders were found to be in sequential \n     order and written in the same handwriting, the Times said, \n     and many contributors who appeared to be of Asian descent \n     shared the same surname.\n       In May, a trust official told White House aides that the \n     Trie-related donors appeared to belong to Suma Ching Hai.\n       Officials at the meeting were concerned about media \n     coverage of the origin of the donations, the Times reported. \n     Still, Davis insisted ``there was no discussion about whether \n     to disclose return of the checks or the effect of disclosure \n     on the election.''\n       Trustees decided to return the money in June, settling on \n     two steps to keep the donations out of the public eye.\n       First, the trust eliminated the line ``Less Ineligible \n     Contributions'' on the fund's public disclosure form released \n     last August. Notes taken by Ickes show a reference to ``Less \n     ineligibles,'' indicating the accounting procedure may have \n     been discussed as early as April 4.\n       Second, if any sect members wanted to re-donate to the \n     legal fund, their names would not be disclosed until the next \n     reporting period---in early 1997, the Times reported.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  That, in a fairly abbreviated statement, Madam President, is the \nsubstance of legislation which I propose to offer.\n  It is my hope that the hearings of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nwill bring substantial public interest to this subject. I know that the \nPresiding Officer has cosponsored the McCain legislation, is very much \nin favor of campaign finance reform, and perhaps, if our hearings \ngenerate enough public interest, that kind of public demand will be \ncreated.\n  It is worth noting that at an early stage in the Watergate hearings \npeople were disinterested in campaign finance reform at that time. But \nas those hearings progressed more public interest was stimulated, and \ncampaign finance reform was enacted in 1974. But I believe that this is \nvery, very important if we are to bring back public confidence with \nwhat is done in Washington, DC.\n  Madam President, in the absence of anyone on the floor seeking \nrecognition, I again suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I at this point ask if the pending business \nwould permit me to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendments are in order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1056\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for Federal Pell Grants, with an offset \n  from fiscal year 1998 funding for low-income home energy assistance)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I have sent an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1056.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 41, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 104-208, to be available for obligation in the period \n     October 1, 1997 through September 30, 1998, $527,666,000 are \n     rescinded.\n       On page 56, line 21, strike ``$8,557,741,000'' and insert \n     ``$9,085,407,000''.\n       On page 56, line 22, before the period insert ``: Provided, \n     That $7,438,000,000 shall be available to carry out subpart 1 \n     of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1070a)''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me simply indicate generally what this \namendment does.\n  This amendment will provide an additional $528 million for the Pell \nGrant Program, boosting that level to the amount recommended by the \nAppropriations Committee. And that money will come from the LIHEAP \nprogram. It would be a direct offset. So that the $528 million would \ncome from LIHEAP and would go to fund Pell grants.\n  Madam President, this amendment is very simple. It will provide an \nadditional $528 million for the Pell Grant Program, boosting the amount \nin the bill to the level recommended by the House of Representatives. \nPell grant funding would go from $6.910 billion to $7.438 billion. The \noffset is from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP].\n  The additional Pell grant funding is intended to finance changes in \neligibility--that is, to correct problems that have arisen as a result \nof the current law phaseout of certain independent students at income \nlevels that are\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\nlower than those for dependent students. Like the House bill, the \nfunding is contingent upon the authorizing committees acting on the \nproposal. I am not attempting an end run around the normal committee \nprocess, just attempting to ensure that the funds will be available \nshould the Education Committee concur in the change.\n  The Clinton administration originally estimated the cost of the \nproposal at $725 million in fiscal year 1998, but it is my \nunderstanding that administration officials are now satisfied with the \nHouse numbers. In any event, I believe we ought to put as high a \npriority on Pell grants as the House did in its version of the Labor-\nHHS bill.\n  Madam President, it was the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 that \nestablished a separate allowance for independent students without \ndependents. The income protection allowance, which is a fixed amount of \na family's income that is excluded from need determination, is based on \nthe family's household size and the number in the household attending \ncollege. The problem is that the separate allowance established by the \n1992 act creates a substantial disparity among groups of students.\n  For example, when compared with other students with the same number \nof family members in the household and one member in college, the \nallowance for 1997-1998 is $5,750 less in the case of married students \nwithout dependents. It is $5,940 less in the case of single students \nwithout dependents, according to the Department of Education. And \nbecause the income protection allowance for independent students \nwithout dependents is not indexed for inflation, the gap can only be \nexpected to widen each year.\n  The proposed change in eligibility, which the funding in my amendment \nis intended to finance, would bring the proportion of students in this \ngroup who would be eligible for Pell grants closer to the proportion \nthat existed prior to the establishment of the separate allowance in \nthe 1992 act. Students in this group are typically older students with \nannual family incomes of between $10,000 and $20,000.\n  Madam President, here is a State-by-State breakdown of the number of \nstudents who lost eligibility under the separate allowance. The \nnumbers, which were supplied by the Education Department, compare the \nperiod 1992-1993 before the 1992 reauthorization with the period 1993-\n1994 after reauthorization:\n\nAlabama...........................................................4,399\nAlaska..............................................................548\nArizona...........................................................6,417\nArkansas..........................................................2,525\nCalifornia.......................................................24,314\nColorado..........................................................5,204\nConnecticut.......................................................2,645\nDelaware............................................................472\nDistrict of Columbia................................................426\nFlorida..........................................................17,792\nGeorgia...........................................................5,196\nHawaii..............................................................561\nIdaho.............................................................1,402\nIllinois.........................................................10,848\nIndiana...........................................................5,467\nIowa..............................................................4,247\nKansas............................................................4,434\nKentucky..........................................................3,754\nLouisiana.........................................................5,765\nMaine.............................................................1,364\nMaryland..........................................................4,047\nMassachusetts.....................................................5,778\nMichigan.........................................................15,254\nMinnesota.........................................................7,432\nMississippi.......................................................2,751\nMissouri..........................................................7,963\nMontana...........................................................1,561\nNebraska..........................................................2,792\nNevada............................................................1,891\nNew Hampshire.....................................................1,098\nNew Jersey........................................................5,920\nNew Mexico........................................................2,002\nNew York.........................................................19,477\nNorth Carolina....................................................4,231\nNorth Dakota......................................................1,335\nOhio.............................................................12,864\nOklahoma..........................................................4,621\nOregon............................................................4,031\nPennsylvania......................................................9,535\nRhode Island......................................................1,314\nSouth Carolina....................................................2,087\nSouth Dakota......................................................1,324\nTennessee.........................................................4,972\nTexas............................................................15,126\nUtah..............................................................4,074\nVermont.............................................................353\nVirginia..........................................................5,168\nWashington........................................................5,636\nWest Virginia.....................................................1,011\nWisconsin.........................................................6,258\nWyoming.............................................................730\nPuerto Rico, other................................................3,347\n\n  The figures I just cited will give Senators a rough idea of the \nnumber of additional students that would benefit from the added funding \nin my amendment.\n  Madam President, Professor David Breneman, the dean of the Curry \nSchool of Education at the University of Virginia, testified before the \nSenate Finance Committee back in April about the effectiveness of \nvarious forms of Federal aid. He concluded that ``the Pell Grant \nprogram has the merit of targeting aid to students who would be unable \nto attend college without the grant.'' In other words, Pell grants are \nprobably the most efficient and effective way of targeting Federal aid \nto those students who need it most. And unlike other forms of \nassistance, which might reach those who have the means and \ndetermination to attend college with or without the Government's help, \nit does less to fuel tuition inflation.\n  Now I know the offset for the additional Pell grant funding will be \ncontroversial for some. It would come from the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program [LIHEAP], a program that was set up nearly 16 years \nago to temporarily--temporarily--supplement existing cash assistance \nprograms and help low-income individuals pay for home fuel costs that \nwere escalating at the time.\n  But the world is a very different place than it was in 1981. Gone are \nthe long lines at the gas pumps and skyrocketing energy prices. As we \nprepare to cross a bridge to the 21st century, we should look beyond \nprograms designed to cope with an energy crisis of 20 years ago--a \ncrisis that has come and gone--and focus instead on how to prepare \nyoung people for the high technology, more competitive economy of the \nfuture.\n  Madam President, fuel costs have not only stabilized since 1981, they \nhave declined significantly in real terms. Figures provided to me by \none of Arizona's majority utilities, Arizona Public Service, indicate \nthat average residential rates for electricity have declined 15 percent \nin real terms since 1980. And that does not take into account a 1.2-\npercent rate decrease that just became effective on July 1.\n  It is no secret that I have been skeptical of the continued need for \nLIHEAP. I have offered amendments on the subject several times in \nrecent years. But I would point out that in its fiscal year 1995 budget \nsubmission, the Clinton administration, too, recommended substantial \nreductions in the program.\n  As noted in the President's fiscal year 95 budget,\n\n        * * * fuel prices have decreased by 40 percent in real \n     terms; the cost of electricity has dropped by about 13 \n     percent in real terms; and the percent of income spent for \n     home heating for households at or below 150 percent of \n     poverty guidelines has dropped by about one-third.\n\nHe went on to propose a 50-percent reduction in funding for the program \nthat year.\n  Last year, President Clinton proposed outyear cuts in LIHEAP--a $90 \nmillion reduction in 1999, and a $181 million reduction in 2000. The \nOffice of Management and Budget advised my office that the declining \nfigures were due to standard percentage reductions applied to programs \nthat were not considered a top priority.\n  Last December, it was widely reported that the Clinton administration \nwould recommend a 25-percent reduction in the program this year. So \nthere has been skepticism about the continuing need for the program, \neven at the White House.\n  Madam President, the States themselves have already shown remarkable \nability to meet the energy needs of those requiring assistance, \nrefusing to allow public utilities to shut off power to delinquent \ncustomers and setting up payment plans and other options. It seems to \nme that, given the States' track records and the stable or declining \nprice of energy, this is a good time to begin cutting back on LIHEAP \nspending so that we can target the resources to other pressing needs.\n  In closing, the bipartisan budget agreement that we passed in July \nwas intended to extend new opportunities in education to middle- and \nupper middle-income families, and it will through a variety of new tax \ncredits. But we have the chance today to target additional Pell grant \nassistance to more lower- and middle-income people, so that all \nAmerican families have the same opportunity to secure a brighter \nfuture. I hope my colleagues will join\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\nme in supporting this amendment to put more money into the Pell Grant \nProgram.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, when the time comes to discuss the \nmatter, there will be very vigorous objection from the managers, both \nSenator Harkin and myself, on this amendment. We think that low-income \nenergy assistance is very, very important. But we will await the event \nafter our distinguished colleague from Arizona has had a chance to make \nhis presentation.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, Madam \nPresident, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak in morning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I noted in a news report recently \nsomething which I have heard previously. The news reported that \nPresident Clinton and his administration will in just a matter of days \nfrom now, on September 10, send a legislative proposal to give \nPresident Clinton and this administration something called fast track \ntrade authority.\n  Now, that might sound like a foreign language to a lot of folks, but \nthe notion of fast track trade authority is relatively simple. It is \nthat trade negotiators shall negotiate trade agreements between the \nUnited States and other countries, then bring these trade agreements to \nthe Congress, and they shall be considered in Congress under something \ncalled fast track procedures. That means no one here in the Congress is \nallowed to or will be able to offer amendments to alter that proposed \ntrade agreement.\n  That is what fast track means. It is a special deal for a trade \nagreement brought back to Congress so that all Members of Congress are \nprevented from offering amendments. Members of Congress will be allowed \nonly to vote yes or no on the entire agreement.\n  The Constitution of the United States in article I, section 8 says, \n``The Congress shall have the power to regulate Commerce with foreign \nNations.''\n  Yet, in recent decades we have developed this notion of fast track \ntrade authority that has given both Republican and Democrat Presidents \nthe opportunity to bring trade agreements to the Congress under a \nprocedure that handcuffs Members of Congress and prevents them from \noffering any amendments at any time.\n  I want to share why I think this is important and why I believe it is \ninappropriate to grant fast track trade authority to this \nadministration. I should say that when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, I led an effort in the Chamber of the House to prevent \nfast track trade authority being given to a previous administration as \nwell.\n  The Washington Post, in an article written by Ann Devroy, titled \n``Battle Lines Forming Over Clinton's Bid for Fast Track Trade \nPowers,'' states the Business Roundtable, among others, will work to \nhelp President Clinton get these fast track procedures in place by \ngetting Congress to pass a proposal to give the President fast track \npowers. ``The job won't be easy,'' it says.\n  It reports that the Business Roundtable has written in a letter to \nits members, ``The political climate for new trade agreements is not \ngood. Organized labor, human rights groups, protectionists, \nisolationists and environmentalists are questioning the benefits of \ntrade.''\n  Now, I guess I don't fit any of these descriptions. I am not an \nisolationist. I am not a member of organized labor. I am not a member \nof a human rights group. I am not a protectionist. I am not a member of \nsome environmental organization. I am not some xenophobe, and I am not \nsomeone from a small town who cannot see over the horizon. I studied a \nlittle economics. I even taught a little economics in college. I \nunderstand something about the trade issue.\n  I understand that in international trade this country is not moving \nforward; it is falling back. We are not winning; we are losing. We \nought not proceed to develop new trade agreements until we solve the \nproblems of the old trade agreements. And I want to recite a few of \nthose problems.\n  This was an interesting article written by a journalist who is a very \ngood journalist. But nowhere in this article in talking about trade \nauthority--and this is the difficulty we have in this Chamber--does it \npoint out that we will have the largest merchandise trade deficit in \nthe history of this country. Nowhere does it point that out. How can \nyou have a discussion of trade and fail to mention in the context of \nthat discussion that we now suffer the largest trade deficit in the \nhistory of our country?\n  I don't understand that. This is not theory. It is not some academic \ndiscussion. It is a discussion about whether we are going to proceed to \ngive this administration the ability to have fast track authority for a \nnew trade agreement they or trade agreements they will negotiate, and \nbring them to Congress and tie our hands so that no amendments may be \noffered.\n  Some do not mind, I suppose, that we have the largest merchandise \ntrade deficit in history. They say trade is trade. In fact, this \narticle quotes the Business Roundtable as saying, ``Those who oppose \nthis question the benefit of trade.''\n  What a lot of nonsense that is. I don't question the benefit of \ntrade. In fact, much of what we produce in my State, an agricultural \nState, must find a foreign home. I understand the benefits of trade. I \nalso understand the benefits of trade that is fair and the benefits of \ntrade relationships with other countries that are fair trade \nrelationships. I also understand about being taken advantage of. I also \nunderstand about trade policies that have been more foreign policy than \ntrade policy over the last half century.\n  For the first 25 years following the Second World War, our trade \npolicy was foreign policy. It had very little to do with trade. The \nfact was that this country was bigger, better, stronger and could \nouttrade and outproduce almost any other country in the world with one \nhand tied behind its back. So we could afford to exercise a foreign \npolicy disguised as trade policy with dozens of our trading allies and \nstill prevail. And it was just fine, at least in the first 25 years \nfollowing the Second World War.\n  During those first 25 years, incomes in this country continued to \nrise. However, in the second 25 years, we ran into some very shrewd, \ntough international competitors and it has not been as easy for us to \ncompete unless the trade rules are fair. Unfortunately, the trade rules \nhave not been fair because we have continued to negotiate trade \nagreements that are more foreign policy than trade policy. As a result \nwe have trade agreements that are fundamentally unfair to American \nworkers and American producers. I want to go through a few of these in \nthis discussion.\n  The first chart that I want to show is a chart about the merchandise \ntrade deficit in our country. Nobody seems to care much about it here \nin the Congress. You don't hear people talking about it. There is \nalways this angst about the budget deficit, and we have worked on that \nand finally have our fiscal house in some order. But there is no \ndiscussion at all about the other deficit, the merchandise trade \ndeficit, which is a sea of red ink and growing every single year. In \nfact, we had the largest merchandise trade deficit in American history \nlast year, and we are most likely going to exceed that this year. We \nhave had deficit after deficit after deficit. There have been 21 \nstraight years of merchandise trade deficits.\n  Let me just describe what has happened following our trade \nagreements. We rush off and send our best negotiators to negotiate \ntrade agreements. When they finish negotiating some agreement with some \ncountry, whether it be Japan or the GATT agreement or NAFTA or some \nother agreement, they have a huge celebration or giant feast\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\nat which they all declare they have won.\n  But, what have our negotiators actually won? We had a $28 billion \nmerchandise trade deficit in 1981 when the trade agreement took effect \nfrom the Tokyo round of trade talks. By 1989, this Congress passed--\nwithout my vote, I might add--a United States-Canada Free-Trade \nAgreement, at which time we now had a $115 billion merchandise trade \ndeficit.\n  In 1994, a trade agreement, negotiated under fast track with Mexico \nand Canada, called NAFTA or the North American Free-Trade Agreement \ncame into effect. By that time, we had amassed a $166 billion \nmerchandise trade deficit. Then there was the Uruguay round of talks \nunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or GATT, and the trade \nagreement enacted by Congress which took effect January 1, 1995. By \nthat time, we had a $173 billion merchandise trade deficit. That has \nnow grown to a $191 billion merchandise trade deficit, and is \ncontinuing to grow again this year.\n  DRI and McGraw-Hill, which is a company that does econometric \nprojections, suggests our merchandise trade deficit will likely double \nin a 10-year period. We are headed in the wrong direction, not the \nright direction. So the question is, Do we continue doing this? Or does \nsomebody stand up and say, ``Wait a second, this doesn't make any \nsense. You are asking us to give fast track trade authority to \nnegotiate another trade agreement when all we have seen is an ocean of \nmerchandise trade deficits.''\n  With this discussion, I am not suggesting that we ought not trade. Of \ncourse we should trade. But we ought to say to our trading allies that \nthe conditions under which we trade with them must represent fair \ntrade. If you get your products into our marketplace, that's fine. But, \nthen we expect our products to get into your marketplace. If we have \nstandards that will not allow our producers to pollute our air and \nwater, then we expect you to produce under the same standards.\n  If we have standards that say we can't hire a 14-year-old and have \nhim work 14 hours a day and pay him 14 cents an hour to produce a \nproduct that we then ship to Pittsburgh or Los Angeles and Denver, then \nwe expect you not to employ a 14-year-old and pay him 14 cents an hour, \nproducing something you ship to those same cities. Those are the \nconditions under which our workers, our citizens, and our businesses \nought to expect trade to be handled under our trade agreements.\n  Now, when you look at this ocean of red ink which no one writes about \nand no one talks about, it seems to me it is time to stop to evaluate \nwhere we are. Daniel Webster said, on the floor of this Senate about \n160 years ago, ``When the mariner has been tossed for many days in \nthick weather and on an unknown sea, he naturally avails himself of the \nfirst pause in the storm, the earliest glance at the Sun, to take his \nlatitude and ascertain how far the elements have driven him from his \ntrue course.'' That might be a good suggestion for this Congress on the \nissue of trade.\n  Instead, what this Congress will debate, without even talking about \nthis choking trade debt, will be fast track.\n  There is fast food, fast lane, fast living, fast talk, and fast \nbreak. I remember when I played high school basketball the notion of a \nfast break was to move quickly and rush and get ahead of the defenders \nbefore they could get set up and make the basket. That's what a fast \nbreak is all about. You go ahead, before anybody notices you, and score \nyour points.\n  Everything that says fast somehow connotes lack of preparation. That \ncertainly has been the case with fast track in trade. Anyone, I say, \nanybody who believes that we have been successful in representing the \neconomic interests of this country in pursuing the kind of process we \npursued in recent years in trade just is not looking at the same set of \nfacts that exists for this presentation I am giving today.\n  Madam President, the instant you discuss these issues there are those \nin this town who categorize you in one of two camps. You are described \nas a free trader, period, end of story. This connotes, by the way, that \nyou support all of these negotiations and fast track and so on. You are \neither a free trader, or you are some kind of xenophobic, isolationist \nstooge who doesn't get it and are called a basic protectionist. Those \nare the two camps. You are one or the other, and you can't be in \nbetween because there is no thoughtfulness in between, we are told.\n  I stand right square in the middle of this issue, saying that this \ncountry has a problem and we ought to deal with it. We ought not be \ntalking about negotiating new trade agreements as long as we have \nvexing, difficult problems with old trade agreements that we refuse to \ndeal with. Fast track--if we are going to fast track anything, let's \nfast track the efforts to solve old trade problems.\n  We negotiated a trade agreement with Mexico. At the time, we had a \nnearly $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Guess what? It has not \nbeen very long--only 3 years later--and we have ended up with nearly a \n$16 billion trade deficit with Mexico. We go from a small surplus, to a \nbig deficit.\n  We negotiate a trade agreement with Mexico and we are told what is \ngoing to come into this country from Mexico will be the product of low-\nskill and low-wage work.\n  What is actually coming in from Mexico? Automobiles, automobile \nparts, and electronics parts. Do you know we now import more cars from \nMexico into the United States than the United States exports to the \nrest of the entire world? Think of that.\n  Has the United States-Mexico, has the NAFTA agreement worked out the \nway we expected? I would like one person to come to this Senate and \nsay, ``Boy, this really worked out well. What we wanted was to have an \nagreement with Canada and Mexico positioned such that at end of it, we \nwould have a combined trade deficit of nearly $40 billion.'' Is that \nwhat we wanted? I don't think so.\n  At the root of all of this, whether it's with Mexico or Canada is our \npast agreements and the fast track process that wouldn't allow the \nagreements to be changed and corrected. As a result we have a severe \nproblem with Canadian grain flooding across our border in a \nfundamentally unfair way.\n  And by the way, we can't resolve these issues now because we pulled \nthe teeth of our own trade laws in all these trade agreements. We have \npulled the teeth of those provisions which could have been effective in \nrepresenting us and in remedying these problems. And now that the teeth \nare pulled, we wonder why we can't chew on these issues. You can't chew \nbecause there is no effective remedy left.\n  Does anybody think that this represents progress? Is it progress to \nhave Mexico and Canada have a huge trade surplus with the United \nStates? Is it progress that we have this deficit with them?\n  China has a large and growing trade deficit, which has been growing \nexponentially. In a dozen years it has grown from $10 million up to \nover $40 billion. How about Japan? Every single year, we have had a \nrecurring trade deficit of $48 billion to over $50 billion a year.\n  What does all of that represent? It represents jobs. And it \nrepresents, by and large, a diminution of our manufacturing sector. No \neconomy will long remain a strong economy if it doesn't retain a strong \nmanufacturing base.\n  There are those who believe it doesn't matter where you produce. Get \nin your Lear jet or get in your Gulfstream and travel around the world. \nLook out the window and find out where on this Earth, what patch of \nground can you find where you can build a plant and have people come in \nthe front door of that plant and pay them a quarter an hour, a half a \ndollar an hour, or 75 cents an hour. Pay them no benefits, no pensions, \nno insurance, and pollute the air and water as you produce because that \nrepresents profit and that represents progress. Not to me it doesn't. \nNot to this country it doesn't.\n  The consideration of fast-track trade authority by this Congress \nought, it seems to me, to persuade us finally to ask ourselves, what \ntruly is progress in international trade? Do we really think that a \ntrade picture that looks like this is progress?\n  Six countries have 92 percent of our record level merchandise trade \ndeficit. Nearly 30 percent of the trade deficit is with Japan. It is 24 \npercent and growing with China. Canada and Mexico together, have \nanother 24 percent. The\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\nlatest figures show that NAFTA, the crown jewel of trade agreements has \nproduced a record nearly $40 billion combined trade deficit. Do we \nreally think that those kinds of numbers represent progress?\n  This is not working. It is not a case of this country saying we want \nto close our borders and shut off imports; it's a case of this country \nsaying we expect the trade rules to be fair. We expect our negotiators \nwho negotiate trade agreements to win from time to time. Should we \nexpect that every time our trade negotiators run off someplace that \nthey lose? I don't think so. Yet, that is what happened.\n  We have a beef agreement with Japan. Nobody knows much about these \nthings, because all this is like a foreign language. We have an \navalanche of Japanese goods coming into America. I do not object to \nthat. All I ask is that American goods get into Japan on a fair basis.\n  We couldn't get much American beef into Japan, so we had a huge \nnegotiation with the Japanese. It must have been 8, 10 years ago, by \nnow, that they announced this breakthrough. You would have thought \nthere was a national day of fiesta and rejoicing. It was a major \nbreakthrough; a big beef agreement with Japan. Guess what the agreement \nwas. We have such a low expectation of our trade negotiations.\n  The agreement with Japan was the following: When the agreement is \nfully phased in, there will remain only a 50-percent tariff on American \nbeef going into Japan. That tariff will be reduced, except if the \nquantity increases, it snaps back to 50 percent. Under any other set of \ncircumstances, that would be defined as failure, but it was defined in \nour negotiations with Japan as a success. That is true with virtually \nevery single set of negotiations this country has been involved in the \nlast two decades.\n  This is not a complaint about Republicans or Democrats. It's a \ncomplaint against both and all. I have not yet met anyone who is \nwilling to look me in the eye and talk about the facts about the \nmerchandise trade deficits in this country and have them tell me that \nthis is a record they want to stand on.\n  My hope is that in the coming couple of weeks, as we discuss the \nissue of fast-track trade authority, we might finally have the debate \nwe really need. We don't want a thoughtless debate about ``this person \nis a protectionist'' and ``this person is a free trader.'' Rather we \nneed a thoughtful debate about precisely what kind of trade agreements \nrepresent this country's real interests, what kind of trade agreements \nrequire us to compete internationally and compete effectively and \nfairly, and what kind of trade agreements make certain that this \ncountry, when it does compete in the international marketplace, is able \nto do so on an even and fair basis.\n  Madam President, it is obvious, I suppose, that I will be \naggressively opposing the fast-track authority that this President will \nrequest. If he, on September 10, makes a formal request, he will no \ndoubt have substantial support for it. I have had several people come \nup to me in my State who said to me, ``Oh, by the way, Byron, I was \nsupposed to tell you to vote for fast track because my company sent out \na memo to all the employees saying, `We want you all to contact your \nSenator to vote for fast track.' I don't know about fast track,'' they \nsaid, ``but that is something my company wants you to vote for.''\n  I am not going to support fast track. I will be on the floor of the \nSenate often to talk about what I think are the problems in \ninternational trade and what I think are our priorities.\n  We have massive problems with Canada, for example, on grain trade. \nThe responsibility that we have is not to create some fast-track \nprocedure for new agreements, but to create a fast-track determination \nto solve old trade problems from previous agreements that do not work.\n  Until trade negotiators demonstrate a willingness to do that, and \nuntil this administration demonstrates a willingness to do that, I do \nnot think it ought to get the vote of the U.S. Senate or the U.S. House \nfor a peculiar and unique authority called fasttrack that, in my \njudgment, undercuts the constitutional requirement of Congress, to \nregulate commerce.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just say to my colleague from \nNorth Dakota that I appreciate his analysis. I look forward to joining \nhim in this debate. I think he is really one of the most eloquent \nSenators, or for that matter Congressmen, in Washington on a set of \nissues that are so important to working people, so important to \nproducers, and I thank him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8648-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8650-S8651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1056\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask whether or not the amendment we \nare on right now is the Kyl amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I do not know whether or not my colleague, Senator Kyl \nfrom Arizona, will be back today or whether we will come back to his \namendment tomorrow, but I want to just very briefly comment on his \namendment.\n  The Kyl amendment, as I understand it--I have the amendment before \nme--amounts essentially to over a $500 million rescission, if you will, \nin funding for what is called LIHEAP, the low-income energy assistance \nprogram. We have seen cuts over the years in this low-income energy \nassistance program. It is really now under a billion dollars total. So \nin many ways we would essentially, if this amendment passes, be dealing \nwith the end of the program.\n  Mr. President, I actually would come to the floor and have an \namendment which would call for an increase in funding for low-income \nenergy assistance. And the reason I do not is that we have been sort of \ngoing through the same drill every year, which is that come the cold \nwinter months--this happens in Minnesota; it happens in many of our \ncold-weather States--what happens is, because we do not have enough by \nway of appropriations, because the vast majority of these families are \nfamilies with incomes under $7,000 or $8,000 a year, because about half \nthe people helped are children, because close to 50 percent of these \nfamilies are working poor families, they work 52 weeks a year, 40 hours \na week, and because, Mr. President, these grants, this assistance, \nrepresents a kind of lifeline for people so they are not faced with the \nchoice of ``Do I pay for my heat? Then I can't afford prescription \ndrugs or I can't afford food,'' we have been supportive of this.\n  What happens, though not as supportive as we should be, the \nadministration provides additional emergency funds because, you know, \nwhether it be in Minnesota or Indiana, I suppose, as well, what happens \nis that at the county level where the people live, at the grassroots \nlevel, we get calls. And these are desperation calls. So we actually \nprovide a supplement to what we have in the bill by way of emergency \nfunding. But for a State like Minnesota or Indiana it is a bit of a \nnightmare to plan. People never know. They never know.\n  So now we have an amendment which would really just make this \nsituation, which is not great--we do not have the funding that we \nshould have for a program that helps people so they do not go cold. \nThat is a kind of minimal standard of decency. It certainly is \nimportant to a cold-weather State like Minnesota. But now if this \namendment was to pass--I do not think it will; I hope we will have a \nstrong vote against it--it would be a nightmare.\n  I just want to say to my colleague, whom I enjoy, that the part of \nthe amendment which deals with expanding funding for the Pell grant I \nam all for. I think one of the things that was overlooked in the budget \nagreement--I think there was a bit too much exaggeration about how we \nwere going to make sure that higher education was affordable for all \nour students because, to repeat one more time, the tax credit which \ngoes to the HOPE scholarship program is not refundable. So if you come \nfrom a family below $27,000 a year, you may not be eligible, and\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\nmany of the community college students in Minnesota are not.\n  We also expanded the Pell grant a little bit, but if you talk to the \nfinancial aid officers around the country, I think all of them will \ntell you that the most effective, efficient way of providing the \nnecessary support for young or not such young students--many of our \nstudents are older--to be able to afford higher education is the Pell \ngrants.\n  So I say to my colleague, it is a laudable goal. I will have an \namendment on the floor to provide some additional funding for the Pell \ngrants in this country. But you cannot do that on the backs of some of \nthe poorest, most vulnerable citizens in the United States of America. \nI mean, you cannot take away energy assistance from people who, if they \ndo not receive this emergency assistance during cold winters, could \nvery well go cold or maybe pay for heat but then not have enough to \neat. This is just an unacceptable trade-off.\n\n  I am disappointed we have to go through this whole fight again, but, \nyou know, all of us do what we think is right. I know my colleague from \nArizona is doing this because he thinks it is the right thing to do. \nBut we have had very strong bipartisan support over the LIHEAP Program. \nI think we all know already that it is minimum funding. We all know \nalready it is not enough. We all know already that we end up every \nwinter having to provide additional emergency funding. So the last \nthing we want to do is essentially gut this program.\n  So, again, I share part of the goal of this because indeed I will \nhave an amendment that will talk about expanding Pell grant funding. \nBut you do not take the funding from some of the poorest, most \nvulnerable families in America.\n  I am speaking as a Senator from a cold-weather State, Minnesota, but \nI think the vast majority of my colleagues share this sentiment as \nwell. So when we come back to this, there will be a pretty strong \ndebate. I hope we will have an overwhelmingly strong vote in opposition \nto this amendment.\n  I also want to say, Mr. President--I will say it very briefly--that I \nlook forward to starting tomorrow. I do intend to introduce an \namendment to expand funding for Head Start. I have been doing some \nreally interesting traveling and learned so much from people when I was \nin eastern Kentucky.\n  I, by the way, would like to say to the Chair, not in sort of a \nsyrupy, senatorial courtesy, if you will, but at my wife's family \nreunion, the Isom family in eastern Kentucky, about half the people \nwere from Indiana. I had an opportunity to tell them I really enjoyed \nworking with Senator Coats from Indiana. It was kind of nice. Most of \nthem are Republicans. I did not change their view, but they are \nwonderful people. They think a great deal of the Chair. I think they \nare disappointed he is in fact not going to be continuing in the \nSenate. I say that to the Chair.\n  One of the things you learn, especially as you visit Head Start, is \nthat now that we are talking more about the very early years, I mean \nthe funding, when it comes to really trying to help with families where \nchildren are 1 or 2, under the age of 3, we have practically no funding \nat all.\n  I tell you, I met some wonderful people in eastern Kentucky. One \nwoman who has been with Head Start, I don't know, from the very \nbeginning, her husband died of black lung, and she has not had a high \nschool degree. With the help of Head Start, she went back and got her \nhigh school degree, went on and got a college education and has been a \nHead Start teacher for 30 years. I asked her, ``Why do you do this? You \ncan't get wealthy. You don't make very much money at all.'' She talked \nabout her love of children. You could just feel it.\n  So I want to have an amendment that talks about expanding some \nfunding for Head Start. I certainly want to have an amendment that \ndeals with the Pell grant program. I will have one other amendment that \nwill deal with this whole issue of what are we going to do about \nrebuilding crumbling schools.\n  I heard my colleague, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, in a very \neloquent way say there is agreement on this except we do not seem to \nmatch our words with resources. I am seeing, as I travel around the \ncountry, some of these crumbling schools. It is sort of like when we \ntalk about family values. We have to make ``values'' a verb. It cannot \njust be a noun. We have to sort of live it, do it.\n  If we value these children, we just cannot have children going to \nschools that are crumbling. You cannot have children walking into \nschools where the ceilings are falling--I have seen these conditions--\nor when the stench of urine is in the hallway or toilets are decrepit \nand you cannot even wash your hands after you go to the bathroom.\n  As Senator Kennedy said earlier, we are saying to these kids --no \nmatter what we think we are saying--what we are saying is that we do \nnot value you much. We have to figure out a way as a nation to do \nsomething about this.\n  I was at a gathering with a top urban educator. I so appreciated her \nremarks because what she said is: Look, you all can debate whether \nthere should be tests or standards or how you measure accountability \nand all the rest of it, and it is all debatable, but, she said, some \nthings are simple. Just invest some money in infrastructure. Help \nrebuild these crumbling schools.\n  She is right. I will have another amendment that will deal with that. \nBut I do hope when we come back--I want my colleague from Arizona to \nknow there will be a very fierce debate about this. I mean, for the \nlast several years I have come out here. Senator Kennedy has joined me. \nSenator Harkin, Senator Specter, a number of different Senators have \nbeen very strong on this. Senator Jeffords has been a very strong \nleader on this. And we have had to fight every year for this low-income \nenergy assistance. I do not think we should have to fight so hard for \nit because it is really just a basic lifeline program.\n  My colleague from Arizona, whether he intends to do so or not, is \nessentially gutting this program, ending it. We cannot do that. We \ncannot do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8650-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8651-S8655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I understand I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. During previous consideration of the appropriations bill \non agriculture I offered an amendment, along with Senator Chafee and \nothers to protect America's kids and crack down on illegal tobacco \nsales. We would do it by providing full funding for the FDA's youth \ntobacco use prevention initiative.\n  That amendment was debated and received a strong bipartisan vote of \n48 Senators, but some of my colleagues expressed concerns about certain \naspects of the amendment. Those concerns seemed to focus primarily on \nthe nature of the offset and on whether the FDA initiative should be \nfunded before the outcome of the pending tobacco settlement is known. I \nhave, in good faith, modified my amendment in two important respects \nthat I believe fully address both concerns.\n  First, this amendment contains an entirely different offset. It would \nreduce spending by the USDA Commodity Credit Corporation on automated \ndata processing and information technology equipment during fiscal year \n1998 by $29.1 million, just enough to allow full funding for the FDA \ninitiative.\n  Second, to clear up any uncertainty about the relationship of the FDA \ninitiative to the pending tobacco settlement, this amendment contains a \nsunset provision that would become effective if funding for FDA youth \ntobacco use prevention activities becomes available as a result of the \ntobacco settlement.\n  I want to make it clear there is nothing in my amendment having to do \nwith tobacco marketing assessments or tobacco farmers or anything that \ncould remotely be called a revenue measure that could conceivably \ninterest the Ways and Means Committee of the House.\n  I also add the amendment includes language suggested by Senator Byrd \nthat would have the FDA encourage States to coordinate their \nenforcement either under the youth tobacco use prevention initiative \nwith enforcement of laws against underage drinking. I want to commend \nand thank Senator Byrd for that addition. As I said in the debate \nearlier, the two go hand in glove. You find kids using illegal tobacco, \nyou find them illegally buying alcohol at the same time more often than \nnot.\n  With that background, Mr. President, I hope we can zero in on what \nthis is all about. Plain and simple--this amendment is about protecting \nAmerica's kids from killer tobacco. With a death toll of more than \n400,000 a year, smoking kills more Americans than AIDS, alcohol, motor \nvehicles, fires, homicides, illicit drugs, and suicide combined.\n  This is an epidemic, and we know where it starts. It starts with \nkids. It starts with illegal underage smoking. Almost 90 percent of \nadult smokers began at or before age 18.\n  Put this in perspective: The Senate last took up this debate 40 days \nago with my previous amendment. Since that time, another 120,000 young \nAmericans got hooked on tobacco and began smoking; 40,000 of those will \ndie because of it. That is the toll just in the past 7 weeks. At \ncurrent rates, 5 million American kids under age 18 who are alive today \nwill be killed by smoking-related disease. And teenage smoking rates \nare still climbing.\n  Smoking among high school seniors is at a 17-year high. The \nstatistics on smoking among young women and girls is just shocking. \nSmoking among 8th grade girls jumped over 60 percent from 1991 to 1996, \nwith rates of smoking now higher for 8th and 10th grade girls than for \nboys.\n  Now, briefly reviewing what this amendment will fund at FDA. FDA \nneeds $34 million to carry out enforcement of rules setting a minimum \nage of 18 for tobacco purchases and requiring photo ID checks. In its \ninitiative, FDA is signing contracts with State and local jurisdictions \nfor cooperation in carrying out enforcement of these rules.\n  The FDA initiative also includes funding to provide information to \nretailers and the public about the rules to help retailers comply with \nthe rules and not sell tobacco to kids. This excerpt from an FDA \nbrochure shows why it is necessary to have a photo ID check.\n  FDA has $4.9 million in fiscal year 1997 that it is using to fund \ncontracts with 10 States. The $34 million will allow FDA to provide \nmoney to all 50 States to help them prevent youth tobacco use. This is \nnot some big new bureaucratic program. The bulk of the money goes to \nthe States and local jurisdictions.\n  Of the $34 million, $24 million will go to enforcement and \nevaluation, and $10 million will be used to educate retailers and the \npublic about the rules so retailers can comply. The point of the rules \nis not to punish anyone, it is to protect kids. I add that these photo \nID check and minimum age rules were fully upheld by the Federal \ndistrict court in Greensboro, NC.\n  This funding request is part of the President's budget request for \nthe Food and Drug Administration. I have a letter from Vice President \nGore expressing the administration's strong support for my amendment. I \nask unanimous consent the letter, dated August 28, 1997, from the \nOffice of the Vice President, be printed at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Vice President,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 28, 1997.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I am writing to inform you of the \n     Administration's strong support for your amendment to fully \n     fund the anti-youth access to tobacco initiative in fiscal \n     year 1998. As you know, every year, there are more than $1 \n     billion in illegal sales of tobacco products to children and \n     adolescents in the United States. With approximately 500,000 \n     retailers in the country who sell tobacco, it is critical \n     that the Food and Drug Administration's request for $34 \n     million in funding be granted in order to stop these illegal \n     sales to our children.\n       The requested funding is intended to enforce the age and \n     photo ID provisions of the FDA rule, upheld by the Federal \n     District Court in Greensboro, North Carolina. The bulk of the \n     $34 million will be spent on contracts with states that want \n     to join the FDA in ensuring retailer compliance with these \n     provisions. While the FDA is in the process of providing \n     initial funding for 10 states to begin conducting compliance \n     checks, the $34 million is needed to allow state officials in \n     all interested states to undertake compliance checks in \n     fiscal year 1998.\n       The remaining funds are intended to educate retailers and \n     the public about the new rules. We believe that the vast \n     majority of retailers in this country will comply with the \n     age and photo ID requirements if they understand their \n     responsibilities and recognize the important role they can \n     play in protecting children from tobacco and its \n     consequences.\n       Funding the FDA initiative is vital if we are to have a \n     credible national youth tobacco program in the upcoming \n     fiscal year; the $4.9 million provided thus far by the Senate \n     will not enable us to do so. This amendment would add the \n     needed $29 million to the initiative, offset by reducing the \n     Department of Agriculture automated data processing funds \n     available through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The \n     Administration has determined that this modest limitation \n     will not impair the ability of USDA to carry out its programs \n     and provide services to the public.\n       Once again, let me assure you that the President and I \n     remain strongly committed to protecting young people from \n     tobacco and its consequences. Your amendment would allow the \n     government to have a meaningful enforcement and outreach \n     program that will ensure the safety of our children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Al Gore.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a letter from 33 attorneys general involved in the \ntobacco settlement negotiations calling\n\n[[Page S8653]]\n\nfor full funding of the FDA initiative. I ask unanimous consent a \nletter from the attorneys general be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Attorney General of Washington,\n\n                                       Olympia, WA, June 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chair, Senate Appropriations Committee, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations Committee, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chair, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, \n         Rural Development and Related Agencies, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dale Bumpers,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \n         Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: We are writing as the attorneys \n     general for our respective states in support of the Food and \n     Drug Administration's (FDA) request for $34 million to \n     implement the tobacco initiative in the Agriculture \n     Appropriations bill. This funding is critical to our efforts \n     to protect kids from tobacco sales.\n       There is no reason not to fully fund the FDA tobacco \n     regulations. A Federal District Court recently upheld FDA's \n     general jurisdiction over the sale of tobacco products to \n     minors, and the American public overwhelmingly supports this \n     initiative. The tobacco industry failed in its legal effort \n     to derail FDA's important protections for kids. Now, local, \n     state and federal officials must move forward and work \n     together to implement FDA's regulations.\n       In 1994, attorneys general from around the country issued a \n     report illustrating the need for comprehensive new policies \n     to protect kids from tobacco. In the past three years, 40 \n     attorneys general have filed suit against the tobacco \n     industry to recover damages caused by their behavior. To stop \n     the marketing of tobacco products to kids is a primary goal \n     of these lawsuits, against the tobacco industry.\n       We are prepared to work hand-in-hand with FDA to ensure \n     that the provisions of its tobacco initiative are fully \n     enforced. Towards this end, FDA has allocated a significant \n     portion of the $34 million to go directly to the states to \n     help with enforcement. This money is critical to ensuring our \n     country's success in reducing tobacco use by youth.\n       We need to act without delay: cigarette smoking among high \n     school seniors is at a 17 year high and smoking among 8th and \n     10th graders has increased by more than 50 percent since \n     1991. Tobacco use is clearly a problem that starts with \n     children: almost 90 percent of adult smokers started using \n     tobacco at or before age 18, and the average youth smoker \n     begins at age 13 and becomes a daily smoker by age 14\\1/2\\.\n       While some provisions of FDA's initiative are on hold \n     pending appeal, the court fully upheld FDA's funding that \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are both drugs and \n     drug delivery devices. In addition, the court provided FDA \n     with full authority to continue implementing provisions \n     requiring retailers to check photo identification of \n     consumers seeking to purchase tobacco who appear to be \n     younger than 27 years of age. Strong enforcement of this \n     provision is key to reducing youth access to tobacco \n     products. The $34 million requested by FDA will provide much \n     needed funding for enforcement by state and local officials.\n       Currently, it is far too easy for kids to buy cigarettes \n     and chewing tobacco through vending machines and at retail \n     outlets. A review of thirteen studies of over-the-counter \n     sales found that, on average, children and adolescents were \n     able to successfully buy tobacco products 67 percent of the \n     time. We can substantially improve on this record by \n     providing funding for the FDA regulations.\n       The tobacco industry's record of targeting our kids is \n     clear. Now is the time to stand up for America's kids and \n     protect them from cigarettes and chewing tobacco. FDA's \n     jurisdiction over sales to minors has been upheld in court \n     and enjoys strong support among the people of our states. We \n     hope you will vote for full-funding of this critical \n     initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n         Christine O. Gregoire, Attorney General of Washington; \n           Bruce Ml.

Keep in mind the $34 million FDA needs is just a drop in \nthe bucket compared to the $50 billion in annual smoking-related \nmedical costs in our Nation.\n  As I close, I want to bring the discussion back to the central issue. \nThat is, whether we will stand up to big tobacco and stand up for \nAmerica's kids. If we cannot even take this modest step, $29.1 million, \nwhat kind of message does that send?\n  We talk a lot around here about protecting kids. Well, it is time to \nquit talking and do something about it. Let's do what is right for our \nkids, right for law enforcement, right for the future. Let's pass this \namendment and give our kids what they deserve--better health and a \nbrighter future.\n  Again, I point out that this amendment is in full compliance with the \nrules. This Senator is offering the amendment parliamentarily to the \nHouse-passed bill as it came over here under the unanimous-consent \nagreement reached with the majority leader prior to the Senate going \nout in early August.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 53 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, let me say at the outset, when we started the \nconsideration of appropriations bills this year it became important \nthat we work out an arrangement whereby we proceed to consider bills \neven though they may not have passed by the House. And as all Senators \nknow, it is the past custom, and the practice has been that \nappropriations bills originate in the House, they come to the Senate, \nand they are amended, and then they go to conference to work out the \ndifferences.\n  Because of the crush of the time and the negotiations on a budget \nresolution and for a number of other reasons, it was considered \nappropriate for the Senate committee to proceed to consider original \nlegislation on appropriations here in the Senate, for the subcommittees \nto mark up bills and the full committee to report out bills, whether or \nnot the House had passed the bill or even met in the Committee on \nAppropriations to act on legislation.\n  Consistent with that procedure, it was assumed that it would be \nappropriate at the conclusion of the Senate's action on an \nappropriations bill to obtain unanimous consent to hold the bill here, \nand that upon receipt of the bill as passed by the House, the Senate's \naction on the bill would be substituted for the House-passed bill. That \nit would then be considered as passed, conference would be invited, and \nwe would proceed to work out our differences in conference.\n  The Senate has passed 10 appropriations bills, all but two were \nSenate-originated bills; the House has passed only 7 appropriations \nbills. The process was working just fine, and with the cooperation of \nall Senators, until the agriculture appropriations bill was considered \nand action on the bill was nearly completed. Our leadership sought to \nget unanimous consent to substitute the Senate-passed bill, to insert \nit as an amendment to the House-passed bill when that bill was \nreceived. We could not get unanimous consent because the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa had offered an amendment, as other Senators had, \nduring the course of consideration of the bill. The amendment had been \ndisposed of, but he wanted to offer\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\nit again in a different form. So to do that, he objected.\n  It was discovered that unanimous consent had to be obtained under the \nprocedure we were using. So if he objected, he could hold up passage of \nthe House bill, offer his amendment again, reconfigure it, and have the \nSenate vote on it again. That is what has happened.\n  I think the Senate should reject the amendment on the grounds that \nthe procedure is one where we will have to either stop considering \nSenate appropriations bills until the House has acted, or at the \nbeginning of the consideration of an appropriations bill either get \nunanimous consent in advance to taking up amendments, or take some \nother action that would keep from happening what the Senator from Iowa \nis trying to make happen now. That is, on the whim or on the action of \nany individual Senator, to force this Senate to vote on all the \namendments again or versions of the amendments that were defeated when \nwe were considering the Senate bill. This becomes a terribly unwieldy \nand impossible procedure to follow.\n  We have certain understandings all the time about how things will be \ndone here in the Senate. There are certain procedures and rules that \nare institutionalized. After third reading, you cannot offer any more \namendments, for example. I don't know of anybody that has tried to \noverturn or undo that rule. There are other procedures that have become \na part of the practice of the Senate in doing business. The reason for \nthe rule on third reading is that at some point there has to be an end \nto the offering of amendments. No one objected to the procedure we were \nfollowing on the other appropriations bills; there was no alternative \nproposed; everybody agreed it was fair; it was serving the purpose of \nexpediting action on appropriations bills; it was not a problem with \nthe House; no one objected and said they were not going to permit the \nSenate to act on appropriations bills until the House has completed its \naction. We heard nothing like that from the House leadership.\n  So what I am suggesting, Mr. President, as respectfully as I can, is \nthat this is an unfortunate effort to go around the practices and the \nprocedures that have been established for this purpose, to facilitate \nthe orderly consideration of appropriations bills, and the Senate ought \nto reject this effort. The Senate ought to vote down this amendment. \nTomorrow morning, after all time has been used under the unanimous-\nconsent request, I will move to table the Harkin amendment. I urge the \nSenate to vote to table the Harkin amendment.\n  It is the same amendment, in effect, that was offered and argued \nbefore the Senate on July 23. A motion to table that amendment was made \nand agreed to by the Senate on a record vote. Then, after amendments \nhad been considered, a unanimous-consent request was made by our \nleadership, jointly supported, to limit the remaining amendments to a \nstated number. This was after the Harkin amendment had been defeated on \na motion to table. The Senator should have asked, if he wanted to offer \nanother amendment on this subject, that he be permitted to do so under \nthat unanimous-consent request. And there was no request that he be \npermitted to do so. There were a few amendments left to be considered \nat that time, and so the Senate heard that request. There was no \nobjection, and so it was ordered that the remaining amendments on the \nbill be limited to those stated in that order. The Harkin amendment was \nnot one of them. No amendment to be offered by Senator Harkin was one \nof them.\n  He or any Senator under that situation should be stopped from urging \na right to offer another amendment then after that order was entered. \nAfter the order was entered, then we voted on the bill, as amended, and \nit passed 99 to 0 on a rollcall vote. Now, after that has happened, the \nSenate is obliged to consider this amendment in order to get unanimous-\nconsent to receive the House-passed bill, which was adopted on the same \nday the Senate adopted its bill. We have to consider this amendment \nbefore the Senate again and have the Senate act on it in exchange for a \nunanimous consent agreement that we can then substitute the Senate-\npassed bill, as amended, for the provisions of the House bill and go to \nconference.\n  I hope the Senate will not encourage this kind of activity in the \nfuture and make it impossible for us to proceed as we have been \nproceeding by acting favorably on the Harkin amendment. The Senate has \nto vote down the Harkin amendment or vote for a motion to table, which \nwill be made tomorrow.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the arguments \nmade by my friend, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nAppropriations Committee. However, let me point out that, first of all, \nno point of order lies against my amendment. Therefore, it is in full \ncompliance with the rules of the Senate. I know of no one who would say \nthat something ought to be defeated because it is in compliance with \nthe rules.\n  I, through my staff, consulted the Parliamentarian's office about \nresearching any precedents for the procedural situation of my amendment \non the bill. My staff was told it would be virtually impossible to \nresearch precedence because offering an amendment in this posture is \nclearly within the rules and would not be identified as having set a \nprecedent. By the same token, I believe that adopting my amendment \nwould not set any precedent whatsoever. We are simply using the rules.\n  Now, the fact is that, as the chairman said, most of the time bills \nare passed in the House and they come over and we substitute, in the \nbeginning, before the process, the House-passed bill, and therefore we \nwork on one bill, and when third reading is made, that is the end of \nit. But in this case, we passed the bill prior to the House passing it. \nThe rules clearly allow that any bill that comes over from the House \ntaken up by the Senate is amendable. That is all this Senator is doing. \nIt sets no precedent whatsoever.\n  Second, I point out that I did not need a unanimous-consent agreement \nto offer my amendment. I could have done it without any unanimous \nconsent agreement whatsoever. The only reason the unanimous consent was \nentered into is I was accommodating to the majority leader that night, \nwho wanted to get the bill done. I want to make it clear that I didn't \nneed unanimous consent to offer this amendment.\n  Third, there was a lot of confusion at the time that I offered this \namendment that, by offering it, it would go to the House, it would be \nblue-slipped by the House, would go to the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, all of which I thought at the time was spurious. But I think \nsome Members were swayed by that. Even in light of that, this amendment \ngot 48 votes. I now point out that no such argument can be held on \nthis, because this will not go back to the House. It will go right to \nconference. Therefore, it cannot be blue-slipped. It will not go to the \nWays and Means Committee in the House. So, therefore, there was some \nconfusion about that at the time.\n  Next, there was a feeling by some that the offsets I had were not \nappropriate. So we changed the offsets, as I said in my initial opening \ncomments, to accommodate certain Senators who didn't feel I had the \nright offsets.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Iowa has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Mr. Harkin's amendment uses a budgetary \ngimmick to offset increased spending in 1998.\n  The amendment merely delays $29 million in mandatory Commodity Credit \nCorporation [CCC] spending for USDA computers and related items until \n1999 to offset increased spending in 1998.\n  The 1996 farm bill included $275 million for computer and related \nexpenses over the 1997 through 2002 fiscal years. Based upon the \nlanguage in the farm bill CBO had to estimate the flow of funds over \nthe 6-year period.\n  The CBO estimated that approximately $66 million will be spent on \ncomputers and related expenses in 1998. The Harkin amendment merely \ndelays the expenditure of $29 million into 1999 thus increasing \nspending in 1999.\n  Under our scoring rules if the appropriations bill changes a \nmandatory program the Appropriations Committee will get scored with the \nchange. If this\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\namendment becomes law, the discretionary spending caps will be adjusted \ndownward in 1999.\n  This amendment will therefore make it more difficult for Congress to \nfund agriculture research and extension, education, and environment \nprograms in next year's appropriation bills as less money is available \nto spend.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I presume all time has now expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 15 seconds.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I hope everybody will read Senator Domenici's remarks in \nthe Record tonight. They refer to the fact that the offset this \namendment proposes really isn't anything more than a temporary, 1-year \noffset. In order to achieve the savings that are purported to be added \nto the FDA account by this amendment being offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, a limitation on the use of Commodity Credit \nCorporation funds is imposed. But that is only for 1 year. In other \nwords, that deserves some consideration, as Senator Domenici indicates. \nI agree with him.\n  In addition, if $47 million in Commodity Credit Corporation funds is \nreally needed for the Department of Agriculture to operate and maintain \nits computer systems in fiscal year 1998, as the Department indicates, \nthose funds will have to be reprogrammed from other accounts, putting \npressure on possibly the Farm Service Agency or other USDA agencies.\n  I am focusing on and I hope the Senate will focus on why we are going \nto have to reject this effort to undermine the procedure we have, or \neither change the procedure. We had a procedure that seemed to satisfy \neverybody. And now there is an effort to undermine it completely. It \nought to be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 5 minutes on the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the amendment that \nthe Senator from Iowa has offered on increasing the funding for the FDA \nyouth tobacco initiative. This amendment will restore full funding for \nthe Food and Drug Administration's tobacco initiative in order to \nprevent tobacco use by teenagers and adolescents. The goal of the \namendment is to prevent illegal sales of tobacco products to children.\n  In the bill presently before us, the Senate has allocated $4.9 \nmillion for the implementation of the FDA regulations that restrict the \nsale and distribution of tobacco products to young people.\n  This is not adequate funding. The FDA will not be able to enforce the \nrestrictions on the sale of tobacco to children unless the additional \nfunds proposed by the Harkin amendment are agreed to. Some have said \nthat the amendment is premature and the tobacco settlement is still \nbeing reviewed. Here in the Congress we will provide the money that the \nFDA needs in order to go ahead with the enforcement called for in the \ncurrent regulations.\n  First, I point out that it is not that clear that Congress will go \nahead and approve a settlement similar to that proposed by the \nattorneys general and the tobacco industry. Even if we are able to \nagree upon legislation to implement such an agreement, money for FDA \nenforcement through that settlement is not likely to be provided before \nfiscal year 1999, and the FDA enforcement and outreach efforts are very \nimportant and should not be delayed until that time.\n  It should also be noted that the amendment has a sunset provision. \nThe Harkin amendment has a sunset provision, and if funding for the FDA \ntobacco initiative is provided for fiscal year 1998 through any tobacco \nsettlement legislation, then the extra funds covered by that offset \nwould be rescinded under the amendment. The amendment would raise the \nlevel to $34 million in fiscal year 1998 so that the FDA, working with \nthe States, can carry out rules to prevent kids from smoking.\n  Clearly, the need to give more attention and more effort and more \nresources to the effort to prevent young people from smoking is clear: \n4.5 million young people, ages 12 through 17, are smokers today. High \nschool seniors are smoking at the highest rates they have in 17 years. \nNearly 90 percent of adult smokers began at or before the age of 18 and \nbegan with that habit. Today, just like every other day of the year, \nanother 3,000 young people will become regular smokers. If current \nrates continue, more than 5 million children under age 18 who are alive \ntoday will wind up being killed by smoking-related diseases.\n  A root cause of youth smoking is the easy access that kids have to \ntobacco. A survey by the Centers for Disease Control shows that \nchildren and adolescents were able to buy tobacco products 67 percent \nof the time that they tried. The CDC found that most young smokers \nusually buy cigarettes without questions being asked and without any \nidentification being requested. The American people support the effort \nthat the FDA is making to reduce smoking among young people. Their \nstrong support is shown in recent polls among the public with the use-\naccess provisions of the FDA rule in the enforcement of those \nprovisions. Eighty-seven percent of the public agreed with the FDA \npolicy setting a national minimum age of 18 for the purchase of tobacco \nproducts. It is estimated that there are more than $1 million in \nillegal sales of tobacco products to children and adolescents in the \nUnited States every year.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying that this amendment, \nwhich Senator Harkin has offered and I have cosponsored with him, will \nallow us to enforce the law that is in effect in all 50 States--the law \nagainst the sale of tobacco products to minors. It simply restores full \nfunding to the FDA's tobacco initiative to prevent teenage tobacco use.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8651-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8655-S8656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this morning, when the majority \nleader and I were on the floor, with Senator Harkin, the ranking member \nof the subcommittee, we discussed the sequence of the bill which is \ncurrently pending, and it was our plan, our expectation, to conclude \naction on this bill by tomorrow evening. We have only had one amendment \nlaid down so far. The distinguished Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] has \nlaid down an amendment with respect to LIHEAP, but no other amendment \nhas been forthcoming.\n  Now is obviously a good time to offer amendments since the floor is \nclear, with ample time for consideration. We hope that anybody who has \nan amendment to offer would advise the managers of the bill, myself in \nmy capacity as chairman of the subcommittee, and Senator Harkin, the \nranking member of the subcommittee, and that we would have notification \nby the end of business today as to all amendments\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\nMembers tend to offer. At the very latest we hope those amendments \nwould be filed by noon tomorrow. We have a vote scheduled for 9:30, and \nSenators to some extent may be arriving back at this time. Certainly as \nan indicator from past practice Senators will be here tomorrow morning \nto vote at 9:30, so we hope that Senators would let us have those \namendments so that we could plan the conclusion of the bill, sequence \nthe amendments and try to conclude this bill by the end of business \ntomorrow, Wednesday night.\n  I thank the Chair, and in the absence of any other Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Dr. Donoso is a world renowned ophthalmologist, a \nnative son of the State of Utah, and a proud graduate of the University \nof Utah School of Medicine.\n  Recently, Dr. Donoso was honored by the Queens Medical Center at the \nUniversity of Nottingham, one of the United Kingdom's most prestigious \nacademic medical centers. There they established the Larry A. Donoso \nEye Research Laboratory in recognition of his long collaboration in the \nestablishment of the new laboratory, and his efforts to advance eye \ntreatment for patients around the world. He is the first American to be \nso honored by the Queens Medical Center. Both the city of Philadelphia \nand the Senate of the State of Pennsylvania have acknowledged the \nsignificance of this award, and the breadth of his contributions to the \nfield of ophthalmology.\n  Dr. Donoso is being lauded for his vast contributions as a premier \nresearch scientist, compassionate medical doctor, and extraordinary \nteacher. Having graduated from East High School in Salt Lake City, Dr. \nDonoso received his bachelors degree from the University of Utah in \n1965. The School of Medicine conferred his Ph.D. in 1971 and his \nmedical degree in 1973. He also went on to complete his clinical \nresidency training in ophthalmology at Utah before joining the faculty \nof the Wills Eye Hospital in Pennsylvania.\n  Dr. Larry Donoso, or ``LD'' as his friends affectionately call him, \nis an extraordinary eye researcher who has worked tirelessly over the \nlast 30 years to advance the reputation of Wills Eye Hospital among the \ninternational medical community. His career accomplishments have been \nhonored by the city of Philadelphia, the Senate of the State of \nPennsylvania, and the Queens Medical Center at the University of \nNottingham in England. I wanted my colleagues to be aware of these \noutstanding achievements, which, I hope, will serve as inspiration to \nus all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8656-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, it is an honor to serve the people of \nMissouri and this great country. One of the privileges I have as a \nMissouri Senator is to recognize those who have gone above and beyond \nthe call of duty in service to the State of Missouri. For 25 years, \nCheryl Huff, of Mexico, MO, has served faithfully the people of \nMissouri through the Division of Youth Services.\n  Within the Missouri Department of Social Services, the Division of \nYouth Services is the State agency responsible for the care and \ntreatment of youth, committed to its custody by one of Missouri's 45 \njuvenile courts. This State agency operates treatment programs ranging \nfrom nonresidential day treatment centers to secure residential \ninstitutions.\n  The 1889 establishment of the Training School for Boys in Boonville \nand the Training School for Girls in Chillicothe marked the foundation \nof the division of youth services. It was at the Training School for \nBoys in Boonville, a quarter of a century ago, that Cheryl began her \nservice. She is widely respected by peers for her sound judgement and \npersonal integrity. During her tenure, Cheryl has distinguished herself \namong her colleagues as an efficient and effective caretaker of \nMissouri's most precious resource--its children.\n  The recognition of Cheryl for her commitment to Missouri's children \nsimply mirrors her dedication to her own family. While the \naccomplishments of a successful career are important to her, those who \nknow Cheryl would be the first to point out that her career is \nsecondary to her love of family. The lasting legacy of Cheryl's life is \napparent in the time, energy, and resources she has invested in her \nchildren. She exemplifies the highest commitment to relentless \ndedication and sacrifice.\n  Cheryl, the grateful State of Missouri offers you these simple words \nof appreciation: Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8656-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8656-5", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8656-S8657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT RELATIVE TO TAX BENEFITS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED \n              DURING THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE--PM 60\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate on August 11, 1997, received a message from \nthe President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly, pursuant to Public Law 93-344 as \namended, to the Committee on the Budget and to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                      Washington, August 11, 1997.\n     Hon.

The Congress shall have power to enforce this \n     article by appropriate legislation.''; and\n       Whereas, by proclamation of Federal Secretary of State \n     Hamilton Fish, dated March 30, 1870 (16 Stat. 1131-2), this \n     proposed amendment to the United States Constitution was \n     officially declared to have been duly ratified by the \n     legislatures of the constitutionally-required margin of at \n     least three-fourths (\\3/4\\) of the several states, there \n     being at the time 37 states in the Union; and\n       Whereas, after Amendment 15 had made its way into our \n     Nation's highest law in early 1870, the legislatures of five \n     other states which had been in the Union prior to its \n     adoption--but which, like Tennessee, had not approved the \n     amendment--post-ratified it, many years after 1870, as \n     follows:\n       Delaware in 1901 (Senate Joint Resolution No. 13);\n       Oregon in 1959 (Senate Joint Resolution No. 7);\n       California in 1962 (Senate Joint Resolution No. 9);\n       Maryland in 1973 (Senate Joint Resolution No. 56);\n       Kentucky in 1976 (House [Joint] Resolution No. 75); and\n       Whereas, for the past 21 years, Tennessee has stood alone \n     as the only State in the Union, both well before Amendment 15 \n     was proposed and long after it was adopted, whose legislature \n     has never placed its own unique imprimatur upon these \n     fundamental two sentences of the United States Constitution; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the One \n     Hundredth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the \n     Senate concurring, That Amendment 15 to the United States \n     Constitution, quoted above, is hereby post-ratified by the \n     Tennessee General Assembly, be it further\n       Resolved, That House Joint Resolution No. 98 (Act ``Number \n     LXXX'') of the Thirty-Sixth General Assembly of the State of \n     Tennessee, in which Amendment 15 was rejected by the \n     Tennessee House of Representatives and by the Tennessee \n     Senate, be hereby revoked, repealed, and utterly rescinded, \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That a properly inscribed copy of this Resolution \n     be transmitted by the Secretary of State of Tennessee to the \n     Archivist of the United States, Washington, D.C., in \n     compliance with Pub.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 19\n\n       Whereas, the military and the defense industry provide \n     California with highly skilled professionals working in the \n     leading edge of technology, and generate jobs that complement \n     and support the state's industrial and commercial leadership \n     in aerospace, advanced computing, and telecommunications \n     technology; and\n       Whereas, since the inception of the Base Realignment and \n     Closure Commission in 1988, 29 military installations have \n     been closed or severely realigned in the State of California, \n     resulting in the loss of half a million direct and indirect \n     defense jobs; and\n       Whereas, there is strong indication that another base \n     realignment and closure is in the offing and without strong \n     vigilance to retain the remaining installations, California \n     could experience additional closures and realignments; and\n       Whereas, during the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure, the \n     Joint Cross Service Groups on Laboratories and Test and \n     Evaluation, both under the sponsorship of the Office of the \n     Secretary of Defense, recommended that military services \n     consider consolidating a major portion of aircraft and air-\n     launched weapons research, development, testing, evaluation, \n     and training installations in the southwest United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Southwest Defense Complex has a network of \n     existing military installations that are already \n     electronically linked and cooperatively managed; and\n       Whereas, the Southwest Defense Complex would consist of \n     facilities in California, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, and \n     Utah; and\n       Whereas, the Southwest Defense Complex is the only area in \n     the United States where research, development, testing, \n     evaluation, and training using advanced technology can be \n     conducted in a realistic, high fidelity environment with \n     minimal impact upon the general public; and\n       Whereas, this unique southwestern area, with ideal weather \n     for testing and training operations, consists of mostly \n     Department of Defense and government lands that are largely \n     free of commercial airline routes, electromagnetic \n     interference, and high population density; and\n       Whereas, this complex of nearly contiguous facilities has \n     the technical assets--scientific and engineering work force, \n     laboratories, test facilities, ranges, land and airspace--\n     plus the track record of cooperation to allow it to assume \n     the principal Department of Defense role in developing and \n     testing complex air warfare systems; and\n       Whereas, the Southwest Defense Alliance, consisting of a \n     group of local elected officials, representatives from \n     private industry, chambers of commerce, economic development \n     associations, base retention groups, and community leaders, \n     is dedicated to supporting and enhancing the Southwest \n     Defense Complex; and\n       Whereas, the California Legislature unanimously expressed \n     support in 1994 for the Southwest Defense Complex, by \n     enacting a joint resolution; and\n       Whereas, it would be desirable to reaffirm the California \n     Legislature's support for the Southwest Defense Complex, to \n     reduce the chances of additional base closures in California: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully\n\n[[Page S8665]]\n\n     memorializes the President and the Congress of the United \n     States to endorse and support the Southwest Defense Complex, \n     and the efforts of the Southwest Defense Alliance in \n     furtherance of the Southwest Defense Complex; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-209. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of New Hampshire; to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works.\n\n                        House Joint Resolution 5\n\n       Whereas, the state of New Hampshire has continued to \n     decrease air pollution emissions in accordance with the \n     federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; and\n       Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) has continued to fund scientific air pollution research \n     which has shown that some of the scientific assumptions \n     behind the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are \n     invalid; and\n       Whereas, certain regions of the country, including the \n     state of New Hampshire, are required to make considerable \n     additional expenditures on scientifically obsolete or \n     ineffective air pollution controls mandated by the federal \n     Clean Air Act; and\n       Whereas, the federal Clean Air Act does not allow the EPA \n     to authorize states to substitute more cost effective air \n     pollution control strategies for scientifically obsolete or \n     ineffective air pollution control strategies, thereby \n     stifling innovation; and\n       Whereas, certain regions of the country, including the \n     state of New Hampshire, are currently victims of air \n     pollution emitted upwind from the region, but are being held \n     responsible for that pollution by the federal Clean Air Act; \n     and\n       Whereas, the federal Clean Air Act requires the EPA to \n     adopt standards which protect public health with an adequate \n     margin of safety, despite recent scientific research which \n     indicates that no safe level exists, providing opponents of \n     air pollution control expenditures with unnecessary \n     opportunities to question the implementation of the Clean Air \n     Act; and\n       Whereas, the EPA is in the process of mandating low-\n     emission vehicle requirements for new automobiles which \n     needlessly mix cost-effective stricter nitrogen oxide \n     emission standards with scientifically obsolete requirements \n     for stricter hydrocarbon emission standards; and\n       Whereas, the EPA in its procedures for assessing state \n     implementation plans for air pollution control gives little \n     or no credit for voluntary pollution reductions already in \n     place that are not mandated by law, and gives excessive \n     credit for promises of future mandatory control measures; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives in \n     General Court convened: That the federal Clean Air Act should \n     be amended to require the EPA to permit states to substitute \n     more effective air pollution control strategies for less \n     effective strategies mandated by the federal Clean Air Act, \n     so that states will be allowed to devise cost-effective \n     strategies that will produce more air pollution improvement \n     for less cost; and\n       That the federal Clean Air Act should be amended so that \n     regions which are victims of windborne air pollution are not \n     held responsible, and if polluted air gets cleaner as it \n     passes over a region of a non-attainment area, that region \n     should not be required to observe the additional air \n     pollution control requirements for non-attainment areas, and \n     the EPA should instead look to upwind polluters to apply \n     additional controls; and\n       That the federal Clean Air Act should be amended to promote \n     reductions in ground level ozone through nitrogen oxide \n     emission reductions from power plants, industrial boilers, \n     new automobiles, and new trucks, rather than further reducing \n     hydrocarbon emissions from existing gasoline vehicles or \n     industrial solvents; and\n       That the federal Clean Air Act should be amended so that \n     the EPA may more justifiably set air quality standards at a \n     level other than zero, which improve over time at a steady \n     rate, based on scientific analysis of public health damage, \n     ecological damage, and cost of control; and\n       That the EPA should revise its policies regarding motor \n     vehicle emissions, including low-emission vehicle standards, \n     to concentrate on nitrogen oxide emission reductions, not \n     hydrocarbon emission reductions; and\n       That the EPA should revise its policies regarding state \n     implementation plans for air pollution control so that states \n     shall be given full credit in their state emission \n     inventories for non-mandatory pollution reductions which can \n     reasonably be expected to occur or to remain in place, \n     including low-emission vehicles already registered in the \n     state; and\n       That the EPA should act on its responsibility to forcefully \n     communicate the results of its ongoing scientific research to \n     the United States Congress and encourage Congress to amend \n     the Clean Air Act so as to bring it in line with current \n     research; and\n       That the EPA should promptly amend its own policies so as \n     to bring them in line with current research; and\n       That the copies of this resolution be sent by the house \n     clerk to the President of the United States, the President of \n     the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the chairpersons of committees of \n     the United States Congress having jurisdiction over the Clean \n     Air Act, the Administrator of the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency, and each member of the New Hampshire \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-210.

and\n       Whereas, the proposed rail route from California to Idaho \n     will involve the shipments passing through the Feather River \n     Canyon where trains have derailed 28 times in 16 years; and\n       Whereas, the combined shipments of spent nuclear fuel rods \n     will involve approximately one-half ton of uranium and small \n     amounts of plutonium; and\n       Whereas, the planned shipments of spent nuclear fuel rods \n     will be made by private foreign flag ships; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Energy intends to \n     ship the spent nuclear fuel rods to the Concord Naval Weapons \n     Station in a total of 38 20-ton steel casks purportedly able \n     to withstand airdrops from 200 feet and immersion in water \n     depths of 650 feet; and\n       Whereas, the policy of bringing spent fuel from foreign \n     countries to the United States was adopted as a part of the \n     Atoms for Peace program enacted 50 years ago, when 41 \n     countries agreed not to make nuclear weapons in exchange for \n     enriched uranium to use in research reactors; and\n       Whereas, under the Atoms for Peace program, the United \n     States agreed to take the used fuel to relieve foreign \n     countries of problems with disposal and ease fears about \n     terrorists abroad using the fuel to make bombs; and\n       Whereas, shipments of similar nuclear fuel rods began on \n     the east coast of the United States with no public notice as \n     early as 1958, with a total of 150 shipments through the \n     Charleston Naval Weapons Station in South Carolina; and\n       Whereas, the Concord Naval Weapons Station has been the \n     secret west coast shipping point for nuclear bombs and \n     missiles since the beginning of the Cold War; and\n       Whereas, the proposed route for the shipments to the \n     Concord Naval Weapons Station runs through the San Francisco \n     Bay area, placing over 6.5 million residents of California's \n     second largest metropolis in harm's way; and\n       Whereas, portions of the San Francisco Bay area are subject \n     to intense shaking amplification and are still recovering \n     from major damage caused by the 1989 Lorna Prieta earthquake; \n     and\n       Whereas, the planned shipments will result in unreimbursed \n     local government expenditures for enhanced emergency and \n     hazardous materials response systems; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Energy has \n     inadequately addressed potential environmental and safety \n     impacts in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the \n     shipment project, failed to fully inform local communities in \n     California of the catastrophic impacts of a potential \n     shipment accident, and failed to adequately document the \n     necessity of using the Concord station rather than \n     alternative shipping points, such as the naval base at \n     Bremerton, Washington; and\n       Whereas, if the steel casks containing the spent nuclear \n     fuel rods are breached, there is no assurance that persons, \n     land, and waters will not be exposed to dangerous radioactive \n     materials; and\n       Whereas, this state is committed foremost to protecting the \n     health and safety of its people and environment; and\n       Whereas, on behalf of, and in addition to, local government \n     officials in the nine-county San Francisco Bay area, \n     including those with the City and County of San Francisco, \n     the County of Contra Costa, the City of Concord, the San \n     Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, and \n     the Association of Bay Area Governments, 11 Members of the \n     Assembly have requested that the state Attorney General sue \n     the United States Department of Energy for a federal court \n     injunction to halt the shipments through the San Francisco \n     Bay region to Concord: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the President and Congress of the \n     United States to call upon the Department of Energy to halt \n     indefinitely the five planned shipments of spent nuclear fuel \n     rods through the San Francisco Bay to the Concord Naval \n     Weapons Station for land transport to Idaho;

This \n     program will benefit the entire nation by providing \n     consistent mobility, connectivity, and economic benefit for \n     all states;\n       (2) Recognizes states' diversity and provides the \n     flexibility to tailor transportation solutions to their \n     particular circumstances by reaffirming ISTEA planning \n     processes, returning decision-making to the state and local \n     levels, and eliminating federal mandates;\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Resolved, That this General Assembly urges Congress to \n     continue, as an integral component of STEP 21, the local \n     Metropolitan Planning Organizations that have assured local \n     governments a meaningful role in setting transportation \n     priorities and policies, be it further\n       Resolved, That this General Assembly memorializes each \n     member of the U.S. Congress from Tennessee to utilize the \n     full measure of his or her influence to effect the enactment \n     of ``The ISTEA Integrity Restoration Act'' or STEP 21 \n     legislation, and especially the provision guaranteeing all \n     states a ninety-five percent (95%) return on their total \n     contributions to the Federal Highway Trust Fund, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That this General Assembly recognizes the \n     important role that counties perform in maintaining rural \n     bridges and roads across the State of Tennessee and therefore \n     pledges, that in the event Congress enacts STEP 21 \n     legislation, resulting in an increase in federal highway \n     funding for the State of Tennessee, the State should share a \n     portion of such increased funding with the local governments \n     who perform this vital task, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives is directed to transmit a certified copy of \n     this resolution to the Honorable Bill Clinton, President of \n     the United States; the President and the Secertary of the \n     U.S. Senate; the Speaker and the Clerk of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives; and to each member of the Tennessee \n     delegation to the U.S. Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-216.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to take into \naccount newly developed renewable energy-based fuels and to equalize \nalternative fuel vehicle acquisition incentives to increase the \nflexibility of controlled fleet owners and operators, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S8669]]\n\n              THE BIODIESEL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, along with \nSenators Johnson, Wellstone, and Grassley, the Biodiesel Energy \nDevelopment Act of 1997. This legislation is an important step in \nhelping achieve a very important goal of this Nation--that of shifting \nthe focus of national energy demand away from imported oil toward \nrenewable or domestically produced energy sources, as stated in the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992, also known as EPACT.\n  To reach its goal, which is to replace 10 percent of petroleum by the \nyear 2000 and 30 percent by the year 2010 with alternative fuels, EPACT \nrequires Federal and State government fleets, and a limited number of \nprivate fleets, to purchase alternative-fueled vehicles [AFV's].\n  Dedicated AFV's are vehicles that can only run on alternative fuels. \nNatural gas vehicles and electric vehicles are two of the most common \nAFV's. Flexible fueled vehicles [FFV's] are those vehicles which can \nrun on alternative fuels, such as methanol and ethanol, petroleum \nfuels, or a combination of the two.\n  Current EPACT mandates, incentives, and grants exclude biodiesel fuel \nblends from being designated as an alternative fuel or from it being an \noption for controlled fleet owners and operators. EPACT offers little \nincentive for the use of heavier duty FFV's where biodiesel would be \nmost appropriate, as fleets may obtain credit for heavier duty FFV's \nonly after they have fulfilled their light duty AFV purchase \nrequirements. In addition, EPACT does not allow the conversion and \nwarranty of existing vehicles to FFV standards when they are overhauled \nor rebuilt. Mr. President, the exclusion of biodiesel as an alternative \nfuel only impedes the ability of the fleets to meet EPACT mandates.\n  Let me spell out some of the benefits that biodiesel provides. \nBiodiesel is a cleaner burning fuel that is made from natural, \nrenewable sources such as vegetable oils, and is domestically produced. \nFrom these facts alone it is evident that the use of biodiesel can \nreduce the United States' dependence upon imported oil.\n  Biodiesel also helps achieve a stated goal of this administration, \nwhich is to protect the environment by reducing emissions that may \ndamage the ozone layer and contribute to the greenhouse effect. \nBiodiesel does just that. When used in a 20-percent blend with \npetroleum diesel, biodiesel results in a significant reduction in \nvisible smoke and odor and reduces particulate matter by as much as 14 \npercent. When used in combination with an oxidation catalyst, biodiesel \nreduces particulate matter by 45 percent, carbon monoxide emissions by \n41 percent, and total hydrocarbons by 65 percent.\n  Mr. President, biodiesel does all of this without forcing expensive \nengine modifications, reducing the payload capacity of vehicles, or \nreducing the range of vehicles. Biodiesel performs similarly to \npetroleum diesel in terms of torque, horsepower, and miles per gallon. \nIn short, biodiesel performs just as well as petroleum diesel, and yet \nprovides users with all of the benefits of alternative fuels.\n  In addition, once the biodiesel market takes off, it is estimated \nthat it could add more than $11 billion to the States that grow oilseed \ncrops. Biodiesel is also biodegradable and nontoxic, resulting in \nlittle to no environmental threat.\n  The Biodiesel Energy Development Act would solve many of the problems \nin EPACT, and help fleets reach EPACT's goals. This legislation would \ndesignate a biodiesel-petroleum diesel blend as an alternative fuel; \nequalize incentives between AFV's and alternative fuels; equalize \nincentives between different types of AFV's; increase the flexibility \nof EPACT fleet owners and operators in meeting existing mandated AFV \npurchase requirements; and provide an incentive-based solution \nregarding flexible-fuel use in AFV's.\n  Mr. President, it is time we enabled the fleets that are mandated by \nEPACT to purchase AFV's with the option of using biodiesel fuel. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and \nhonor an event that has long been a source of great civic pride for \nmany of us in Tennessee: the Smithville Fiddlers' Jamboree and Crafts \nFestival.\n  A spectacular 2-day event held annually over the Fourth of July \nholiday, the Smithville Fiddlers' Jamboree is dedicated to the \nfurtherance and preservation of old-time Appalachian country music, \ndance, and authentic Appalachian art and culture. The jamboree and I go \na long way back, and yet I never cease to be amazed by the hospitality, \nthe fellowship, the crafts, and, of course, the outstanding music.\n  This past Fourth of July weekend marked the 26th anniversary of the \njamboree. It all began back on July 1, 1972, when musicians from 16 \nstates delighted an audience of 8,000 people. While that in itself was \nquite an accomplishment, the event's founders were not content to stop \nthere. By comparison, this year's event drew a record crowd of 125,000 \nand featured more than 600 contestants from 42 States and 4 foreign \ncountries. More than 300 artisans and craftsmen were on hand to sell \nand display authentic pioneer and contemporary Appalachian crafts.\n  These days, the Smithville Fiddlers' Jamboree is broadcast on \ntelevision worldwide and has been featured in National Geographic \nTraveler, Southern Living, and several other national publications. The \nJamboree has been named one of the top 100 tourist events in North \nAmerica, according to a list compiled by the American Bus Association. \nThe event was selected as a ``Top 20 Tourist Favorite'' by the \nSoutheast Tourism Society, which includes the States of Tennessee, \nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, \nLouisiana, Alabama, and Virginia. Earlier this year, the Tennessee \nGeneral Assembly passed a resolution designating the Smithville \nFiddlers' Jamboree and Crafts Festival as the official jamboree and \ncrafts festival of the State of Tennessee.\n  Without a doubt, knowledge of the Smithville Jamboree's accomplished \nmusicians, inspiring music, skilled artisans, and authentic crafts has \nnow reached the four corners of the globe, and I applaud the \norganizers, committees, volunteers, and the people of Smithville and \nDeKalb County, TN, for their unique and substantial contribution to the \nrich tradition of Appalachian art and culture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8671-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8671-S8672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. ROBERT W. DAY\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer \nResearch Center recently marked the end of an era with the retirement \nof its visionary president and director, Dr. Robert W. Day.\n  In 1981, Dr. Day took over leadership of the center from its founding \ndirector, Dr. Bill Hutchinson. It was a time of painful transition for \nthe young research facility. In Dr. Day, the center had a new leader \nwho possessed the administrative skills, broad scientific perspective, \nambitious vision and fiery passion needed to guide the center through \nthis critical period. During Dr. Day's 16 year tenure, the center \ntransformed from a local medical facility to one of the world's most \nrespected cancer research facilities.\n  There are many legacies of Dr. Day's remarkable leadership. Perhaps \nthe most visible is the magnificent South Lake Union research facility. \nOther prominent reminders are the many biotechnology firms that have \nbeen spawned by research conducted at the Hutchinson Center.\n  Among Dr. Day's most important legacies are his contributions to \ncancer policy. He is credited with pioneering the integration of public \nhealth and cancer research, which had primarily focused on basic and \nclinical research. He played a key role in launching and expanding the \npreventive program at the Centers for Disease Control. He is largely \nresponsible for the Hutchinson Center being awarded the Nation's first \ncancer prevention research unit. Public education was also an important \npriority for Dr. Day, and he undertook the strengthening of the Cancer \nInformation Service.\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\n  Because of his tremendous experience, Dr. Day has been widely sought \nout to fill advisory roles. In addition to his duties at Fred \nHutchinson, Dr. Day has served on a number of influential national \nboards, including the National Cancer Advisory Board, the President's \nCancer Advisory Council and countless peer-review committees. He is \nalso a past president of the national Coalition for Cancer Research and \nof the American Association of Cancer Institutes.\n  Dr. Day has become a much respected figure on Capitol Hill. I \nappreciate the insight he has given me on legislative matters and his \nrole in educating Members of this body on the issues surrounding cancer \nresearch. His influence and respect in the business community has \nhelped to make the business community an important partner in cancer \nresearch efforts.\n  Dr. Day is regarded as not only an outstanding administrator and \nscientist, but as an outstanding human being. There can be no doubt \nthat his passion for fighting cancer comes from the fact that he is a \nman who genuinely cares about people.\n  Dr. Day's well-deserved retirement will leave him time to devote to \nother personal interests. However, even in retirement he will continue \nto lend his considerable talent as a senior adviser to the center.\n  While the war against cancer has yet to be won, thanks to Dr. Day's \nremarkable efforts, much progress has been made. He has my lasting \nappreciation for his passionate leadership and his unending faith that \none day we will win the battle against this terrible disease. He will \ncontinue to be an inspiration to those who seek to make his vision a \nreality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8671-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BRAVERY IN YACOLT, WA\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to recognize an Explorer \nScout whose bravery and quick thinking saved the life of his friend. On \nJuly 3, 1997, a group of friends went swimming near Sunset Falls in \nYacolt, WA. Recent flooding had altered the depth of the water where \nthe friends chose to go diving. Not recognizing the change in depth, \nKade Vance dove from a rock into the natural pool below. Moments later, \nhe surfaced in a dead man's float, bleeding from his head. Robby \nLoomis, a trained Explorer Scout, immediately swam to his friend's aid \nand turned him on his back to allow him to breathe. Robby conversed \nwith Kade, making sure he remained conscious. Kade indicated he could \nnot feel his legs and that his strength was quickly deteriorating.\n  For more than 40 minutes, Robby kept Kade afloat in water that was \nonly 60 degrees. Despite his dropping temperature and diminishing \nstrength, Robby helped move Kade closer to shore where the emergency \nmedical team could reach them. Robby used his own body as a shield to \nprotect his injured friend from further damage by rocks near the \nshoreline. As a result of Robby Loomis' courageous efforts, and due to \nhis Explorer Scout training, Kade Vance's life was saved. I would like \nto recognize the bravery and heroism displayed by Robby Loomis and \ncongratulate him on his valiant efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8672-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLARE JARECKI\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of a remarkable person from my home State of Michigan, Mr. \nClare Jarecki. Clare will be receiving the 1997 Reflection Award, which \nis given each year by Aquinas College to an individual who reflects the \nvalues Aquinas College seeks to impart to its students--commitment, \nvision, service, loyalty, integrity, and trust.\n  Clare has been a business and community leader in Grand Rapids, MI, \nfor more than 50 years. He served as president and chairman of the \nboard of Jarecki Corp., which was formed by the merger of Jarecki \nProducts, Inc., and Nichols & Cox Lumber Co. Jarecki Corp. grew to be \nextremely successful, and was once the largest independent tool and die \nmanufacturer in the world.\n  The Grand Rapids area contributed greatly to Clare Jarecki's success, \nand he chose to become involved with a number of organizations \ndedicated to improving the welfare of the people of Grand Rapids. He \nhas served on the boards of directors of organizations like the YMCA, \nthe Community Chest, the Rehabilitation League and the Greater Grand \nRapids Chamber of Commerce, as well as a trustee of Blodgett Memorial \nHospital. He was instrumental in the creation of U.S. 131, the north-\nsouth expressway, which contributed greatly to the growth and \ndevelopment of Grand Rapids and the surrounding area. Clare has been \nhonored and recognized by both Ferris State University and Michigan \nState University as a distinguished alumnus.\n  Throughout his life, Clare Jarecki has endeavored to make his \ncommunity a better place. In doing so, he embodies the values for which \nthe Reflection Award is conferred. Mr. President, I ask that you, along \nwith my colleagues, join with me in sending congratulations and best \nwishes to Clare Jarecki on this important occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8672-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8672-S8673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n  The text of S. 910, the bill to authorize appropriations for carrying \nout the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 for fiscal years 1998 \nand 1999, and for other purposes, as passed by the Senate on July 31, \n1997, is as follows:\n\n                                 S. 910\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am submitting, along with \nSenators Kennedy, DeWine, and Wellstone, a Senate resolution to \ncongratulate the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on its 50th \nanniversary.\n  The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service [FMCS] was created in \n1947, as an independent agency, by the Labor-Management Relations Act \n[Taft-Hartley]. FMCS was established by Congress to resolve collective \nbargaining disputes which threaten the free flow of commerce and to \npromote the development of sound and stable labor-management relations.\n  The primary focus of the agency's work is on labor-management \nrelations, mediating contract negotiation disputes between companies \nand the unions representing their employees, and providing training in \ncooperative processes to help build better labor-management relations. \nFMCS also was authorized under the Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 to \nshare its expertise in all aspects of mediation, facilitation, and \nconflict resolution with Federal, State, and local governmental bodies \nand agencies. In addition to dispute mediation services, FMCS provides \npreventive mediation services, administers a grants program which \nprovides funding for the creation and operation of joint labor-\nmanagement committees, and also provides an arbitration service, when \ndisputes arise between the parties over the interpretation of their \ncollective bargaining agreement.\n  For 50 years, the men and women of the FMCS have worked tirelessly, \nand successfully, to accomplish the mission of the Agency, the \npromotion of ``sound and stable industrial peace and the advancement of \nthe general welfare, health and safety of the Nation.* * *'' Our \nresolution recognizes, and commends, the Federal Mediation and \nConciliation Service for its 50 years of dedicated service to the \nNation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 117) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 117\n\n       Whereas the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service \n     (referred to in this resolution as the ``FMCS'') was created \n     as an independent agency of the United States by the Labor-\n     Management Relations Act of 1947;\n       Whereas for 50 years, the FMCS has been instrumental in \n     promoting the United States policy that ``sound and stable \n     industrial peace and the advancement of the general welfare, \n     health, and safety of the Nation and of the best interest of \n     employers and employees can most satisfactorily be secured \n     through settlement of issues between employers and employees \n     through the processes of collective bargaining between \n     employers and representatives of their employees'';\n       Whereas the FMCS has provided mediation services to labor \n     and management by assisting them to settle disputes and reach \n     agreement in collective bargaining negotiations, thereby \n     helping to prevent or minimize work stoppages that disrupt \n     the free flow of commerce and to promote sound and stable \n     labor-management relations;\n       Whereas the FMCS has provided arbitration services by \n     administering a roster of qualified, private arbitrators to \n     resolve disputes arising under collective bargaining \n     agreements, thereby minimizing disruptions to commerce and \n     preserving labor-management peace;\n       Whereas the FMCS has encouraged joint initiatives designed \n     to assist employers and the representatives of their \n     employees explore better ways to manage differences and to \n     work together for mutual benefit and has awarded grants to \n     promote labor-management cooperation and to encourage \n     innovative workplace practices, thereby improving economic \n     performance and enhancing economic development, employment \n     security, and organizational effectiveness;\n       Whereas the FMCS has provided dispute resolution services \n     to government agencies as an alternative to costly litigation \n     or formal rulemaking, thereby enabling less adversarial and \n     more participative approaches to governing;\n       Whereas the FMCS has helped management, labor, and \n     government leaders from many nations throughout the world to \n     establish sound industrial relations and conflict resolution \n     systems and practices, thereby promoting sound economic \n     development and democratic principles; and\n       Whereas the FMCS has developed the art, science, and \n     practice of conflict resolution as a means to improve the \n     lives of the working men and women of this Nation and the \n     relationships between labor and management and between others \n     in our society, to sustain democratic institutions, and to \n     strengthen the American economy, thereby making an important \n     contribution to our Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service \n     for 50 years of dedicated and important service to the \n     Nation; and\n       (2) congratulates the FMCS as it commemorates its fiftieth \n     anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/02/senate-section/article/S8674-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONDITIONAL SEQUENTIAL REFERRAL--H.R. 1658\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
