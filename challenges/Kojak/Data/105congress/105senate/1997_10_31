Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 2646, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2646) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to allow tax-free expenditures from education individual \n     retirement accounts for elementary and secondary school \n     expenses, to increase the maximum annual amount of \n     contributions to such accounts, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 10:30 a.m. will be divided \nbetween the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] and the minority \nleader, or his designee.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of H.R. 2646, the A-\nplus education bill. What has become known as the A-plus account, or \neducation savings account, is a unique instrument that is being \ndesigned to help American families across the land to deal with \neducation deficiencies, particularly in grades K-12, kindergarten \nthrough high school, although the account may be kept intact and used \nfor higher education if that is the desire of the family.\n  Simply put, a family could save up to $2,500 every year from the \nchild's birth in a savings account much like an IRA that most Americans \nhave come to understand, a similar instrument. These are after-tax \ndollars. The interest that would build up each succeeding year would \nnot be taxed if the proceeds of the account are used for virtually any \neducational purpose. So it becomes a tool that empowers parents to deal \nwith particular or peculiar deficiencies of the child.\n  As a result, my own view is that the value of these dollars could be \nas much as three to five times a typical public dollar being spent \nbecause the dollar is being directed at the unique deficiency.\n  Let's say, for example, the child had a learning disability, or \ndyslexia, that required special attention. The dollars could be put \nright on that problem. Or perhaps the child had a math deficiency and \nit required a tutor, or there was a transportation problem to deal with \nan after-school program, or a learning disability of some form. All of \nthese particular problems, broad dollars cannot necessarily address, \nbut these savings accounts can. They can go right to the deficiency.\n  A unique feature of the savings account is that the account can \nreceive contributions from sponsors. When you do that, the imagination \nbegins to work at the different kinds of things that could happen to \nhelp build this account up for this child. A corporation, an employer, \ncould be a contributor to\n\n[[Page S11504]]\n\nthese accounts. You can envision matching circumstances, where an \nemployer would say I'll put so much in your children's account if \nyou'll match it. You can imagine a church becoming involved in these \ntypes of accounts. I can see a community--recently in Atlanta we lost a \nlaw enforcement officer, and people are often trying to find a way to \nhelp the remaining family. I can see communities stepping forward in \nthis case and establishing an account for the surviving children. So \ncommunity, employers, extended family, brothers, uncles, neighbors, \ngrandparents--all of these individuals could become sponsors of these \nchildren's accounts.\n  As a result, a large infusion of enrichment will occur to education \nin America, one of the largest in 10 years--billions of dollars. The \nJoint Committee on Taxation has advised us that 14 million families \nwill make use of these accounts--14 million families. A quick \nestimation there shows you somewhere around 20 million-plus children, \napproaching half of children in America's schools, will be \nbeneficiaries to some degree of these accounts.\n  It baffles me that some in the professional system, the National \nEducation Association, oppose this. They want to believe and others to \nthink that--I think the line is that it only will help wealthy people \nand that it will only support religious schools. Both assertions are \nutterly false.\n  I have been stunned by an organization of this character being so \nmisleading about a matter of public policy. You would think that an \norganization associated with schooling and role modeling for young \npeople could do a little better job of being candid and straightforward \nabout their opposition. It has had some effect, because many people \nthink the savings account is the equivalent of a voucher. A voucher--\nwhich I support; they don't--but a voucher is the redistribution of \npublic money. In other words, the money raised from the public for \ntaxes, property taxes or the like, is given to the family and they can \nmove it to any point they would like. That is a voucher. This is a \nsavings account. This is not public money. This is private after-tax \nmoney. And we are not taxing the buildup.\n  Under their definition of public money, I guess the capital gains tax \nreduction would be a voucher because we have left money in someone's \nchecking account and they can use it some way they choose. But, in any \nevent, the allegation is that it is for the wealthy and that it \nsupports religious schools.\n  Here are the facts. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, of \nthe 14 million families that will use these accounts, 10.8 million of \nthem will be in families whose children are in public schools; 70 \npercent of the funds generated, this enrichment, this additional effort \nand energy coming behind our school system, private and voluntary, will \ngo to support public schools--70 percent--and 30 percent to private \nschools.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 70 percent of all these \nfunds will go to support children and families earning $75,000 or less. \nIt is means tested. It is not for the wealthy. It has sponsors, so that \nwe can help those who have a tough time organizing the accounts, and \nthe principal beneficiary will be the public school system of America \nand the families in it.\n  Mr. President, I yield at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, let me first congratulate my friend and \ncolleague on the thoughtfulness of his remarks and the cogency of his \narguments. If I will now speak in opposition, it is first and foremost \na procedural opposition and jurisdictional one, having to do with bills \nsent from the House of Representatives and held at the desk and not \nreferred to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And also having to do with the season of the year.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the general remarks.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in an op-ed article in the New York \nTimes on Tuesday, Richard Leone, who is the president of the 20th \nCentury Fund, an eminent New York City institution, remarked, ``Last \nweek, the House of Representatives took time out from beating up on the \nInternal Revenue Service to approve a fresh tax loophole.''\n  I have had occasion to comment that on July 31, when we voted 92 to 8 \nto approve an 820-page addition to the Internal Revenue Code, the only \ncopy of the bill in this Chamber was in the possession of our most \ndistinguished tax counsel, Mr. Giordano.\n  Somewhat furtively, Members would come up and ask if they could just \ncheck whether their provision was in the bill. We might have charged \nfor that service. We did not, in the public spirit of the occasion. But \nit was no way to legislate taxation.\n  In that spirit, I simply want to say that neither, at this time and \nin this manner, ought we to be approving a new provision providing for \nexpansion of IRA's that would cost us $4 billion over 10 years. That is \nin addition to the $38 billion in new IRA's which we passed on July 31. \nThere was an education IRA, and I am happy to say a Roth IRA. Our \ndistinguished chairman is to have the satisfaction, I hope it is, of \nseeing in bank windows around the country, ``Roth IRA available for \npurchase,'' which people will be wise to do.\n  The tax legislation for this session of the 105th Congress is \nconcluded. We will resume next year. I hope we don't resume with too \nmuch energy. It is a fact that we impose upon the Internal Revenue \nService, and upon the citizenry much more than the Internal Revenue \nService, incredibly complex measures which defy assessment in so many \ncases. And we do it while calling for the repeal of the Internal \nRevenue Code and the abolition of the IRS. Well, I can understand the \ncalls that issue from the House of Representatives to abolish the IRS, \nbecause increasingly its task is impossible. But on the other hand, \nthere is something called the Nation and it does require revenues. Even \nif they are reduced to that elemental proposition of delivering the \nmail and defending the coasts, that does require revenues. The choices \nare for us many and we shouldn't complexify them to the point of plain \nbafflement.\n  The President has said he will veto this bill. Our President, in a \nletter to our distinguished majority leader of July 29, thanked the \nmajority leader and, by reference, the others of us in conference on \nthe Tax Relief Act of 1997, for the bipartisan way in which we were \nputting that legislation together, but he did say he would strongly \noppose the measure of the Senator from Georgia. So, accordingly, that \nwas taken out in conference in order for the whole bill to be approved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the President's letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I want to again thank you for working in a \n     productive, bipartisan manner to develop this bipartisan \n     budget agreement. I feel particularly good about the strong \n     education package that is included in the tax bill. As you \n     know, in working out the final agreement, I strongly opposed \n     the Coverdell amendment. I would veto any tax package that \n     would undermine public education by providing tax benefits \n     for private and parochial school expenses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair.\n  One further point. After a very great deal of effort and not \ninconsiderable amount of pain, we have brought the Federal budget into \nbalance. I stood here in 1993, or rather my good friend, now Ambassador \nto China, Mr. Sasser, as chairman of the Budget Committee, stood here \nand I stood there as chairman of the Finance Committee, and in a very \nclose and dramatic moment, we got the required 51 votes to enact what I \nhave since acknowledged to be the largest tax increase in history. But \nit broke the back of the expectation that we could never handle our \nfinances, that interest rates had to be high, the inflation premium \nattendant on the probability that we would end up monetizing the debt \nbecause we couldn't pay for it. Monetizing is a term by which you \ninflate the currency and lower the cost of the debt.\n  We did it, and the deficit has gone down. We have this most \nextraordinary, unprecedented, somewhat difficult-to-comprehend \nsituation of full\n\n[[Page S11505]]\n\nemployment, low inflation, low interest rates, high productivity. \nFuller employment than we ever thought was compatible with the interest \nsituation. We are in a new economic setting, and by March, I would \nthink, the continued revenues to the Treasury would be such that the \ndeficit will have disappeared.\n  We have talked about the deficit, not always in the calmest tones, \nfor a decade now. We finally balanced the budget, and what do we \nsuddenly see? More and more proposals for cutting taxes through one \nform or another, losing revenue so we will get the deficit back again.\n  Mr. President, the time is at hand, if I may say, to use the deficit \nto reduce the debt. We now spend almost as much money on interest \npayments as we do on defense. That is not a proportionate set of values \nof interests, of priorities. We ought to start reducing the debt. For \nevery dollar of public debt that we reduce, we get $1 of private \nsavings, private investment, which, in turn, will produce revenue, and \non one hand, it will reduce costs of interest payments, and on the \nother hand, it will increase revenue. We are short of savings. I know \nthe concern of the Senator from Georgia is savings, but at this moment, \nI would like to say we will take this up next year. This has not been \nreferred to the Finance Committee. It is a House measure held at the \ndesk in the last hours of the first session of the 105th Congress. I \nhope that we will put it off until next year when it will receive a \ngoodly consideration. I can't say I know this to be Chairman Roth's \nintention, but I cannot doubt it is his intention, such as it is his \nmanner in all these issues.\n  But to say again, the measure before us would spend $4 billion over \n10 years to increase the contribution limit for education IRA's from \n$500 to $2,500 per year, provide for tax-free build-up of the earnings \nin such accounts, and tax-free withdrawals for an array of expenses \nrelating to elementary and secondary education. The bill comes to this \nfloor directly from the House; it has not been considered by the \nFinance Committee.\n  With great respect to the sponsor of the bill, the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia, I do not believe the Senate should take up this \nlegislation at this time. It was just 3 months ago that we passed the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which included a net tax cut of $95 \nbillion over 5 years and $275 billion over 10 years. At a cost of $38 \nbillion over 10 years, that act created the education IRA and the Roth \nIRA, and significantly expanded existing IRA's and the tax benefits of \nState-sponsored prepaid college tuition plans. And now, we are asked to \nexpand those recent IRA changes even further.\n  As well intentioned as this legislation is, surely there are many \nother priorities that should take precedence if we are serious about \ndoing something for education. Priorities that have been thoroughly \nconsidered in the Finance Committee and by the full Senate. One such \npriority is the income exclusion for employer-provided educational \nassistance, which is Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. It is \nprobably the single-most successful tax incentive for education we \nhave. In the tax bill that emerged from the Finance Committee in June, \nwe made section 127 permanent and we applied it to graduate school. \nUnfortunately, when the tax bill came back from conference, this \nprovision was limited to a 3-year extension only for undergraduates.\n  Proponents of the pending legislation speak of a crisis in our \nelementary and secondary schools. There is no more compelling \nillustration of this than the state of the infrastructure of these \nschools. During the debate last summer on the tax and spending \nlegislation, Senators Carol Moseley-Braun and Bob Graham brought the \nissue of crumbling schools to our attention, and they continue to be \neager to address it. If we feel we must spend $4 billion, why not spend \nit to insure that schools have heat this winter?\n  There are also tax policy concerns with this bill. First, complexity. \nEven as we hear ever louder calls to scrap the code, we have before us \na bill that would create a maze of rules in attempting to define what \nconstitutes a ``qualified elementary and secondary education expense.'' \nThe bill states that qualified elementary and secondary school expenses \ninclude expenses for tuition, computers, and transportation required \nfor enrollment or attendance at a K-12 institution, and for home \nschooling. There is no further definition. For example, would it be \npossible to withdraw money from these accounts to purchase the family \ncar? I don't know, but you can't find the answer in the text of this \nbill.\n  Under the bill, the ability to contribute funds for elementary and \nsecondary education expenses is proposed to sunset after 2002. However, \nmoney contributed through 2002 could still be used for such expenses. \nIt will be up to the taxpayer to track--and the IRS to examine--when \nfunds were contributed, and whether they can be used for only \nelementary and secondary education, only higher education, or both.\n  The administration estimates that 70 percent of the benefits of the \nbill go to the top 20 percent of income earners, taxpayers with annual \nincomes above $93,000. Tax benefits to taxpayers below that level are \nestimated to be nominal. If the proponents are truly concerned about \nthe middle class, the tax benefits should be targeted there. In order \nto accomplish this, the income limits that apply to this bill would \nhave to be lowered, and the ability to circumvent those limits would \nhave to be prevented.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the good will of the sponsors of this \nlegislation, which we will be happy to consider in the Finance \nCommittee in the next season. But please let us not take up a tax bill, \nof all things, in the final days of this session. This is no time for \nthis tax bill or any other tax bill. But if our friends in the majority \ninsist on going forward, I believe they will find that Senators on this \nside--and doubtless on their side, too--will be ready with amendments \nby the dozens.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I thank the Chair for his courtesy, and I thank my friend.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his generous \nremarks addressed toward me at the initial opening of his statement. I \nappreciate that very much.\n  I now yield up to 4 minutes to my good colleague from Connecticut. I \nwant to just say that he, Senator Lieberman, has been at the forefront \nof education reform for more years than I. He is very dedicated to \nthese proposals, and his support of this measure has been personally \nand publicly appreciated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Georgia for his very kind comments. May I say, with his leadership \non this issue, he has come right to the forefront of the national \nmovement for education reform.\n  Let me say first, briefly, how grateful I am, and I know the Senate \nacross party lines, for the bipartisan leadership for the agreement \nthat was achieved yesterday on scheduling the consideration by the \nSenate of campaign finance reform, which is important in its own right \nbecause of the significance of that effort, but also important because \nit frees us now to approach on the merits issues such as this.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this Education Savings Act for Public \nand Private Schools. It is a bipartisan cosponsorship, as will be clear \nfrom those who speak on behalf of it.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that of all the challenges that we have \nbefore us as we try to make this great country of ours even greater and \nspread the opportunities beyond those who have them best now, the most \nimportant place we can invest is in education, the education of our \nchildren.\n  As we look at the education system in our country, I think we can say \nwith some pride that the system of higher education is really doing \nquite well, but that it is the elementary and secondary schools, in \nmaking sure that our children get a good start on the road to education \nand self-sufficiency, that really need help.\n  There are a lot of good things happening in our public and private \nand faith-based schools, but too many of our kids are still being \neducated in schools that are either in terrible shape physically, \nschools in which\n\n[[Page S11506]]\n\ntheir personal security is threatened by crime in the schools, or \nschools in which there is not adequate teaching and innovation going \non.\n  This measure is a classic attempt to create a partnership between the \nGovernment and families and businesses to help people better educate \ntheir children at the elementary and secondary level. It is a tax \nincentive, a small one. It is like dropping that pebble into the lake, \nand it is going to create ripples out for individual children and for \nour society that I think will be dramatic.\n  I want to make just a few points.\n  This recommendation of these educational savings accounts builds \nexactly on the higher education savings accounts that we adopted just a \nfew months ago with broad bipartisan support. In that case, you could \nput $500 in. The income would be tax free, particularly if you took it \nout for years in higher education. It had income limits in it for means \ntesting, if you will.\n  This proposal of ours takes that idea and simply extends it to K-12 \neducation, with one big change--two, I suppose. One is that you can put \nin not just $500 but $2,500 in and others can invest in those \naccounts--grandparents, uncles, aunts, businesses. I wouldn't be \nsurprised, if this is adopted, that labor unions will begin to \nnegotiate with their employers to put matching contributions into the \nsavings accounts for their kids.\n  The point I want to make is this. A lot of anxiety and opposition has \nbeen expressed about this proposal. It is the same proposal that most \nof us voted for enthusiastically just a few months ago for higher \neducation. So why is it so frightening now and it was so much accepted \nbefore? Why was it middle-class-tax relief then and it is now some sort \nof giveaway to wealthy people?\n\n  I think if you focus on the merits of this, understand what \nindependent analysis has told us that 70 percent of those who will \nbenefit from this will be sending their kids to public school, that it \ncan be used not just for tuition payments but for a broad array of \nsupport services--transportation, home schooling, purchasing a \ncomputer, et cetera.\n  This is the kind of program that dreams are made of, that dreams are \nrealized from. Parents who are working hard trying to find a better way \nfor their children will be able to put a little money in these accounts \nor have some relatives put some money in, or convince the employer to \nput some money in and make it easier for them to take their children \nand put them in the schools where they want them, public or private or \nfaith-based, or give the kids the support they need to get the better \neducation.\n  I think this is a good proposal whose time has come, and I am proud \nto be a cosponsor. I thank Senator Coverdell for his leadership on \nthis, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks of \nthe Senator from Connecticut. He has made excellent points. This has \nalready been passed by 59 votes in the Senate. It has been passed by \nthe House. It is an extension of a proposal that both bodies \noverwhelmingly passed. I am fearful that we are in the midst of a \nfilibuster attempt by special interests to block it, but we are going \nto stay at it, filibuster or not.\n  I now yield up to 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for up \nto 4 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding. And I compliment him \non his leadership, particularly on educational issues.\n  Today, I am here to encourage my colleagues to support legislation \nwhich will open doors of educational opportunities to the parents and \nchildren throughout our Nation. Education savings accounts are a \nsensible step toward solving our education crisis in America by \nallowing families to use their own money--to use their own money--to \npay for their child's education needs.\n  This bill would empower parents with financial tools to provide all \nthe needs they recognize in their children, needs that teachers or \nadministrators cannot be trusted to address in the same way that a \nparent can.\n  These accounts would provide families the ability to save for extra \nfees that they might incur, have to deal with, when they are sending \ntheir children to public schools, fees that may be necessary to pay for \ncomputers or maybe they want to go down and buy their own computer to \nhelp with their child's education, maybe some tutoring needs within the \nfamily, maybe they need to prepare for the SAT.\n  Transportation costs could also be an educational need, particularly \nin rural areas, or maybe special circumstances that would allow a \nfamily to consider some private alternatives as opposed to public \neducation.\n  Handicapped children, for example, I think could really benefit from \nthis because they do have special needs. This encourages the family of \nthe handicapped to meet those special needs and to pay the costs that \nthey may incur and still send them to a public school.\n  This kind of tax relief is especially important for parents who are \nworking two jobs with no extra time to help with homework or those who \ndo not feel adequate in their own knowledge to tutor their children.\n  As parents, I know that my wife and I were the best judges of our \nchildren's needs, and I am proud of the way they have developed. As all \nparents realize, I knew that I was in the best position to address \ntheir needs. I would have welcomed an opportunity to accrue tax-free \ninterest to help pay for more opportunities in the education of my \nchildren. Far too many parents find that their hopes to provide the \nbest education for their children are crushed as they realize the costs \ninvolved in accomplishing this task.\n  Contrary to popular myth, 75 percent of the children who would \nbenefit from this bill are public school students. The new estimates \nreleased by the Joint Tax Committee disprove the claim that public \nschool revenues would be reduced by what is referred to as the A-plus \naccounts.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimates that by the year 2000, 14 million \nstudents would be able to benefit from this bill with 90 percent of \nthose families earning between $15,000 and $100,000 a year.\n  Mr. President, this is an important piece of legislation. It empowers \nfamilies, and it empowers them to control the education of their family \nand meet their special needs. So I am absolutely thrilled with the \nleadership that the Senator from Georgia is showing in this regard. If \nmy time is running out, I yield the remainder of my time back to the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the respected historian and biographer, \nDavid McCullough, recently reminded us of the importance of education. \nQuoting John Adams, Professor McCullough wrote: ``Laws for the . . . \neducation of youth are so extremely wise and useful that to a humane \nand generous mind no expense for this purpose would be thought \nextravagant.''\n  Today we consider a law that will go a long way toward helping \nparents provide educational opportunities for their children--a law \nthat will benefit students, whether they attend public schools or \nprivate.\n  This bill, which is sponsored by our distinguished colleague Senator \nCoverdell, and which has broad bipartisan support, expands the \neducation savings IRA. It allows families to save up to $2,500 a year, \nand to use this money to pay for educational expenses for their \nchildren attending school, from kindergarten to 12th grade.\n  This, as John Adams would say, is a wise bill. It is one that will go \na long way toward helping our families meet the rising costs associated \nwith schooling. It will go a long way toward helping our children \nreceive quality educations. And it will pay dividends to America, \nitself, as these children--better educated and more prepared--become \nthe parents, educators, scientists, businessmen, and businesswomen of \ntomorrow.\n  Not too long ago, the Finance Committee held hearings to look into \nthe rising costs associated with education, and the pressure those \ncosts place on parents and families. What we found was rather alarming. \nToday, parents are under an enormous burden when it comes to paying for \neducation. And the costs continue to rise.\n\n[[Page S11507]]\n\n  We designed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to help parents and \nstudents offset some of these costs. For example:\n  We created an education savings IRA to allow parents to save for \nhigher education.\n  We expanded the tax-deferred treatment of State-sponsored prepaid \ntuition plans.\n  We restored the tax deduction on student loan interest.\n  And, we extended the tax-free treatment of employer-provided \neducational assistance.\n  Each of these measures will go a long way toward helping our students \nand their families handle the burden associated with education. \nPersonally, I would have liked to see stronger measures in each of \nthese areas. The Senate version of the Taxpayer Relief Act actually \ncontained stronger provisions, and I introduced them as a separate bill \nthe very day that we passed the Taxpayer Relief Act.\n  The legislation we're considering today--which Senator Coverdell has \nintroduced in the Senate--is in keeping with the spirit and emphasis of \nour efforts. It expands the education savings IRA that we passed in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997. It allows the IRA to be used to help \nfamilies finance school-related needs for their children beginning in \ntheir kindergarten years and covers them all the way through high \nschool. It raises the yearly contribution amount from $500 to $2,500.\n\n  It allows savings from the IRA to be used for both public and private \nschools. For example, money could be withdrawn to pay for tuition, fees \nand books for children attending private school. It could also be \nwithdrawn to pay for computers, uniforms, instruments, books, supplies, \nand other educational needs for children in public schools. In \naddition, Mr. President, this expanded IRA can be used for children \nwith special needs throughout their lives.\n  This legislation does not engender a public versus private debate. It \nis fair and good for families and children who elect either form of \neducation. It is focused on middle-income families--those who are most \npinched by the rising costs of education. It provides these families \nwith the tools they need to have the freedom to select whichever form \nof education they feel is best for their children.\n  According to estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the vast \nmajority of withdrawn funds from these expanded IRAs will go for public \nschool children. Over 10 million families with children in public \nschools will use these educational savings accounts, as opposed to a \nlittle over 2 million families with children in private schools. The \nexpanded education savings IRA's are completely paid for, as revenue \nloss will be fully offset by repealing an abusive vacation and \nseverance pay accrual technique.\n  Again, Mr. President, this legislation has strong bipartisan support. \nIt is good for families, good for children, and good for the future of \nAmerica. It builds on the foundation we set with the Taxpayer Relief \nAct of 1997. It provides flexibility as well as opportunity, and it is \na necessary step toward providing parents with the tools and resources \nthey need to help their children prepare for the future.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the A plus Education \nSavings Accounts Act which will provide families--an estimated 14.3 \nmillion families by 2002--with the opportunity to save for their \nchildren's education, an investment by parents for their children's \nfuture.\n  Education savings accounts allow parents, grandparents and \nscholarship sponsors to contribute up to $2,500 a year per child for an \naccount that will be used for a child's education. The interest accrued \nwill be tax-free as long as the funds are used to further the best \npossible education for their children.\n  The funds saved by parents must be used for educational purposes--and \ncan include expenses for home computers, tutoring for children with \nspecial needs or tuition for a private school. The money will be used \nin the most efficient manner because it will be the parents who make \nthe decision on how to use the money.\n  These education savings accounts leave public resources in public \nschools and let parents use their own money to augment education for \ntheir most precious investment--their children.\n  This is a common sense approach--an education reform that gives \ncontrol back to parents, improving education for their children.\n  We must encourage parental involvement in their child's education, \nand this is an excellent way to allow that involvement, making the \neducation system more responsive to parents.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I join Senator Moynihan in his objection to this legislation \non procedural grounds. As a member of that committee, I can attest to \nthe fact that we have had no hearings at all on this legislation. The \nissue has not come up in committee. In fact, as far as I know, there is \nno precedence for bringing a House-passed tax bill to the Senate floor \nwithout any committee consideration whatsoever, without a single \nhearing or markup, and then immediately subjecting that matter to a \nvote to close off debate.\n  That is what this is about. If cloture is invoked, it would limit the \nability of Senators, those on the Finance Committee and everybody else, \nfor that matter, to offer amendments. Members of the Finance Committee, \nMembers of this body have not had an opportunity to offer amendments, \nhave not had an opportunity to debate this matter, and this vote \neffectively will shut off that debate.\n  I have filed two amendments to this tax bill, both relating to the \nissue of school repair and construction. Our buildings, as many parents \nknow, are literally falling down around our children. They certainly \ncannot learn in those kinds of environments.\n  I know of other amendments that have been filed relating to a variety \nof issues touching on this legislation--all amendments relevant to the \nconsideration of this tax bill--but, again, those Senators who have \noffered those amendments will not have the opportunity to offer their \namendments if cloture is invoked.\n  Mr. President, I think those reasons should be enough for every \nMember of this body to vote against cloture, because, if nothing else, \nthis is supposed to be a deliberative body, and we are supposed to have \nthe opportunity to talk about ideas, to really fully explore them, to \ntalk about them in a public way so that the people who listen to these \ndebates have a chance to know what it is that we are voting on. But \nthis bill has not had that. In fact, what it sets up is another set of \ntax expenditures without any consideration of the implications or the \nimpacts of that expenditure.\n  To use the term ``tax expenditure''--for the average citizen, the \nwords ``tax expenditure'' do not have a lot of resonance, do not have a \nlot of meaning.\n  I want you to think about, for a moment, spending from two \nperspectives: Spending out of the front door and spending out of the \nbackdoor.\n  Front-door spending includes appropriations, and everybody can relate \nto those. You see it on a bill. Bills that we pass, they say: We are \ngoing to spend this much for that purpose or this much for that \npurpose. The appropriations spending, front-door spending, is obvious. \nIt is apparent. The public can understand it. It is simple. Everybody \nknows what the deal is, whether it is spending for a bridge or \nsomebody's boondoggle. Appropriations for front-door spending is \napparent and obvious spending.\n  This plan we are considering today goes in the other direction, of \nthe nonobvious spending for what is called tax expenditures. We can \ndebate tax expenditures for a while, but the point is, I call it \nbackdoor spending because essentially what it is is it is spending that \ntakes place when you carve out an exception for somebody who otherwise \nwas paying taxes, where you say everybody has to pay taxes, but as to \nthis little group here, taxes will not have to be paid. So that then \nmeans that everybody else who is left has to make up that little hole \nthat is created. That is what we mean by loopholes. That is what we \nmean by tax expenditures. And this is such a tax expenditure. This is \nnot only a tax expenditure, it is $4 billion tax expenditure.\n  I would have thought at a minimum we would have had a chance to have\n\n[[Page S11508]]\n\nthis up in committee and have had to have witnesses testify on it and \nto have at least amendments on this floor. None of that has been made \navailable with regard to this bill.\n\n  There are times, Mr. President, when tax expenditures really do make \nsense, where we take the position that it makes more sense to say, as \nto this universe of people, this little group should not have to pay \ntaxes, this loophole serves a legitimate function and it is an \nefficient way to do or to effect whatever policy it is that we are \ntrying to achieve. There are some times when it is efficient.\n  So for a moment, for purposes of this debate, let us take a look at \nthe efficiency of this tax expenditure, whether or not the taxpayers \nwho are going to have to make up this $4 billion difference, whether or \nnot they will get the bang for their buck, whether or not it makes \nsense for us to spend money through the back door in this way.\n  The truth is that this plan will benefit only the wealthy. According \nto the Treasury Department, which has analyzed this proposed tax scheme \nand calculated what are called its distributional effects--that is to \nsay, who gets the benefit of the tax benefit; what kind of bang for the \nbuck do you get for this spending out of the back door?--70 percent of \nthe benefits in this proposal would go to the top 20 percent of the \nincome scale, that is to say, families with annual incomes of at least \n$93,222 would get the majority of the benefits in this bill. Fully 84 \npercent of the benefits would go to families making more than $75,000 a \nyear.\n  The poorest families in this country, those in the bottom 20 percent \nof the income scale, would receive 0.4 percent of the benefits of this \nspending out of the back door.\n  Let me say that again: 0.4 percent, less than one-half of 1 percent, \nof the benefits go to the 20 percent of the population of this country \nwho have the least money.\n  These bars on this chart here really set this out. These are not my \nnumbers. These are Department of the Treasury's numbers. Quite frankly, \nwe would have had a chance to debate this had the bill come up through \ncommittee in the normal and ordinary course of things. But since we did \nnot get that chance, we just were kind of surprised with having to vote \nfor cloture on this bill today. We have not really had a chance to \nthrash through these numbers.\n  But anyway, the Department of the Treasury tells us that in this \nlegislation, the lowest 20 percent, as you can see, get the lowest \namount out of this legislation. The highest income people get the \nhighest amount. Families in the highest income quintile would reap $96 \na year in benefits from this bill, that is to say, families with \nincomes over $93,000 a year. They would see $96 of benefits in an \naverage year.\n  Those in the fourth quintile--those earning more than $55,000 a \nyear--would see only $32 in benefits in a given year.\n  Families in the third income quintile--those earning at least \n$33,000--would get only $7 per year. So $7 for the middle-class \nfamilies earning between $33,000 and $55,000 a year--$7.\n  Families in the first and second income quintiles--those earning less \nthan $33,000--would get virtually nothing from this plan. And you can \nsee that on the chart.\n  So really what you wind up with is a tax expenditure that creates a \nloophole, backdoor spending that will benefit rich people.\n  All of my colleagues who have had doubts about--and we have debated \nin other contexts the voucher plans, and this and that and the other, \nand how to approach education finance in these times. We need to have \nthat debate because there is no question but that we have great \nchallenges before us in terms of the reform of schools and providing \nreform of the schools so that this generation of children will have an \nopportunity at least as great as the last generation gave all of us in \nthis Chamber.\n  At the core, this debate is about what kind of educational system are \nwe going to have. I was a product of the Chicago public schools. I am \nproud to say that, because the public schools in Chicago gave me a \nquality education in a time when my parents certainly could not afford \nto send us to private schools. They did, from time to time, choose the \nprivate and the parochial schools in the area. And I went to Catholic \nschool myself on a couple of occasions.\n\n  But the fact is that the public schools in my neighborhood were good \npublic schools. So it was a legitimate set of choices. We had good \npublic schools, good Catholic schools, good private schools. We could \nchoose between good and good and good. So it was just a matter of the \nnuances of the educational opportunity that our parents wanted to give \nus that made the difference in their decisionmaking.\n  As we have gotten to this time, we are really challenged by the fact \nthat there is not the kind of equal choice among and between \neducational opportunities for these young people. Very often--all too \noften--the public schools are troubled. Everybody who has given up on \ntrying to fix public education, fix the public schools, says, ``OK. \nFine. To heck with them. Let's go create something else. Let's go \nsupport something else. Let's go voucher out over here. Let's send our \nkids to the Catholic schools. And let's go to the private schools,'' or \nwhatever.\n  They will come up with alternatives as opposed to confronting and \nfacing what do we do about providing quality public education to every \nchild that will allow every child the same opportunity, will allow \nevery child a chance to climb up the ladder of opportunity. Because, \nafter all, Mr. President, as I think everybody is aware, the rungs on \nthe ladder of opportunity in this country are crafted in the classroom. \nThe kind of education that a child gets not only is important to that \nchild as an individual, but to our community as a whole.\n  It just seems to me that we cannot afford to lose a single child. We \ncannot afford to triage our educational system, cutting off the schools \nthat have to deal with the problem cases, that have to deal with the \npoorest students, and letting everybody else go out and take advantage \nof tax loopholes to provide themselves education in another venue \naltogether.\n  Mr. President, the distributional effects of this tax expenditure \nreally are easily explainable. Again, had we had a chance to talk about \nthis in committee, we would have had that kind of debate. But to talk \nabout why this works out this way, if you think about it, low- and \nmoderate-income families, people that make $33,000 a year are having a \nhard enough time putting food on the table for their families as \nopposed to being able to just salt away and save an additional $2,500 a \nyear, which is at the core of this proposal.\n\n  It should be apparent--maybe it isn't--the contradiction in this \nproposal. It calls itself ``an education individual retirement \naccount.'' The fact of the matter is, retirement accounts are supposed \nto be for people in their sunset years, money put away for retirement \nwhen they can no longer work. If you say we are going to use that \nvehicle to let people use money for a lot of other things, then you \nare, by definition, defeating the notion that people will be able to \nsave, put secure money away, and let it build up so they can retire on \nit.\n  This says, OK, we will use the vehicle for the retirement account \nmodel to let people save for private education. Assuming for a moment \nthat made sense, again, what do you do when you have a situation where \nthe people who need it the most get it the least? What do you do when \npeople who are making $33,000 a year who can't salt away $2,500 a year \nfor this, who can't build up the interest in the accounts? That is an \nimportant part of this--who can't build up the interest in these \naccounts. What happens to them in this situation? They wind up being \nleft out in the cold.\n  If we are thinking about the bang for the buck for tax expenditures, \nthis backdoor set of expenditures, it seems to me, it is the taxpayers \nwho are going to be called on to help make up the difference with the \nloophole we have created, and they will get the least from it.\n  Mr. President, there is another whole set of issues in this bill \nthat, again, had we been able to talk about it in committee we could \nhave gone further in understanding the meaning of the actual language \nof the legislation. The bill defines ``qualified elementary and\n\n[[Page S11509]]\n\nsecondary education expenses'' as ``tuition, fees, tutoring, special \nneeds services, books, supplies, computer equipment . . . and other \nequipment, transportation, and supplementary expenses required for the \nenrollment or attendance of the designated beneficiary of the trust at \na public, private or religious school.''\n  In addition, the bill provides a ``Special rule for home schooling'' \nso any of the above expenses qualify if the child is home schooled.\n  I just read it off, and I have the words in front of me, what does \nany of this mean? What does ``required transportation expenses for home \nschooled child'' mean? If you are staying at home, do you still get a \ntransportation deduction? Does that mean a new car for mom and dad? \nWhat does that mean? We don't have enough information to make decisions \nabout the $4 billion expenditure without having debate in this \ncommittee.\n  Now, given the broad nature of the language of the bill, the \npossibilities for abuse are almost limitless, except for one caveat: \nThe ability to use these provisions and reap the benefits of this broad \nstatute would be restricted, again, almost exclusively to the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  Now, it is OK to say we want to give rich people tax cuts. If that is \nthe argument, that is fine. But it seems to me it is not altogether \nappropriate to dress it up and say that we are doing this for the poor \nchildren of America when, in fact, this is a tax subsidy for wealthy \npeople. And they just got a tax cut. It would be different if they had \nnot just gotten a tax cut.\n  An argument in the Finance Committee with the last bill--which I \nsupported, the tax bill--was that we were cutting taxes at that time in \nways that would benefit the wealthiest Americans. There are some people \nin the committee that didn't have a problem with that, who said the \nwealthiest Americans pay the most in taxes, they should get the most \nback. If that is the argument, that is fine. But it seems to me \nsomebody ought to say that. The people ought to say that instead of \nwrapping it up in ``education reform terms'' when, in fact, the goal of \neducational reform, of saving our school system, will not be achieved.\n  I have other specific concerns with this legislation.\n  The bill attempts to limit the availability of these educational \nsavings accounts to single-filers with annual incomes below $95,000, \nand joint-filers with annual incomes below $160,000. During the Ways \nand Means markup, however, the question was asked whether a wealthy \ntaxpayer could avoid this limitation by making a gift to the taxpayer's \nchild, who would then make the contribution to the education savings \naccount. According to the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the \nbill would permit such a shell game, as long as the child earned less \nthan $95,000. They described the income limitations on the education \nsavings accounts as ``porous.''\n  Mr. President, in addition to benefitting only the wealthy and being \nwritten in such as way as to be virtually unadministrable, there is yet \nanother problem with this bill which leads me to believe we are \nconsidering this bill mostly for symbolic reasons. In order to meet the \nrevenue figures required by the offset that has been chosen, the bill \nonly allows contributions to be made to the new education IRA's for \nelementary and secondary education for the next 5 years.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of IRA's is to encourage long-term \nsavings. The proposal before us today makes a mockery of this concept, \nby allowing contributions for only a 5-year period. In so doing, it \nalso creates a situation where everyone who puts money into these \naccounts will need to hire accountants to figure out what they are \nallowed to do and how much they are allowed to various education and \neducation-related activities.\n  The bill allows contributions of up to $2,500 for the first 5 years. \nThese contributions, and the interest earned on these contributions, \ncould then be withdrawn at any time to meet certain education expenses \nfrom kindergarten through college. After the first 5 years, however, \nthe bill limits contributions to $500. These contributions, and the \ninterest earned on these contributions, could then be withdrawn only to \nmeet certain higher education expenses. Over a long period of time, the \nbill thus creates a situation where some amount of the interest that \nhas accumulated in the accounts could be withdrawn for one purpose, \nwhile other interest that has accumulated concurrently could only be \nwithdrawn for another purpose. To say that these accounts would be \ndifficult to manage is an understatement.\n  Let me say this in closing, I encourage my colleagues to redirect \nthis retreat from quality public education in this country. There is no \nquestion but that we have to reform the public school system. There is \nno question but that the Federal Government certainly needs to do more \nin terms of supporting elementary and secondary education. We are right \nnow paying less than 6 percent of the cost of the public schools in \nthis country, which is not fair. It is not fair to property taxpayers. \nIt is not fair to local taxpayers. In the main, education funding comes \nout of the local property taxes all over this country. If you ask \nanybody what is the tax they hate the most, it is their local property \ntaxes.\n  We are, for all intents and purposes, tying the ability to fund the \nschools to people who have fixed incomes and who really don't have the \nability to pay more in property taxes. That is one of the reasons why \nthe schools are troubled, frankly, in so many areas of this country. \nThose communities that have the least property taxes, that have the \nleast ability to expand in that regard, have the most troubled schools. \nWhy? Because you have tied education to fixed incomes or to declining \ntax bases.\n  We have a General Accounting Office study, in fact, that shows that \nthe poorest areas in the country make the most tax effort to try to pay \nfor their schools. It seems to me, Mr. President, that with all these \nissues to take up and with all of the challenges to reform public \neducation so that every child in America can access a quality \neducation, we ought to do that in the context of having open debate, \nnot trying to shut off debate on something that, again, effectively \nonly helps the wealthiest Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this retreat from public education, to \nreject this retreat from education reform, to oppose this measure, and \nto vote against cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I understand the leadership on the other side and the \nNEA are endeavoring to filibuster this proposal, but they will not \nsucceed in the long run. This is going to happen.\n  I do want to respond quickly to several of the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Illinois. First, the figures from the Treasury Department have \nbeen ridiculed and rejected. They have absolutely no credibility. That \nis the same formula they used to try to discredit the other tax relief. \nThey used imputed income --if you rent your house, that sort of thing.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation says 75 percent of all these proceeds \nwill go to people making $75,000 or less.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I cannot yield because of the time. I know the Senator \nwill appreciate that.\n  I also want to point out that the formula that governs this account \nis the same one the Senator from Illinois voted for in the tax relief \nplan when the IRA saving account was set up for higher education. It is \nidentical. The Senator from Illinois has already voted for this \naccount. The distribution of the moneys is identical. In those \naccounts, like these accounts, 70 percent of it will go to families \nearning $75,000 or less.\n  The Senate and House have already expressed themselves on it. It is \nmeans tested. It is the same formula your President and my President \nrequested be put in place. The same one that governs those accounts, \nyou and I both voted for, as did the vast majority. It is the same \nformula on this account.\n  Now, the Senator has suggested this is something new. This is an IRA. \nThey have been here for 17 years. The Senate already cast 59 votes for \nthis account in the tax relief proposal. The House has passed it. This \nis not some new idea, snaking through the Halls of Congress. We have \nbeen dealing with IRA's for almost two decades.\n  The last point I make, and I understand the misunderstanding because \nof\n\n[[Page S11510]]\n\nsome of the administration views, I want to remind the Senator that 70 \npercent of all these new resources which would supplement education \nwill go to students in public schools. Public schools are going to be \nthe big winner here. And 10.8 million families with children in public \nschools will use these accounts--so there will be an enrichment of the \npublic school system--of the 14 million, so that means less than 3 \nmillion will be in private schools.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I now send a cloture motion to the desk \nto H.R. 2646.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 2646, the \n     Education Savings Act for Public and Private Schools:\n         Trent Lott, Paul Coverdell, Robert F. Bennett, Pat \n           Roberts, Strom Thurmond, Gordon H. Smith, Bill Frist, \n           Mike DeWine, Larry E. Craig, Don Nickles, Connie Mack, \n           Jeff Sessions, Conrad Burns, Lauch Faircloth, Thad \n           Cochran, and Wayne Allard.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield the balance of my time to the distinguished \ncolleague from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, \nfor yielding time to me. I am very proud to join with him in offering \nthis proposal today.\n  Mr. President, I think there is a growing awareness in our country \nthat the status quo in education is no longer good enough, that there \nis a need for fundamental reform in the financing and the standards and \nour approach to educating our children in the grade school and high \nschool levels.\n  This legislation offers the promise of a new beginning in how we \napproach educational reform. In a time of limited budgets, as we seek \nto balance the Federal budget, we are marshaling private resources. At \na time when families have been separated from the challenge of \neducating their own children, we are challenging families to get \ninvolved again. At a time when some are fighting between private \neducation and public education, we seek to help both.\n  Senator Coverdell and I do this in what I think is an imaginative \napproach, what really is no more than an extension of what President \nClinton proposed to do and achieve with his HOPE scholarships for \ncolleges, we do for high schools and grade schools.\n  We do it in the following fashion: It is a challenge to all families \nof middle-income status--$95,000 and below. From the time of the birth \nof your child, you, uncles, aunts, grandparents, can put into a tax-\nfree account, $10, $20, $100 a month, put money aside to prepare for \nthe education of your child. In private school, parochial school, if \nyou choose a yeshiva, or in public schools--indeed, the Joint Tax \nCommittee has estimated 70 percent of this money will go for public \nschool students--by allowing families to plan, recognizing that a \npublic school education, is no longer a matter of 8:30 in the morning \nto 3 o'clock in the afternoon with just a teacher. The whole family has \nto get involved.\n  Use this money to buy a home computer, pay for transportation after \nschool so a student can get tutoring, extracurricular activities, or \nhire a public school teacher after school or on weekends to get \ninvolved in tutoring. It is the marshaling of family resources, family \ninvolvement, to help either complement that public education or allow \nfor a private education.\n  Now, the question becomes, is it wrong to even use these private \nresources to help with a private education? Unlike Senator Coverdell, I \nhave, through the years, opposed the use of vouchers, because I thought \nit was a diversion of public resources at a time when the public \nschools cannot afford the loss of resources. I had constitutional \nreservations. On vouchers, we can all differ. This is not a voucher. \nThere is not a constitutional issue because this is private money, not \nGovernment money. There is not an issue of compromising current \nresources for public education because this is private money, and it is \nnew money. Not a single dollar is lost from the public schools by the \nuse of these IRA's. But is it needed? For those who do not want to \naddress the problem of private education, does it really help the 90 \npercent of American students who go to public schools? Absolutely. \nPresident Clinton has put a challenge down to the country: By the year \n2000, every American school should be on line. But American students do \ntheir homework and research at home. Seventy percent of American \nstudents do not have a computer in the home. Eighty-five percent of \nblack and Hispanic students do not have a computer at home. Under Mr. \nCoverdell's proposal, that would be allowed from these accounts.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding the time. I am very \nproud to join with him in offering the A-plus accounts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I do this, Mr. President, just so that Senator Daschle and \nI can explain what is transpiring.\n  As you know, we are prepared now to go to the cloture vote on the DOD \nauthorization conference report. However, the interested parties on \nboth sides of the aisle and on both sides of the issue involved, \nregarding the depots, wanted a few minutes to talk about what would be \nthe situation beyond this, and so there are a lot of conversations \ngoing on now in the back of the Chamber. I would like to give them a \nfew more minutes to discuss the various options. As soon as we then \ncall off the quorum call, we would proceed to a cloture vote.\n  It is my thinking that we would probably go to this cloture vote, but \nit is going to be a few more minutes before we can actually proceed to \nthat vote. But we will not let it languish very long. The interested \nparties asked for a few minutes to talk. That is what we are doing. I \nrealize Members have other commitments. But we will, probably within \nthe next 15 or 20 minutes, have some final decision, and then we will \nknow whether we will have a vote on cloture at that point or not.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in a few moments, the Senate will vote \nto invoke cloture on the Defense authorization bill for fiscal year \n1998. As all of you know, we have had a difficult time getting to this \npoint. After months of negotiating on the depot maintenance issue, we \nfinally achieved a breakthrough when those Members of Congress who have \ndepots agreed to a compromise heretofore believed to be unachievable.\n  Those Members who have depots gave up on issues extremely important \nto them substantively and politically. At that time, those of us who \nhad worked over many months to achieve such a compromise believed that \nwe could finally put this very divisive issue behind us. It was simply \nunthinkable to us that after those with depots had come so far toward \nthe other side's position that the Senators from Texas and California \nwould oppose this compromise. They have always said they only wanted \nthe opportunity to compete. This compromise gives them that opportunity \non what the Armed Services Committee believes is clearly a level \nplaying field.\n  All 18 members of the Armed Services Committee have signed this \nconference report indicating their support of the compromise. The \nranking member of the committee, Senator Levin, supported the Senators \nfrom Texas and California up to the point when this compromise was \nnegotiated. He and his staff were totally involved in drafting and \nnegotiating the compromise. Senator Levin and I join in total support \nof this compromise which is fair and equitable to all parties.\n  This bill is important to the young men and women who serve in our \nmilitary forces. The bill includes pay raises and increases to special \nincentive pay including vital aviator bonuses. Provisions in this bill \naffect every aspect of our national defense including quality of life \ninitiatives, modernization, and readiness. I remind all Senators that \nall military construction projects require an authorization as well as \nan appropriation and cannot be executed without this bill.\n  All members of the committee support this bill. The House has already \npassed it by a veto-proof majority of 286 to 123. The leaders of the \nDefense Department have indicated that they can make this compromise \nwork and that they need this bill passed. It is hard for me to believe \nthat any Senator would oppose and delay the entire Defense \nauthorization bill at a time when American troops are deployed in \nBosnia and trouble appears to be brewing again in the Middle East.\n  I strongly encourage all Senators to vote to invoke cloture on this \nbill. We must send a strong signal to the White House to demonstrate to \nthe President that this bill which is so important to our national \nsecurity should be passed now. I also ask the support of all Senators \nto defeat any further attempts to delay this bill. Show the young men \nand women in uniform serving our Nation around the world that we are \nstrongly behind them.\n  I yield the floor. I observe the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move to waive rule XXII to use a couple \nminutes of my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thought I would just take a moment \nwhile we were negotiating here on the next vote and our schedule, to \ncomment briefly on the cloture vote that we have just taken. It is \nclear that within our caucus there are varying positions with regard to \nthe Coverdell bill. Obviously, it is our desire to accommodate all of \nour colleagues as we attempt to work through those positions, for we \nrecognize the importance of a good debate about the issue.\n  The bill, as we all know, was brought to the floor in an unusual set \nof circumstances. It passed the House and was not sent to the Finance \nCommittee as most tax legislation is. It was sent directly to the desk \nand pulled from the desk for consideration. And a cloture motion was \nfiled immediately, precluding Senators' rights to offer amendments, \nincluding relevant amendments. So it was on the basis of procedure, and \nour inability to offer amendments, that many of my colleagues have \nchosen to oppose cloture this morning.\n  It is my hope that we can work with our colleagues to come up with an \nagreement that will allow the consideration of amendments. Democrats \nneed to protect their rights to offer amendments regardless of the \nlegislation, but especially on matters relating to tax matters. And \nthat is, in essence, the concern that we express in our opposition to \ncloture this morning. Let's have a good debate. Let's offer amendments. \nLet's have an opportunity to consider alternatives. But let's ensure \nthat the normal process, the regular order, is adhered to as we take up \nmatters of this import.\n  So that is, in essence, the situation we find ourselves in this \nmorning. On the basis of procedure, given our inability to offer \namendments to the bill, many of our colleagues found it necessary to \noppose cloture. It is my hope that over the course of the next couple \nof days we can come to some resolution with regard to amendments and \ntherefore have the kind of debate we should have--the opportunity to \ndiscuss this issue and consider the bill in more detail. I believe that \nultimately we can resolve this impasse.\n  I thank Senators for giving me the opportunity to provide that \nexplanation. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think we are ready to go with the regular order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11511-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11511-S11512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak again on an issue of, I \nthink, paramount importance, and that is the education of our children. \nMr. President, unless we bring about fundamental reform in education, \nwe are just going to continue to nibble at the margins. We are going to \nhave great intellectual discussions and not be able to help our \nchildren.\n  The needs in our schools are great. We need better textbooks. We need \nto update computer facilities. We need to insist on teachers teaching \nthe basics. And we need merit pay for good teachers.\n  Our children deserve an oasis of calm in order to learn. We have to \nbe able to get violent and disruptive juveniles out of the classroom, \nand ``fast track'' them out of the classroom. We hear about fast track \nfor trade; what about fast tracking violent, disruptive students out of \nthe classroom?\n  Most importantly, we need to listen to parents in the local \ncommunities. This afternoon, I am going to touch on a few examples, \nhorrendous examples, that all too often are being repeated in the \neducational systems throughout this country. Time after time, we see \nthe education system supporting administrators, school principals and \nteachers at the expense of our children. We have to encourage parental \ninvolvement in education. When parents speak out, they have a right to \nbe heard. They have a right to be listened to.\n  One of the things that parents are clearly calling for is an end of a \nsystem of lifetime tenure, lifetime job protection regardless of \nwhether the teacher or the school principals are doing the job. \nEliminating tenure and reforming it is a desperately needed measure. \nThe tenure system guarantees a lifetime job to teachers and school \nprincipals, regardless of their performance.\n  Let me give you examples of how children suffer. These are real \ncases, these are our children. In junior high school 275 in Brooklyn, \nreading school scores have plummeted 21.5 points in the past 5 years. \nSadly, this is a school that is failing our children, and they are \ngetting hurt.\n  So parents in the community, recognizing that problem, came together. \nThe parents and the local school board\n\n[[Page S11513]]\n\nwanted to deny tenure to the junior high school 275 principal, \nPriscilla Williams. I think we ought to applaud those parents for \ncoming together and becoming involved and speaking out, as well as the \nlocal school board.\n  Instead of listening to the parents, instead of listening to the \nschool board, the local superintendent granted permanent tenure to \nprincipal Williams. While those scores were plummeting, the school's \nprincipal was rewarded with a lifetime guarantee, a lifetime job. So \ninstead of correcting the situation and bringing in a principal who \nwould turn that around, we now have children being held captive. That \nmeans these children will continue to suffer, and the school's leaders \ncannot be held accountable. The scene is repeated throughout the \nsystem, unfortunately.\n  Let's take a look at another district, Brooklyn's district 23. The \nschool board pleaded--pleaded, and these are the elected \nrepresentatives--to block tenure for five principals at failing \nelementary and junior high schools. What is their motivation? Their \nmotivation is to give their kids a better educational opportunity. Mr. \nPresident, sadly, all five were granted tenure anyway. So what does \nthat mean? That means thousands of children are going to be trapped in \na system that is failing them.\n  Parents know that the tenure system rewards failures. Why don't we \nlisten to these parents who are crying out for reform, who are crying \nout to give their children a better education? They know that the \nbusiness-as-usual tenure system is hurting their children. Instead of \ngranting tenure to Principal Williams at junior high school 275 where \nthe reading scores are dropping like a rock, she should have been \nfired, replaced, and they should have brought in somebody who had the \neducational experience and the ability to raise those scores.\n\n  As tragic as the failing levels are at junior high school 275, there \nis something more devastating that took place more recently at another \nschool. Again, these are real children involved. This was a school in \nthe Bronx, PS 44, where two 9-year-old girls were brutally sexually \nassaulted by four boys----9-year-old children at school. The girls \nreported this incredibly horrendous assault to their teacher. The \nteacher, in turn, reported it to the school principal, Anthony Padilla. \nNow, what did Mr. Padilla do? Did he call the police when a teacher \nreports an assault on two 9-year-old children? No. Did he take any \nsteps to assist the victim, to contact the parents? No. But he did send \na letter. He sent a letter to the parents which stated, ``No \ninappropriate behavior took place.'' Imagine that--doesn't call the \nauthorities but sends a letter to the parents saying, ``No \ninappropriate behavior took place.''\n  Well, the police did investigate the case. Juveniles have been \narrested and charged with this horrendous act. But what was done with \nor to the principal as a result of his failure to confront and deal \nwith this situation in an orderly manner, a brutal attack against two \n9-year-old girls? I'll tell you what happened--he was reassigned to a \ndifferent administrative position within the district.\n  Now, let me point out something else. Padilla didn't even have \ntenure. He has previously been denied tenure. Why is he being \nprotected? Why is he being kept in such a position of such \nresponsibility where the lives of hundreds of youngsters are under his \ncontrol? You have a system that protected him when he should have been \nfired. It is another example of a system supporting administrators and \nprincipals instead of parents and children.\n  Now, Mr. President, parents know that a principal who doesn't respond \nto violence within a school should be fired and not just reassigned. He \nshould have been fired. But he is reassigned. Why? Because we have a \nsystem that is more interested in protecting the rights and the perks \nand the privileges and has become a hiring hall. It is an employment \ncenter, as opposed to being a center of learning, of knowledge. \nSomething is seriously wrong when they are more concerned with the \nperks and privileges of the union members, regardless of how they are \nperforming.\n  Mr. President, let's set the record straight. I believe the vast \nnumber of our teachers are good, are dedicated, are great \nprofessionals. We should reward them and we should pay them for that \nand we should recognize that. But the incompetent who are receiving \nlifetime job security are eroding this system both at the \nadministrative level and, yes, in the classrooms. Something is \nseriously wrong when parents try to get involved in their children's \neducation--in the examples I pointed out to you, where the school \nboards are begging for changes--and the system refuses to respond to \nthem.\n  That is exactly what has happened when school principals are granted \nlifetime tenure over the objections of parents and in spite of the \nrecord of the failing schools. The tenure system has kept some \nprincipals in schools for 25 years while the academic performance has \ncontinually declined. That is wrong and has to be stopped.\n  I want to congratulate the parents for getting involved in their \nchildren's education. Nothing is more important. We have an obligation \nto reform our educational system. We have to get rid of today's system \nthat ignores parents and rewards failing principals with lifetime \ntenure and replace it with a new system, a system that listens to \nparents and rewards their involvement and thinks about the education of \nthe children first, not the perks and privileges of those who work in \nthe system.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleagues for granting me this \nadditional time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 10 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11512-6", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11513-S11515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FAST TRACK\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a few moments ago the majority leader came \nto the floor and filed a cloture motion on what is called the motion to \nproceed to the fast-track trade authority legislation that we will \nconsider beginning next week in the U.S. Senate. I want to make comment \nabout that, on the issue of fast-track authority.\n  It seems to me it does not serve well the interests of this country \nto try to fit into a small crevice, at the end of the first session of \nthis Congress with only days left, a debate about international trade.\n  What is our situation in trade in this country? Well, it is not a \nvery pretty picture. We have the largest trade deficit in the history \nof this country right now. We have huge and growing trade deficits with \nJapan. This year, it is expected to total between $60 billion to $65 \nbillion. We have a mushrooming trade deficit with China, this year \nexpected to reach close to $50 billion. We have an ongoing trade \ndeficit with Mexico and Canada. We have a flood of subsidized goods \ncoming into our country that I am convinced violates the antidumping \nlaws of this country, undercutting our producers and undercutting our \nfarmers. Yet, nothing is done about it.\n  We are not winning in world trade. First of all, I think we are \nlosing because our trade agreements have been negotiated largely as \nforeign policy instruments. Secondly, the trade agreements that do \nexist, which could be beneficial to this country, are not enforced. You \ncan point to trade agreement after trade agreement with Japan, for \nexample, and discover that no matter what the agreement is, it is not \ncomplied with by the Japanese and not enforced by the United States.\n  The reason I take the time to mention this today is that we face very \nsignificant trade problems in this country. We have a daunting, growing \ntrade deficit which has contributed now in the aggregate to about $2 \ntrillion in our current accounts deficit. This deficit will be and must \nbe repaid at some point in the future with a lower standard of living \nin this country.\n  This is the other deficit. We have spent many months and many years \ntalking about the budget deficit, and have wrestled that budget deficit \nto the ground. But this other deficit, the trade deficit, is growing. \nNobody seems to care about that.\n  The request comes now to Congress for fast track from the President \nsaying: Let us go out and negotiate new trade agreements. I say let's \nsolve the trade problems that exist from the old trade agreements \nbefore we rush off to make new trade agreements.\n\n[[Page S11514]]\n\n  In recent years, we made a free trade agreement with Canada. What \nhappened? A flood of Canadian grain has come down our back door, \nundercutting our farmers. This is costing North Dakota alone, according \nto a recent North Dakota State University study, $220 million a year in \nlost revenue. This grain is coming from a state trading enterprise in \nCanada that would be illegal in this country.\n  We had a trade agreement with Mexico. Prior to that, we had a $2 \nbillion trade surplus with Mexico. Now it is apparently a $16 billion \ntrade deficit with Mexico. We now import more automobiles from Mexico \nto the United States than we export to all of the rest of the world. A \nrecent study by the Economic Policy Institute says that we have lost \n395,000 jobs in America as a result of the trade agreement with Mexico \nand Canada called NAFTA. This trade of ours is not moving in the right \ndirection. It is moving in the wrong direction.\n  We should have a debate about trade policy, but it ought not be a \ndebate that is tried to be fit into a narrow crevasse at the end of \nthis session. I will bet as I stand here today that we will see the \nmajority leader come to the floor in the days ahead trying to restrict \namendments, limit amendments and debate, and shortchange the American \npeople on the opportunity to have a full, thorough, and thoughtful \ndebate about this country's trade policy. Just as sure as I am standing \nhere, I know in a matter of 1, 2, 3, or 4 days, we will hear them on \nthe floor saying, ``We don't want amendments. We can't have you taking \nup that much time.''\n  In fact, when the fast-track trade authority bill was passed out of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, I am told it was done in 2 minutes. No \namendments. Just minutes, no amendments, no debate. That is not the way \nthis body ought to deal with the important subject of international \ntrade. This is a critically important question to the economic health \nof this country. It is a question of who will have the jobs in the \nfuture, which economies will grow in the future, and who will have \nopportunity in the years ahead?\n\n  I hope that, as we head toward next week and begin discussing this, \nwe can prevail upon the majority leader and others to understand that \nthis must be a full debate. I have plenty of amendments I want to \noffer. I know other colleagues have some, and I expect and hope we will \nhave that opportunity in the coming week.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator has indicated that the administration wants to \ngo out and negotiate additional agreements. What is to keep them from \nit? They have that authority now. They can go out and negotiate. They \nare negotiating now. There is nothing here that anybody is doing to \nkeep the administration from negotiating additional agreements, is \nthere?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is absolutely correct. This administration \nsays they have negotiated nearly 200 trade agreements in the last 5 \nyears--200 of them. Well, why didn't they need fast track to do that? \nBecause those agreements were mostly bilateral trade agreements in \nwhich they weren't trying to change underlying U.S. law. Fast track \ngives them the opportunity to go out someplace with some negotiators \nand close the door, have a negotiation outside the purview of the \npublic and propose changing underlying U.S. law. Then fast track says \nwhen you come back here to the U.S. Senate, nobody, no Member of this \nbody, has an opportunity to have a voice in changing that agreement \nthat was made behind closed doors.\n  Mr. BYRD. So the fast track has to do with the operations here within \nthe Senate and the House.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is absolutely correct about that.\n  Mr. BYRD. The administration has the authority right now to negotiate \nadditional agreements and is negotiating additional agreements.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That's correct. The administration talks about an \nagreement with Chile. Go negotiate an agreement with Chile. Get an \nairplane ticket for 1 o'clock. You can do that. Nothing prevents a \nnegotiation on trade with Chile--not this fast-track authority or lack \nof it. You can negotiate a trade agreement with Chile if you want to.\n  But, if you want to change underlying law, you have to bring it back \nto the Congress and get the permission of Congress to do that. The \nSenator makes an important point. There is nothing that prevents trade \nnegotiations from occurring without fast-track authority. In fact, the \nadministration says it has now completed over 200 trade agreements in \nthe last 5 years.\n  Mr. BYRD. The fast track means that the Senate and the House are \nsupposed to bind and gag themselves and not talk and not offer \namendments, is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is the procedure. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. No amendments in this body. That is not what the \nConstitution says. The Constitution says that the Senate may offer \namendments to revenue bills, as on other bills, as on other \nlegislation. So that is where the fast track comes in.\n  Do we want to bind and gag ourselves and not be able to speak for our \nconstituents and speak for our country? Do we want to illuminate the \nlistening public as to what is really going on here? Is that what we \nare talking about? Fast track means we will hear nothing, say nothing, \nsee nothing, right? We will offer no amendments. We can't do that on \nbehalf of our constituents in the next 5 years; is that right? Am I \nright?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, the Senator is exactly right. Fast-track authority \nmeans that the Congress says to a President, you negotiate a trade \ntreaty or agreement, bring it back to the Congress, and we agree to \nrestrict ourselves to be unable to offer any changes or any amendments \nof any kind. That is what the Congress is doing.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. To give you an example of that, they negotiated a trade \nagreement with Canada under fast track. I was then serving in the other \nbody on the House Ways and Means Committee, which has 35 votes. They \nbrought that trade agreement to the Ways and Means Committee. The vote \nwas 34-1 to approve it. I was the only one to vote to disapprove it. We \nweren't able to offer any amendments. It went to the floor of the \nHouse, and I led the opposition to it. I lost by 20 or 30 votes. No \namendments.\n\n  Now, what happened in the last 4 or 5 years with Canada? The deficit \nhas doubled. We have a flood of this unfairly subsidized grain coming \nin, undercutting our producers. Everybody understands it is unfair \ntrade, and you can't do a thing about it. We have folks that crow about \nit from time to time, but they don't lift a finger to do anything about \nit.\n  That is what is wrong with these kinds of procedures. We should have \nbeen able to amend that treaty to make sure that if a trade agreement \nwith Canada is contemplated, we have the ability to solve a problem if \na problem exists. But they have pulled all the teeth now, so there are \nno teeth in this ability to reconcile and deal with problems. Now we \nhave these trade agreements where the deficits keep ratcheting up. We \nhave unfair competition for our producers, and jobs are leaving our \ncountry. As I said 395,000 jobs left our country to Mexico and Canada. \nIt doesn't make any sense for us to tie our hands in this way.\n  Mr. BYRD. In a manner, this is just a continuation of the siphoning \noff of the legislative powers, as we saw in the Line-Item Veto Act. It \nwas siphoned away. As a matter of fact, we just gave legislative power \nto the President. Aside from that subject, that is what is being done \nhere. We are being asked to give up the people's power under the \nConstitution to legislate, to amend, and to debate. In other words, we \nare just to buy a pig in a poke and are not even supposed to look \ninside the poke --just rubberstamp whatever the administration sends up \nhere.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But we know there is a pig in the poke.\n  Mr. BYRD. There is something in the poke; I am not sure what is in \nthe poke. But I am not willing to bind and gag myself. I will be forced \nto do that, of course; they will do that, but we will be kicking and \nscreaming.\n  This administration wants more and more power, and other \nadministrations have been the same. They have all been the same in \nwanting this fast track. But I compliment the Senator. I salute him for \nleading this fight. I am opposed\n\n[[Page S11515]]\n\nto fast track, and I will be there when the roll is called. I thank the \nSenator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time I have taken of the Senator's \n10 minutes not be charged against the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has long \nbeen concerned and interested in international trade. I very much value \nand appreciate his support. It is not the case that the Senator from \nWest Virginia, myself, and others, who believe that fast track is \ninappropriate and our trade strategy has not worked believe we should \nput walls around our country or restrict international trade. I think \nwe ought to expand it.\n  I say this to those folks who talk about fast track: If you want to \nbe fast about something, do something fast, put on your Speedo trunks \nand do something quickly, and start to quickly solve the trade problems \nwe have. I can cite a dozen of them that undercut American jobs and \nAmerican producers, workers, and farmers. If you want to be fast about \nsomething, let's be fast about starting to solve a few of these \nproblems.\n  Just demonstrate that you can solve one; it doesn't have to be all of \nthem. Demonstrate that this country has the nerve and will to stand up \nand say to other countries: If our market is open to you, then your \nmarket has to be open to us. We pledge to you that we will be involved \nin fair trade with you. We demand and insist that you be involved with \nfair trade practices with us. If not, this country has the will and the \nnerve to take action.\n  That is all I ask. If you want to be fast, don't come around here \nwith fast track, come around with fast action to solve trade problems. \nShow me that you can solve one of them just once. Then let's talk about \ntrade once again.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was very encouraged to read in this \nmorning's newspaper the majority leader's comments about the agenda for \nthe rest of the session. An agreement has been reached on bringing up \ncampaign finance reform next year.\n  On the list of things that the majority leader had was taking action \nto restructure the Internal Revenue Service. It was a very \ncontroversial debate over one proposal that Congressman Portman, \nSenator Grassley, Congressman Cardin, and I introduced a couple of \nmonths ago dealing with a proposed public board of directors. A lot of \nattention was paid to that. Unfortunately, in the process of paying \nattention to that, we lost sight and a lot of people lost sight of some \nof the other things that we are going to legislate on that are terribly \nimportant.\n  I was pleased to see, since the House has passed it, that the \nmajority leader indicated that is one of the things he is going to try \nto get done sometime during the rest of the year. There is broad \nconsensus on some of the things which we know will improve the \noperational efficiency of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Chairman Roth's Finance Committee had 3 days of hearings on a \nseparate set of issues dealing with privacy, dealing with the power of \nthe Internal Revenue Service to demand action on the part of taxpayers.\n  These are very important issues, and the chairman has indicated his \ndesire to take up next year the consideration of those issues. I have \ngreat respect for Chairman Roth and his desire to bring attention to \nthe Internal Revenue Service. His intent and his sincerity lead to, I \nbelieve, the citizens of the United States seeing that change is \nneeded. However, I believe action is needed yet this year in order to \ngive the new IRS Commissioner, Mr. Rossotti, the authority he needs to \nbe able to manage this agency.\n  One of the things we found in our restructuring commission when we \nbegan in 1995 was that the General Accounting Office disclosed that \nnearly $4 billion worth of modernization and purchase of computers and \nsoftware had not produced the desired result and had essentially been \nwasted. We began our effort in 1995. We held hearings in 1996 and \n1997--12 public hearings, thousands of interviews with current \nemployees and taxpayers and professionals that help and assist \ntaxpayers.\n  We reached our decision in our restructuring commission that the \ncurrent law was unacceptable, that it would not allow us to go from \nwhere we are today to where citizens need to have us go.\n  Today, 85 percent of Americans voluntarily comply with the Tax Code. \nThat is down from 95 percent 30 years ago. The real test is what does \nthe taxpaying citizen think of the existing system? Their confidence is \ndeteriorating rapidly, and it is deteriorating as a consequence of the \nlaw. The law makes it impossible for the Commissioner to manage that \nagency the way we all want the Commissioner to be able to manage the \nagency.\n  We proposed legislation. The legislation has now been passed by the \nHouse and has the full support of the President. The President is now \ncalling upon us to take action. As I said, I am hopeful that the \nmajority leader's comments in this morning's paper are an indication \nthat there is still a chance that we can get this done.\n  We found in our commission deliberations a number of problems that \nare addressed in this legislation.\n  First, as I said, the Commissioner can't manage the agency. He can't \nmake decisions to fire. He can't make decisions to reward based upon \nperformance. He can't make decisions to reorganize. He can't make \ndecisions to run the Agency. The law doesn't allow it. You can get \nwhoever you want to come in--and I think the President has found an \nexceptional individual from the private sector who understands \ntechnology and who understands how to manage an organization--but the \nlaw does not give Mr. Rossotti the authority that Mr. Rossotti is going \nto need to manage the Agency.\n\n  We also found that there is inconsistent oversight both from the \nexecutive branch and from the legislative branch. So we propose not \nonly a public board of citizens that would have responsibility for \ndeveloping a strategic plan, but we also propose to create twice a year \na joint hearing of appropriations and authorizers and government \noperations people to give not just the oversight but give us an \nopportunity to achieve consensus on what the strategic plan is going to \nbe. Twice a year that would be required in order to achieve consensus \nand, most importantly, achieve consensus for the purpose of being able \nto make the right investments in technology, being able to sustain the \neffort over a period of time to do the improvement of operations that \nare necessary.\n  It is very difficult to operate the IRS with 200 million tax returns \na year. We are heading into the filing season right now. It is an \nunimaginable problem to try to manage this Agency and satisfy all of \nthe various demands and answer all of the various questions that \ntaxpaying customers have as well as being able to go out and enforce \nthe law against a relatively small percentage of people who are not \nwilling to voluntarily comply with the law; not to mention as well the \ndifficult challenge of adjusting the software and rewriting software \nfor the millennium problem that needs to be solved in the next 18 \nmonths in order to be prepared on December 1, 1999, for what will \noccur, which is the computers will no longer recognize 99 as being \n1999--a very big problem for a small agency, and an enormous problem \nfor an agency like the IRS that will be in the middle of a filing \nseason, if their computers go down and they are unable to recognize \nthat number.\n  So there is an urgency to get this law changed so that this \nCommissioner can have the authority to manage, the authority that is \nneeded so the Commissioner has the kind of oversight that is needed, \nand in order to have any chance at all of being able to manage this \nAgency, to reduce the current problems and avoid future problems as \nwell.\n  The legislation provides incentives for electronic filing. We found \nin our\n\n[[Page S11516]]\n\nexamination of the Internal Revenue Service that there was a 25-percent \nrate of error in the paperwork. In electronic filing the rate of error \nwas less than 1 percent. Errors mean dollars both to the filers as well \nas the organization that is being operated. There is a tremendous \nopportunity for saving money both from standpoint of the taxpayer in \nwhat it costs to comply with the code as well as the taxpayer from the \nstandpoint of operating the IRS.\n  We believe, and everybody who has looked at it believes, that \nelectronic filing is a tremendous way to save money and satisfy the \ndemand of the customer to close this breathtaking gap that currently \nexists between what a private sector financial service agency can do \nand what the IRS can do. All of us understand what an ATM card is. All \nof us have seen what the private sector has done to reduce the amount \nof time needed to do a transaction with a financial institution. The \nIRS has been unable to keep pace with what the private sector is doing, \nand we think that electronic filing is not only likely to save money \nbut will also increase people's confidence that the IRS is closing the \ngap between what the private sector is able to do and what they are \nable to do.\n  We have a section in there on taxpayer rights. We do not address the \nso-called 6103, the privacy issues, that Chairman Roth and Senator \nMoynihan did with the Finance Committee, but there are a number of \nthings where we are absolutely certain that, if we make some changes, \nthe taxpayer will have increased authority. We give the taxpayer \nadvocate more independence, moving them outside the IRS; it is very \ndifficult to imagine that person doing the job they need to do if, \nafter they criticize the IRS, they then depend on the IRS personnel \nsystem in order to be advanced.\n  We make some additional changes on the burden of proof. We think \nhaving modified it slightly does not produce a situation that will \nresult in a deterioration of our ability to get voluntary compliance or \nimpose a burden upon individuals who are willing to comply in a \nvoluntary fashion.\n  We provide as well, Mr. President, some changes that will I think \naddress the problem of a complex Code, not by reforming the Tax Code \nbut by putting the Commissioner at the table and giving the \nCommissioner the authority to comment either on proposals made by the \nPresident or by the Congress as to the cost of compliance and putting \nin a complexity index that would give us some kind of idea of cost \nanytime we have some new change we want to make.\n  Over and over and over we heard from witnesses coming before the \nCommission who said to us almost nothing is going to work if Congress \ncontinues to make the Code complex. If we continue to add provisions \nthat add to the already estimated $200 billion that the private sector \ntaxpayer pays in order to complete their forms, if we continue to make \nthe Tax Code more and more complicated, it is going to be very \ndifficult to manage the Agency for the purpose of reducing the customer \ndissatisfaction and increasing the voluntary compliance with the \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, I am very encouraged, and I hope we are able, in \nfact--there is now 13 of the 20 members of the Finance Committee who \nare supportive of this legislation. My guess is it will pass the Senate \nwith a very large number. I have heard very few people raise objections \nnow that we have reached agreement with the administration. I have \nheard very few people say this legislation would not help an awful lot. \nThere will be 200 or more collections notices a day going out between \nnow and the time that we act, 800,000 notices of either audits or other \nkinds of requirements sent to the taxpayers every single month. There \nis an urgency to act on this.\n  Are there other things that need to be done? The answer is yes. Will \nit solve every problem? The answer is no. But it will give the \nCommission the tools the Commissioner needs to manage the agency. It \nwill change the oversight and make it possible for us to get shared and \nagreed consensus on where it is we are going to go. It will give the \ntaxpayer more authority and more power than they currently have. And it \nwill enable us to assess whether or not some new tax idea that we have \nis going to cost us more to implement than we are going to generate in \nrevenue as a result of the change in the Code.\n  So I am very encouraged by the majority leader's comments in the \npaper this morning, and I am hopeful in that bipartisan way, in a big \nbipartisan way we can pass in the Senate, conference with the House, \nand send to the President for his signature a change in the law that \nwould give taxpaying citizens increased confidence not only that they \nare going to get a fair shake but that Government of, for, and by the \npeople works.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11515-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11516-S11523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS REAUTHORIZATION AND AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment with \nan amendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1543.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is located in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I advise my colleagues that after long \nnegotiations, I think we have reached an agreement on the measure to \nreauthorize the Small Business Administration for the next 3 fiscal \nyears to continue vitally important programs and to add new programs \nwhich we think will be of significant benefit to our country. The \nmeasure before us now is similar to the bill we passed in early \nSeptember, and it includes changes passed by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The negotiations have been very detailed, and we think if we can get \nto passage of this measure on the House side prior to the adjournment \nfor the remainder of the calendar year that our Nation's small \nbusinesses will be greatly aided by this bill.\n  There are certain programs in the Small Business Administration that \nneed to be reauthorized, and that cannot occur without this \nlegislation. Some of the loan programs will continue even without the \nreauthorization, but the Small Business Technology Transfer Program, \nknown as STTR, the Microloan Program, the 504 Loan Program, the Small \nBusiness\n\n[[Page S11523]]\n\nCompetitiveness Demonstration Program, and SBA's cosponsorship \nauthority will expire if there is no reauthorization passed and signed \nby the President.\n  In addition, the measure that we passed unanimously in early \nSeptember includes provisions relating to the very important issue of \nbundling of large Federal contracts. The bill adds a new outreach \nprogram for disabled veterans. It also includes significant changes in \nthe Microloan Program, which was a top priority of Senator Kerry and \nothers. The bill contains my HUBZones Program which is designed to \nencourage small businesses to provide welfare-to-work opportunities in \ninner cities and in rural areas of high unemployment by providing small \nbusiness contracts set-asides in HUBZones, which are historically \nunderutilized business zones marked by high rates of poverty and high \nrates of unemployment. We believe the HUBZone Program can do a \ntremendous amount to assist us in the goal which I think is generally \nagreed upon around here, and that is to provide more opportunities for \npeople who need want to move from welfare or dependency upon public \nassistance to gainful employment.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that we can accomplish passage of \nthis important legislation today. We hope that the House will move on \nit expeditiously next week so that we can get the measure to the \nPresident for his signature before we adjourn for the year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a joint explanatory \nstatement describing this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Joint Explanatory Statement\n\n       The bill establishes authorizations of appropriation for \n     programs of the Small Business Administration, creates a new \n     program, and makes a number of changes in existing programs.\n\n\n                        TITLE 1: AUTHORIZATIONS\n\n       In Title I, the bill authorizes appropriations for SBA's \n     several business loan programs and for certain business \n     development programs for Fiscal Years 1998, 1999, and 2000. \n     Included among the loan programs are section 7(a) loan \n     guarantees, 7(a)(21) defense conversion loan guarantees, \n     Microloans, Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) \n     debentures, and SBIC Participating Securities. Also included \n     in this Title is a ``such sums as may be necessary'' \n     authorization of appropriations for SBA business and \n     homeowner disaster loans, which are direct loans made to \n     individuals and businesses in communities which have been \n     affected by natural disasters.\n       Except for disaster loan funding, the authorization levels \n     with respect to funding for SBA loan programs, and certain \n     business development programs, are set forth in the following \n     chart.\n\n                                                       Program Levels for SBA Reauthorization Bill                                                      \n                                                                      [In millions]                                                                     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  Current Level        SBA 3 Year Authorization Request        Reauthorization Bill     \n                                                            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          Program                                            FY 98                                                                      \n                                                                FY 97       Budget       1998        1999        2000       1998       1999       2000  \n                                                                            Request                                                                     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n7(a).......................................................       $10.3         $8.5       $10         $11         $13     $12,000   $13,000     $14,500\n504........................................................         2.65         2.3         3           3.5         4.5     3,000     3,500       4,500\nSBIC:                                                                                                                                                   \n  Debentures...............................................       300          376         450         550         650         600       700         800\n  Participating Securities.................................       410          456         600         700         850         700       800         900\nMicroloan:                                                                                                                                              \n  Technical Assistance.....................................        13           16.5        42          65.8        86.7        40        40          40\n  Direct Loans.............................................        24           19          60          60          60          60        60          60\n  Guaranteed Loans.........................................        19           25          40          40          40          40        40          40\nDelta......................................................        48           88           1           1       1,000       1,000     1,000       1,000\nSurety Bond Guarantee......................................     1,800        1,700                                                                      \n  General Program..........................................

In \n     order to maintain the financial integrity and success of the \n     programs, including the welfare-to-work microloan initiative \n     authorized by section 202 of this bill, SBA should continue \n     to administer the programs through its offices charged with \n     management and oversight of small business finance programs.\n       The bill makes a number of changes to the permanent \n     program, including: 1) increases the loan limit for each \n     intermediary under the microloan program from $2,500,000 to \n     $3,500,000; 2) changes the loan loss reserve requirements for \n     an experienced microloan intermediary to the greater of twice \n     its historic loss rate or 10 percent of its outstanding loan \n     balance; 3) increases from 15 percent to 25 percent the \n     percentage of a technical assistance grant that may be used \n     for microloan program participants prior to their receipt of \n     a microloan; and 4) authorizes up to 25 percent of the \n     technical assistance grants to be used for contracting with \n     third parties to provide assistance to microborrowers.\n     Section 202. Welfare-to-Work Microloan Initiative.\n       The bill establishes a Welfare-to-Work Microloan \n     Initiative, a three-year initiative to test the feasibility \n     of providing supplemental grants to existing microloan \n     intermediaries and technical assistance providers \n     specifically targeted to helping individuals leave public \n     assistance and establish their own businesses. While this \n     initiative is not expected to be appropriate for all \n     individuals seeking to leave public assistance, testimony \n     before the Senate Committee indicated that in the state of \n     Iowa microloan technical assistance has been one useful tool \n     for assisting some in this population to establish small \n     businesses. By authorizing 20 locations to target the welfare \n     population, this initiative is intended to test the \n     effectiveness of this tool in all regions of the country. The \n     bill requires an annual evaluation of the initiative and its \n     effectiveness in moving individuals from public assistance to \n     business ownership.\n       The bill also authorizes supplemental grants to be used, at \n     the discretion of the intermediary or technical assistance \n     provider, to pay all or a portion of the child care or \n     transportation costs of an individual participating in this \n     initiative. These costs are often identified as the highest \n     barriers to the employment of welfare recipients. To \n     encourage the creation of small businesses in these key \n     areas, the bill authorizes the microloan program to assist \n     individuals who are starting or operating a for-profit or \n     non-profit child care establishment or a for-profit \n     transportation business.\n       The bill authorizes SBA to fund the supplemental microloan \n     technical assistance grants solely through transfers by \n     cooperative agreements with other Federal departments or \n     agencies which have appropriated funds for the purpose of \n     moving individuals from public assistance to employment. The \n     Small Business Administration is authorized to receive $3 \n     million for Fiscal Year 1998, $4 million for Fiscal Year \n     1999, and $5 million for Fiscal Year 2000 for the welfare-to-\n     work microloan initiative.\n\n         Subtitle B--Small Business Investment Company Program\n\n     Section 211. Five Year Commitments for SBICs at Option of \n         Administrator.\n       The bill gives the Administrator of SBA authority to make \n     five year leverage commitments for SBICs. This new authority \n     is designed to assist SBICs in raising private capital, which \n     is matched with government guaranteed capital to be invested \n     in small businesses. By allowing SBA to approve five year \n     commitments, an SBIC will be able to obtain leverage \n     commitments based on its typical investment pattern, which \n     normally allows for all investments to be made during the \n     first five years of the SBIC's life-cycle.\n     Section 212. Fees.\n       The bill includes a provision to permit SBA to collect fees \n     from applicants for a license under the SBIC Program. It \n     permits SBA to retain these funds to offset its overhead to \n     conduct a review of each applicant.\n\n[[Page S11524]]\n\n     Section 213. Small Business Investment Company Reform.\n\n                          (a) Bank Investments\n\n       This subsection modifies the Small Business Investment Act \n     of 1958 to allow banks to continue to invest in SBICs, \n     whether the SBIC is organized as a corporation, partnership, \n     or limited liability company. This provision expressly \n     permits banks to invest in entities established to invest \n     solely in SBICs, with no requirement that such entities be \n     registered investment companies. Currently, the Small \n     Business Investment Act only provides that banks may purchase \n     stock from SBICs; however, many SBICs are now organized as \n     limited liability companies and partnerships which do not \n     have stock, and some banks may want to structure their SBIC \n     investments through a separately managed ``fund of funds'' to \n     diversify among several different SBICs. This provision will \n     permit such investments.\n\n                            (b) Leverage Cap\n\n       Section 213 provides for a $90 million cap on leverage to \n     an individual SBIC or multiple SBICs under common control to \n     be adjusted annually for inflation. Under this subsection, \n     recipients of leverage in excess of $90 million would agree \n     to invest all leverage obtained above this cap in ``smaller \n     businesses,'' which are defined as small businesses having $2 \n     million or less in revenues and $6 million or less in net \n     worth. The $90 million cap will be adjusted annually for \n     inflation.\n\n                         (c) Tax Distributions\n\n       Because the majority of the SBICs are partnerships, this \n     subsection permits SBICs to make quarterly distributions to \n     its investors (i.e., partners) to meet the investors' tax \n     obligations. This quarterly distribution is designed to cover \n     the situation where investors are making quarterly tax \n     payments to the Federal government. If the SBIC's tax \n     liability is not as great as estimated, the quarterly tax \n     distributions are applied to the following tax year.\n\n                            (d) Leverage Fee\n\n       Under this subsection, SBICs will be required to pay a 1 \n     percent commitment fee at the time SBA makes a commitment for \n     leverage, and the balance of 2 percent will be paid on the \n     amount of leverage as it is periodically drawn by the SBIC. \n     If SBA made no prior commitment to the SBIC for leverage, the \n     entire 3 percent fee is paid at the time that leverage is \n     drawn by the SBIC.\n\n       (e) Periodic Issuance of Guarantees and Trust Certificates\n\n       Subsection (e) will permit SBA to pool and sell debentures \n     to investors every six months. This is a change from current \n     law which requires SBA to pool and sell debentures every \n     three months. Current law has caused difficulties for SBA in \n     producing sufficiently large and diverse pools of debentures \n     that are most attractive to investors. This change will allow \n     for large pools, which should generate greater investment \n     interest and more favorable interest rates for SBICs. Under \n     this subsection, SBA will retain the discretion to pool and \n     sell debentures more frequently, if there is sufficient \n     demand.\n     Section 214. Examination Fees.\n       This section would permit SBA to collect fees from SBICs to \n     defray costs for SBA to conduct periodic examinations of \n     SBICs. It is the intention of the Conferees that these funds \n     be available to SBA solely to cover the costs of the \n     examinations and other related oversight activities.\n\n           Subtitle C--Certified Development Company Program\n\n     Section 221. Loans for Planned Acquisition, Construction, \n         Conversion, and Expansion\n       The bill permits a borrower under the 504 Program to lease \n     out 20 percent of the project to one or more other tenants. \n     This new authorization will allow the 504 borrower to attract \n     an unaffiliated tenant to its project that would complement \n     the borrower's business activity. The bill also permits the \n     seller to provide partial financing to the 504 borrower, so \n     long as the seller subordinates its interest in the property \n     to that of the SBA. The seller's financing is limited to no \n     more than 50 percent of the equity that must be provided to \n     the project by the borrower.\n     Section 222. Development Company Debentures\n       The bill permits SBA to collect a fee of up to 15/16ths of \n     1 percent fee through Fiscal Year 2000, paid by the 504 \n     borrower annually on the outstanding principal owed on the \n     loan guaranteed by SBA. The bill directs that the fee paid by \n     the 504 borrower be reduced by SBA in an amount to insure \n     that excessive fees are not collected by SBA from 504 \n     borrowers if the credit subsidy rate is reduced.\n     Section 223. Premier Certified Lenders Program\n       The bill expands the Premier Certified Lenders Program by \n     repealing the current limit of 15 CDCs that can participate \n     under the program. The responsibilities of a PCLP participant \n     are expanded to include in addition to approving loans, \n     authorizing, closing, servicing, foreclosing, litigating and \n     liquidating loans. The bill recognizes that the \n     Administration has a legitimate oversight interest in law \n     suits to which a premier certified lender is a party. The \n     bill anticipates that SBA will interject its views on a case \n     of first impression or other litigation of a precedent \n     setting nature and may request a litigation plan to evaluate \n     the litigation strategy of the PCLP participant. In addition, \n     the bill extends eligibility for the PCLP Program once a CDC \n     has been an active participant in the accredited lenders \n     program during the 12 month period preceding the date the CDC \n     submits its application.\n       The bill modifies current law that requires the premier \n     lender to maintain a loss reserve of 10 percent of the CDCs \n     exposure. SBA is directed to review CDCs on a regular basis \n     to confirm that those with loan loss rates greater than 10 \n     percent do not expose the Federal government to a risk of \n     loss. SBA should take appropriate steps to insure that CDCs \n     with loss rates in excess of 10 percent do not pose a risk of \n     loss to the government.\n       The bill permits the premier lenders to maintain their loss \n     reserves using segregated funds on deposit in federally \n     insured institutions, or they can provide irrevocable letters \n     of credit in a format acceptable to the SBA. If a loss has \n     been sustained by the SBA, and funds are disbursed from the \n     loss reserve to reimburse SBA for the CDC's share of the \n     loss, the CDC must replenish the reserve account within 30 \n     days.\n       The bill provides that each premier lender is to establish \n     a goal of processing not less than 50 percent of their loan \n     applications under the PCLP and extends the program through \n     October 1, 2000. With respect to the processing goal, the \n     Congress intends the goal as a target only, and expects \n     Community Development Companies to use prudent judgment at \n     all times in determining which applications are appropriate \n     for processing under the streamlined PCLP procedures. This \n     judgment should not be influenced by the 50 percent goal. The \n     bill also requires SBA to promulgate regulations to carry out \n     these changes within 120 days of enactment of this bill. \n     Within 150 days after the date of enactment of this bill, SBA \n     is to issue program guidelines and fully implement changes \n     contained in this section.\n\n                 7(a) Guaranteed Business Loan Program\n\n       The bill authorizes SBA to conduct background ``name'' \n     checks on all prospective 7(a) and 504 borrowers using the \n     best available means possible, including the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), \n     computer system if it is available. Although the presence of \n     a criminal record does not act as an absolute bar to \n     participation in the SBA's loan programs, the Congress is \n     concerned that persons convicted of fraud, embezzlement, and \n     similar crimes may have access to SBA loans. Congress is also \n     concerned that, in conducting these checks, undue delay in \n     loan approvals will be detrimental to small business \n     borrowers and to the programs' viability. In implementing \n     this authority, the SBA should explore the effectiveness of a \n     sampling methodology provided that all prospective borrowers \n     are required to provide the information necessary to enable \n     such a check to be conducted.\n       The bill directs SBA to undertake a study on its efforts to \n     increase lender approval, servicing, foreclosure, liquidation \n     and litigation of 7(a) loans and to report to the Congress \n     within six months of enactment of this Act.\n       The bill includes a requirement that SBA submit a detailed \n     report to the Congress and the General Accounting Office on \n     its plans for installation of a computerized financial \n     tracking and loan monitoring system. SBA is directed to \n     report to the House and Senate Committees on Small Business \n     and the General Accounting Office within six months of the \n     enactment of this Act. No funds can be obligated or spent on \n     this system until 45 days after the report is received by the \n     Committees and GAO.\n\n                TITLE III: WOMEN'S BUSINESS ENTERPRISES\n\n       Title III addresses the non-credit programs that serve \n     women who own or seek to start their own business.\n     Section 301. Interagency Committee Participation\n       The bill provides that each designee to the Interagency \n     Committee report directly to the head of their respective \n     agency on the status of the Interagency Committee's \n     activities.\n       The bill does not authorize appropriations to support the \n     activities of the Interagency Committee. The agencies and \n     departments on the Interagency Committee are to allocate \n     existing personnel and resources to support participation on \n     the Interagency Committee.\n     Section 302. Reports\n       The bill directs the Interagency Committee to transmit its \n     annual report to Congress and the President through the SBA. \n     This section deletes the requirement that the Interagency \n     Committee's report include recommendations from the National \n     Women's Business Council and requires that the report address \n     the Committee's efforts to meet its statutory duties.\n     Section 303. Duties of the National Women's Business Council\n       In order to remove an inconsistency in current law, the \n     bill directs the National Women's Business Council to submit \n     its recommendations and reports to the Administrator of the \n     SBA through the Assistant Administrator for the Office of \n     Women's Business Ownership. The bill requires the Council to \n     report annually to Congress and the President, and it must \n     include a status report on the Council's efforts to fulfill \n     its duties\n\n[[Page S11525]]\n\n     under sections 406 (a) and (d) of the Small Business Act.\n     Section 304. Council Membership\n       Under the bill, the SBA Administrator is to appoint the \n     Council members after reviewing the recommendations of the \n     Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the Committees on \n     Small Business in the Senate and House of Representatives. \n     The Administrator shall give full consideration to the \n     recommendations provided by the Chairmen and Ranking Minority \n     Members. This is to enhance the Council's ability to fulfill \n     its role as an independent advisory body to the Congress, the \n     President and the Administrator through the Assistant \n     Administrator of the Office of Women's Business Ownership.\n       The bill establishes staggered terms for the Council \n     members.\n       The bill expands the Council to 14 members, plus a chair \n     who should be a prominent business woman appointed by the \n     President. Under current law, there are nine members (four \n     business owners and five women's business organizations' \n     representatives). The bill increases the number of women \n     business owners to eight and increases the number of \n     representatives of women's business organizations to six and \n     includes language expressly recognizing that this category is \n     to include representatives of local Women's Business Centers. \n     The bill removes the word ``national'' as a qualifier for the \n     type of organizations that can be represented on the Council. \n     The bill also directs the SBA Administrator to give \n     appropriate consideration to rural versus urban diversity \n     when selecting Council members.\n     Section 305. Authorization for Appropriations.\n       The bill authorizes the appropriation of $600,000 for \n     Fiscal Years 1998 through 2000 with $200,000 targeted for \n     research on women's procurement and finance issues as \n     authorized in section 306 and 307. Any funds appropriated \n     under this section are to be used solely for the activities \n     and duties of the Council, and the Council is required to \n     review and approve its operating and research budget each \n     year.\n       Prior to funds being appropriated for research under \n     section 307, the Council shall provide the Senate and House \n     Committees on Small Business with a description of the \n     proposed research study and resulting report. Such proposals \n     are to be delivered to the Committees with SBA's annual \n     budget request.\n     Section 306. National Women's Business Council Procurement \n         Project.\n       The bill authorizes the National Women's Business Council \n     to conduct a study of issues related to Federal procurement \n     opportunities for businesses controlled and owned by women.\n       Although women-owned business now represent over \\1/3\\rd of \n     all businesses, they receive a minute share of Federal \n     procurement dollars. In 1994, the Federal Acquisition \n     Streamlining Act (FASA) established a modest government-wide \n     goal of 5 percent for Federal contracts being awarded to \n     women-owned businesses. The study directed by this bill is to \n     gain a greater understanding of the Federal government's poor \n     performance in working with this growing sector. \n     Specifically, the National Women's Business Council is to \n     conduct a study of the Federal government's procurement \n     history in attracting and awarding contracts to women-owned \n     business using existing data collected by agencies. The bill \n     also requires the National Women's Business Council to \n     prepare a report on the best procurement practices of the \n     Federal government and the commercial sector and to recommend \n     policy changes.\n       The bill provides contract authority to the Council to \n     carry out the research initiatives and resulting reports \n     authorized under sections 306 and 307. All contracts shall be \n     awarded in accordance with the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulations.\n     Section 307. Studies and Other Research.\n       Upon completion of the Federal procurement study under \n     section 306, the Council is authorized to conduct other \n     research relating to the award of Federal prime contracts and \n     subcontracts to women-owned businesses, and access to credit \n     and investment capital by women entrepreneurs, as the Council \n     determines to be appropriate.\n     Section 308. Women's Business Centers.\n       The bill increases the authorization for creating Women's \n     Business Centers (previously called Women's Business \n     Demonstration Sites) from $4 million per year to $8 million \n     per year. Grantees awarded funds under this section will be \n     eligible to receive funds for five years rather than three \n     years as provided under current law. Changes to the matching \n     funds requirement as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Year 1                  Year 2                  Year 3                  Year 4                  Year 5        \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent law.....................  1 non-Federal; 2        1 non-Federal; 1        2 non-Federal; 1        No funds                No funds              \n                                   Federal                 Federal                 Federal                                                              \nReauthorization.................  1 non-Federal; 2        1 non-Federal; 2        1 non-Federal; 1        1 non-Federal; 1        2 non-Federal; 1      \n                                   Federal                 Federal                 Federal                 Federal                 Federal              \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The bill provides that grantees conducting a three year \n     program as of the day before the effective date of this bill \n     may apply to SBA to receive funds for two additional years. \n     Such Centers that were in year 3 of a 3 year project on \n     September 30, 1997 and that are approved to receive funds in \n     years 4 and 5 will be subject to the matching requirements \n     applicable to year 5 under this bill. The Congress intends \n     that Centers which have a history of successful operation in \n     this program receive funds to continue for years 4 and 5.\n       The bill includes language providing a definition of \n     ``women's business center site.'' This language reflects the \n     fact that existing Women's Business Centers may submit \n     applications for grants to create new sites in their state or \n     neighboring states; however, selection must be made in \n     accordance with the criteria provided in the Act.\n       The bill also includes a list of duties and \n     responsibilities of the Assistant Administrator for the \n     Office of Women's Business Ownership, and upgrades the \n     position of Assistant Administrator for the Office of Women's \n     Business Ownership to a position in the Senior Executive \n     Service.\n       The bill includes language to codify the practice of \n     allowing Women's Business Center grant recipients to pursue \n     other sources of Federal funds. Accordingly, funds received \n     from other Federal agencies do not qualify as non-Federal \n     funds under the matching funds requirement of this section. \n     The additional funds obtained by a Women's Business Center do \n     not effect the level of non-Federal funds required to receive \n     its Federal funds under this section. In addition, the \n     performance of other Federal contracts shall not hinder the \n     ability of the Women's Business Center grantee from \n     fulfilling its obligations under this section.\n       The bill amends the criteria for selecting grant applicants \n     under this section to include the ``location for the Women's \n     Business Center site.'' This language is to ensure that \n     preference be given to applications for states without \n     existing Centers. SBA should allocate at least 1/5th of the \n     funds appropriated each year to the creation of new sites, \n     with preference given to those in states not having a Center.\n       On the use of appropriated funds, the bill expressly \n     prohibits the use of the funds appropriated under this \n     section for any purposes other than grant awards, except \n     that, in Fiscal Year 1998 only, up to 5 percent of the funds \n     appropriated under this section are authorized to be used to \n     supplement funds in SBA's salaries and expense budget for the \n     administration of this program. No funds appropriated under \n     this section may be reprogrammed by SBA or used for programs \n     authorized by any other section of this Act without first \n     notifying Congress. SBA needs to change its practice of using \n     funds appropriated under this section for personnel and \n     administrative overhead. SBA should include in its Fiscal \n     Year 1999 budget request a line item in the salaries and \n     expenses budget to reflect the actual cost of administering \n     this important program. To assist with Congressional \n     oversight, the SBA is directed to provide the Senate and \n     House Committees on Small Business with a quarterly \n     accounting within 20 days of the end of the Fiscal Year \n     quarter detailing all expenditures for the Women's Business \n     Centers program in Fiscal Years 1998, 1999, and 2000. In \n     Fiscal Year 1998, the report shall identify whether each \n     expenditure was funded by appropriated grant funds or SBA's \n     salaries and expense budget.\n       In Fiscal Year 1998, up to 5 percent of the funds \n     appropriated for Women's Business Center grants can be used \n     only for administrative expenses associated with: (a) \n     continued development and implementation of the computerized \n     data reporting and collection system; (b) selection and \n     oversight of the grantees; and (c) holding a training seminar \n     for new grantees and existing programs. All other \n     administrative costs are to come from the agency's salaries \n     and expenses budget.\n       SBA is directed to: (a) award the contract for the computer \n     data system competitively; (b) ensure that the Office of \n     Women's Business Ownership has sufficient personnel dedicated \n     to the oversight of the program by expanding the number of \n     full time staff dedicated to this program to at least two and \n     by better utilizing the District Office staff; and (c) ensure \n     that the seminar is truly educational in nature, with any \n     travel, per diem, and other overhead expenses for SBA staff \n     paid from the salaries and expenses budget.\n       The computer data system should be designed to track \n     outcomes, such as those named in the statute to be contained \n     in the annual report to the Committees on the effectiveness \n     of the program. The contractor should (a) provide technical \n     assistance to ensure that the Centers know how to use the \n     system and (b) work with a representative group of Centers to \n     ensure that the system is compatible with their activities.\n\n\n                   TITLE IV: COMPETITIVENESS PROGRAM\n\n           Subtitle A--Small Business Competitiveness Program\n\n     Section 401. Program Term.\n       The bill amends the Small Business Competitiveness \n     Demonstration Program Act of 1988 to make the program \n     permanent.\n     Section 402. Monitoring Agency Performance.\n       The bill contains a provision to change the monitoring and \n     reporting frequency from quarterly to annual (October 1 \n     through September 30).\n     Section 403. Reports to Congress.\n       The bill amends section 716(a) of Small Business \n     Competitiveness Demonstration\n\n[[Page S11526]]\n\n     Program Act of 1988, to assure that annual reports are \n     submitted to the House and Senate. The bill also amends the \n     Act to require the Small Business Administration be the \n     Executive Agency responsible for the development and \n     submission of the annual report and not the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy. The bill also makes a technical amendment \n     to the Act to correctly reflect the name of the House of \n     Representatives Committee to receive the report from the \n     ``Committee on Governmental Operations'' to the ``Committee \n     on Government Reform and Oversight.''\n     Section 404. Small Business Participation in Dredging.\n       The bill makes this program permanent.\n       The bill recognizes that a transition from the standard \n     industrial classification (SIC) code to the North American \n     Industrial Classification Code (NAICC) is likely to occur in \n     the future; however, the Small Business Administration (SBA) \n     first needs to convert the small business size standards to \n     the new code and the Federal Procurement Data System must \n     also be converted to the NAICC. The Senate Committee on Small \n     Business encourages the Administrator of SBA, the \n     Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy \n     (OFPP) and the Secretary of the Department of Commerce to \n     develop a plan and time table for implementing the NAICC.\n\n      Subtitle B--Small Business Procurement Opportunities Program\n\n     Section 411. Contract Bundling.\n       Section 411 amends section 2 of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 632) emphasizing Congressional policy to provide small \n     businesses, to the maximum extent practicable, prime \n     contracting and subcontracting opportunities and to eliminate \n     obstacles to their participation and to avoid unnecessary and \n     unjustified bundling of contract requirements.\n     Section 412. Definition of Contract Bundling.\n       The bill amends section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 632) to define the terms ``bundling of contract \n     requirements,'' ``bundled contract'' and ``separate smaller \n     contract.''\n     Section 413. Assessing Proposed Contract Bundling.\n       The bill amends section 15 of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 644) to create a new subsection (e) which establishes \n     the procedure to be followed by contracting officials to \n     insure that small business concerns are afforded the maximum \n     practicable opportunity to compete for prime contracting and \n     subcontracting opportunities. Specifically, the bill directs \n     that if a requirement could lead to a ``bundled requirement'' \n     the agency shall conduct market research to determine whether \n     consolidation is necessary and justified.\n       Section 413 encourages small businesses to form contract \n     teams to compete for bundled requirements and provides that \n     such a team will not affect a business's status as a small \n     business concern for any other purpose. In establishing a \n     contract teaming authority which amends SBA's small business \n     affiliation rules, Congress recognizes that some types of \n     affiliation should not disqualify a small business from \n     participating in Federal procurement programs established to \n     encourage small business contracting. Similarly, Congress \n     directs SBA to study the appropriateness of changing the \n     small business affiliation rules for instances of investments \n     by another entity if no other indicia of control or negative \n     control is evident. In the teaming provisions of the bill and \n     the previous legislation authorizing an exception to the size \n     rules for investments by an SBIC or any one of a range of \n     professional investors. Congress has recognized certain \n     situations which should be encouraged and should not \n     disqualify an entity from small business status. The Agency \n     should report to the Committees on Small Business on its \n     findings by April 30, 1998, which will enable the Congress to \n     address the issue legislatively if necessary.\n       The ability of small businesses to team with other small \n     businesses should not be considered an opportunity for \n     procurement officials to justify a decision to bundle one or \n     more requirements. The justification for bundling must be \n     based solely on savings, improvements, and enhancements that \n     accrue to the agency and that overwhelm any infringement of \n     small business opportunity. The mere fact that small \n     businesses could or might team does not lower the burden for \n     agency justification of bundling.\n       The bill also amends section 15 of the Small Business Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 644(a)) to direct that the Small Business \n     Administration procurement review procedures shall be \n     required if a solicitation involves an unnecessary or \n     unjustified bundling of contract requirements. Nothing in \n     this section or section 412 is intended to amend or change in \n     any way the existing obligations imposed on a procurement \n     activity or the authority granted the Small Business \n     Administration under section 15(a) of the Small Business Act.\n     Section 414. Reporting of Bundled Contract Opportunities.\n       Section 414 contains a requirement that Federal agencies \n     report through the Federal Procurement Data System all \n     contract actions involving bundled requirements with an \n     anticipated contract award value exceeding $5,000,000.\n     Section 415. Evaluating Subcontract Participation in Awarding \n         Contracts.\n       The bill adds a new substitute section 8(d)(4) of the Small \n     Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)) to require that bundled \n     contract requirements to be awarded pursuant to the \n     negotiated method of procurement shall use the contractor's \n     small business subcontracting plan and past small business \n     subcontracting performance as to significant factors for the \n     purposes of evaluating offers.\n     Section 416. Improved Notice of Subcontracting Opportunities.\n       The bill amends section 8 of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 637) to allow prime contractors and subcontractors (at \n     any tier) with an estimated subcontracting opportunity in \n     excess of $10,000 to provide public notice of subcontracting \n     opportunities through the Commerce Business Daily.\n     Section 417. Deadlines for Issuance of Regulations.\n       The bill requires that proposed implementing regulations be \n     published not later than 120 days after the date of enactment \n     and that final regulations be published not later than 270 \n     days after the date of enactment.\n\n\n                   TITLE V: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n                   Small Business Technology Transfer\n\n     Section 501. Small Business Technology Transfer Program.\n       The bill reauthorizes the STTR program through Fiscal Year \n     2001 and makes three changes to the program: (1) extends \n     SBA's reporting requirements on the program to include the \n     House Committee on Science and Technology; (2) directs any \n     Federal agency participating in the Small Business Innovation \n     Research (SBIR) program or STTR to include information \n     relating to such participation in its requirements under the \n     Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA); and (3) \n     directs SBA to conduct outreach to states with low levels of \n     participation in the STTR program.\n       The new ``outreach program'' is intended to increase the \n     STTR grant application pool from which STTR grant \n     applications are selected by increasing the number of \n     applicants from states that received under $5,000,000 in \n     awards during Fiscal Year 1995. The program is intended to \n     improve the overall number and quality of applications for \n     awards.\n       The authorization contained in this section shall be taken \n     entirely from funds authorized for use by the Small Business \n     Administration. No funding derived from the STTR agency \n     research set-aside may be used for the outreach program.\n       In addition, the bill adds a new subsection that requires \n     STTR and SBIR programs to be included in agencies' strategic \n     plan updates required under the Government Performance and \n     Results Act (5 U.S.C. 306 (b)).\n\n                   Small Business Development Centers\n\n     Section 502. Small Business Development Centers.\n       The bill includes substantial increases in the authorized \n     grant amounts available to SBDCs under the ``National \n     Program.'' Because the funds under the program are allocated \n     on a population basis some states with small populations, but \n     which are large geographically, have been receiving too small \n     a Federal grant to serve adequately its small business \n     population. In order to correct this inequity, the bill \n     includes a minimum grant amount of $500,000 for the smaller \n     population states. So long as a state provides a matching \n     amount of non-Federal funds, it will receive $500,000 even if \n     it would not otherwise be entitled to this amount under the \n     ``National Program.'' Similarly, if a state provides a \n     matching amount of less than $500,000, it will receive a \n     grant in the amount of the matching contribution.\n       The Congress views the non-Federal matching contribution \n     requirement to be an essential attribute of this program and \n     a key to its success. Therefore, if any state is unable to \n     match the full $500,000 authorized in this bill as a funding \n     floor, it should be funded up to the level that it is able to \n     match.\n       The Committee urges the Small Business Development Centers \n     to inform and assist small businesses in complying with \n     energy, safety, labor, tax, and related Federal, state, and \n     local regulations, and to work with the technical and \n     environmental compliance assistance programs established in \n     each state under section 507 of the Clean Air Act Amendments \n     of 1990 or state pollution prevention programs to work with \n     Small Business Development Centers to inform and assist small \n     businesses in complying with environmental regulations.\n     Section 505. Asset Sales.\n       Section 505 directs SBA to provide the Committees on Small \n     Business of the Senate and House of Representatives with \n     copies of the draft and final plans describing its initiative \n     to sell its portfolio of defaulted guaranteed loans and \n     direct loans in Fiscal Years 1998 and 1999. It is the \n     understanding of the Committee that SBA intends to conduct an \n     initial sale of $100 million from the Disaster loan \n     portfolio. We expect the Agency to provide the Committees \n     with copies of preliminary plans at the time they are \n     prepared for evaluation by SBA, as sell as any amended or \n     final plans chosen by SBA to carry out the sales of the \n     assets covered by this program and copies of reports \n     analyzing the results of each sale.\n     Oversight of Regulatory Enforcement\n       P.L. 104-121 established the Small Business and Agriculture \n     Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small \n     Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness\n\n[[Page S11527]]\n\n     Boards. The Ombudsman's primary responsibilities are to \n     solicit and record comments from small businesses and compile \n     an evaluation, similar to a ``customer satisfaction'' rating, \n     of each agency's performance based on the comments received \n     from small businesses and the Fairness Boards. A ``report \n     card'' of these agency ratings is to be published each year.\n       The Fairness Boards, composed of five small business owners \n     in each of the SBA's ten regions, provide small businesses \n     with an opportunity to review and assess government agencies' \n     enforcement activities involving small businesses. The \n     Fairness Boards may hold hearings, gather information as \n     appropriate, and offer recommendations and comments on agency \n     enforcement policies and practices to the Ombudsman for \n     inclusion in his report. The Ombudsman is the federal \n     official designated to assist the Fairness Boards by \n     coordinating their independent activities. The Ombudsman is \n     directed under the law to include their advice and \n     recommendations in his reports to the agencies and Congress.\n       The Ombudsman must pursue its statutory mission and \n     allocate its resources in accordance with the priorities set \n     forth in the statute. Soliciting comments and developing \n     suggested routine procedures for agencies to implement, to \n     facilitate and to encourage small businesses to provide \n     comments to the Boards and the Ombudsman is a significant \n     undertaking. Careful attention and a thorough effort is \n     required of the Ombudsman to convert these comments into the \n     annual agency report cards called for by the law. The purpose \n     of the law's requirements is to give small businesses a voice \n     in evaluating each agency's performance, and the resulting \n     ratings are intended to measure whether agencies are treating \n     small businesses more like responsible citizens than \n     potential criminals.\n       Annual reports issued by the Ombudsman on agency \n     responsiveness in enforcement activities must be based on \n     comments received from small businesses, not based on self-\n     assessment by the agencies themselves or on the Ombudsman's \n     evaluation of the agencies' efforts. P.L. 104-121 instructs \n     the Ombudsman and Fairness Boards to base their report on \n     ``substantiated'' comments. The Ombudsman should verify \n     comments by contacting the commenting small businesses, on a \n     spot check basis as may appear necessary under the \n     circumstances, rather than by going to the agency, if there \n     is a reason to believe that any particular comments are \n     fictitious or in some way not the result of an actual \n     interaction with Federal agency personnel.\n       Many small businesses fear retaliation for commenting on an \n     agency's performance and, as a result, the Ombudsman and \n     Fairness Boards have a sensitive task. Because of these \n     confidentiality interests, the law requires the Ombudsman and \n     Fairness Boards to rate agency performance according to the \n     subjective views and comments submitted by small businesses. \n     All agencies, however, have an opportunity to review and \n     comment on the Ombudsman's draft report, but the Ombudsman is \n     not authorized to forward to the agency or disclose in the \n     report the identity of individual small businesses providing \n     comments. The agencies' positions may be addressed by \n     including a separate agency response section in the final \n     report.\n       With limited resources, the statutory duties and \n     responsibilities of the Ombudsman necessarily should be \n     strictly followed, and resources should not be used to \n     undertake activities beyond the scope of the statute. \n     Ordinarily, the law does not contemplate that the Ombudsman \n     will make a determination of the factual and legal merits of \n     the enforcement action contained in comments received by the \n     Ombudsman. The law does not anticipate a mediation role for \n     the Ombudsman to create a forum for agencies to negotiate the \n     resolution of individual comments or complaints.\n\n\n                       TITLE VI: HUBZONE PROGRAM\n\n       The bill creates a new program known as the ``HUBZone Act \n     of 1997.'' This program was approved by a vote of 18-0 in the \n     Committee on Small Business and subsequently included in S. \n     1139 as Title VI.\n       The purpose of the HUBZone Act of 1997 is to provide relief \n     to urban and rural areas of the United States which have \n     historically been identified as economically distressed \n     areas. The HUBZone Act of 1997 is a jobs program intended to \n     encourage small business concerns to locate in, and employ \n     residents of, HUBZones. One of the principal purposes of this \n     Act is to decrease the unemployment, underemployment, and low \n     quality of life conditions that tend to be concentrated in \n     inner cities and some rural areas, including Indian \n     Reservations, throughout the U.S.\n       The HUBZone Act of 1997 is crucial to our Government's \n     attempt to reform welfare by providing meaningful economic \n     opportunities to individuals who live and work in HUBZones. \n     Every effort should be made in the implementation of the \n     HUBZone Act by SBA and other Federal agencies to provide an \n     effective opportunity for the contracting preferences to be \n     used as the basis for meaningful levels of contract awards. \n     Special care must be taken to insure that routine dependency \n     on existing programs does not hinder the full and fair \n     implementation and utilization of HUBZone contracting \n     procedures by federal agencies.\n       The HUBZone Act of 1997 is designed to bring qualified \n     HUBZone small business concerns and their employees into the \n     mainstream of government contracting at both the prime and \n     subcontract levels by providing procurement preferences and \n     through the establishment of contracting goals. The Act \n     establishes three specific Federal procurement preferences \n     for ``qualified HUBZone small business concerns.''\n     Section 602. Historically Underutilized Business Zones.\n       This section establishes the framework for implementation \n     of the HUBZone Act of 1997. It defines the terms under which \n     a small business qualifies as a HUBZone small business. In \n     addition, Section 602 sets forth the authority for a \n     contacting officer for a Federal agency to restrict \n     competition for a contract to a qualified HUBZone small \n     business when he determines there are two or more qualified \n     HUBZone small business concerns that are likely to submit \n     offers and that award can be made at a fair market price. In \n     the circumstance where there is only one qualified HUBZone \n     small business concern and the contracting officer is \n     authorized to make a non-competitive award of a contract that \n     does not exceed $3 million for service contracts and $5 \n     million for manufacturing contracts. In this circumstance, \n     the contracting officer must determine that the award can be \n     made at a fair and reasonable price.\n       Section 602 gives the Small Business Administration new, \n     discretionary authority to appeal a decision of a contracting \n     officer not to award a contract under this title. The \n     Administrator would have five days after receiving notice of \n     this adverse decision to notify the contracting officer that \n     SBA may appeal the decision, and within 15 days the \n     Administrator may appeal the decision to the head of the \n     department or agency.\n     Section 603. Technical and Conforming Amendments to the Small \n         Business Act.\n       The bill amends various provisions of the Small Business \n     Act and the technical and conforming amendments are \n     implemented to effectuate the requirements of the program in \n     a consistent manner with other statute.\n     Section 604. Other Technical and Conforming Amendments.\n       This section of the bill, addressing other technical and \n     conforming amendments, is intended to amend the Competition \n     in Contracting Act (10 U.S.C. 2304(b)(2)) and (41 U.S.C. \n     253(b)(2)) to allow for HUBZone set-aside procedures in \n     Federal prime contracting for contract requirements in excess \n     of the simplified acquisition threshold. The effect of the \n     bill is to amend the Competition in Contracting Act (10 \n     U.S.C. 2304(c)) and (41 U.S.C. 253(c)) to provide HUBZone \n     contracting authority to award HUBZone prime contracts using \n     procedures other than competitive procedures for Federal \n     prime contract requirements greater than the simplified \n     acquisition threshold and not greater than $5,000,000, in the \n     case of manufactured items and $3,000,000, for all other \n     contract opportunities.\n     Section 605. Regulations.\n       The bill requires the Small Business Administration to \n     publish within 180 days of enactment the final regulations to \n     carry out the program. The Senate bill further requires the \n     Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to publish the HUBZone \n     implementing regulations within 180 days of the date the SBA \n     published its final regulations.\n     Section 606. Report.\n       The bill requires the Administrator of the Small Business \n     Administration to submit a report to the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives Committees on Small Business by March 1, \n     2002. The report is to evaluate the implementation of the \n     HUBZone program, as well as the effectiveness of the program.\n     Section 607. Authorization of Appropriations.\n       The bill amends the Small Business Act to authorize the \n     appropriation of $5,000,000, to the Small Business \n     Administration for implementation of the HUBZone program for \n     each Fiscal Year, 1998, 1999 and 2000.\n\n\n                  TITLE VII: SERVICE DISABLED VETERANS\n\n       This title includes the House language designed to enhance \n     the Small Business Administration's efforts to improve \n     opportunities for service disabled veterans and provide \n     enhanced outreach to that group. The Congress believes \n     strongly that these individuals deserve far better \n     consideration from the Federal agencies that they are \n     currently receiving.\n     Section 701. Purposes.\n       This section outlines the intent of the Congress to enhance \n     entrepreneurial opportunities for service disabled veterans \n     and to promote their efforts to participate in the small \n     business community.\n     Section 702. Definitions.\n       This section defines the terms ``eligible veteran'' and \n     ``small business concern owned and controlled by eligible \n     veterans'' for the purposes of this title and the Act.\n     Section 703. Report by the Small Business Administration.\n       This section requires the Small Business Administration to \n     study the needs of small businesses owned by eligible \n     veterans and report to the Committees on Small Business of \n     the House and Senate on the steps needed to improve and \n     enhance the role of service disabled veterans in the small \n     business community and the economic mainstream of the \n     country. The Congress expects the Small Business \n     Administration to provide this information in detail and well \n     within the time allotted. The Congress expects the Small \n     Business Administration to reach out for assistance in this \n     task to the various veterans\n\n[[Page S11528]]\n\n     organizations, State run programs for veterans, and other \n     interested groups for assistance in completing this study.\n     Section 704. Information Collection.\n       This section directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in \n     cooperation with the Administrator of the Small Business \n     Administration, to identify annually the small businesses \n     owned and controlled by eligible veterans and to work to keep \n     them informed concerning Federal procurement opportunities \n     available to them.\n     Section 705. State of Small Business Report.\n       This section directs the Small Business Administration to \n     include information concerning small businesses owned and \n     controlled by eligible veterans in its annual report to the \n     President and Congress, ``The State of Small Business.''\n     Section 706. Loan to Veterans.\n       This section reinforces the Small Business Administration's \n     preexisting ability to make loans to small business concerns \n     owned and controlled by service disabled veterans. The \n     Congress takes this step to cure a lingering misunderstanding \n     that the Administration's requested defunding of the \n     Veteran's direct loan program in no way diminishes the Small \n     Business Administration's responsibility to assist veterans \n     through the 7(a) program.\n     Section 707. Entrepreneurial Training, Counseling, and \n         Management Assistance.\n       This section directs the Administrator to ensure that small \n     business concerns owned and controlled by eligible veterans \n     are given full access to the Small Business Administration's \n     business assistance programs, including SCORE and the Small \n     Business Development Centers.\n     Section 708. Grants for Eligible Veterans' Outreach Programs.\n       This section amends the Small Business Administration's \n     existing authority to include making grants to, or entering \n     into cooperative agreements with, organizations that have or \n     may establish outreach and assistance programs for eligible \n     veterans.\n     Section 709. Outreach for Eligible Veterans.\n       This section directs the Administrator of the Small \n     Business Administration, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, \n     and the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment \n     and Training to develop cooperatively an outreach and \n     assistance program designed to coordinate the activities of \n     their respective agencies and disseminate the information \n     about those programs to eligible veterans.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is with great satisfaction that I rise \ntoday to speak on behalf of S. 1139, the Small Business Reauthorization \nAct of 1997. The legislation now before the Senate is the product of \nnegotiations between the House and Senate to resolve the differences in \nthe bill passed by the Senate in early September and the bill crafted \nby Chairman Talent and Congressman LaFalce. I am pleased that so many \nof the provisions of the original Senate bill have been retained in \nvirtually identical form, such as the welfare-to-work Microloan \nInitiative, the extension of the Small Business Technology Transfer \n(STTR) program, the Women's Business Centers program and the HUBZone \nAct. I congratulate Chairman Bond for his leadership and stewardship \nthrough this year's reauthorization process. His willingness to craft a \nbipartisan bill has ensured that the Small Business Administration will \ncontinue to operate effectively in the years to come providing support \nto thousands of America's small businesses.\n  A component of this bill which I believe to be one of the most \nimportant to assist our aspiring entrepreneurs is the Microloan \nProgram. The Microloan Program was created 6 years ago through the \nvision and hard work of Senator Bumpers. Since then, the Microloan \nProgram has operated on a pilot basis, providing loans in amounts \naveraging $10,000 to small businesses, and more importantly, providing \ntechnical assistance to these businesses on how to better operate their \nenterprises. One of the major reasons why new businesses in America \nfail is because so many people who want to start their own companies \nreally have little idea on how to conduct the day-to-day financial \noperations that are so crucial to keeping a business afloat and making \nit a successful enterprise. The technical assistance provided by the \nintermediaries in the Microloan Program has had an impressive impact on \nthe success of businesses participating in this program. Moreover, the \nlosses to the Government have been minuscule, despite the higher risk \nassociated with micro lending. In fact, since the Microloan Program has \nbeen in existence, there has been only one default of an intermediary's \nloan from the SBA. That is an amazing fact, and one which I believe \ndemonstrates the financial soundness of the Microloan Program. The \nCongress wholeheartedly supports making the Microloan loan and \ntechnical assistance programs permanent SBA programs, and do so in this \nbill.\n  S. 1139 also contains provisions for a new initiative for the \nMicroloan Program, one which will go a step further to reach aspiring \nentrepreneurs who may now be on Government assistance. In addition to \nloans and technical training, participants in this welfare-to-work \nMicroloan initiative will be able to receive assistance to help defray \nchild care and transportation expenses, two of the biggest obstacles \nwelfare recipients face in their attempts to become active, \ncontributing members of society. Inclusion of the welfare-to-work \nMicroloan Program in the Small Business Reauthorization Act allows SBA \nto apply knowledge learned over the last 6 years to address one of the \nmost pressing issues facing us today.\n  In June, Senator Domenici, Senator Bond and I introduced the Women's \nBusiness Centers Act. I am extremely pleased that the major provisions \nof that bill are included in the legislation now before us. \nAuthorization for funding the Women's Business Centers Program has been \ndoubled in this bill, and extends the eligibility of awardees from 3 \nyears to 5 years. This bill also provides for studies to be conducted \non contracting and finance issues as they affect women-owned \nbusinesses. This section of the Small Business Reauthorization Act will \nstrengthen a sector of our economy that contributes over $1.5 trillion \nto the American economy and employs more Americans than Fortune 500 \ncompanies.\n  The Small Business Technology Transfer [STTR] program is reauthorized \nfor an additional 4 years through this act. An offshoot of the very \nsuccessful SBIR Program, STTR has been joining small businesses and \nnon-profit research institutions for the past four years in an attempt \nto make better use of federally sponsored high technology research. \nThis bill strengthens the STTR Program by requiring more accurate data \nrecording by the SBA and participating agencies, and requires those \nparticipating agencies to include information regarding the SBIR and \nSTTR Programs in their strategic plans required by the Government \nPerformance and Results Act. By doing this, we in Congress can better \nevaluate programs such as STTR and what provisions might best assist \nthe kind of companies participating in the program and what changes \ncould result in a stronger STTR when we revisit it for reauthorization \n4 years from now.\n  Chairman Bond led the way on an integral part of the reauthorization \nact, the HUBZones Program. This program seeks to aid small business \nconcerns located in the poorest areas of our country by providing \nbetter opportunities to contract with the Federal Government. The \nHUBZone Act is the result of several years of work by Chairman Bond, \nand I congratulate him and his staff for this legislation which will \ncertainly improve the economic situation of many American communities.\n  There are a few other components of the reauthorization act that I \nbelieve warrant mentioning at this time. The Community Development \nCompany program, also called the 504 loan program, is continued through \nthis legislation and will provide small businesses $2.3 billion of \nneeded capital for their plant and equipment needs. The SBA's biggest \nloan program, 7(a), is authorized at $39.5 billion over the next 3 \nyears, high enough to ensure continued support for those small \nbusinesses that need extra capital to grow their businesses. In \naddition, this legislation also contains a provision that seeks to \nprotect small businesses from the practice of contract bundling, which \ncan be harmful to small business. Bundling is when a Federal agency \nrolls several contracts into one big contract. This practice \neffectively bars small businesses from participating in the lucrative \nFederal Government contracting process on those contracts. The language \ncontained in this bill will help alleviate this problem to some degree \nso that small businesses are not left out in the cold, and will require \nthe Government to keep records on bundled contracts valued at more than \n$5 million.\n  The bill before us contains some provisions that the House included \nin their bill and that we have not seen before. One such provision is \ntitle VII of\n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\nthe bill which contains language that directs SBA to conduct a study on \nthe potential to aid small businesses that are owned by service \ndisabled veterans. I believe it is important to conduct research into \nthis issue and see if the opportunity exists to better assist these \nbusinesses.\n  There are other components of the Small Business Reauthorization Act \nwhich I have not mentioned here but will be helpful to small businesses \nparticipating in the SBA's programs. The Small Business Investment \nCompanies and Small Business Development Centers Programs are both \nmodified through this act. The Pilot Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee \nProgram is also extended in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude by again thanking the \nChairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator Bond, for his \nleadership throughout the year on reaching this point and passing what \nI consider to be a very meaningful and effective piece of legislation. \nIt is clear that the Small Business Administration will be assured of \nits continued support by Congress as it moves ahead to the 21st century \nassisting the driving force of our economy, American small business.\n\n\n                        Women's Business Centers\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity of \ncommending Senator Bond for his efforts in bringing this Small Business \nReauthorization Act to the floor for consideration. In particular, I am \ngrateful for his deep commitment and tireless dedication to improving \nthe Small Business Administration's [SBA] Women's Business Centers \nprogram. As a result of his work, this program will be expanded and \nmodified so that it targets more appropriately the thousands of women \nentrepreneurs who provide jobs and economic growth to their local \ncommunities.\n  I also want to commend Congresswoman Nancy Johnson for her strong \nsupport of this program. My legislation, S. 888, the Women's Business \nCenters Act of 1997, introduced in behalf of myself, Senator Bond, \nSenator Kerry and 23 other cosponsors, was the companion bill to \nRepresentative Johnson's legislation. Due to the strong bipartisan \nsupport of Chairman Bond and other members of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, S. 888 was incorporated into this reauthorization bill. \nCongresswoman Johnson has been a long-time and dedicated friend of \nwomen's business efforts, and I am most appreciative that we were able \nto work together on this important measure.\n  Many of us believe that the SBA must give renewed attention to one of \nits smallest but most successful business programs. This legislation, \ntherefore, doubles the amount of funds available to Women's Business \nCenters, and it extends the grant period from 3 years to 5 years. It \nalso changes the funding formula so that newly created business sites \nwill have a more realistic Federal-to-non-Federal matching program. \nThis latter issue is important because up to this point, women's \nbusiness centers have been required to meet a much stricter matching \ngrant requirement than have other grantees in the SBA's grant programs. \nI remain somewhat concerned, however, that existing business site \ngrantees must still bear a slightly higher burden of matching fund \nrequirements. Nevertheless, the overall changes to the Women's Business \nCenters Program are noteworthy and extremely positive.\n  By passage of this reauthorization language, Congress recognizes the \nessential role of women-owned small businesses to this country's local \nand national economies. Congress also recognizes the necessity of added \nSBA administrative and programmatic support to the women's program. The \nSBA must ensure that the Office of Women's Business Ownership [OWBO] \nhas adequate staffing and resources to manage this expanded program. It \nmust also provide any supplemental assistance OWBO may need to manage \nits ongoing program while developing new and creative activities to \nenhance its present portfolio. Frankly, a program of this nature \ndemands tangible agency commitment to its success. While OWBO and its \nwomen's business clients have an impressive and outstanding \nprogrammatic record, this small program deserves much more attention \nfrom the Agency than it has received thus far. I am hopeful that next \nyear and in the years to come the SBA will work more closely with OWBO, \nas well as with Congress, to ensure that women's businesses are \nprovided the necessary resources to continue their vital \nentrepreneurial endeavors.\n  I believe it is also important to give credit to the many able and \ncommitted directors and staff of the Women's Business Centers \nthroughout the country. I know these professional women, like those of \nAgnes Noonan and her staff in my State of New Mexico, have counseled \ncountless thousands of potential business clients and have established \nequal numbers of successful small businesses. Their tasks have not been \neasy, but they have met their management obligations while also \ncreating an impressive and wide-ranging network of business colleagues \nto address the special challenges of women-owned businesses. The \ntechniques they've learned and the expertise they share with one \nanother have been instrumental in the overall success of this SBA \nprogram.\n  Once again, I commend Senator Bond for his attention and commitment \nto the Women's Business Centers Program. His able staff, particularly \nMs. Suey Howe and Mr. Paul Cooksey, provided excellent professional \nsupport so that this program was reviewed and modified appropriately. I \nam very pleased Chairman Bond and other members of the committee have \ngiven this issue the attention it deserves. Women-owned businesses are \nan integral component of our Nation's business sector and are \ninstrumental to our country's overall economic health. The efforts of \nthe Chairman and the committee will ensure that this SBA business \nprogram continues its obligations to so many deserving and successful \nwomen entrepreneurs. Thank you for the opportunity of sharing my \nsupport of this important program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Missouri.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about an \nannouncement the administration is making today to increase funding for \nhumanitarian demining programs and appoint a demining czar. This is, of \ncourse, on the subject of landmines, which has been a concern of mine \nfor many years. I have not received all the details, but I understand \nthe administration plans to spend $80 million on humanitarian demining \nprograms next year, which is a significant increase over the current \nlevel.\n  They also plan to seek additional support from other governments, \ncorporations, and foundations. Their goal is to raise $1 billion to \nclear most of the world's landmines by the year 2010. I also understand \nAmbassador Karl Inderfurth, our Assistant Secretary for South Asia and \nformerly the U.S. Alternate Representative to the United Nations, is to \nbecome the new demining czar.\n  I can think of no better person to lead this effort than Ambassador \nInderfurth. The Ambassador, known as Rick to his friends, is a long-\ntime friend of mine. I have immense respect and admiration for him. I \nhave watched him prowl the halls of the United Nations and buttonhole \nother representatives, as did Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \nwhen she was our U.N. Representative, to get support for an \ninternational ban on antipersonnel landmines.\n  Rick has been a passionate voice for the victims of landmines. I am \nvery grateful that he has agreed to take this on, especially as he \nalready has a full-time job that would be more than enough for most \npeople. He will do a superb job.\n\n[[Page S11530]]\n\n  This announcement is being made today by Secretaries Albright and \nCohen. I commend them both, and I say that it is welcome news.\n  While its goals sound awfully ambitious, some may say even \nunrealistic, time will tell. They have my full support. This is an area \nin which not nearly enough has been done, and the United States has a \ngreat deal to offer.\n\n  Mr. President, today we clear landmines much the same way that we did \nin World War II or Korea. It takes an enormous amount of time and it is \nextremely dangerous. There is very little money, especially as most of \nthese landmines are in the Third World.\n  Our leadership in this area could help immeasurably. Look what we did \nafter World War II with the tens of millions of landmines spread all \nover Europe. We cleared most of them in a decade. There are still parts \nof Europe that have landmines today, but most of them are gone.\n  The administration's plan builds on what the Congress began some \nyears ago. We established humanitarian demining programs at both the \nDepartments of Defense and State. At the beginning, the Pentagon did \nnot want to do it. They said it was not their mission. They said their \njob was breaching mine fields, not clearing mines. That is one reason \nthere are so many unexploded landmines killing and maiming innocent \npeople around the world.\n  What happens, of course, Mr. President, is that the world's \nmilitaries leave millions of landmines behind once the wars end, the \nsoldiers go home, the guns are unloaded, the leaders sign the peace \nagreements, and hands are shaken.\n  But the landmines stay, and some unsuspecting child or farmer steps \non them--a child going to school or someone going to gather water or \nfirewood. Someone trying to raise crops to feed their family. Or an \nunsuspecting missionary.\n  There are so many victims, long after anybody even remembers who was \nfighting whom, or why. There are Russian mines, American mines, Italian \nmines and mines from other countries in hundreds of varieties in over \n68 countries. It is estimated that it would cost, at the rate we are \ngoing now, billions of dollars over decades and decades to get rid of \nthem.\n  Over time, the Pentagon has become more supportive. I hope this new \ninitiative means that they are now fully on board. They have the \nexpertise and technology to make an important contribution. They could \ncut years, years off the time it would take to demine the world.\n  Again, as I have said, we are using the same demining technologies \nthat were common years ago. We are not taking advantage of some of the \ntechnology and expertise available today. And the demining programs \nthat we now use have been in place for several years have a mixed \nrecord. The administration says they have spent some $150 million to \ndate. I wonder how many landmines have been removed for all that money? \nI suspect if anyone did the arithmetic it would come to hundreds of \ndollars, possibly even thousands of dollars, to remove each landmine. \nOf course, the tragic irony of that is that it only costs $3 or $4 to \nput the landmine in the ground in the first place.\n  So I suggest, in building on what Secretary Albright and Secretary \nCohen said today, that we begin with a top-to-bottom review of our \ndemining efforts. They are too uncoordinated among government agencies. \nThis should include a thorough review of the program that is in the \nPentagon itself.\n  The Pentagon should play a central role, but I am concerned that some \nPentagon officials have been more interested in using this program to \nmake contacts with foreign military personnel than to build the \nsustainable demining capabilities in these other countries. The \nsoldiers we send to do the training in places like Eritrea and \nMozambique and other mine-infested countries are among our best, and \nthey do a terrific job. There is no one more proud of them than I am. \nBut we need to be sure that when they leave, the people they have \ntrained have the knowledge and the equipment and the support to carry \non.\n  We have the Humanitarian Demining Technologies Program. This program \nfunds research and development on new demining technologies. This \nprogram, again, established by the Congress three years ago, has the \npotential to revolutionize the way we detect and destroy landmines and \nother unexploded ordnance.\n  This may be what enables us to make that quantum leap forward so that \ninstead of taking decades and decades to get rid of the mines, we cut \nthat time substantially. The Pentagon also has a lot to offer in this \narea, but it has not been fully supportive of it despite the best \nefforts of the people involved. As one who has spent nearly 10 years \nworking to ban anti-personnel landmines, to support programs to clear \nmines and care for the victims, I must say that there should be some \nthought given to moving this program elsewhere or reorganizing it, \nbecause there needs to be much more coordination with the private \nsector and with other governments that are also working in this area.\n  Mr. President, there is another part of this that needs to be \nmentioned. Two years ago, the President of the United States went to \nthe United Nations to urge the world's nations to negotiate a treaty \nbanning antipersonnel landmines.\n  In December, over 110 governments will sign such a treaty in Ottawa. \nBut the United States is not going to be among them. In fact, not only \nwill we be absent, now we find the Pentagon is backtracking on the \npledge it made a year ago to find alternatives to anti-personnel \nlandmines.\n  So taken in this context, it is no surprise that the administration \nfeels it must do something to counter the growing impression around the \nworld that the United States has become an obstacle to an international \nban.\n  Thirteen members of NATO and most of the world's producers and users \nand exporters of landmines will sign the treaty in Ottawa, but not the \nworld's only superpower. We have taken the position that even though we \nare the most powerful nation history has ever known, we cannot give up \nour landmines but we want everybody else to give up theirs. Rather than \nlead this effort, we risk being left behind with a handful of pariah \nstates with whom we do not belong. We are too great a nation for that.\n  No one should suggest that a ban is a substitute for demining. There \nare some 100 million unexploded landmines in the ground, and whether \nthere is a ban or not they will go on maiming and killing until we get \nrid of them. We have to do that. But neither is demining a substitute \nfor a ban. Why spend billions of dollars to get rid of the mines if \nthey are simply replaced with new mines?\n  We need to destroy the mines that are in the ground. We need to stop \nthe laying of new mines. Both are necessary to rid the world of these \ninsidious weapons.\n  So I welcome this initiative. I will do everything I can to support \nit. But let us not fool themselves. The United States is about to miss \na historic opportunity. We should sign the Ottawa treaty, just as we \nshould do everything we can to lead an international demining effort to \nget rid of the mines in the ground.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in today's \nWashington Post, which describes how the Pentagon is walking away from \nits pledge last May to find alternatives to antipersonnel landmines, a \npledge that at the time they said reflected their ``complete \nagreement'' with the President's goal of an international ban, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 31, 1997]\n\n Administration Drops Plans to Find Substitutes for Antipersonnel Mine\n\n                            (By Dana Priest)\n\n       The Clinton administration has dropped its effort to find \n     alternatives to a certain type of antipersonnel land mine, a \n     move that has angered advocates of banning mines who say the \n     president has retreated from his pledge to find a substitute \n     for the weapon.\n       ``There wasn't anything that conceptually made any sense,'' \n     said a high-ranking Defense Department official who declined \n     to be named. ``And there is no humanitarian need for such an \n     alternative.''\n       Caleb Rossiter, director of Demilitarization for Democracy, \n     which advocates an international land mine ban, said: ``This \n     is a huge policy change.''\n       At issue are the millions of antipersonnel land mines used \n     by U.S. troops to protect anti-tank minefields.\n\n[[Page S11531]]\n\n       Since May 1996, Clinton has pledged to find alternatives to \n     all mines this country uses, and the Pentagon has been \n     studying various approaches. In January, when Clinton \n     announced he would not sign an international treaty banning \n     land mines, he directed the Defense Department ``to develop \n     alternatives to antipersonnel land mines, so that by the year \n     2003 we can end even the use of self-destruct land mines.''\n       He also directed the Pentagon to find alternatives to the \n     mines used on the Korean Peninsula by 2006.\n       At the same time, Clinton redefined the only type of \n     antipersonnel land mine used by U.S. troops outside Korea--\n     mines that are scattered around anti-tank mines to protect \n     them from being breached by enemy troops. This is called a \n     ``mixed system'' of anti-tank and antipersonnel mines. The \n     administration now calls these antipersonnel land mines \n     ``devices'' and ``submunitions.''\n       The practical result of this definitional change is that \n     the Pentagon is no longer actively trying to come up with an \n     alternative for these mines, of which the United States has \n     more than 1 million.\n       ``We are looking for alternatives to the Korean \n     situation,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. ``The \n     mixed packages are not a humanitarian threat.''\n       The reason the mixed packages are not a humanitarian threat \n     is because they turn themselves off after a set period of \n     time, usually three hours. Even so, from May 1996 until this \n     January, Clinton still wanted to find alternatives to them in \n     hopes of inducing countries that use the troublesome non-\n     self-destructing mines to give them up.\n       Non-self-destructing mines, also known as ``dumb mines,'' \n     are responsible for injuring or killing 25,000 people a year, \n     many of them civilians.\n       U.S. negotiators working on the Ottawa treaty tried \n     unsuccessfully to convince other countries to create an \n     exemption for the antipersonnel mines used in anti-tank \n     minefields.\n       Abandoning the search for alternatives, said Bobby Muller, \n     president of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, \n     would make it impossible for the United States to ever sign \n     the treaty as it is written.\n       ``Our bottom line is for the U.S. to sign the treaty,'' \n     said Muller, who also is part of the International Campaign \n     to Ban Landmines, which won the Nobel Peace Prize this year. \n     ``We are going to be in his [Clinton's] face. We are not \n     going away.''\n       Yesterday the international campaign began airing eight \n     days of Washington-broadcast television ads aimed at \n     pressuring Clinton to sign the treaty or to pledge to sign it \n     at a specified date.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let us hope that the Pentagon's pledge \ntoday to help lead an international demining effort is a lot longer \nlasting.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken on this subject so many times. I think \nof when I went to Oslo recently when governments were meeting there to \ntalk about an international ban. And I was joined by Tim Rieser, of my \nstaff, who has worked so hard on this, and David Carle. I met with the \nAmerican negotiators who were there and had a chance to speak to the \ndelegates and the NGO's and others who had gathered.\n  And I said: I dream of a world, as we go into the next century, a \nworld where armies of humanity dig up and destroy the landmines that \nare in the ground and when no other armies come and put new landmines \ndown.\n  If we did that, Mr. President, if the world did that, removed the \nlandmines that are there, banned the use of new landmines, we would \ngive such great hope to people everywhere.\n  Today, there are countries where families literally have to tether \ntheir child on a rope near where they live because they know within the \ncircle of that rope is one of the few areas that is free of landmines. \nAnd the child can play only on the end of a leash like a dog.\n  These are the same places where people often go hungry. They cannot \nwork in their fields without risking their lives. And they often have \nno choice. And when one of them loses a limb, or his or her life, the \nwhole family suffers. That is the reality for millions of people, and \nthat is why this demining initiative is so important.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Seeing nobody else seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11529-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11531-S11533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SUPPORT OF NOMINATION OF BILL LANN LEE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken many times on the floor about \nthe nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the Assistant Attorney General in \ncharge of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  Mr. Lee testified before the Judiciary Committee. It was really the \nculmination of the American dream. A son of Chinese immigrants who went \nfrom living at the family laundry upon his father returning from World \nWar II and then on to achieving one of the highest academic records \never, and ends up dedicating his life to protecting the civil rights of \nall Americans. At a time when we are discussing what is happening \nregarding the lack of civil rights in the country of his forbears--what \na marked contrast.\n  I am concerned when I hear some Members trying to stall or defeat his \nnomination. They have done it by mischaracterizing Mr. Lee and his \nrecord of practical problem solving.\n  Yesterday, my statement pointed out that the confirmation of this son \nof Chinese immigrants to be the principal Federal law enforcement \nofficial responsible for protecting the civil rights of all Americans \nwould stand in sharp contrast to the human rights practices in China.\n  Some are obviously trying to stall or defeat this nomination by \nmischaracterizing Mr. Lee and his record of practical problem solving. \nBill Lee testified that he regards quotas as illegal and wrong, but \nsome would ignore his real record of achievement and our hearing if \nallowed to do so. I am confident that the vast majority of the Senate \nand the American people will see through the partisan rhetoric and \nsupport Bill Lee.\n  Bill Lee has dedicated his career to wide ranging work on civil \nrights issues. He has represented poor children who were being denied \nlead screening tests, women and people of color who were denied job \nopportunities and promotions, neighbors in a mixed income and mixed \nrace community who strove to save their homes, and parents seeking a \ngood education for their children. Mr. Lee has developed a broad array \nof supporters over the years, including the Republican mayor of Los \nAngeles, former opposing counsels, and numerous others who cross race, \ngender and political affiliation lines.\n  Senator D'Amato spoke eloquently of Mr. Lee's qualifications and \nbackground while introducing him last week. Senator Warner wrote to the \nWhite House in support of Mr. Lee's candidacy. Senators Moynihan, \nInouye, Akaka, Feinstein, and Boxer supported Mr. Lee at his \nconfirmation hearing last week and Representatives Mink, Beccera, \nMatsui, and Jackson-Lee all took the time to come to the hearings to \nshow their commitment to this outstanding nominee.\n  To those who know him, Bill Lee is a person of integrity who is well \nknown for resolving complex cases. He has been involved in \napproximately 200 cases in his 23 years of law practice, and he has \nsettled all but 6 of them. Clearly, this is strong evidence that Mr. \nLee is a problem solver and practical in his approach to the law. No \none who has taken the time to thoroughly review his record could call \nhim an idealogue.\n  Further evidence that Mr. Lee is the man for the job is contained in \nthe editorials from some of our country's leading newspapers, including \nthe Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Washington Post, and New York \nTimes. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record copies of \nthose editorials and articles at the conclusion of my statement, and I \nalso ask to be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement, \na letter from the assistant city attorney from Los Angeles that \ncorrects a misimpression that may have been created by a letter \nrecently sent by Newt Gingrich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  As Robert Cramer's letter establishes, Mr. Lee neither sought to \nimpose racial or gender quota nor employed dubious means in a case in \nwhich he, in fact, was not even active as counsel. Mr. Cramer, a 17-\nyear veteran attorney for the city of Los Angeles, concludes:\n\n       Bill Lann Lee and I have sat on opposite sides of the \n     negotiating table over the course of several years. Although \n     we have disagreed profoundly on many issues, I have \n     throughout the time I have known him respected\n\n[[Page S11532]]\n\n     Bill's candor, his thorough preparation, his sense of ethical \n     behavior, and his ability to bring persons holding diverse \n     views into agreement. He would, in my view, be an outstanding \n     public servant and a worthy addition to the Department of \n     Justice.\n\n  When confirmed, Bill Lee will be the first Asian-American to hold \nsuch a senior position at the Department of Justice. I am sure that any \nfairminded review will yield the inescapable conclusion that no finer \nnominee could be found for this important post and that Bill Lee ought \nto be confirmed without delay. I look forward to the Judiciary \nCommittee voting on this nomination next week and am hopeful that Mr. \nLee will be confirmed before the Senate adjourns.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Oct. 20, 1997]\n\nFine Choice for U.S. Rights Post--L.A. Attorney Should be Confirmed by \n                        the Senate Without Delay\n\n       Los Angeles civil rights attorney Bill Lann Lee is a smart, \n     pragmatic consensus builder who has proven himself in \n     fighting discrimination based on race, national origin, \n     gender, age or disability. He has the expertise, the \n     experience and the temperament to head the Justice \n     Department's civil rights division. This nomination should be \n     a slam dunk for the Senate. Instead it has become a partisan \n     referendum on President Clinton's continued support for some \n     form of affirmative action.\n       If confirmed, Lee, the western regional counsel of the \n     NAACP Legal Defense Fund, would become the first Asian \n     American to manage the 250-lawyer division. He would be well \n     positioned to broaden civil rights enforcement to accommodate \n     the nation's multicultural dynamics.\n       Some Republicans are seizing on Lee's opposition to \n     Proposition 209, the anti-affirmative action ballot measure \n     approved last November by California voters. But what else \n     might be expected from a veteran civil rights lawyer? And \n     during his confirmation hearing he promised to abide by the \n     law of the land, which awaits a Supreme Court ruling on the \n     constitutionality of Proposition 209.\n       Nominees to the federal civil rights post do often run into \n     political trouble. During the Reagan administration, a \n     Democratic majority blocked the promotion of Bradford \n     Reynolds, who opposed busing and other traditional civil \n     rights remedies. A Bush nominee, William Lucas, was blocked \n     on similar grounds. Clinton's first choice, Lani Guinier, hit \n     a wall of GOP rejection. Later, Deval Patrick was confirmed; \n     he resigned in January.\n       Conservatives should love Lee. The son of poor Chinese \n     immigrants who owned a hand laundry in Harlem, Lee made it on \n     merit. He graduated with high honors from Yale and Columbia \n     University Law School and could have enriched himself in \n     private practice. Instead, he has spent 23 years in civil \n     rights law.\n       Even legal adversaries admire him. Mayor Richard Riordan, a \n     Republican, was on the other side when the NAACP Legal \n     Defense Fund accused the MTA of providing inferior service to \n     poor, inner-city bus riders. Lee built a strong case, then \n     negotiated a settlement that saved the city substantial legal \n     fees while still achieving more equitable transportation in \n     Southern California. Riordan praised Lee for ``practical \n     leadership and expertise'' that eschewed divisive politics.\n       Bill Lee is well qualified to become assistant attorney \n     general for civil rights and his nomination should be \n     approved now.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Aug. 27, 1997]\n\n                       Justice for Bill Lann Lee\n\n       Bill Lann Lee is being unjustly booed. President Clinton \n     wants Lee to be the next assistant attorney general in charge \n     of the Justice Department's civil rights division, but \n     critics are branding Lee an extremist.\n       Such name-calling is a waste. Lee, a 48-year-old Asian-\n     American, isn't a subversive. He's western regional counsel \n     for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. But that \n     worries Clint Bolick. The director of litigation at the \n     Institute for Justice, a conservative Washington public \n     interest law firm, Bolick argues that Lee's organization \n     doesn't reflect mainstream thinking on civil rights. And \n     Senator Orrin Hatch has said he'll search to see whether Lee \n     favors quotas.\n       The NAACP Legal Defense Fund isn't a fringe group. It's the \n     organization that brought America Brown v. Board of \n     Education, the 1954 Supreme Court ruling that outlawed \n     segregation in the public schools.\n       As for Lee, even past legal opponents call him a pragmatic \n     problem-solver. One example is a 1994 federal civil rights \n     class-action suit against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan \n     Transportation Authority. The suit charged that resources \n     were unfairly distributed: The suburbs were overserved; the \n     inner city was underserved. Lee focused on solving the \n     transportation problem instead of punishing the \n     transportation system. The resulting settlement will be worth \n     an estimated $1 billion over 10 years to Los Angeles bus \n     riders.\n       Lee's career is a crucial reminder that the country can't \n     let the word ``quota'' scare it away from addressing racial \n     injustice. He is part of the Legal Defense Fund's tradition \n     of tackling important but unpopular issues, including \n     environmental racism, police brutality, and housing. And \n     ultimately, it isn't lawyers who create change, explains \n     Theodore Shaw, associate director and counsel for the Defense \n     Fund: they only create a window of opportunity in which \n     change can happen--if communities follow through. As the \n     Senate scrutinizes Lee, it ought to see the merits of his \n     record, one of asking everyone--plaintiffs and defendants \n     alike--to remedy injustice.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 1997]\n\n                           The Lee Nomination\n\n       In July, the president nominated Bill Lann Lee, western \n     regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational \n     Fund, to be assistant attorney general for civil rights. The \n     post had then been vacant for half a year. On Wednesday, Mr. \n     Lee had his confirmation hearing. The nomination now should \n     be approved.\n       The choice of Mr. Lee has drawn some limited opposition, as \n     civil rights nominations by either party almost always seem \n     to do these days. In this case, however, even opponents, some \n     of them, have acknowledged that, from a professional \n     standpoint, Mr. Lee is qualified. The issue is not his \n     professional competence. The objection is rather to the views \n     of civil rights that he shares with the president, and which, \n     in the view of the critics, should disqualify him.\n       Mr. Lee's views appear to us to be well inside the bounds \n     of accepted jurisprudence. He is an advocate of affirmative \n     action, as you would expect of someone who has spent his \n     entire professional career--23 years--as a civil rights \n     litigator. The president has likewise generally been a \n     defender of such policies against strong political pressures \n     to the contrary. But Mr. Lee himself observed that the \n     assistant attorney general takes an oath to uphold the law as \n     set forth by the courts, and so he would. The range of \n     discretion in a job such as this is almost always less than \n     the surrounding rhetoric suggests.\n       Mr. Lee over his career has brought a considerable number \n     of lawsuits in behalf of groups claiming they were \n     discriminated against, and has sought and won resolutions \n     aimed at making the groups whole, somehow defined. It is that \n     kind of group resolution of such disputes that some people \n     object to, on grounds that the whole object of the exercise \n     should be to avoid labeling and treating people as members of \n     racial and other such groups. There is surely some reason for \n     the discomfort this group categorizing generates. But the \n     courts themselves continue to uphold such actions in limited \n     circumstances. And Mr. Lee has won a reputation for resolving \n     such cases sensibly. Los Angeles's Republican Mayor Richard \n     Riordan is one who supports the nomination. ``Mr. Lee first \n     became known to me as opposing counsel in an important civil \n     rights case concerning poor bus riders in Los Angeles,'' he \n     has written. ``The work of my opponents rarely evokes my \n     praises, but the negotiations could not have concluded \n     successfully without Mr. Lee's practical leadership and \n     expertise. . . . Mr. Lee has practiced mainstream civil \n     rights law.''\n       There are lots of legitimate issues to be argued about in \n     connection with civil rights law. Mr. Lee's nomination is not \n     the right vehicle for resolving them. Senators, including \n     some who no doubt disagree with some of his views, complain \n     with cause about the continuing vacancies in high places at \n     the Justice Department. This is one they should fill before \n     they go home.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 29, 1997]\n\n                        A Chief for Civil Rights\n\n       The important post of Assistant Attorney General for Civil \n     Rights has been vacant for nearly a year, sending the wrong \n     message about the nation's commitment to enforce anti-\n     discrimination laws.

Bill Lann Lee Confirmation.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: As an Assistant City Attorney for \n     the City of Los Angeles--and opposing counsel to Bill Lann \n     Lee\n\n[[Page S11533]]\n\n     in recent federal civil rights litigation--I read with \n     concern the October 27 letter to you from the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives. I believe the Speaker has been \n     misinformed about many of the facts set out in that letter, \n     and therefore the conclusions he reaches about Mr. Lee's \n     fitness for public office, and in particular for the position \n     of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, are \n     unwarranted.\n       The Speaker's letter begins by asserting that Mr. Lee \n     ``attempted to force through a consent decree mandating \n     racial and gender preferences in the Los Angeles Police \n     Department.'' This assertion is erroneous. In the course of \n     representing the City of Los Angeles, I have for the past \n     seventeen years monitored the City's compliance with consent \n     decrees affecting the hiring, promotion, advancement, and \n     assignment of sworn police officers. I have negotiated on the \n     City's behalf two of those decrees. Of those two, Mr. Lee was \n     opposing counsel on the first, and was associated with \n     opposing counsel on the second. None of these decrees \n     mandates the use of racial or gender preferences. In fact, \n     each of them contains provisions forbidding the use of such \n     preferences.\n       For the same reasons, the Speaker's statement that the use \n     of racial and gender preferences ``would have been a back-\n     door thwarting of the will of the people of California with \n     regard to Proposition 209 (the California Civil Rights \n     Initiative)'' is inapposite. Because the decrees with which \n     Mr. Lee was associated do not call for racial or gender \n     preferences, and in fact forbid them, these decrees do not \n     violate the requirements or the intent of Proposition 209.\n       Of particular concern to me is the Speaker's reference to \n     ``the allegation that Mr. Lee apparently employed dubious \n     means to try to circumscribe the will of the judge in the \n     case.'' This allegation is wholly untrue. The case being \n     referred to is presently in litigation in the district court. \n     Mr. Lee was not at any time a named counsel in the case, but \n     was associated with opposing counsel because of his \n     involvement in the negotiation of a related consent decree. \n     Neither Mr. Lee nor any opposing counsel attempted in any \n     fashion to thwart the will of the judge supervising the \n     litigation. The matter had been referred by the court to a \n     magistrate judge appointed by the court to assist in the \n     resolution of the case. Each counsel had advised the district \n     judge at all points about the progress of the matter. Upon \n     reconsideration, the district judge elected to assert direct \n     control over the litigation. Nothing in Mr. Lee's conduct \n     reflected any violation of the court's rules, either in fact \n     or by appearance.\n       Bill Lann Lee and I have sat on opposite sides of the \n     negotiating table over the course of several years. Although \n     we have disagreed profoundly on many issues, I have \n     throughout the time I have known him respected Bill's candor, \n     his thorough preparation, his sense of ethical behavior, and \n     his ability to bring persons holding diverse views into \n     agreement. He would, in my view, be an outstanding public \n     servant and a worthy addition to the Department of Justice.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Robert Cramer,\n                                          Assistant City Attorney.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, earlier this week, Senators received a \n``Dear Colleague'' letter and accompanying material from my friends and \ncolleagues, Senators Chafee and Domenici. This letter included several \nrepresentations regarding the substance and effect of the Byrd-Gramm-\nBaucus-Warner amendment in comparison to that of the Chafee-Domenici \namendment to S. 1173, the ISTEA reauthorization bill.\n  I have already addressed a number of these issues on the floor over \nthe last two days. However, I thought it would be valuable for Senators \nto review a memorandum that evaluates in detail the representations \nmade by Senators Chafee and Domenici in their ``Dear Colleague'' \nletter. This analysis was prepared by Dr. William Buechner, Director of \nEconomics and Research at the American Road and Transportation Builders \nAssociation.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that Dr. Buechner's analysis be \nprinted in the Record at this point, and I hope all Members will \ncarefully review this material and become cosponsors of the Byrd-Gramm-\nBaucus-Warner amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Senate Transportation & Budget LA's\n     From: Dr. William Buechner, Director of Economics & Research \n         American Road & Transportation Builders Association\n     Date: October 29, 1997\n     Re: Dear Colleague by Senators Domenici and Chafee on Byrd-\n         Gramm-Baucus-Warner Amendment to S. 1173 (ISTERA II)\n       Yesterday, you received a dear colleague letter from \n     Senators Domenici and Chafee claiming that forty-three states \n     would lose highway money under the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner \n     Amendment to S. 1173. This claim was made on the basis of \n     tables and charts prepared by the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation under instructions from the Environment and \n     Public Works Committee. A front page article on this \n     memorandum appeared in the October 28 edition of Congress \n     Daily A.M., which gives the Domenici-Chafee analysis the \n     illusion of accuracy and authority.\n\n\n                            don't be misled\n\n       The purpose of the Domenici-Chafee dear colleague letter is \n     to obscure the fact that the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner \n     amendment will provide $28 billion more for highways during \n     the next five years than ISTEA II as reported, while the \n     proposed Domenici-Chafee amendment will not. Nonetheless, the \n     letter suggests that it is appropriate to compare the two \n     proposals as though both provide the same amount of funding. \n     This creates the impression that some states would receive \n     less under Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner than under Domenici-\n     Chafee. Here are the facts:\n       The Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment authorizes an \n     increase in formula funding for highway programs of about $28 \n     billion over the five-year period FY 1999-2003, to be \n     distributed among the states based on the precise \n     distribution formula in the committee bill. Since the program \n     authorization levels in ISTEA II will put an upper limit on \n     the amount Congress can spend on highway during the next six \n     years, the only way to increase highway spending is to \n     increase the amounts authorized in ISTEA II, which is \n     precisely what the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment does. \n     The implication of the Domenici-Chafee dear colleague letter \n     that the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment provides no more \n     funding than ISTEA II as reported is simply wrong and \n     completely misrepresents the intent of the amendment.\n       The Domenici-Chafee approach would lock the highway program \n     into the inadequate authorization levels currently specified \n     in ISTEA II in exchange for a procedure by which Congress \n     could add more money at some future time if it so wishes. \n     This pig-in-a-poke asks the American people to give up the \n     higher authorizations for highways provided in Byrd-Gramm-\n     Baucus-Warner for the hope that Congress might deliver the \n     equivalent at some future date. Of course, Congress will \n     still have to pass higher obligation limitations and \n     appropriations under either approach, but the Byrd-Gramm-\n     Baucus-Warner amendment lets us lock in the necessary \n     authorization level today.\n       The Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment also authorizes \n     additional spending for the Appalachian Highway Development \n     System and changes most of the funding for the Border \n     Corridor program from a general fund authorization into \n     contract authority. The Environment and Public Works \n     Committee-directed table assumes that funds for these \n     initiatives would be paid ``off the top'' and implies that \n     states would have to give up money from other highway \n     programs no matter what level is appropriated for the highway \n     program. In fact, the authorization for these programs in the \n     Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment are fully subject to any \n     annual obligation limitation as are other highway programs. \n     Moreover, these programs would be funded in the same \n     proportion as other programs in the bill.\n       In truth, the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment provides \n     an increase in authorization for all of the highway programs \n     in ISTEA II in the same proportion as provided for in the \n     underlying bill. As the annual level of appropriations rise, \n     the funds available for all states will rise with it. You \n     cannot compare the state-by-state allocations under Byrd-\n     Gramm-Baucus-Warner versus Domenici-Chafee at the same level \n     of spending, as the dear colleague letter attempts, because \n     the two do not provide the same level of spending. Instead, \n     the appropriate comparison would pit the fully-funded Byrd-\n     Gramm-Baucus-Warner against the anemic level of funding under \n     Domenici-Chafee, in which case every state wins and wins big \n     under the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment. The Byrd-Gramm-\n     Baucus-Warner amendment will make it possible to use the \n     revenues from the recent transfer of the 4.3 cents per gallon \n     of the Federal gasoline tax previously used for deficit \n     reduction into the Highway Trust Fund to provide \n     authorization for more than $5 billion per year in new funds \n     to allocate among all the states for highway investment.\n       In truth, every state stands to receive substantially more \n     under the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment than under ISTEA \n     II as reported. These additional funds are critical to meet \n     our nation's transportation needs.\n       I would be happy to discuss this with you if you have \n     questions. I can be reached at 202-289-4434.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11533-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11534]]\n                     ADDITIONAL COSPONSOR--S. 1173\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues an important matter, which I hope can receive consideration \nbefore we leave this fall.\n  Last week, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources \nunanimously reported out a bill, S. 1294, the Emergency Student Loan \nConsolidation Act of 1997. This measure is a modest, but extremely \nimportant, effort designed to assist students attempting to finance \ntheir higher education.\n  The measure enjoys broad bipartisan support. The House companion \nbill, H.R. 2335, was approved by a vote of 43 to 0 by the House \nCommittee on Education and the Workforce. This measure, with language \nidentical to S. 1294, as reported by the Labor Committee, was \nsubsequently approved by the full House under suspension by voice vote. \nIt has also been endorsed by national associations representing \nstudents and institutions of higher education.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Dr. Stanley O. Ikenberry, \npresident of the American Council on Education, be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the House measure is now being held at \nthe desk and is available for immediate action by the Senate. It has \nbeen cleared on the Republican side of the aisle. Unfortunately, due to \nobjections from the other side of the aisle, we are unable to consider \nit.\n  I want to take this opportunity to discuss the provisions of this \nlegislation and the need to move expeditiously on it. This legislation \ndoes two things:\n  First, it permits individuals to consolidate all their student \nloans--both Federal Direct Loan Program [FDLP] loans and Federal Family \nEducation Loan Program [FFELP] loans--into a FFELP consolidation loan. \nUnder current law, students who have both direct and guaranteed loans \nmay only consolidate them into an FDLP consolidation loan administered \nby the Department of Education.\n  The problem is that FDLP consolidation is not an option right now. \nSince August 26, the Department has suspended its consolidation program \nin an effort to deal with the backlog of 84,000 applications which had \npiled up prior to that time.\n  Second, it assures that students and their parents will enjoy the \nfull benefits of the educational tax credits contained within the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 by excluding these tax credits from \nconsideration when student financial need is being assessed.\n  Let me talk for a moment about why it is important to offer a loan \nconsolidation option to those students who, right now, have nowhere to \nturn. The student loan consolidation program allows students to \nconsolidate multiple student loans into a single loan that has several \nrepayment options. The benefits of consolidation include the \nconvenience of making a single monthly loan payment. In addition, the \nrepayment options can reduce monthly payments. For many young families, \nthese loans reduce their monthly payments enough to allow them to \nqualify for a mortgage for their first home.\n  In my view, we need to make every possible effort to assure that \nconsolidation is a benefit to students--not just another obstacle \ncourse. A New York Times article about the series of problems which has \nplagued the FDLP consolidation program operated by the Department of \nEducation under contract with Electronic Data Systems Corp. brings to \nlife the individuals whom this legislation is trying to help.\n  Consider the following account regarding Shannan Elmore:\n\n       It seemed like a simple enough thing to do: consolidate 10 \n     different Government-sponsored college loans due over 10 \n     years into one jumbo loan payable over 25, slashing the \n     monthly payment to $350 from $448. That was one of the last \n     things standing between Shannan Elmore and mortgage approval \n     for the house--the one whose concrete foundation her husband \n     had proposed in front of--that she wanted to build near \n     Boulder, CO. But Mrs. Elmore, a 30-year-old chemist who \n     graduated in May 1996 with a master's degree and $43,000 of \n     debt, said it took eight months for the Electronic Data \n     Systems Corporation to do the paperwork--far too long to \n     satisfy the mortgage lender. During those months, Mrs. Elmore \n     said, she called frequently only to be put on hold--for as \n     long as 45 minutes--and received one promissory note missing \n     the very page her lender needed to see. She said she was \n     still trying to clear up a loan that E.D.S. thinks it paid \n     off twice and for which it is double-billing her. The Elmores \n     eventually qualified for a mortgage, but for a different \n     house.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \narticle, which appeared in the New York Times on October 1, 1997, \nappear in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Department of Education officials have \nbeen working diligently to resolve the problems with the consolidation \nprogram and have indicated that it will reopen by December 1. I believe \nwe would all welcome seeing the program back on its feet. In the \nmeantime, we need to give students another option right now.\n  We also need to help alleviate the pressure on the direct \nconsolidation loan program which will inevitably occur when it \nreopens--only to face the pent-up demand built up over a 3-month \nperiod. Prior to the shutdown, applications were running approximately \n12,000 per month.\n  This legislation is intended to provide immediate relief to students \nand is designed specifically for that purpose. It modifies the current \nFFELP consolidation program to assure that loan subsidies are \nmaintained, to provide for the same interest rate in effect for FDLP \nconsolidation loans, and to protect borrowers against discrimination.\n  The bill does not, nor is it intended to, address every issue which \nhas been raised with respect to the loan consolidation provisions of \nthe Higher Education Act. In anticipation that these issues would be \nfully debated and addressed in next year's reauthorization of the act, \nthe consolidation provisions of this legislation will expire on October \n1, 1998.\n  Finally, this legislation also includes important provisions dealing \nwith the calculation of student aid under the Higher Education Act.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 contained two educational tax credits \ndesigned to help students and their families pay for the rising cost of \nhigher education. Under current law, the need analysis formula will \nconsider students and their parents who receive the tax credit as \nhaving greater resources to pay for college, thereby reducing their \neligibility for student financial aid. As a result, students and their \nfamilies will find their financial aid reduced and that the amount they \nexpended for higher education remained relatively unchanged by the \neducational tax credits.\n  If the change in the need analysis formula included in this \nlegislation is not made, approximately 69,000 individuals will lose an \nestimated $120 million in student financial aid.\n  I do not believe that this needed relief for students should be \nfurther delayed, and I urge my colleagues to withdraw their objections \nso we can get this measure to the President.\n  Mr. President, I want to just please urge those who are opposing the \nconsideration of this bill to at least take the time to fully \nunderstand the ramifications of their failure to allow this bill to \ncome up. I am sure that when they do so, they will recognize that this \nis not something which should be left undone before we leave here this \nfall.\n\n[[Page S11535]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    American Council on Education,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: I write on behalf of the undersigned to \n     express our strong support for S. 1294, the ``Emergency \n     Student Loan Consolidation Act of 1997.'' This urgent \n     legislation contains two important provisions, each of which \n     provides significant benefits for students.\n       First, the bill amends the student aid need analysis \n     section of Title IV to exclude from parental or student \n     income the amount of any tax credit claimed under the \n     ``Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.'' This is an essential \n     conforming change that is necessary to fulfill the intent of \n     framers of the tax bill regarding the Hope Scholarship and \n     Lifetime tax credits.\n       Second, the bill provides temporary, but much-needed, \n     relief for tens of thousands of borrowers whose access to \n     Direct Consolidation loans has been limited due to the \n     problems experienced by the Department of Education in \n     implementing the Consolidation program. While we hope the \n     Department will soon eliminate the massive backlog of \n     applications, and that it will be able to accept and process \n     applications soon, it is important to provide additional \n     consolidation options for borrowers who desperately need help \n     now. S. 1294 will provide several significant borrower \n     benefits:\n       The bill allows borrowers to consolidate their student \n     loans not only through the Direct Consolidation program, but \n     also through the lender of their choice in the Federal Family \n     Education Loan Program (FFELP).\n       It lowers the interest rate on FFEL Consolidation loans, \n     and sets a maximum cap on interest at the same rate as is \n     currently in effect for Direct Consolidation loans.\n       It equalizes the treatment of certain interest exemption \n     benefits for all borrowers by extending the Direct \n     Consolidation program's treatment of these exemptions to the \n     FFEL Consolidation program.\n       The bill provides adequate non-discrimination provisions \n     that go beyond current law in FFELP in limiting lender \n     discretion.\n       We respectfully request that you join us in supporting this \n     important legislation, which provides a broad array of much-\n     needed student benefits.\n     Sincerely,\n                                             Stanley O. Ikenberry,\n                                                        President.\n       On behalf of the following:\n       American Council on Education.\n       American Association of Community Colleges.\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities.\n       Association of American Universities.\n       National Association of Graduate and Professional Students.\n       National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities.\n       National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant \n     Colleges.\n       United States Public Interest Research Group.\n       United States Student Association.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 1, 1997]\n\n  Dropping the Ball in Juggling Loans; a Lot of Fumbles by E.D.S. in \n                        Processing Student Debt\n\n                        (By Carol Marie Cropper)\n\n       Dallas, Sept. 30.--It seemed like a simple enough thing to \n     do: consolidate 10 different Government-sponsored college \n     loans due over 10 years into one jumbo loan payable over 25, \n     slashing the monthly payment to $350 from $558. That was one \n     of the last things standing between Shannan Elmore and \n     mortgage approval for the house--the one whose concrete \n     foundation her husband had proposed in front of--that she \n     wanted to build near Boulder, Colo.\n       But Mrs. Elmore, a 30-year-old chemist who graduated in May \n     1996 with a master's degree and $43,000 of debt, said it took \n     eight months for the Electronic Data Systems Corporation to \n     do the paperwork--far too long to satisfy the mortgage \n     lender.\n       During those months, Mrs. Elmore said, she called \n     frequently only to be put on hold--for as long as 45 \n     minutes--and received one promissory note missing the very \n     page her lender needed to see. She said she was still trying \n     to clear up a loan that E.D.S thinks it paid off twice and \n     for which it is double-billing her. The Elmores eventually \n     qualified for a mortgage, but for a different house.\n       Mrs. Elmore is one of tens of thousands of recent graduates \n     who have endured months of red tape as E.D.S. has struggled \n     during the last year to fulfill its contract with the \n     Education Department to run the Government's four-year-old \n     effort to gain control of the nation's student loans. The \n     delays have resulted in a Congressional hearing, prompted \n     calls for legislation and given a black eye to both the \n     Education Department and to E.D.S., the giant computer \n     services company that is based in the Dallas suburb of Plano.\n       At the hearing, held Sept. 18, Marshall Smith, Acting \n     Deputy Secretary of the department, testified that it had \n     taken E.D.S. almost five months, on average, to complete each \n     loan consolidation, creating a backlog of 84,000 \n     applications. To give E.D.S. time to catch up, the department \n     ordered it to stop accepting new consolidation requests in \n     August.\n       This very public stumbling has put expansion of the \n     Government's so-called direct student loan program in \n     jeopardy. Republicans who opposed the Clinton \n     Administration's 1993 effort to move student loans away from \n     banks and into the hands of the Education Department are back \n     in force.\n       ``What we said in '93 has come home to roost,'' said \n     Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, chairman of \n     the subcommittee of the Committee on Education and the Work \n     Force that held the recent hearing. Critics of the program \n     said that it was doomed to create inefficiencies and \n     bottlenecks.\n       Under the direct-loan program, student loans are issued by \n     the Government, instead of by banks or other private lenders. \n     The program is supposed to simplify life for students, who \n     often have to borrow from more than one bank and then keep \n     track of loans that are sold to lenders in other parts of the \n     country.\n       The program is also supposed to trim Government \n     administrative and interest expenses paid to lenders in the \n     separate student loan operation in which repayment is simply \n     guaranteed by Washington. And it provides students with more \n     lenient repayment methods--allowing them to pay based on \n     their income. The direct program has proved popular with \n     students: it now represents about $20 billion in outstanding \n     loans, about 16 percent of the total student debt, and is \n     being used by 36 percent of all students borrowing for \n     college expenses. E.D.S. issues the direct loans and oversees \n     their consolidation.\n       To help ease the consolidation logjam--and, not \n     incidentally, slow the direct program's forward motion--\n     critics of Government lending have scheduled a committee vote \n     Wednesday on a measure that would allow students to \n     consolidate loans through a bank even if one or more of the \n     loans had been issued by the Government. That option is not \n     currently available to them. If the measure is approved, it \n     would go to the full House for consideration.\n       Both E.D.S. and the Education Department say the logjam \n     results from an unexpectedly large influx of consolidation \n     applications and from a surprising amount of complexity in \n     the process. E.D.S. said it had based its winning bid for the \n     contract on department specifications that had forecast much \n     less work. The department said it expected 7,000 to 8,000 \n     applications each month; the actual rate was 12,000 a month.\n       But analysts that follow E.D.S., along with an executive of \n     the Maryland company that previously held the contract, \n     suggest another explanation--that an E.D.S. eager to win \n     business may have underbid the job in 1995 by underestimating \n     how many workers would be needed. E.D.S. has had to add 77 \n     customer service representatives to the 100 it originally \n     assigned to the contract, and last year it replaced the \n     managers running the project.\n       Education Department officials acknowledge that they do not \n     have the expertise to guide such a complicated computer \n     effort. ``A lot of the problems we run into with government \n     is we don't block and tackle correctly,'' Thomas Bloom, \n     inspector general for the department, testified at the Sept. \n     18 hearing. The General Accounting Office, the Congressional \n     watchdog, has repeatedly questioned the department's \n     technical ability to handle financial aid information.\n       George Newstrom, an E.D.S. corporate vice president for \n     government contracts, said the company did not improperly \n     underbid. ``We don't do that,'' he said E.D.S. would have had \n     enough employees to do the work if the Government's estimates \n     had been correct, he said.\n       But E.D.S. has acknowledged that it miscalculated on other \n     contracts that were bid around this time. In August, E.D.S. \n     said that it had re-evaluated profits related to about a \n     dozen contracts booked in 1994 and 1995, lowering the \n     numbers. The changes cost the company $80 million in \n     pretax income.\n       Investor concerns over those errors combined with \n     disappointing quarterly earnings to drive E.D.S.'s stock from \n     a 52-week high of $63.375 last October to $35.50 today. The \n     company is in the middle of a revamping that will shed 8,500 \n     of its 100,000 jobs.\n       E.D.S. dismissed at least one of the managers responsible \n     for the troubled contracts, according to Myrna Vance, \n     E.D.S.'s corporate vice president for investor relations.\n       Mrs. Vance said the student loan account was not on the \n     problem list in August. It is too early to tell whether the \n     need to assign additional service representatives will mean \n     lower profits there, she said.\n       The company's February 1995 bid to the Education Department \n     was submitted at a time when, analysts say, E.D.S. was in a \n     period of flux and managers were especially eager to win \n     contracts.\n       E.D.S. was still adjusting to bruising competition from \n     I.B.M., which had barged onto its turf in 1991 with \n     aggressive bids for contracts that had long gone to the Texas \n     company. Also, top E.D.S. management was distracted by the \n     company's planned 1996 spinoff from the General Motors \n     Corporation, which had bought the company from its founder, \n     Ross Perot, in 1984. The spinoff would remove E.D.S. from \n     G.M.'s protective wing, leaving it to stand or fall on its \n     own.\n       E.D.S., long the industry leader in handling computer \n     services for big clients, finished 1995 with $12.4 billion in \n     revenue, up from $10 billion the year before. But according \n     to a Merrill Lynch analyst, Stephen T. McClellan, the company \n     was finding it increasingly difficult to keep up the double-\n\n[[Page S11536]]\n\n     digit earnings growth it had come to regard as its due. \n     Worse, I.B.M. was gaining on E.D.S. for total contracts won \n     and would roar past in 1996.\n       It was in this atmosphere that E.D.S. prepared its $162 \n     million bid to issue and consolidate direct loans over a \n     five-year period. The bid was at least 50 percent lower than \n     the one submitted by the Maryland company that had been doing \n     the job, the CDSI/Business Applications Solutions unit of \n     Computer Data Systems Inc. E.D.S. soon won a second five-year \n     contract, worth $378 million, to service the loans.\n       Thomas A. Green, president of the CDSI unit, said that his \n     company had already started to see a surge in interest in the \n     direct-loan program--and the Education Department should have \n     know that. ``We were sending out applications all the time, \n     so it was clear that the popularity of the program was \n     growing,'' Mr. Green said. ``They weren't blind-sided at what \n     it was going to be when they took over,'' he said of E.D.S.\n       Mr. Green also said his company was never as backlogged as \n     E.D.S. has been. He said CDSI consolidated 144,000 loans in \n     the 22 months between January 1995 and November 1996, when it \n     finished its work. The average consolidation took 65 to 70 \n     days, he added.\n       That compares with an average of 142 for E.D.S., according \n     to Mr. Smith, the Education Department official. E.D.S. has \n     processed about 54,000 loans since taking over last \n     September, he told the House panel.\n       One of those affected by the delays is Robyn Higbee, who \n     says she went back and forth on the phone for six months to \n     consolidate two of her husband's law school loans totaling \n     $18,500. Mrs. Higbee struggled with this as the family moved \n     from Virginia to California, her husband studied for the bar \n     exam and started a new job, the couple bought their first \n     home and she gave birth to a baby who required heart surgery.\n       ``It was just something that was totally unnecessary,'' \n     Mrs. Hibgee, 25, said of the loan complications.\n       Randolph Dove, a spokesman for the company in its \n     Washington-area office, while not familiar with the details \n     of Mrs. Higbee's and Mrs. Elmore's cases, said that E.D.S. \n     regretted the difficulties any students have had. ``We've \n     been working very hard and have a lot of people dedicated to \n     resolving this,'' he said.\n       Over all, E.D.S. has recovered from its dry spell in \n     winning contracts. I.B.M. won $27 billion in new business \n     last year, compared with E.D.S.'s $8.4 billion, according to \n     Greg Gould, a computer services analyst at Goldman, Sachs, \n     but this year E.D.S. has already won or is close to signing \n     $16.4 billion worth of contracts. Also, gross margins are up \n     for the work E.D.S. managers are bringing in--25 percent \n     rather than the 16 percent on contracts in 1994 and 1995, Mr. \n     Gould said. And top management has increased its control of \n     underlings who may have been tempted to bid too low to win a \n     contract, he added. ``There's that winner's curse,'' he said. \n     ``You want to win and you just lower your price until you win \n     the contract.''\n       The prognosis for direct student loans is murkier. E.D.S. \n     expects to have the kinks out of its system and its backlog \n     erased by Dec. 1, Mr. Dove said. Students can then start \n     applying once more for consolidations, he said.\n       But the concern over the logjam is undercutting the \n     Government's plans to expand the program. Representative \n     McKeon, who introduced the legislation now before the \n     education committee, concedes that there are not enough \n     opponents of direct loans to kill the program outright. But \n     his bill would at least end the Government's monopoly over \n     consolidation that restricts all students who have any direct \n     loans.\n       For E.D.S.'s part, Mrs. Vance said that the publicity would \n     not have much impact on the company's prospects. ``One \n     contract is not going to set a trend or be a deterrent for \n     new business,'' she said.\n       The Education Department, however, is considering whether \n     to cancel the $378 million contract with E.D.S. for servicing \n     the loans. Such a move could come because applications for \n     new loans are, oddly enough, now running below expectations. \n     A cancellation would not be related to the problems with the \n     consolidations, a department spokesman said, adding that \n     another company's servicing contract is also in jeopardy.\n       But even some of the lawmakers who mostly blame the \n     Education Department for the program's troubles are asking \n     whether E.D.S. should be punished by being docked part of its \n     pay. Representative Peter Hoekstra, Republican of Michigan, \n     said he might favor doing that.\n       Even without that penalty, however, E.D.S. will feel some \n     pain, Mr. Hoekstra said, adding, ``I wouldn't want to be \n     identified as the vendor that forced the Federal Government \n     to shut down consolidations in the direct-loan program with a \n     backlog of 84,000 kids.''\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, yesterday, in perhaps the most \nantienvironmental vote of the Congress, the House of Representatives \npassed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. Like the Senate bill that \npassed earlier this year, the House bill unfairly targets Nevada, a \nState with no nuclear reactors, as the final destination for 80,000 \nmetric tons of high-level nuclear waste produced by the U.S. commercial \nnuclear utilities, most of which are located in the East.\n  The central feature of the bill passed by the House yesterday, like \nthe Senate bill, is the establishment of so-called interim storage of \nhigh-level commercial nuclear waste at the Nevada test site, about 80 \nmiles north of the metropolitan Las Vegas area, an area that comprises \nsome 1 million citizens.\n  Like its Senate counterpart, the House bill tramples on decades of \nenvironmental policy, ignores public health and safety and exposes the \nAmerican taxpayer to billions of dollars in cost to solve the private \nindustry's waste problem.\n  Fortunately, the President has indicated that he will veto either \nversion of this misguided legislation. We have secured the votes in the \nSenate to sustain President Clinton's veto.\n  While yesterday's House vote falls slightly short of the number \nrequired to sustain a veto in the House, we are still within striking \ndistance of the required number, and I believe that in the end this \nbill has little or no chance of becoming law.\n  As I have discussed many times here on the Senate floor, the nuclear \npower industry's legislation is nothing but corporate pork, plain and \nsimple. It is a bailout for a dying industry at the expense of both the \npocketbooks and the health and safety of the American public.\n  Nevada, as the industry's chosen destination for its waste, has \nobvious objections to this legislation. But, Mr. President, other \nregions are also rightfully concerned with the potential impact on \ntheir citizens. Under this legislation, in just a few short years, \n16,000 shipments of toxic, high-level nuclear waste will be transported \nby rail and highway through 43 States. More than 50 million Americans \nlive within 1 mile of the proposed rail and truck routes.\n  The bill requires the transportation of waste through many of our \nlargest\n\n[[Page S11537]]\n\nmetropolitan centers and provides no assurance that funds will be \navailable to provide training and equipment for emergency responders.\n  Moreover, the bill makes a mockery of our Nation's environmental \nprotection laws. It ignores the National Environmental Protection Act \nand would take precedence over nearly every local, State or Federal \nenvironmental statute or ordnance, including, among others, the Clean \nAir Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and many \nmore. It establishes radiation protection standards far lower than in \nany other Federal program and in complete contradiction to \ninternationally accepted thresholds.\n  The bill provides little or no public input or comment by affected \ncommunities or individuals and establishes a whole new set of \nunreachable deadlines, repeating the very mistakes Congress made in \n1982 with the original Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  All of this--the trampling of our environmental laws, the billions of \ndollars in subsidy to the nuclear power industry, and the grave threat \nto the health and safety of millions of Americans--is completely \nunnecessary. Nuclear utilities can and do store waste safely on site at \nreactors. In fact, the very same storage technology that the \nlegislation contemplates using at the Nevada test site is currently \nused at reactor sites around the country, with many more sites soon to \nfollow. No reactor in the United States has ever closed for lack of \nstorage.\n  Despite the scare tactics of the nuclear power industry, there is no \nstorage crisis. Objective scientific experts agree that there is no \nstorage crisis. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, an \nindependent oversight board created by the Congress, found in March of \n1996, and repeated again this year, that there is no compelling \ntechnical or safety reason to move spent fuel to a centralized interim \nfacility for the next few years. Nevertheless, the nuclear power \nindustry has been relentless in its efforts to move its waste to Nevada \nas soon as humanly possible, no matter what the consequences.\n  Mr. President, we will continue to do whatever we can to stop this \nlegislation from passing. With a firm veto threat in place and without \nthe votes to override the veto, I encourage the leadership of both the \nSenate and the House of Representatives to stop this exercise in \nfutility. Stop wasting Congress' time on ill-founded legislation that \nstands little or no chance of being enacted.\n  The American people deserve more from us than wasting our time on \nbillion-dollar subsidies for an industry that has spent too long \nalready at the public trough.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I came over to speak on a beautiful, lazy \nFriday afternoon--that is one of the times you can get the floor \nwithout having to sit around too long--and talk about three or four \nitems that I have just been reflecting on--nothing heavy.\n  But to take up campaign finance reform first, that issue has had the \nSenate tied in knots, now, for about 6 weeks, so tied in knots that we \nare not going to be able to finish the work that we ought to finish, \nparticularly on the highway transportation bill, and that is a real \ntragedy. Nevertheless, I have felt very strongly about this issue for a \nlong time, so strongly that earlier this year I introduced my own bill \nto provide for public financing of campaigns.\n  I think I could probably say without fear of contradiction--and at my \nage I am not likely to live long enough to see this country go to \npublic financing--and yet in my opinion that is the only solution: If \nyou take all private money out of financing of campaigns in this \ncountry then you know that any private money in a campaign is a \nviolation.\n  Senator Thompson has just announced--essentially announced--the \nshutting down of the hearings on campaign finance reform. Nobody's \nfault--I thought Senator Thompson did a credible job. I thought all the \nmembers of the committee did. But there really was not very much there, \nexcept occasional abuses, cases of neglect, inattention, and heavy \npartisanship, but very little in a way that could remotely be construed \nas illegal. Yet, for all the abuses--and there were some--uncovered and \ntestified to and about during those hearings, there is not any strong \nsentiment here to change the system under which those abuses occurred. \nIf we do nothing this year, we do nothing next year, you can rest \nassured the abuses will continue.\n  I come from the Democratic Party. Of course, when it comes to raising \nmoney, we are a threatened species. But completely aside from the \npolitics of the issue--and the fact is that the Republicans outraise \nus--I think our Democratic National Committee is in debt by $15 \nmillion. I saw a big story in the paper this morning that the \nDemocratic National Committee was going to raise $2.5 million at a \nretreat in Florida this weekend, and the story acted as though there \nwas something ominous and maybe certainly unethical about it. But it \ndidn't seem that way to me at all, not under the existing system. There \nis nothing wrong with people giving $50,000 a couple to attend a \nweekend retreat. That is a pretty steep price, but people do it every \nweekend in both parties. The price is just not normally that high.\n  But I also feel that as long as we allow that sort of thing to \ncontinue, we are effectively selling off the Government to the highest \nbidder. I said on the floor, and it bears repeating, you cannot expect \na democracy to function as it is supposed to function when money plays \nthe role it plays in our campaigns. So, I hope that, come next March or \nwhenever they have agreed to, if there has been such an agreement, that \nwe can address the McCain-Feingold bill. I am a cosponsor of the bill, \nbut I must say it pales compared to what I think ought to be done, \nnamely go to public financing and take private money out of it.\n  I saw a list in the Washington Post yesterday of all the incumbents \nand how much money they had in the bank and how much the challengers \nhad. And the incumbents are all friends of mine. This is not to \nbelittle them. They are simply taking advantage of the system as it is. \nBut the incumbents have millions in the bank and the challengers had \nvirtually nothing. As a country lawyer from a town of 1,200 people who \njumped up from a private practice to run for Governor--which most \npeople considered insane, trying to get me to submit to a saliva test--\nbelieve you me, I know the power of incumbency and I faced it.\n  In the first primary, I spent $90,000. You couldn't get on the \nevening news for a week for that today.\n  I don't want to get too preachy about it. This is something you can \nget preachy about. But the fact is, I see campaign finance reform now \nin a different way than I saw it even as recently as 2 or 3 years ago. \nI see it now as a real threat to this Nation. It is no longer, at least \nit should not be, a partisan matter. It is, and it shouldn't be, \nbecause everybody's future is at stake.\n  I saw in the paper this morning where one of the candidates in \nVirginia is going to be given $1 million by his party. I saw last week \nwhere one of the candidates for Susan Molinari's spot, I guess it is in \nNew York, that one of the parties is dumping $800,000 into that \ncampaign and that person's opponent had $35,000 in the bank. You don't \nhave to be brilliant to know how those races are going to come out. \nTelevision does it all and you cannot get on television without money. \nThat is what these massive contributions are all about.\n  Whoever has the most money 94 percent of the time wins. You can \nhardly call that a democracy because, as I say, it is threatening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11537-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11537-S11538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REDUCING THE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there is a lot of talk now since the \nPresident has announced that the deficit this year for 1997 is, I \nbelieve, $22.6 billion. That is an incredible figure. In 1993, you are \nlooking at a Senator who was genuinely concerned, really concerned, not \njust concerned, alarmed about where we were heading with these massive \ndeficits of $290 billion a year, and\n\n[[Page S11538]]\n\nno one seeming to want to do something about it, either cut spending or \nraise taxes, both of which would be necessary to address the problem.\n  I have said on the floor before, so far as I am concerned, regardless \nof what President Clinton does before or from now on, his legacy is \ngoing to be the bill in 1993 that addressed that problem in a very \ncourageous way, so courageous it cost a lot of Members on my side of \nthe aisle their seats. But it reduced the deficit from $290 billion a \nyear, and it is reduced to this year $22.6 billion. That is an awesome, \nawesome result, and one in which the people in this country ought to \ntake great pride.\n  Then I hear on the House side where the Speaker said, if we have a \nsurplus left next year, he would like to have it go on to defense \nspending. Completely aside from what I want to say on the subject, that \nis not where I want it to go. I want the so-called surplus to go right \ninto the National Treasury, because even though the deficit this year \nis $22.6 billion, that does not include $114 billion that we are using \nin trust funds--Social Security, airport, highway trust funds--to get \nto that point.\n  So while we are all patting ourselves on the back, Senator Hollings \nsays giving ourselves the Good Government Award, for doing something \nabout the deficit, we should not ever lose sight of the fact that the \n$22.6 billion is not the deficit. The deficit is $22.6 billion plus the \n$114 billion we are spending in trust funds by borrowing, and until we \nadd $114 billion in surplus to the $22.6 billion in deficit, we will \nnot have a balanced budget.\n  I agree with Alan Greenspan--I don't always agree with him--but I \nagree with him on one thing. Even using the jargon of the Senate and \nassuming that $22.6 billion is the deficit, that is not the honest \ndeficit, but assuming that it is, if we have anything in excess of that \nnext year, I would like to see it go into the Treasury, because the \nmore we pay on the national debt, the lower interest rates are going to \ngo, and the lower interest rates go, the better off the economy is \ngoing to be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11537-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11538-S11539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, everybody has heard that old expression \nabout fools walk in where angels fear to tread. I have heard as a \npracticing lawyer, as a citizen and certainly as a Member of the U.S. \nSenate, as many tales about the IRS as anybody in this body. There have \nbeen unbelievable abuses, a lot of which have been aired in the \nhearings that Chairman Roth held in the Finance Committee.\n  You don't get accomplished diplomats for what we pay auditors in the \nIRS. Oftentimes, you get somebody who really is, indeed, abusive. Even \nthough he is spending the taxpayer's money he is auditing, he can be \nvery unpleasant. It isn't just the abusiveness of the auditors. \nOccasionally it is also their incompetence.\n  I was trying to help somebody one time and made a phone call back \nwhen I was practicing law. ``We can't talk to you; send us a letter \nauthorizing us.''\n  I was a little offended by that, but at the same time, I understood. \nAnybody could call and say, ``I'm calling on behalf of'' somebody else. \nThey don't know who they are, so I had to get an affidavit from my \nclient and send it in saying I was authorized to represent her in a tax \ndispute.\n  But my point is all this legislation to abolish the IRS without \nputting anything in its place is not all that troubling to me because \nsomething has to give. You can't abolish the IRS and abolish the Tax \nCode without replacing it with something.\n  What you replace it with certainly ought not to be a flat tax. So far \nas I am concerned, the flat tax was created by the Flat Earth Society. \nA flat tax, No. 1, is not ever going to pass here because invariably it \ndoes not allow people to deduct interest on their homes. It doesn't \nallow charitable contributions. The church people, the universities of \nthe country who depend so extensively on giving are not ever going to \nsit still for a flat tax. If the middle- and lower-income groups of the \ncountry knew what the flat tax would do to them, they wouldn't stand \nstill for it.\n  I can promise you that under every flat-tax scenario I have seen, \npeople who make between $30,000 and $100,000 are going to wind up \npaying more, and people who make more than that are going to wind up \npaying less. I have not seen one single flat-tax proposal that doesn't \ntake all the progressivity out of the Tax Code.\n  I can tell you, I only have 1 more year in the Senate, but I am not \ngoing to vote during that year for anything that even smacks of a flat \ntax. Oh, everybody thinks it is so simple. Do you know why the Tax Code \nis so complex? Because of the U.S. Congress. They drafted it. We just \ngot through adding about 800 pages to it with the so-called balanced \nbudget bill.\n  Of course, it is complex. When you consider the myriad of \ntransactions that occur in this country and you are trying to deal with \nall of them and there are lobbyists all over the city asking for \nspecial favors--this little thing in our business, and this little \nthing in our business--that is the reason the code is indecipherable \ntoday. So don't blame the IRS because the Tax Code is indecipherable, \nblame the U.S. Congress. We are the ones who drafted every word of it.\n  So, Mr. President, bear in mind that for the last year--and the IRS \nhas many statistics on it--there is about $100 billion, somewhere \nbetween $92 and $95 billion in tax evasion every year.\n  What does that mean? Let's assume in the year 1997 that we collected \n$600 billion in personal income tax, and that is probably pretty close \nto correct. Assume further that the IRS had been able to collect the \n$100 billion which is not being paid that ought to be paid. You could \nreduce taxes by $100 billion. That would be pretty nice.\n\n  You hear all kinds of talk around here about tax cuts. But nobody \never wants to give the IRS any more money to enforce the Tax Code \nagainst those people who are paying no taxes. One of the reasons our \ntaxes are as high as they are is because of the underground economy \noperated by people who deal in cash and do not pay taxes for the \nprivilege of being an American citizen.\n  I am inclined to support--I read an op-ed piece in the Post this week \nstrongly opposed to this idea. I do not know whether it was this week \nor not. But this business of shifting the burden to the IRS from the \ntaxpayer has some merit.\n  I offered a bill in 1980, and it passed the Senate. It never passed \nthe House, but it passed the Senate. The Republicans liked it so well \nthey put it in their platform in the convention in 1980. But I had a \nprovision that said, any time a regulator comes into your plant and \ncharges you with a violation, you would have to sustain the burden of \nproving that that regulation was valid.\n  If somebody comes into your plant and says, ``Your fire extinguisher \nis 2 inches too high off the floor and, therefore, I'm fining you \n$100,'' it would be incumbent, under existing law, for the person who \nowned that plant to prove that Congress did not intend for him to pay a \nfine because his fire extinguisher was 2 inches too high off the \nground.\n  Under my bill that passed the Senate in 1980, the burden would have \nshifted to the regulator, the guy who is trying to impose the fine. He \nwould have to prove that the regulation is valid and within the intent \nof Congress. You shift the burden. But my bill excluded the Internal \nRevenue Code. I won't go into all the reasons we did that. It did not \nseem workable.\n  But now I am going to look very closely at this proposal of Bill \nArcher's, from the House, to shift the burden to the IRS when they \nallege that somebody is deficient or made a mistake on their tax return \nor generally state when the IRS is accusing somebody of owing money, \nthey will have to sustain the burden of proving that instead of \nshifting the burden immediately to the taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, I had one or two other issues I was going to talk \nabout. But in the interest of expediting this evening and allowing \npeople in the Senate to get out of here--they all look at me with mean \nlooks, so I know everybody is wanting to shut this place down--I will \nforgo a couple of other items and save them for next Friday afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S11539]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, section 344 of the National Highway System \nDesignation Act of 1995 required the Department of Transportation to \nimplement a motor carrier regulatory relief and safety demonstration \nproject. The purpose of this project was to determine whether certain \nmotor carriers with exemplary safety records could operate safely with \nfewer regulatory burdens.\n  Specifically, the Department was required to establish a pilot \nprogram for operators of vehicles between 10,001 and 26,000 pounds, \nunder which eligible drivers, vehicles, and carriers would be exempt \nfrom some of the Federal motor carrier safety regulations.\n  The safety data generated from this project was to serve as the basis \nfor assessing the appropriate level of future safety regulation for the \nmotor carrier industry.\n  The statute was clear. Section 344 required the Department of \nTransportation to ensure that participants in the project would be \n``subject to a minimum of paperwork and regulatory burdens necessary to \nensure compliance with the requirements of the program'' and to \n``represent a broad cross section of fleet size and drivers of eligible \nvehicles''.\n  Mr. President, I would inquire of the Majority Leader, what is the \nstatus of the motor carrier regulatory relief and safety demonstration \nproject which we mandated in 1995?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for raising this issue. \nThe letter and intent of the law concerning this program are not being \ncarried out at all.\n  The National Highway System Designation Act passed in 1995, and \nsection 334 mandated the motor carrier regulatory relief and safety \ndemonstration project. It required the Department of Transportation to \nimplement this project no later than August, 1996. However, the \nDepartment of Transportation did not even publish Final Guidelines for \nthe project until June 10 of this year--1 year later than required by \nlaw.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am, to be honest, somewhat taken aback by the \nDepartment of Transportation's obvious delay in implementing a \ncongressionally mandated program. And I understand that delay is not \nthe only problem afflicting this program.\n  The Final Guidelines, only published this year, appear to fall far \nshort of what was intended in section 334, both in terms of reducing \npaperwork and regulatory burdens and attracting a broad cross section \nof participating businesses. Potential business participants invested \nmany months of effort attempting to work with the Department of \nTransportation to create a functional program. However, the \nDepartment's Final Guidelines still create unreasonable barriers to \nmotor carrier participation, produce uncertainty in implementation and \nenforcement, and fail to reduce business paperwork.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would add that, at this time, there is not \na single applicant for the motor safety demonstration project.\n  This has not kept the Department from heralding the project as a \ncenterpiece of their so-called regulatory reform. For example, in the \nAugust 11, 1997 issue, of the industry publication ``Transport \nTopics,'' the Department's Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers, \nGeorge Reagle, referred to the project as a key part of the \nadministration's effort to ``provide common-sense government * * *.'' \nwhich offers ``the opportunity to further regulatory reform''. Mr. \nReagle further stated that ``This early step toward reform will set the \ntone for our entire regulatory future * * *.''\n  A centerpiece with no participants is an empty centerpiece. Words of \nself-praise are an inadequate response. The law was clear and \nimplementation is overdue.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it seems to me that if there has not been \na single participant in this program--which was intended as a way to \nrelieve the regulatory burden on those companies that have demonstrated \na good safety record--then something is amiss with this program.\n  I would hope that the Department would take a second look at this \nprogram and give serious consideration to making some changes that will \npermit the program to work in the manner in which Congress intended. It \nis clear that Congress desired to establish a means to achieve some \nregulatory relief and, thus far, we have not seen that result.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I fully agree with the Senator.

Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the Paducah \ngaseous diffusion plant [PGDP] in Paducah, KY. On October 20, 1997, \nIndustry Week Magazine recognized the Paducah facility as one of \n``America's 10 Best Plants'' from among 275 plants nominated for the \nhonor in 1997.\n  According to Industry Week, a national publication which annually \nsalutes the top performing manufacturing facilities in North America, \nthe dual purposes of the competition are ``to recognize plants that are \non the leading edge of North American efforts to increase \ncompetitiveness, enhance customer satisfaction, and create stimulating \nand rewarding work environments; and, to encourage other North American \nmanagers and work teams to emulate the honorees by adopting world-class \npractices, technologies, and improvement strategies.''\n  There is no question that the Paducah facility, a federally owned \nnuclear fuel enrichment plant managed by Lockheed Martin Utility \nServices, meets these criteria. In fact, it is a model for any \nmanufacturing plant in any industry in the country. Over the past 10 \nyears, the Paducah plant has nearly tripled output from 2.3 million \nunits per year to 6.8 million units per year. And this amazing increase \nin productivity was achieved using existing equipment and machinery. \nSimilarly, the percentage of production units in-line has risen from 57 \npercent of capacity in August 1993, to an impressive 96.9 percent in \nApril 1997. To top it all off, the Paducah facility boasts 100 percent \non-time delivery for the past 5 years with a zero product defect rate. \nNow that, Mr. President, is what quality American manufacturing is all \nabout.\n  On July 25, the Clinton administration gave formal approval to move \nforward with privatization for the U.S. Enrichment Corporation [USEC], \nthe Government entity that currently owns PGDP. Hopefully, this process \nwill be completed early in 1998. As I have maintained for the better \npart of 10 years, privatization will not only enable Paducah to utilize \ncutting edge technologies to keep it competitive in the world uranium \nmarket, it will also keep thousands of productive employees on the job \nwell into the next century.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article entitled \n``Lockheed Martin Utility Services'' be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11540]]\n\n                  [From Industry Week, Oct. 20, 1997]\n\n                    Lockheed Martin Utility Services\n\n                         (By John H. Sheridan)\n\n       Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the huge \n     production facility he runs is located smack dab in the \n     middle of a 4,000-acre wildlife refuge--complete with pesky \n     beavers and a herd of deer. Or maybe he just enjoys telling \n     animal stories. But if you ask Steve Polston about the \n     management philosophy that drove culture change--and an \n     impressive business turnaround--at the Paducah Gaseous \n     Diffusion Plant (PGDP) in Paducah, Ky., be prepared for a few \n     lessons in zoology.\n       For instance, there's his yarn about the ``tiger rabbit''--\n     a creature that has become the stuff of western Kentucky \n     legend.\n       Polston, who is general manger at PGDP, a nuclear-fuel \n     enrichment facility owned by the federal government and \n     managed by Lockheed Martin Utility Services, likes to show a \n     picture of one of these critters. It's your basic rabbit, but \n     it has black-and-orange stripes. ``It might look a little bit \n     like a tiger,'' says Polston, ``but you can't expect it to \n     act like a tiger.''\n       In a sense, that was his perception of the PGDP complex \n     about five years ago, when the initial steps were taken to \n     begin transforming the 1,550-employee facility from a \n     financially struggling unit of the U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE) \n     into a businesslike operation. An important step was passage \n     of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which spun the Kentucky \n     facility out of DOE--along with a sister plant in Portsmouth, \n     Ohio--and into a newly created government entity, the U.S. \n     Enrichment Corp. (USEC). Legislation adopted in 1996 set in \n     motion a plan to eventually privatize the business.\n       ``In the beginning,'' says Polston, ``we knew we weren't a \n     real business--even though they called us a business.''\n       For one thing, the culture of the plant was mired in a \n     can't-do mentality, the legacy of years of bureaucratic \n     oversight. For another, costs were out of control. ``We had \n     been losing market share because our costs were going up \n     rapidly,'' Polston recalls. In the early 1990s DOE analysts \n     had projected that USEC's world market share would drop from \n     46% to less than 20% by the year 2000. And there was \n     speculation that the two plants might close for good early in \n     the 21st century--a rather ominous projection, since the USEC \n     plants together supply 80% of the fuel to run nuclear \n     powerplants in this country. If they shut down, the U.S. \n     would no longer be self-sufficient in nuclear-fuel-processing \n     capability.\n       In trying to turn things around, the first challenge was to \n     get costs under control. But it was clear that would require \n     cultivating new attitudes--in the management ranks as well as \n     among the unionized workforce, which is represented by the \n     Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers (OCAW) Local 3550 and the \n     United Plant Guard Workers of America.\n       Explaining PGDP's approach to cost-control issues, Polston \n     sets the stage with--you guessed it--another animal story. \n     When an elephant is young, he points out, it is trained to \n     stay in place by a short tether attached to its leg and tied \n     to a stake. After years of conditioning it associates the \n     tether with an inability to move about freely. ``When an \n     elephant grows up,'' Polston explains, ``you can hold it in \n     place with a piece of old clothesline. After I came here six \n     years ago, I began to envision us as a big elephant \n     restrained by a small rope. Our workers thought it was \n     impossible to get our costs down.''\n       One way to begin changing that mentality was an infusion of \n     new management blood. Polston began recruiting senior \n     managers with backgrounds in commercial nuclear power--people \n     who understood the realities of a competitive business \n     environment. ``I wanted to break that rope,'' he explains. \n     ``I wanted their private-sector mentality to rub off on us.''\n       He also began preaching the merits of cycle-time reduction \n     and elimination of non-value-added activity. At the same \n     time, training, communications, and quality and teamwork \n     initiatives were intensified--with the support of OCAW union \n     leaders.\n       A primary cost-reduction thrust has been to emphasize the \n     use of lower-cost, nonfirm power, since electricity \n     represents 60% of the facility's total costs. To accomplish \n     this, the plant took a more aggressive approach in using \n     freezer/sublimer equipment developed by the Paducah \n     engineering staff, as well as a sophisticated computer \n     system, enabling the plant to reduce power consumption during \n     high-price periods and then make up the production slack by \n     increasing power usage during off-peak hours when rates are \n     lower.\n       A second key initiative--which called for broad involvement \n     by the workforce and rigorous adherence to procedures--was to \n     improve the reliability of process equipment. A strong \n     preventive-maintenance program was beefed up, and workers \n     were encouraged to participate widely in a problem-reporting \n     system that has cultivated a continuous-improvement \n     mentality. When an employee points out a problem or potential \n     problem, it goes into a corrective-action system that plant \n     officials describe as a ``bear trap'' that forces follow-up \n     activity. In some cases, joint union-management teams are \n     formed to investigate and implement solutions. In 1996 the \n     problem-reporting/suggestion system identified 6,000 plant \n     issues--generating about 10 times as many improvement ideas \n     as in years past.\n       When an employee fills out a problem-report form, he or she \n     is required to include suggestions on how to solve the \n     problem. ``Some of the suggestions have been very creative \n     and insightful,'' Polston notes. ``We identify low-threshold \n     problems before they become bigger problems.'' Coupled with \n     the problem-reporting system has been an extensive effort to \n     train employees in root-cause-analysis methods.\n       At the core of PGDP's extensive employee-communications \n     program has been an effort to translate business goals \n     established by USEC into terminology and objectives that the \n     entire workforce can identify with. After a winnowing \n     process, emphasis was placed on three key goals:\n       Ensure an accident-free environment.\n       Strive to get 100% of the plant's production cells on \n     stream.\n       Reduce the cost of SWUs--that is, ``separated work units,'' \n     a measure of the effort required to boost the U235 level in \n     the uranium hexafloride (UF6) processed by \n     hundreds of ``converters'' in the four-building production \n     complex.\n       To keep employees abreast of progress toward the goals, the \n     latest performance metrics are posted on a large sign at the \n     entrance to the property, so that when they drive in each \n     morning workers know exactly how they're doing. In addition, \n     color-coded charts posted in strategic locations provide at-\n     a-glance updates on progress toward the current Top 10 plant \n     objectives--which are established annually under the PGDP \n     Quality of Operations plan.\n       So how they have been doing?\n       Well, the predicted falloff in market share never occurred. \n     In fact, since 1992 USEC--which generates more than one-third \n     of its annual revenues from sales to overseas customers--has \n     increased its domestic market share and boosted its export \n     sales. In the last five years the Paducah plant has reduced \n     its manufacturing costs by nearly 11% while establishing an \n     enviable record of shipping product 100% on-time and 100% \n     within specification--without maintaining an inventory \n     buffer. And the folks at USEC headquarters in Washington have \n     ample reason to be pleased with the bottom-line results.\n       ``We're an example of efficiency in the public sector--and \n     we make a tidy profit for the U.S. Treasury,'' says John R. \n     Dew, who oversees training programs at Paducah and carries an \n     unusual title--manager of mission success. ``Our management \n     team has taken a 45-year-old bureaucratic government \n     operation and turned it into a profitable business that is at \n     the top of President Clinton's list for privatization,''\n       For 1996 USEC was able to report net income of $304.1 \n     million on sales of $1.41 billon--an enviable 21.6% profit \n     margin. If the U.S. Treasury Dept, the USEC's sole \n     shareholder, eventually does approve the sale of the business \n     to private interests--a move that could take place early next \n     year--it will mean a nice windfall for Uncle Sam. By some \n     estimates, the sale could prove to be the biggest U.S. \n     privatization move ever, exceeding the $1.6 billion sale of \n     Conrail in 1987.\n       Securing final approval of the sale could prove a bit \n     sticky, however, since the new owners would obtain access to \n     what is still considered highly classified technology--\n     including AVLIS, a next-generation enrichment process being \n     developed by USEC, in conjunction with Bechtel Corp.\n       Perhaps a little history will put the national security \n     issues into perspective. The Paducah facility was built in \n     1952 by the old Atomic Energy Commission, under orders from \n     President Harry Truman, to produce enriched uranium for \n     thermonuclear warheads--as a hedge against possible war in \n     Southeast Asia. The site met all of the official site-\n     selection criteria established during the early years of the \n     Cold War and at the height of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's anti-\n     Communism crusade. For one thing, Paducah was more than 100 \n     miles from any city with ``known Communist activity.''\n       In addition to the official criteria, the site selection no \n     doubt also was influenced by the fact that Paducah was the \n     home town of Alben W. Barkley, then U.S. vice president.\n       By 1964 the U.S. had developed an ample supply of weapons-\n     grade nuclear material, and the Paducah facility was \n     converted to production of fuel for nuclear power plants. In \n     simple terms, the enrichment process involves heating \n     cylinders containing solid UF6 until it gasifies, \n     then forcing the gas through a miles-long enrichment \n     ``cascade''--a series of converters separated by jet-engine-\n     like compressors. In each converter, uranium molecules pass \n     through a porous material, which gradually separates the \n     lighter U235 molecules from the heavier U238 molecules--\n     creating an ``enriched'' stream with a higher concentration \n     of U235. The enriched stream is eventually withdrawn and \n     cooled to a solid state in 14-ton cylinders.\n       Electrical power to drive the 1,860 motors in the system \n     comes from two primary utilities--including a nearby \n     Tennessee Valley Authority plant--along with electricity \n     purchased in the open market and ``wheeled'' to the Paducah \n     site. The power is distributed through four large power \n     switchyards, one for each of the four processing plants. \n     ``Just one of these switchyards could handle the power needs \n     of a city the size of Washington, D.C.,'' explains Terry \n     Sorrel, customer-relations representative.\n       The heart of the production complex is a large circular \n     control room that monitors the operation of all the equipment \n     on site. One section of the control room, called the\n\n[[Page S11541]]\n\n     ``Power Pit,'' manages the purchase and distribution of all \n     electrical power used throughout the facility. ``Our goal,'' \n     says Ron Taylor, power-operations manager, ``is to have a \n     reliable power supply at the lowest possible cost.''\n       Thanks to the sophisticated freezer/sublimer equipment, the \n     power load can be quickly adjusted by freezing or subliming \n     up to 200 tons of uranium gas. To reduce power requirements, \n     UF6 gas is withdrawn from the system and frozen.\n       Much of PGDP's progress during the last five years can be \n     attributed to a cooperative union-management relationship, \n     which has led to the creation of joint union-management teams \n     at various levels. For example, an empowered union-management \n     team developed a system to provide better heat protection to \n     people working in high-temperature areas. Teams also have \n     improved quality and maintenance efficiency (the site has 300 \n     maintenance workers). And one team developed a six-year plan \n     for facility upgrades.\n       Now, an effort is underway to expand the team concept by \n     creating high-performance work teams that will be responsible \n     for day-to-day operations. Added impetus for this initiative \n     came from a visit by union and management representatives to \n     another Lockheed Martin plant--a former ``Best Plants'' \n     winner--in Moorestown, N.J. ``Teamwork is a win/win \n     situation, but we realized that we were functioning on a \n     project basis,'' says Steve Penrod, operations manager. ``At \n     Moorestown, we saw a culture of teamwork in day-to-day \n     activities.''\n       Union officials support the high-performance team concept, \n     says Mike Jennings, an OCAW representative for continuous-\n     improvement programs. ``It is a slow process, since it is a \n     big change in culture,'' he says. ``We aren't going to force \n     teams on anyone.''\n       Paducah has taken a team approach to operations performance \n     improvement, placing heavy emphasis on a ``conduct of \n     operations'' code that demands ``rigorous attention to \n     detail,'' says Penrod. As part of the effort, a team \n     including hourly workers developed a ``Code of \n     Professionalism'' that specified how employees should conduct \n     themselves on the job.\n       Undergirding all of the performance-improvement efforts at \n     Paducah has been an extensive communications effort--which \n     includes ``All-Hands Meetings'' twice a year for 1,200 or \n     more employees. ``At these meetings, we reinforce our \n     expectations, we discuss our performance measures, and we \n     give people the opportunity to comment and raise any issues \n     they may have,'' explains Howard Pulley, enrichment plant \n     manager. ``Among other things, they may tell us which of our \n     systems are causing them to not be efficient.''\n       Then there are ``C2'' meetings--in which small groups of \n     employees focus on compliments and concerns. Every other \n     month, 15 people are selected at random to participate. After \n     discussion, the groups vote on their top three compliments--\n     citing things that are being done well--as well as their top \n     three concerns. ``We follow up on their issues and then \n     provide feedback,'' Pulley says.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11539-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING OCTOBER 24\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to laud the Senate passage of \nH.R. 672. This legislation, which was introduced by Congressman Coble \nin the House of Representatives, is the counterpart to legislation I \nintroduced in the Senate on March 20 of this year--the Copyright \nClarification Act of 1997, S. 506. The Copyright Clarification Act was \nreported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 17.\n  The purpose of these bills is to make technical but needed changes to \nour Nation's copyright laws in order to ensure the effective \nadministration of our copyright system and the U.S. Copyright Office. \nThe need for these changes was first brought to my attention by the \nRegister of Copyrights, Marybeth Peters, and I want to thank her for \nher outstanding work.\n  Among the most important amendments made by H.R. 672 is a \nclarification of the Copyright Office's authority to increase its fees \nfor the first time since 1990 in order to help cover its costs and to \nreduce the impact of its services on the Federal budget and the \nAmerican taxpayer. This clarification is needed because of ambiguities \nin the Copyright Fees and Technical Amendments Act of 1989, which \nauthorized the Copyright Office to increase fees in 1995, and every \nfifth year thereafter. Because the Copyright Office did not raise its \nfees in 1995, as anticipated, there has been some uncertainty as to \nwhether the Copyright Office may increase its fees again before 2000 \nand whether the baseline for calculating the increase in the consumer \nprice index is the date of the last actual fees settlement--1990--or \nthe date of the last authorized fees settlement--1995. H.R. 672 \nclarifies that the Copyright Office may increase its fees in any \ncalendar year, provided it has not done so within the last 5 years, and \nthat the fees may be increased up to the amount required to cover the \nreasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office.\n  Although H.R. 672 does not require the Copyright Office to increase \nits fees to cover all its costs, I believe it is important in that it \nprovides the Copyright Office the statutory tools to become self-\nsustaining--a concept that I promoted in the last Congress. Currently \nthe Copyright Office does not recover the full costs of its services \nthrough fees, but instead receives some $10 million in annual \nappropriations.\n  Several studies have supported full-cost recovery for the Copyright \nOffice. For example, a 1996 Booz-Allen & Hamilton management review of \nthe Library of Congress recommended that the Copyright Office pursue \nfull-cost recovery, noting that the Copyright Office has been subject \nto full-cost recovery in the past and that the potential revenues to be \nderived from pursuing a fee-based service was significant. A 1996 \ninternal Copyright Office management report prepared by the Library of \nCongress also recommended full-cost recovery for copyright services. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has also suggested full-cost recovery \nfor the Copyright Office as a means of achieving deficit reduction. \nThese recommendations were endorsed by the General Accounting Office in \nits recent report, ``Intellectual Property, Fees Are Not Always \nCommensurate with the Costs of Services.''\n  It is my understanding that the Copyright Office has embraced the \ngoal of achieving full-cost recovery for its copyright services. H.R. \n672 will provide the authority to achieve that goal, and by passing \nthis legislation this year, the Copyright Office will be able to move \nexpeditiously to adjust their fees for the coming year.\n\n[[Page S11542]]\n\n  I also want to note the importance of the amendment which the Senate \nhas adopted to H.R. 672 to overturn the ninth circuit's decision in La \nCienega Music Co. v. ZZ Top, 53 F.3d 950 (9th Cir. 1995), cert denied, \n116 S. Ct. 331 (1995). My colleagues will recall that Senator Leahy and \nI introduced this legislation in March of this year as a provision of \nS. 505, the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997.\n  In general, LaCienega held that distributing a sound recording to the \npublic--by sale, for example--is a ``publication'' of the music \nrecorded on it under the 1909 Copyright Act. Under the 1909 Act, \npublication without copyright notice caused loss of copyright \nprotection. Almost all music that was first published on recording did \nnot contain copyright notice, because publishers believed that it was \nnot technically a publication. The Copyright Office also considered \nthese musical compositions to be unpublished. The effect of La Cienega, \nhowever, is that virtually all music before 1978 that was first \ndistributed to the public on recording has no copyright protection--at \nleast in the ninth circuit.\n  By contrast, the second circuit in Rosette v. Rainbo Record \nManufacturing Corp. 546 F.2d 461 (2d Cir. 1975), aff'd per curiam, 546 \nF.2d 461 (2d Cir. 1976) has held the opposite--that public distribution \nof recordings was not a publication of the music contained on them. As \nI have noted, Rosette comports with the nearly universal understanding \nof the music and sound recording industries and of the Copyright \nOffice.\n  Since the Supreme Court has denied cert in La Cienega, whether one \nhas copyright in thousands of musical compositions depends on whether \nthe case is brought in the second or ninth circuits. This situation is \nintolerable. Overturning the La Cienega decision will restore national \nuniformity on this important issue by confirming the wisdom of the \ncustom and usage of the affected industries and of the Copyright Office \nfor nearly 100 years.\n  In addition to these two important provisions, H.R. 672 will:\n  First, correct drafting errors in the Satellite Home Viewer Act of \n1994, which resulted from the failure to take into account the recent \nchanges made by the Copyright Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, and which \nmistakingly reversed the rates set by a 1992 Copyright Arbitration \nRoyalty Panel for Satellite carriers;\n  Second, clarify ambiguities in the Copyright Restoration Act dealing \nwith the restoration of copyright protection for certain works under \nthe 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act;\n  Third, ensure that rates established in 1996 under the Digital \nPerformance Rights in Sound Recordings Act will not lapse in the event \nthat the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel does not conclude rate-\nsetting proceedings prior to Dec. 31, 2000.\n  Fourth, restore definition of ``jukebox'' and ``jukebox operator,'' \nwhich were mistakingly omitted when the old jukebox compulsory license \nwas replaced with the current negotiated jukebox license;\n  Fifth, revise the currently unworkable requirement of a 20-day \nadvanced notice of intent to copy right the fixation of live \nperformances, such as sporting events;\n  Sixth, clarify administrative issues regarding the operation of the \nCopyright Arbitration Royalty Panels;\n  Seventh, provide needed flexibility for the Librarian of Congress in \nsetting the negotiation period for the distribution of digital audio \nrecording technology [DART] royalties; and,\n  Eighth, make miscellaneous spelling, grammatical, capitalization and \nother corrections to the Copyright Act.\n  Mr. President, this is important legislation, and I am pleased the \nSenate has acted to approved it prior to adjourning this fall. I wish \nto thank my colleagues and to encourage the House to accept the Senate \namendment and to forward H.R. 672 to the President for his signature \nwithout delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11541-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, for the past few days, the Senate has \nbeen considering the conference report to accompany the Department of \nDefense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. While there are \nseveral areas of controversy, I would like to highlight one area that I \nbelieve has not been given sufficient consideration: funding for the \nNational Guard.\n  This bill contains a couple of disturbing provisions, not so much for \ntheir immediate impact, but for their long-term consequences. First, \nthe proposal to add a representative for the Guard and Reserves on the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, which I strongly support, has been watered down \nto call for two two-star advisors to the Chairman of the JCS. Mr. \nPresident, this is essentially the same role that the head of the \nNational Guard Bureau has today. I do not see this as an enhancement of \nthe Guard's status in the highest circles of decisionmaking. And I'm \ntold that in the Pentagon, two two-stars don't equal a four. I am \nafraid that the current pattern of decisionmaking is responsible for \nthe shortfall in resources for the National Guard that we see in the \nlegislation before us, and if it is not altered in a significant \nmanner, the National Guard is likely to have greater problems in the \nfuture.\n  The other provision that I would like to draw my colleagues attention \nto is the cut in Army National Guard personnel endstrength of 5,000. \nMr. President, we all understand that over the next few years, \nendstrengths will come down for all the services. But what this bill \ndoes is to pick out one component of the military and require it to \nmake a significant cut without calling on other components to begin \ntheir agreed-upon reductions. In fact, this bill forces reductions in \nthe only part of the U.S. Army to actually meet its endstrength \nrequirements. I am not sure that all my colleagues realize that because \nthe Army National Guard is actually over its required endstrength by \nabout 2,000 people, the legislation will force the layoff of more than \n5,000 young men and women who are currently serving their country. \nWhereas if similar cuts were to come in the active component, the cuts \nwould be implemented in large part by eliminating unfilled positions. \nThis does not seem to me to be the way to maintain a dedicated cadre of \nmilitary professionals.\n  Finally, I speak out today because I am concerned that this \nlegislation may be taken as a sign by some as a change in Congress' \nattitude toward the National Guard. I very strongly believe that the \nfuture of the U.S. Armed Forces must include a greater role for the \nGuard and Reserves, not a diminished one. As defense resources shrink, \nas the nature of our employment structures change, and as we develop \nbetter tools for keeping our weekend warriors up to speed as top \nquality practioners of their military arts, we must put more of our \nfaith in that part of the U.S. military that is closest to the people--\nthe National Guard.\n  For too long, Congress has been seen as the primary bastion of \nsupport for the Guard and Reserves--not the Pentagon. An example of \nthis is the administration's request for no new procurement funds for \nfiscal year 1998 for the Army Guard and Air Guard, out of a total \nprocurement budget request of $42,883,000,000. This is not only \nunrealistic--it is dangerous. And until the administration sends up a \nmore balanced request, Congress will have to continue its vigilance on \nbehalf of the Guard. But this is not the way it should be, Mr. \nPresident, and I am disappointed that the bill before us today did not \ntake advantage of the opportunity to change this situation.\n  It is my impression that a great debate continues to rage on the \nfuture structure of our military forces. I trust that this bill will \nnot be taken as Congress' comments on that discussion, and that renewed \nenergy will go into finding a better solution to these dilemmas in the \ncoming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11542-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11542-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11543]]\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1479.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 69\n\n       Whereas, In 1986, Congress created the Leaking Underground \n     Storage Tank Trust Fund through legislation amending the \n     Resource Recovery and Conservation Act. The fund was financed \n     through a 0.1 cent tax on each gallon of motor fuel sold. The \n     tax levy, which was reauthorized in 1990, expired on December \n     31, 1995. The fund has approximately $1.5 billion in it; and\n       Whereas, The purpose of the money generated by the Leaking \n     Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund is two-fold. It seeks to \n     enforce corrective actions where the owner of a leaking tank \n     is known and cleanup activities where the owner is not known \n     or is unable or unwilling to pay. The fund's proceeds are \n     distributed to the states on a formula based on criteria \n     determined by federal officials. Factors include levels of \n     contamination, the number of leaking tanks, the number of \n     cleanup efforts, and danger to drinking supplies; and\n       Whereas, Over the years, not enough money from the trust \n     fund has gone to fighting the effects of leaking underground \n     storage tanks. Almost all of the fund's proceeds go toward \n     administration and enforcing the program. It is estimated \n     that only 1 percent of fund money spent each year goes to \n     clean up orphan tanks; and\n       Whereas, In an effort to increase cleanup initiatives and \n     to deal with a problem that gets worse with the passage of \n     time, Congress is considering legislation to revamp the \n     manner in which the money in the Leaking Underground Storage \n     Tank Trust Fund is distributed. The legislative proposals \n     offer a more pragmatic approach by providing for the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to distribute the money to \n     the states with more authority for the states. The states are \n     in far better positions to determine how best to meet the \n     aims of cleanup and enforcement. With a formula for \n     distributing the funds based on what the states contributed \n     to the fund, a far greater positive impact can be made in \n     cleaning up our environment; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to provide for the distribution of the \n     Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund's proceeds to the \n     states for cleanup projects determined by the states; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-292. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 13\n\n       Whereas, The Congress of the United States of America is \n     considering the ratification of the balanced budget amendment \n     to the Constitution of the United States of America; and\n       Whereas, Amendment the Constitution of the United States \n     should not be entered into without the full knowledge of the \n     California Legislature as to the economic and human \n     consequences of the amendment on the State of California; and\n       Whereas, The potential impact of the balanced budget \n     amendment without protections for seniors, medicare \n     recipients, and social security recipients, upon the State of \n     California and its individual citizens could be massive and \n     without precedent; and\n       Whereas, Older American in this country have labored their \n     entire life to prosper and succeed to make America great; and\n       Whereas, Congress should take every step to exempt social \n     security from the balanced budget amendments; and\n       Whereas, Congress needs to adopt a hands-off approach to \n     social security and the Medicare system and stop any further \n     action to hurt older Americans; and\n       Whereas, All efforts should be continued to keep social \n     security from the balanced budget amendment since Congress \n     took it ``off budget'' in 1990; and\n       Whereas, The Legislature of the State of California needs \n     sufficient information and data upon which to base its \n     appraisal of the impact of the balanced budget amendment; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California jointly, That the Legislature respectfully \n     memorializes the President and Congress of the United States \n     to continue efforts to indefinitely ensure that social \n     security is not threatened in any way, to protect older \n     Americans who are receiving social security and Medicare from \n     undue harm and stress from the continuing dialogue to stop \n     any effort to hurt the income security of older Americans, to \n     ensure that everything necessary is being done to make sure \n     that older Americans continue to receive all that they are \n     entitled to and deserve, and to ensure the solvency of social \n     security and Medicare for future generations of taxpayers and \n     senior citizens entitled to the benefits provided by those \n     programs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-293. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                        Joint Resolution No. 18\n\n       Whereas, The United Nations Commission on the Status of \n     Women formulated a document entitled the Convention on the \n     Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women \n     (CEDAW); and\n       Whereas, The United Nations General Assembly adopted the \n     Convention, and opened it for signature in December 1979; and\n       Whereas, The Convention, sometimes called an international \n     Bill of Rights for women, obligates those countries that have \n     ratified or acceded to it to take all appropriate measures to \n     ensure the full development and advancement of women in all \n     spheres, including political, educational, employment, health \n     care, economic, social, legal, marriage and family relations, \n     as well as to modify the social and cultural patterns of \n     conduct of men and women to eliminate prejudice, customs, and \n     all other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or \n     superiority of either sex; and\n       Whereas, Fifty-two countries, including the United States, \n     signed the Convention during the 1980 Mid-Decade Conference \n     for Women in Copenhagen, Denmark; and\n       Whereas, To date, 160 countries, representing over half the \n     countries of the world, have now ratified or acceded to the \n     Convention; and\n       Whereas, The United States has not yet ratified or acceded \n     to the Convention; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California commends the\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\n     local, national, and international efforts of the National \n     Committee on the United Nations to promote the universal \n     adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination \n     of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and urges the \n     United States Senate to ratify CEDAW; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California shall work to ensure the elimination of \n     discrimination against women and girls in the State of \n     California, as they pursue the enjoyment of all civil, \n     political, economic, and cultural rights, as expressed in the \n     CEDAW treaty; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-294. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the province \n     of Taiwan of the Republic of China enjoy a close and long \n     standing relationship;\n       Whereas, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, founder the Republic of China, \n     has been recognized as a national patriot by all the \n     governments of modern China and in harmony with his \n     principles, the government of the Republic of China in Taiwan \n     has consistently shown its commitment towards world peace and \n     stability, economic and social-regional development, \n     international mutual assistance, democratization processes \n     and political and economic freedom;\n       Whereas, the economy of the Republic of China in Taiwan \n     makes it, at present, the fourteenth largest commercial \n     country, the twentieth in gross national product and the \n     twenty-fifth in gross per capita income;\n       Whereas, the population of the Republic of China in Taiwan \n     is greater than the population of two-thirds of the present \n     members of the United Nations Organizations;\n       Whereas, the people of the Republic of China in Taiwan \n     deserve appropriate recognition and credit for their dynamic \n     role in the international community;\n       Whereas, the creation of an ad hoc committee for the study \n     of the exceptional situation of the people of the Republic of \n     China in Taiwan in the international community, has been \n     proposed before the United Nations Organization in order to \n     advance fair and viable solutions which will allow its \n     participation in the international bodies under the aegis of \n     the United Nations Organization;\n       Whereas, there is a precedent for the full participation of \n     the Republic of China in Taiwan in the United Nations \n     Organization and its affiliated bodies, such as the \n     participation formerly granted to nations divided between two \n     governments such as Korea, and as were Germany and Yemen for \n     many years before their unification;\n       Whereas, since the People of Puerto Rico lack the power to \n     directly influence the President and the United States \n     Congressmen who direct the foreign and diplomatic policy \n     which applies to Puerto Rico by vote, it is essential for \n     this High Body to state its feelings on this matter to them. \n     Now therefore: be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico:\n       Section 1.--To hereby request the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to give their utmost attention \n     and action support to the Republic of China in Taiwan as an \n     important participant in international commerce and trade, \n     and as a former ally, and in support of its efforts to attain \n     its full participation in the international community bodies.\n       Section 2.--To have this Resolution translated into the \n     English language, and remit copies thereof to the President \n     and to the Congress of the United States, and to the \n     Representatives of the Republic of China in Taiwan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-295. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n\n                          statement of motives\n\n       Information published in the United States indicates that \n     in recent months a controversy has arisen regarding the \n     manner in which the Federal Census for the year 2000 shall be \n     conducted. The controversy is basically about proposed \n     methodology.\n       The Bureau of the Census plans to use the statistical \n     sampling technique, alleging that it is necessary in order to \n     correct the situation of the previous census which failed to \n     count some one point six (1.6) percent of the population of \n     the United States or around four million (4,000,000) persons, \n     according to its own estimates. It is estimated that if the \n     sample is not used, one point nine (1.9) percent of the \n     population shall not be counted and that six hundred seventy-\n     five (675) to eight hundred (800) million dollars would be \n     necessary in addition to the four billion it expects to \n     spend.\n       From the above, it can be inferred that a census with \n     statistical sampling is more reliable and less costly than \n     that which does not use the sample. It is also important to \n     indicate that experience has shown that the endemic problem \n     of the population that is uncounted mainly affects the \n     minorities, and among them, Hispanics.\n       We wish to join our efforts to those of Martha Farnsworth \n     Richie, Director of the Bureau of the Census, Barbara E. \n     Bryant, former Director of the Bureau of the Census under \n     former President Bush, the two panels of the National \n     Research Council, one of which is directed by Charles L. \n     Schulze, who worked for Brookings Institution, to the \n     American Statistics Association, the United States Conference \n     of Mayors, organizations of legal counsel for minority groups \n     such as the Civil Rights Leadership Council, the majority of \n     the members of Congress affiliated to the Democratic Party, \n     Republican Congressmen such as Senator John McCain from \n     Arizona and Congressman Christopher Shays from Connecticut, \n     as well as state governments such as New York and Los \n     Angeles, all these who favor the use of statistical sampling \n     in the Census.\n       It seems to us that the arguments set forth by those who \n     oppose the use of samples based on considerations of public \n     order, lack validity. The Chairman of the National Republican \n     Party, Jim Nicholson, has been quoted as saying that based on \n     an undisclosed internal report, that Republicans could lose \n     up to twenty-five (25) seats in the House of Representatives \n     if statistic sampling is used in the Census for the year \n     2000. This has been denied by other sectors. A study \n     conducted by the Congressional Investigation Service based on \n     the projections of the Census of 1996, reflects that eleven \n     (11) seats would change hands and that states such as Texas, \n     Arizona and Georgia would gain two (2) seats, while New York \n     and Pennsylvania would lose two (2) seats.\n       The argument that a Census with sampling would be \n     unconstitutional and that additional costs would be avoided \n     if the Supreme Court annuls a census with the sample do not \n     convince us either.\n       Department of Justice Opinions under the administrations of \n     Clinton, Carter and Bush conclude that the Constitution does \n     not exclude the use of the sample. We firmly believe that the \n     constitutional right of equal protection under laws of the \n     United States of the persons omitted in the past by the \n     Census were violated, and that those mainly affected are \n     members of minority groups that are not counted for reasons \n     such as higher rates of multiple families living together, \n     changes of residence and cases of homeless people, which \n     mostly affect minority groups than the rest of the \n     population.\n       In the spirit that justice be done from the economic point \n     of view, as well as from the political point of view through \n     equal treatment to all the residents of the United States, we \n     urge the President and the Congress of the United States to \n     support a Federal Census using the methodology proposed by \n     the Bureau of the Census so that the five (5) million persons \n     who would be omitted from the statistics of the Census if the \n     statistical sampling is not used, can be counted, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico:\n       Section 1.--To urge President William Jefferson Clinton and \n     the Congress of the United States to support the methodology \n     proposed by the United States Bureau of the Census to conduct \n     the Federal Census of the year 2000.\n       Section 2.--A copy of this Resolution shall be remitted to \n     the President of the United States, as well as to the Speaker \n     of the House and President of the Senate of the United States \n     of America, to the Floor leaders of the various parliamentary \n     delegations, and to the Black Caucus and Hispanic Caucus of \n     the Congress, the Governor of Puerto Rico and the Resident \n     Commissioner of Puerto Rico in the United States, in English \n     and in Spanish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11543-5", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, without amendment:\n       H.R. 960.

A bill to amend rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure to restore the stenographic preference for dispositions; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n   THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE RULE 30 AMENDMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \namend rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This bill, which \nI am introducing with Senator Durbin, will restore the stenographic \npreference for depositions taken in Federal Court. Under our system of \ngovernment, Congress has the duty and responsibility to scrutinize \ncarefully all of the rules of Civil Procedure promulgated by the \nJudicial Conference and transmitted to us by the Supreme Court for \nreview--and to make modifications or deletions when appropriate. \nIndeed, when many changes to the rules were proposed in 1993, some were \nto be modified in legislation which was passed by the House. \nUnfortunately, the crush of the end-of-session legislation that year \nmade it impossible for the Senate to act on this bill to modify these \nchanges and they took effect in December of that year.\n  Many of us in this body wanted to bring the bill forward, but \nopponents of the proposed modifications were able to delay any Senate \nconsideration until after the effective date required by the Rules \nEnabling Act. Because of our responsibility to review these rules, I \nwant to bring one of the modifications back before the Senate. This \nmodification concerns rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  From 1970 to December 1993, rule 30 permitted depositions to be \nrecorded by non stenographic means, but only upon court order or with \nthe written stipulation of the parties. The change in rule 30(b) \naltered that procedure by eliminating the requirement of a court order \nor stipulation and affording each party the right to arrange for \nrecording of a deposition by non stenographic means.\n  Testimony at hearings conducted by the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nCourts and Administrative Practice in the 103d Congress raised concerns \nabout the reliability and durability of video or audio tape \nalternatives to stenographic depositions. There was also information \nsubmitted suggesting that technological improvements in stenographic \nrecording will make the stenographic method more cost-effective for \nyears to come.\n  Depositions recorded stenographically have historically provided an \naccurate record of testimony which can conveniently be used by both \ntrial and appellate courts. In addition, the certification of accuracy \nby an independent and unbiased third party is a significant component \nof trustworthy depositions. Studies undertaken by the Justice Research \nInstitute confirm the fact that a stenographic court reporter is the \nqualitative standard for accuracy and clarity in depositions, and a \ncourt reporter using a computer--aided transportation is the least \ncostly method of making a deposition record.\n  Even now, 5 years after the rule change, court reporters associations \ncontend that mechanical recording frequently produces unintelligible \npassages and is laden with other dangers such as the inability to \nidentify speakers. Rather than becoming the way of the future, \nelectronic recording has been faulted by judges and attorneys as an \nerror-prone system where tapes are often untranscribable because of \ninaudible portions, machines frequently fail, and recorders pick up \nevery background sound, including papers rustling, coughing, and \nattorney sidebar conferences which then must be edited out before use \nby jurors or for the appeal process.\n  The case was never made for unilateral decisions on the use of \nnonstenographic recording of depositions. The legislation that I am \nintroducing today with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, \nwould restore the rule that nonstenographic recording of depositions is \nauthorized only when permitted by court order or stipulation of both \nparties.\n  This version of the rule worked very effectively for over 23 years. \nIn fact, I am not aware of any instance where an attorney or party was \ndenied the ability to use an alternative method when it was requested. \nHowever, the most important factor was that the prior incarnation of \nthe Rules recognized the potential for errors from methods other than \nstenographic means and thus established the safeguards of stipulation \nor court order. In fact, the notes to accompany the 1970 version of the \nCivil Rules said it best:\n\n       In order to facilitate less expensive procedures, provision \n     is made for the recording of testimony by other than \n     stenographic means--e.g., by mechanical, electronic, or \n     photographic means. Because these methods give rise to \n     problems of accuracy and trustworthiness, the party taking \n     the deposition is required to apply for a court order. The \n     order is to specify how the testimony is to be recorded, \n     preserved, and filed, and it may contain whatever additional \n     safeguards the court deems necessary.\n       (Notes to accompany the 1970 Revisions to the Federal Rules \n     of Civil Procedure)\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation gives us the chance to do what we \nshould have done 4 years ago and restore the rule in order to maintain \nthe high standard of justice for which our legal system is known.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11546]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1352\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     paragraphs (2) and (3) of Rule 30(b) of the Federal Rules of \n     Civil Procedure are amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2) Unless the court upon motion orders, or the parties \n     stipulate in writing, the deposition shall be recorded by \n     stenographic means. The party taking the deposition shall \n     bear the cost of the transcription. Any party may arrange for \n     a transcription to be made from the recording of a deposition \n     taken by nonstenographic means.\n       ``(3) With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, \n     any party may use another method to record the deponent's \n     testimony in addition to the method used pursuant to \n     paragraph (2). The additional record or transcript shall be \n     made at that party's expense unless the court otherwise \n     orders.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Daschle, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1354. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide \nfor the designation of common carriers not subject to the jurisdiction \nof a State commission as eligible telecommunications carriers; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n     the communications act of 1934 technical amendment act of 1997\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment to the \nCommunications Act of 1934 on behalf of Senators Dorgan, Daschle, \nInouye, Campbell, and myself. This amendment enables the Federal \nCommunications Commission [FCC] to designate common carriers not under \nthe jurisdiction of a State commission as eligible recipients of \nuniversal service support.\n  Universal Service provides intercarrier support for the provision of \ntelecommunications services in rural and high-cost areas throughout the \nUnited States. However, section 254(e) of the 1996 act states that only \nan eligible carrier designated under section 214(e) of the \nCommunications Act shall be eligible to receive specific federal \nuniversal support after the FCC issues regulations implementing the new \nuniversal service provisions into the law. Section 214(e) does not \naccount for the fact that State commissions in a few states have no \njurisdiction over certain carriers. Typically, States also have no \njurisdiction over tribally owned companies which may or may not be \nregulated by a tribal authority that is not a State commission per se.\n  The failure to account for these situations means that carriers not \nsubject to the jurisdiction of a State commission have no way of \nbecoming an eligible carrier that can receive universal service \nsupport. This would be the case whether these carriers are traditional \nlocal exchange carriers that provide services otherwise included in the \nprogram, have previously obtained universal service support, or will \nlikely be the carrier that continues to be the carrier of last resort \nfor customers in the area.\n  Mr. President. This simple amendment will address this oversight \nwithin the 1996 act, and prevent the unintentional consequences it will \nhave on common carriers which Congress intended to be covered under the \numbrella of universal service support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1355. A bill to designate the U.S. courthouse located in New \nHaven, CT, as the ``Richard C. Lee United States Courthouse''; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n           the richard c. lee federal courthouse act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored today to \nintroduce legislation with my colleague Senator Dodd to name the \nFederal courthouse in New Haven, CT, after our dear friend and the \nformer eight-term mayor of New Haven, Richard C. Lee. Congresswoman \nRosa DeLauro is introducing the same proposal in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  If it may be said that Federal buildings should help reflect the very \nbest of the principles, purposes and spirit of America, then this \ncourthouse could have no more appropriate name above its doors than \nthat of Mayor Lee. For Dick Lee is the quintessential American, proud, \nprincipled, hardworking, and productive. In New Haven, he shook loose \nentrenched bureaucracies and forged new community coalitions dedicated \nto rebuilding New Haven after years of neglect and blight. He became a \nnationally recognized urban pioneer and helped to change the landscape \nof the American city.\n  Dick Lee was born in New Haven. He loves the city and its richly \ndiverse people. In May of last year, Mayor Lee was honored by the New \nHaven Colony Historical Society. During that tribute, Prof. Robert Wood \nof Wesleyan University drew inspiration from Mayor Lee's eloquence \nabout his work. Dick Lee said that the core of a mayor's job was \n``wiping away tears from the eyes'' of a city's people so that ``each \ntear becomes a star in the sky'' and not a source of daily despair. \n``Filling the sky above with stars'' was his highest calling. ``The \ntears in the eyes of the young and the old, the hungry, the unloved, \nthe ill-housed, the ill-clothed, and worst of all, the ignored'' were \nnot to be tolerated.\n  Dick Lee was raised in a devout Irish Catholic family that was not \nblessed with wealth but with greater gifts: with faith, talent, and the \nwillingness to work hard to better themselves and their community. He \nserved for many years on the Board of Aldermen of New Haven and held a \nnumber of journalism jobs, including 10 years in public relations at \nYale University. In 1949, he became the youngest man to run for mayor \nin New Haven's history. He lost that year by 712 votes. He lost 2 years \nlater by only two votes. But he did not give up on himself, or the city \nof New Haven and was elected mayor in 1953.\n  Once in office, Dick Lee devoted himself with extraordinary energy \nand imagination to the human and physical renewal of New Haven. One of \nhis most provocative ideas was that the greatest post-World War II \nproblems in our cities--poverty, unemployment, and poor housing--could \nnot be solved by the cities or States alone. The Federal Government had \nto become a partner in America's urban redevelopment.\n  Dick Lee worked tirelessly and with enormous success during the \nEisenhower Administration to bring Federal programs to New Haven. As \nhead of the Urban Committee of the Democratic National Committee in \n1958, Lee authored the first versions of Model Cities and War on \nPoverty legislative proposals. And after his dear friend, John F. \nKennedy was elected, Dick Lee exercised a large and constructive \ninfluence on the national effort to renew America's urban areas and to \nrestore hope and opportunity to the people who lived in them.\n  Dick Lee also understood that just as the human face of New Haven \nneeded reinvigoration, so did the city's physical appearance and \ninfrastructure. For this, Dick Lee turned first to a plan by Maurice \nRovital who developed a blueprint for New Haven while a member of the \nYale faculty. But then he boldly invited many of America's greatest \narchitects to design buildings for his city, making New Haven one of \nAmerica's greatest architectural crossroads.\n  Dick Lee appointed a deputy mayor and administrator of redevelopment. \nFrom there, the real work began. That work included rebuilding downtown \nNew Haven, salvaging the Long Wharf area, restoring Wooster Square, \nconstructing the Knights of Columbus headquarters and the Coliseum, \nresidential rehabilitation, rent supplements, nonprofit housing \nsponsors and the renewal of inner-city neighborhoods.\n  Mayor Lee forged new coalitions to reaffirm his city's sense of \ncommunity and make it easier to get things done. His Citizens Action \nCommission was a unique amalgam of business, labor and civic leaders \nand was designed to build support for the redevelopment effort.\n  Robert Dahl, in his book ``Who Governs? Democracy and Power in the \nAmerican City,'' wrote that Mayor Lee ``had an investment banker's \nwillingness to take risks that held the promise of large long-run \npayoffs, and a labor mediator's ability to head off controversy by \nsearching out areas for agreement by mutual understanding, compromise, \nnegotiation, and bargaining.\n\n       He possessed a detailed knowledge of the city and its \n     people, a formidable information gathering system, and an \n     unceasing, full-time preoccupation with all aspects of his \n     job. His relentless drive to achieve his goals meant that he \n     could be tough and ruthless. But toughness was not his \n     political style, for his overriding strategy was to rely on \n     persuasion rather than threats.\n\n\n[[Page S11547]]\n\n\n  Robert Leeney, former editor of the New Haven Register and a wise and \neloquent observer of the local scene wrote:\n\n       New Haven and the problems of New Haveners have shaped Dick \n     Lee's life. When the Senate seat, later filled by Thomas \n     Dodd, hung like a plum within his grasp he wouldn't reach for \n     it because the Church Street project was badly stalled and \n     home needs took first priority in his public vision and on \n     his personal horizons. His simple belief in--and his \n     unshakeable dedication to--this city and its people started \n     young and they have never ended. . .. He grew up to \n     citizenhood with a classic, almost a Greek, sense of the \n     city-state's call upon his talents and of its shaping effect \n     upon his life and the lives of his neighbors. . ..\n\n  Mr. President, law is the way we choose to express our values as a \ncommunity, our aspirations for ourselves and our neighbors. In that \nfundamental sense, naming the grand federal courthouse in New Haven \nwhich sits proudly on the old New Haven Green and next to city hall is \nan honor which Mayor Dick Lee thoroughly deserves. In his public \nservice, he worked tirelessly to express the best values of his \ncommunity and to help its people realize their dreams for themselves.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Lee United States Courthouse''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the United States \n     courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the ``Richard C. Lee United States Courthouse''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I am pleased to join with my fellow \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, in introducing this bill \nwhich would designate the U.S. courthouse in New Haven, CT, as the \n``Richard C. Lee United States Courthouse.'' I strongly believe that \nthis designation would be a fitting tribute to Dick Lee's service and \ncommitment to the city of New Haven, and I commend my good friend and \ncolleague for putting this legislation forward.\n  A self-educated man who was legendary for his charm, Dick Lee is \nwidely considered as one of the most forceful, most capable, and most \ndedicated mayors that the State of Connecticut an this country has ever \nknown.\n  After losing two bids to become mayor, Dick Lee went on to win eight \nstraight elections, serving as the mayor of New Haven from 1954 to \n1969. His first two elections were very close, losing by only two votes \nin his 1951. Dick Lee learned from these narrow defeats, and they \nhelped to shape his political career. He realized that every single \nperson mattered, and he always did everything in his power to help his \nconstituents, particularly those who were in need. He was always eager \nto tackle, rather than turn away from constituents' problems. He also \nexhibited great foresight in anticipating the problems that awaited New \nHaven and other cities, and he offered imaginative and progressive \nsolutions to these concerns.\n  The focus of his ideas was to preserve and rehabilitate \nneighborhoods, and to engage in urban planning done with the community, \nnot for it. He supervised the clearance of slums in New Haven and \nrevitalized once decaying areas by rebuilding businesses and homes. He \noversaw the building of two new public high schools and a dozen \nelementary schools. To ensure that residents would have a greater \ninvestment in their communities, he pushed for the building of housing \nthat low-income families could buy rather than rent. And Hew Haven was \nalso the first major U.S. city to create its own antipoverty program.\n  Many viewed Dick Lee's views as ahead of his time, and he quickly \nestablished a national reputation as a visionary of urban \nrevitalization. On the strength of this reputation, Mr. Lee became a \nrespected advisor to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson on matters of urban \npolicy.\n  Mr. Lee was approached about a possible cabinet position, but rather \nthan lobby for a political appointment for himself, he used his \npolitical capital to help secure Federal funding for his urban \nredevelopment initiatives back home in New Haven. At one point during \nDick Lee's tenure, New Haven was receiving more Federal money per \ncapita than any other city in the country.\n  Dick Lee still lives in New Haven in the same house that he purchased \nmore than 30 years ago. In light of all the work that Dick Lee did for \nthe people of his home town and his effective advocacy on behalf of all \nof America's cities, I think that it is only appropriate that one of \nNew Haven's Federal buildings should bear his name. Therefore I urge \nall of my colleagues to support this bill to designate the Federal \ncourthouse in New Haven as the ``Richard C. Lee United States \nCourthouse.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH:\n  S. 1356. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit \nInternet service providers from providing accounts to sexually violent \npredators; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n     the internet service providers account prohibition act of 1997\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, in the past few years, I have been \nshocked by the number of crimes I have read about that are connected to \nthe Internet.\n  This was a problem that did not even exist just a few years ago, but \nnow it has become very prevalent.\n  What is happening is that sex offenders and pedophiles are using the \nInternet to recruit children.\n  I think I have a solution that can help this situation.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that would prevent a convicted \nsex offender from having an Internet account. Under my bill, the on-\nline service provider would be barred from providing an account to \nanyone who is a sexually violent predator or who has registered under \nMegan's law.\n  I do not think this would be difficult to enforce, because convicted \nsex offenders are already on a data base.\n  A background check on that data base could keep them offline.\n  Mr. President, we all know that proper parental supervision is the \nbest defense against this type of crime, but I am finding that some \nparents aren't as computer literate as their children and it is almost \nimpossible to watch children every minute of every day.\n  In my view, it is time to pull the plug on sex offenders and take \nthem offline.\n  Mr. President, as I said, this problem has been growing year by year. \nIt has grown to the point where the FBI has set up a special task force \nto track down computer sex offenders.\n  In 1993, the FBI formed a task force known as Innocent Images.\n  It was created after a 10-year-old boy was declared missing in \nMaryland. Unfortunately, he has never been found. But the FBI did come \nacross two neighbors who have an elaborate computer network--where they \nwere recruiting young victims over the Internet. The key suspect is in \njail, but has never told the police anything about the disappearance.\n  This is what one agent said about the program:\n\n       Generally we would come across people trying to trade \n     (illicit pictures) within five to ten minutes . . . It was \n     like coming across a person at every street corner trying to \n     sell you crack.\n\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the Washington Post reported on a man that had \ncontacted over 100 underage girls via a computer. He was arrested and \nreceived 2 years in jail. I have no doubt, he will be back on the \nInternet when he gets out of jail. My bill is designed to stop him \nagain.\n  The task force has conducted over 330 searches that have resulted in \n200 indictments and 150 convictions. Another 135 have been arrested.\n  If we do not stop sex offenders on the Internet, I believe the number \nof crimes will grow.\n  Tragically, just a few weeks ago, an 11-year-old boy was murdered in \nNew Jersey by a teenager who himself had been molested by a man he met \non the Internet. The man was a twice convicted sex offender.\n  We have got to stop this activity and stop it now.\n  Mr. President, there will be critics who call this unconstitutional. \nThey can certainly tie themselves up in knots about the legalities, but \nmy\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\nmain concern is for the safety of our children.\n  I think we have ample precedent for doing something like this. First, \nwe have Megan's Law that requires registration of sex offenders. \nSecond, the Supreme Court, in Kansas versus Hendricks, upheld a State \nstatute that kept a sexual predator committed in a State mental \ninstitution, after his criminal sentence had run. I think it is clear \nthat for sexual predators--they do not enjoy the rights that all of us \nenjoy. There is a difference.\n  More simply put, is this any different than denying a felon the right \nto own a gun. Is it different than barring a habitual drunk driver from \nhaving a driver's license?\n  The Internet is the new weapon of the sexual predator. It is their \nkey to invading our homes.\n  We have to send a clear message that the Internet will not become the \nfavored tool of the pedophile. Instead of roaming the streets, the sex \noffenders of the 1990's are roaming chat rooms and the Internet looking \nfor victims.\n  This legislation will put a stop to that.\n  I hope that we can have hearings on this bill and that we can \nconsider it next session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 1357. A bill to require the States to bear the responsibility for \nthe consequences of releasing violent criminals from custody before the \nexpiration of the full term of imprisonment to which they are \nsentenced.\n\n\n           the fairness and incarceration responsibility Act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to introduce legislation today \ndealing with violent offenders. I want to preface it by saying that all \nof us in this country understand that crime rates are coming down some, \nand we are appreciative of that. But violent crime is still far too \nprevalent.\n  In North Dakota a couple of weeks ago, we had a young woman named \nJulienne Schultz who stopped at a rest area on a quiet rural road and a \nquiet part of our State. She ran into a man in the rest area who \nabducted her, slashed her throat, and left her for dead. Well, I am \npleased to tell you today that Julienne did not die, and she is \nrecovering.\n  The horror of that attack is a horror that is repeated all over this \ncountry, committed by violent criminals who never should have been out \nof jail early. That attack was perpetrated by a fellow who came from \nWashington State. He was, I guess, driving through North Dakota. He is \nalleged to have committed a couple of murders in Washington State \nbefore he left Washington a couple of months before. He ran into \nJulienne Schultz, this wonderful woman from North Dakota, who was \ncoming back from a meeting with the League of Cities and stopped at a \nrest area only to have her throat slashed by this violent criminal. He \nthen took his own life when stopped at a police blockade later that \nnight. This fellow had been in prison in the State of Washington for \nprior violent crimes and was let out of prison early.\n\n  It goes on all across this country. I think this country ought to \ndecide that, if you commit a violent act, you are going to go to prison \nand the prison cell is going to be your address until the end of your \nsentence--no early out, no nothing. If you are convicted of a violent \noffense, you go to prison and stay there. Your prison cell is your \naddress.\n  I will just give you a couple more examples.\n  Charles Miller is from West Virginia, 28 years old. A couple of years \nago he was convicted of the violent rape of a young child and was \nsentenced to serve 5 years in prison. He was up for parole three times \nwhile he was in prison. His third time --May of this year--after \nserving half of the sentence, he was released on gain time, and 43 days \nlater he was charged with sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl. The \nprosecutor said, ``Unfortunately, in the State the way it is now, \neverybody gets out early. We have people guilty of murder getting out \non gain time do it again. We ought to abolish gain time.''\n  I agree with that prosecutor.\n  Miami, FL, a fellow named Gainer, age 23, shot a fellow named Robert \nMays, 20 years old--got into a dispute about drugs. Sentenced to 5 \nyears in State prison for manslaughter, served 1 year and 1 month, \nreleased because he had accumulated 600 days of what is called gain \ntime for working in a prison camp. Six months after he was released he \nwas charged with first-degree murder once again.\n  Mr. Ball, 42, sentenced to 30 years of hard labor in Louisiana, cited \nfor 102 disciplinary infractions in prison, the last infraction being 3 \nmonths before he was released 16 years before the end of his sentence \nfor good behavior. He was rearrested on first-degree murder and armed \nrobbery charges.\n  Budweiser delivery man Bernard Scorconi was 45 years old, murdered by \nMr. Ball when he tried to stop him from robbing a local bar. Ball was \nreleased 16 years earlier than the end of his sentence.\n  It happens all across this country, every day in every way. Violent \npeople are put back on the streets before the end of their sentence.\n  My mother was killed by someone who committed a manslaughter act, and \nhe was let out early. Everybody is let out early. Commit a violent act, \nyou get let out early. All you have to do is go to prison, accumulate \ngood time. In some States you get 30 days off for every 30 days served.\n  I am proposing today a very simple piece of legislation. Let us tell \nthose States who let violent people out of prison early, that you are \ngoing to be responsible for the actions of that offender up until what \nshould have been the completion date of that offender's sentence. If a \nState or local government decides it is appropriate to allow violent \noffenders to be let out before the end of their term because they have \naccumulated good time, gain time, or parole. If violent offenders serve \nless than their entire sentence, then during that period of time when \nthey should have been in jail, if they commit another violent crime, I \nwant the states to be held responsible--no more immunity.\n  I say to local governments, be responsible. You want to let violent \npeople out on the street early, be responsible for it. Waive your \nimmunity. Let people sue you to bring you to account for what you have \ndone.\n  I am proposing that the grants we have in the 1994 crime bill dealing \nwith truth-in-sentencing and violent-offender incarceration be \navailable to those States that decide they will waive immunity and be \nresponsible for the acts these offenders on early release commit.\n  I wonder how many people in this Chamber know that there are more \nthan 4,000 people now in prison for committing a murder that they \ncommitted while they were out early for a previous violent crime. How \nwould you like to be one of the families of the 4,000 or more people \nwho are murdered who understand their loved one was murdered because \nsomeone else was let out early from prison. You know it doesn't take \nDick Tracy to figure out who is going to commit the next violent act. \nIt is somebody who has committed a previous violent act.\n\n  I just suggest that there are those who say prisons are overcrowded \nand so the prison overcrowding forces them to release people early. \nSenator John Glenn and I have talked for years about military housing \nand its possible use for incarcerating non-violent offenders. Why \ncouldn't corrections officials utilize this kind of low-cost housing \nfor nonviolent offenders and freeup maximum security space for violent \noffenders.\n  You can probably incarcerate nonviolent offenders for a fraction of \nthe cost of what it takes to build a prison. Fifty percent of the 1.5 \nmillion people now in prison in this country are nonviolent. We can \nincarcerate them for a fraction of the cost of what we now spend to put \nthem in prisons.\n  We could open 100,000, 200,000, or 300,000 prison cells and say to \nviolent offenders, that is your address until the end of your sentence. \nUnderstand that. Your address is your prison cell, if you commit a \nviolent crime, until the end of your sentence. We ought to provide a \ncreative way for states to facilitate that.\n  Even with the best of intentions, in this Chamber about 4 years ago \nwe decided that the most violent offenders have to serve 85 percent of \ntheir time. Let's let them out only 15 percent early, stated another \nway. In fact, in most States those who commit the most violent offenses \nand therefore get\n\n[[Page S11549]]\n\nthe longest sentences get the most generous amount of good time.\n  I know people will disagree with me about this. I respect that \ndisagreement. I say this. If you are the family of a young boy, 13 \nyears old, named Hall who was murdered just miles from here, or of a \nyoung attorney in her early 20's named Bettina Pruckmayer, who was \nmurdered just miles from here. Both of these young people murdered by \nindividuals who had been in prison for previous murders but let out \nearly because of the sentence system. Is it fine for us to let them \nback on the street? If they do not have good time, if they are hard to \nmanage in prison, think about the violence done to others who are \nmurdered and others who are going to die while they are on street.\n  I am going to introduce this piece of legislation today. I hope in \nthe next year or so before the Congress completes its work that we \nmight be able to decide what we need to do about violent offenders. We \ncan keep violent offenders off the streets to the end of their \nsentence, and we can protect people like Julienne Schultz, who, \nfortunately, is going to be all right.\n  But this innocent young woman who was driving back from a meeting \nstopped at a rest stop in a quiet rural area, had her throat slashed \nand was close to being killed by a fellow who should never have been \ndriving through North Dakota, by a fellow who was let out by \nauthorities in another State which said, ``We can't afford to keep you \nin prison,'' apparently, and, ``We don't have the time to keep you in \nprison anymore.'' Well, we had better make time. We had better find the \nresources to keep these kind of folks in prison to the end of their \nterm in order to help prevent further carnage and the kind of things \nthat are happening to innocent people all across this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be pointed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, you have been very generous in the time today.\n  I yield the time. I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1357\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness and Incarceration \n     Responsibility (FAIR) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) violent criminals often serve only a portion of the \n     terms of imprisonment to which they are sentenced;\n       (2) a significant proportion of the most serious crimes of \n     violence committed in the United States are committed by \n     criminals who have been released early from a term of \n     imprisonment to which they were sentenced for a prior \n     conviction for a crime of violence;\n       (3) violent criminals who are released before the \n     expiration of the term of imprisonment to which they were \n     sentenced often travel to other States to commit subsequent \n     crimes of violence;\n       (4) crimes of violence and the threat of crimes of violence \n     committed by violent criminals who are released from prison \n     before the expiration of the term of imprisonment to which \n     they were sentenced affect tourism, economic development, use \n     of the interstate highway system, federally owned or \n     supported facilities, and other commercial activities of \n     individuals; and\n       (5) the policies of one State regarding the early release \n     of criminals sentenced in that State for a crime of violence \n     often affect the citizens of other States, who can influence \n     those policies only through Federal law.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require States \n     to bear the responsibility for the consequences of releasing \n     violent criminals from custody before the expiration of the \n     full term of imprisonment to which they are sentenced.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FOR \n                   SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 59\n\n       Whereas the Republic of Turkey, because of its position at \n     the crossroads of Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the \n     Middle East, is well positioned to play a leading role in \n     shaping developments in Europe and beyond;\n       Whereas the Republic of Turkey has been a longstanding \n     member of numerous international organizations, including the \n     Council of Europe (1949), the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (1952), and the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (1975);\n       Whereas Turkey's President, Suleyman Demirel, was an \n     original signer of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act of the \n     Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe;\n       Whereas the Republic of Turkey proposed in late 1996 that \n     Istanbul serve as the venue for the next OSCE summit, a \n     prestigious gathering of the heads of state or government of \n     countries in Europe, Central Asia, and North America, \n     including the United States;\n       Whereas a decision on the venue of the next OSCE summit \n     will require the consensus of all OSCE participating states, \n     including the United States;\n       Whereas the OSCE participating states, including Turkey, \n     have declared their steadfast commitment to democracy based \n     on human rights and fundamental freedoms, the protection and \n     promotion of which is the first responsibility of government;\n       Whereas the development of genuine democracy in Turkey is \n     undermined by ongoing violations of international \n     humanitarian law as well as other human rights obligations \n     and commitments, including provisions of the Helsinki Final \n     Act and other OSCE documents, by which Turkey is bound;\n       Whereas the Department of State has found that serious \n     human rights problems persist in Turkey and that human rights \n     abuses have not been limited to the southeast, where Turkey \n     has engaged in an armed conflict with the terrorist Kurdistan \n     Workers Party (PKK) for over a decade;\n       Whereas flagrant violations of OSCE standards and norms \n     continue and the problems raised by the United States \n     Delegation at the November 1996 OSCE Review Meeting in Vienna \n     persist;\n       Whereas expert witnesses at a 1997 briefing of the \n     Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (in this \n     concurrent resolution referred to as the ``Helsinki \n     Commission'') underscored the continued, well-documented, and \n     widespread use of torture by Turkish security forces and the \n     failure of the Government of Turkey to take determined action \n     to correct such gross violations of OSCE provisions and \n     international humanitarian law;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey continues to use broadly \n     the Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of the Criminal Code \n     against writers, journalists, publishers, politicians, \n     musicians, and students;\n       Whereas the Committee To Protect Journalists has concluded \n     that more journalists are currently jailed in Turkey than in \n     any other country in the world;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey has pursued an aggressive \n     campaign of harassment of nongovernmental organizations, \n     including the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey; branch \n     offices of the Human Rights Association in Diyarakir, \n     Malatya, Izmir, Konya, and Urfa have been raided and closed; \n     and Turkish authorities continue to persecute the members of \n     nongovernmental organizations who attempt to assist the \n     victims of torture;\n       Whereas four former parliamentarians from the now banned \n     Kurdish-based Democracy Party (DEP) Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, \n     Orhan Dogan, and Selim Sadak remain imprisoned at Ankara's \n     Ulucanlar Prison and among the actions cited in Zana's \n     indictment was her 1993 appearance before the Helsinki \n     Commission in Washington, D.C.;\n       Whereas the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights has \n     expressed concern over the case of human rights lawyer Hasan \n     Dogan, a member of the People's Democracy Party (HADEP), who \n     like many members of the party, has been subject to detention \n     and prosecution;\n       Whereas many human rights abuses have been committed \n     against Kurds who assert their Kurdish identity, and Kurdish \n     institutions, such as the Kurdish Cultural and Research \n     Foundation, have been targeted for closure;\n       Whereas the Ecumenical Patriarchate has repeatedly \n     requested permission to reopen the Orthodox seminary on the \n     island of Halki closed by the Turkish authorities since the \n     1970s despite Turkey's OSCE commitment to ``allow the \n     training of religious personnel in appropriate \n     institutions'';\n       Whereas members of other minority religions or beliefs, \n     including Armenian and Syrian Orthodox believers, as well as \n     Roman Catholics, Armenian, Chaldean, Greek and Syrian \n     Catholics, and Protestants have faced various forms of \n     discrimination and harassment;\n       Whereas the closing of the border with Armenia by Turkey in \n     1993 remains an obstacle to the development of mutual \n     understanding and confidence, and friendly and good-\n     neighborly relations between those OSCE participating states;\n       Whereas the Republic of Turkey has repeatedly rebuffed \n     offers by the Chair-in-Office of the OSCE to dispatch a \n     personal representative to Turkey for purposes of assessing \n     developments in that country;\n       Whereas, despite the fact that a number of Turkish civilian \n     authorities remain publicly committed to the establishment of \n     rule of law and to respect for human rights, torture, \n     excessive use of force, and other serious\n\n[[Page S11551]]\n\n     human rights abuses by the security forces continue; and\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey has failed to meaningfully \n     address these and other human rights concerns since it first \n     proposed to host the next OSCE summit and thereby has \n     squandered this opportunity to demonstrate its determination \n     to improve implementation of Turkey's OSCE commitments: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the privilege and prestige of hosting a summit of the \n     heads of state or government of the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) should be reserved for \n     participating states that have demonstrated in word and in \n     deed steadfast support for Helsinki principles and standards, \n     particularly respect for human rights;\n       (2) the United States should refuse to give consensus to \n     any proposal that Turkey serve as the venue for a summit \n     meeting of the heads of state or government of OSCE countries \n     until the Government of Turkey has demonstrably improved \n     implementation of its freely undertaken OSCE commitments, \n     including action to address those human rights concerns \n     enumerated in the preamble of this resolution;\n       (3) the United States should encourage the development of \n     genuine democracy in the Republic of Turkey based on \n     protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms; and\n       (4) the President of the United States should report to \n     Congress not later than April 15, 1998, on any improvement in \n     the actual human rights record in Turkey, including \n     improvements in that country's implementation of provisions \n     of the Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE documents.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this concurrent resolution to the President of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to submit a concurrent resolution \non the human rights situation in Turkey. This resolution is prompted by \nthat country's desire to host the next summit meeting of the heads of \nstate or government of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope [OSCE]. This summit meeting is scheduled to take place in 1998. \nThe issue is which country will host this most important OSCE \ngathering.\n  Last November, the Republic of Turkey--an original OSCE participating \nstate--first proposed Istanbul as the site for the next OSCE summit. At \nthat time, I wrote to then-Secretary of State Christopher, together \nwith Commission Co-Chairman Christopher Smith, urging that the United \nStates reject this proposal based on Turkey's dismal human rights \nrecord. I also wrote to Secretary Albright in July to reiterate my \nconcerns regarding the state of human rights in Turkey and Ankara's \nfailure to improve its implementation of OSCE commitments.\n  Ankara has squandered the past year, failing to meaningfully address \na series of longstanding human rights concerns. Regrettably, there has \nbeen no meaningful improvement in Turkey's implementation of its OSCE \nhuman rights commitments in the 11 months since our original letter to \nthe State Department. Despite a number of changes in Turkish law, the \nfact of the matter is that even these modest proposals have not \ntranslated into improved human rights in Turkey.\n  Mr. President, my resolution does not call for outright rejection of \nthe Turkish proposal. Rather, the resolution calls for the United \nStates to refuse consensus to such a plan until the Government of \nTurkey had demonstrably improved implementation of its freely \nundertaken OSCE commitments, including action to address those human \nrights concerns I will describe in more detail later in my remarks. \nUnder OSCE rules, decisions require that all participating states, \nincluding the United States, give their consensus before a proposal can \nbe adopted. The resolution we introduce today calls upon the President \nto report to the Congress by April 15, 1998, on any improvement to \nTurkey's actual human rights performance.\n  Expert witnesses at a Commission briefing earlier this year \nunderscored the continued, well-documented, and widespread use of \ntorture by Turkish security forces and the failure of the Government of \nTurkey to take determined action to correct such gross violations of \nOSCE provisions and international humanitarian law. Even the much \nheralded reduction of periods for the detention of those accused of \ncertain crimes has failed to deter the use of torture. The fact is that \nthis change on paper is commonly circumvented by the authorities. As \none United States official in Turkey observed in discussion with \nCommission staff, a person will be held in incommunicado for days, then \nthe prisoner's name will be postdated for purposes of official police \nlogs giving the appearance that the person had been held within the \nperiod provided for under the revised law. Turkish authorities also \ncontinue to persecute those who attempt to assist the victims of \ntorture, as in the case of Dr. Tufan Kose.\n\n  Despite revisions in the Anti-Terror Law, its provisions continue to \nbe broadly used against writers, journalists, publishers, politicians, \nmusicians, and students. Increasingly, prosecutors have applied article \n312 of the Criminal Code, which forbids ``incitement to racial or \nethnic enmity.'' Government agents continue to harass human rights \nmonitors. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least \n47 Turkish journalists are in jail in Turkey today--more than in any \nother country in the world.\n  Many human rights abuses have been committed against Kurds who assert \ntheir Kurdish identity. The Kurdish Cultural and Research Foundation \noffices in Istanbul were closed by police in June to prevent the \nteaching of Kurdish language classes. In addition, four former \nparliamentarians from the now banned Kurdish-based Democracy Party \n[DEP]: Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan, and Selim Sadak, who have \ncompleted three years of their 15-year sentences, remain imprisoned at \nAnkara's Ulucanlar Prison. Among the actions cited in Leyla Zana's \nindictment was her 1993 appearance before the U.S. Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe here in Washington, DC. The Lawyers \nCommittee for Human Rights has expressed concern over the case of human \nrights lawyer Hasan Dogan, a member of the People's Democracy Party \n[HADEP], who, like many members of the party, has been subject to \ndetention and prosecution.\n  The Government of Turkey has similarly pursued an aggressive campaign \nof harassment of nongovernmental organizations, including the Human \nRights Foundation of Turkey and the Human Rights Association. An \nAssociation forum on capital punishment was banned in early May as was \na peace conference sponsored by international and Turkish NGO's. Human \nRights Association branch offices in Diyarbakir, Malatya, Izmir, Konya, \nand Urfa have been raided and closed.\n  Mr. President, last week the Congress honored His All Holiness \nBartholomew, the leader of Orthodox believers worldwide. The Ecumenical \nPatriarchate, located in Istanbul--the city proposed by Turkey as the \nvenue for the next OSCE summit--has experienced many difficulties. The \nPatriarchate has repeatedly requested permission to reopen the Orthodox \nseminary on the island of Halki closed by the Turkish authorities since \nthe 1970's despite Turkey's OSCE commitment to ``allow the training of \nreligious personnel in appropriate institutions.''\n  As the State Department's own Country Report on Human Rights \nPractices for 1996 concluded, Turkey ``was unable to sustain \nimprovements made in 1995 and, as a result, its record was uneven in \n1996 and deteriorated in some respects.'' While Turkish civilian \nauthorities remain publicly committed to the establishment of rule of \nlaw state and respect for human rights, torture, excessive use of \nforce, and other serious human rights abuses by the security forces \ncontinue. As our resolution points out, the United States should \nencourage the development of genuine democracy in the Republic of \nTurkey based on protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\n  Mr. President, it is most unfortunate that Turkey's leaders, \nincluding President Demirel--who originally signed the 1975 Helsinki \nFinal Act on behalf of Turkey--have not been able to effectively \naddress these and other longstanding human rights concerns.\n  The privilege and prestige of hosting such an OSCE event should be \nreserved for participating states that have demonstrated their support \nfor Helsinki principles and standards--particularly respect for human \nrights--in both word and in deed. Turkey should not be allowed to serve \nas host of such a meeting until and unless that country's dismal human \nrights record has improved.\n  While some may argue that allowing Turkey to host an OSCE summit \nmeeting might provided political impetus\n\n[[Page S11552]]\n\nfor positive change, we are not convinced, particularly in light of the \nfailure of the Turkish Government to meaningfully improve the human \nrights situation in the months since it offered to host the next OSCE \nsummit. We note that several high-level conferences have been held in \nTurkey without any appreciable impact on that country's human rights \npolicies or practices.\n  Mr. President, promises of improved human rights alone should not \nsuffice. Turkey's desire to host an OSCE summit must be matched by \nconcrete steps to improve its dismal human rights record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two letters I mentioned earlier, to \nSecretary Christopher and Secretary Albright, and a copy of the State \nDepartment's August 13, 1997, reply signed by Assistant Secretary of \nState for Legislative Affairs, Barbara Larkin, be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this \nconcurrent resolution and to work for its passage before the end of \nthis first session of the 105th Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Commission on Security and\n\n\n                                        Cooperation in Europe,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1997.\n     Hon. Madeleine Korbel Albright,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: We write to reiterate and further \n     explain our steadfast opposition to Turkey as the venue for \n     an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     summit meeting and ask the Department, which we understand \n     shares our view, to maintain the United States' refusal to \n     give consensus to the Turkish proposal that the next summit \n     should be held in Istanbul. We also observe that a rigid \n     schedule of biennial summit meetings of the OSCE Heads of \n     State or Government appears to be unwarranted at this stage \n     of the OSCE's development and suggest that serious \n     consideration be given to terminating the mandate which \n     currently requires such meetings to be held whether \n     circumstances warrant them or not.\n       Last November, the Republic of Turkey--an original OSCE \n     participating State--first proposed Istanbul as the site for \n     the next OSCE summit. At that time, we wrote to Secretary \n     Christopher urging that the United States reject this \n     proposal. A decision was postponed until the Copenhagen \n     Ministerial, scheduled for this December, and the Lisbon \n     Document simply noted Turkey's invitation.\n       The United States should withhold consensus on any proposal \n     to hold an OSCE summit in Turkey until and unless Ankara has \n     released the imprisoned Democracy Party (DEP) \n     parliamentarians, journalists and others detained for the \n     non-violent expression of their views; ended the persecution \n     of medical professionals and NGOs who provide treatment to \n     victims of torture and expose human rights abuses; and begun \n     to aggressively prosecute those responsible for torture, \n     including members of the security forces.\n       In addition, the United States should urge the Government \n     of Turkey to undertake additional steps aimed at improving \n     its human rights record, including abolishing Article 8 of \n     the Anti-Terror Law, Article 312 of the Penal Code, and other \n     statutes which violate the principle of freedom of expression \n     and ensuring full respect for the civil, political, and \n     cultural rights of members of national minorities, including \n     ethnic Kurds.\n       Regrettably, there has been no improvement in Turkey's \n     implementation of OSCE human rights commitments in the eight \n     months since our original letter to the Department. Despite a \n     number of changes in Turkish law, the fact of the matter is \n     that even these modest proposals have not translated into \n     improved human rights in Turkey. Ankara's flagrant violations \n     of OSCE standards and norms continues and the problems raised \n     by the United States Delegation to the OSCE Review Meeting \n     last November persist.\n       Madam Secretary, the privilege and prestige of hosting such \n     an OSCE event should be reserved for participating States \n     that have demonstrated their support for Helsinki principles \n     and standards--particularly respect for human rights--in both \n     word and in deed. Turkey should not be allowed to serve as \n     host of such a meeting given that country's dismal human \n     rights record.\n       While some may argue that allowing Turkey to host an OSCE \n     summit meeting might provide political impetus for positive \n     change, we are not convinced, particularly in light of the \n     failure of the Turkish Government to improve the human rights \n     situation in the eight months since it proposed to host the \n     next OSCE summit. We note that several high-level conferences \n     have been held in Turkey without any appreciable impact on \n     that country's human rights policies or practices.\n       Promises of improved human rights alone should not suffice. \n     Turkey's desire to host an OSCE summit must be matched by \n     concrete steps to improve its dismal human rights record.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our views on this \n     important matter and look forward to receiving your reply.\n           Sincerely,\n     Christopher H. Smith,\n                                  Member of Congress, Co-Chairman.\n     Alfonse D'Amato,\n     U.S. Senate, Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Commission on Security and\n\n\n                                        Cooperation in Europe,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 22, 1996.\n     Hon. Warren Christopher,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secertary: We have recently learned that the \n     Republic of Turkey may offer Istanbul as the venue for the \n     next summit meeting of the Heads of State or Government of \n     the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe \n     (OSCE). We write to urge that the United States reject this \n     proposal. A decision on this important matter is extremely \n     urgent as the OSCE Review Meeting concludes today and \n     drafting for the Summit document will begin next week.\n       The privilege of hosting such a prestigious OSCE event \n     should be reserved for participating States that have \n     demonstrated steadfast support for Helsinki principles and \n     standards--particularly respect for human rights--in word and \n     in deed. The U.S. should deny consensus on Turkey's proposal \n     to serve as host of an OSCE summit meeting because of that \n     country's dismal human rights record.\n       The United States Delegation to the OSCE Review Meeting has \n     raised a number of specific examples that illustrate Turkey's \n     flagrant violation of OSCE human rights commitments and \n     international humanitarian law, including the well-documented \n     use of torture. The European Committee for the Prevention of \n     Torture has found that incidence of torture and ill-treatment \n     in Turkey to be ``widespread.'' The UN Committee on Torture \n     has referred to ``systemic'' use of torture in Turkey. \n     Earlier this week, Amnesty International released a report \n     documenting the torture of children held in detention in \n     Turkey.\n       Despite Turkey's revisions to the Anti-Terror Law, it \n     provisions continue to be broadly used against writers, \n     journalists, publishers, politicians, musicians, and \n     students. Increasingly, prosecutors have applied Article 312 \n     of the Criminal Code, which forbids ``incitement to racial or \n     ethnic enmity'' to suppress expression of dissenting views. \n     Government agents continue to harass human rights monitors. \n     Many human rights abuses have been committed against Kurds \n     who publicly or politically assert their Kurdish identity.\n       As the Department's own report on human rights practices in \n     Turkey concluded, while Turkisk civilian authorities remain \n     publicly committed to the establishment of a state of law and \n     respect to human rights, torture, excessive use of force, and \n     other serious human rights abuses by the security forces \n     continue.\n       Regrettably, lone overdue reforms of Turkey's human rights \n     policies and practices announced in mid-October by the \n     Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Mrs. \n     Ciller, have not materialized and the prospects for genuine \n     change in the near term appear remote.\n       Another key factor in our urgent call for rejection of \n     Turkey's proposal to host an OSCE summit is Turkey's \n     continuing illegal and forcible occupation of Cypriot \n     territory in blatant violation of OSCE principles. A \n     substantial force of 30,000 Turkish troops remains in Cyprus \n     today in a clear breach of Cypriot sovereignty. In recent \n     months, we have witnessed the worst violence against innocent \n     civilians along the cease-fire line since the 1974 invasion, \n     resulting in at least 5 deaths. In addition, Turkish and \n     Turkish Cypriot authorities have failed to fully account for \n     at least 1,614 Greek Cypriots and five Americans missing \n     since 1974.\n       While some may argue that allowing Turkey to hose an OSCE \n     summit might provide political impetus for positive change, \n     we are not convinced, particularly in light of the fact that \n     several high-level conferences have been held in Turkey \n     without any appreciable impact on that country's human rights \n     policies or practices. Allowing Turkey to host an OSCE summit \n     based upon an inference of increased leverage to improve \n     Turkish human rights performance, when they are in current, \n     active violation of solemn international commitments would be \n     wrong.\n       Turkey's desire to host an OSCE summit must be matched by \n     concrete steps to improve its dismal human rights, to end its \n     illegal occupation of Cypriot territory, and to contribute to \n     a reduction of tensions in the eastern Mediterranean. Absent \n     demonstrable progress in these areas, the United States \n     should withhold consensus on any proposal to hold an OSCE \n     summit in Turkey.\n           Sincerely,\n     Alfonse D'Amato,\n       U.S. Senator, Co-Chairman.\n     Christopher H.

Christopher H. Smith,\n     Co-Chairman, Commission on Security and Cooperation in \n         Europe, House of Representatives.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am responding on behalf of the \n     Secretary of State to your July 15 letter regarding your \n     concerns about the possible selection of Turkey as the venue \n     for\n\n[[Page S11553]]\n\n     the next summit meeting of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).\n       The Department of State shares your concerns about Turkey's \n     human rights record. All states participating in the OSCE are \n     expected to adhere to the principles of the Helsinki Final \n     Act and other OSCE commitments, including respect for human \n     rights and fundamental freedoms. The U.S. Government has \n     consistently called attention to human rights problems in \n     Turkey and has urged improvements. It does not in any way \n     condone Turkey's, or any other OSCE state's, failure to \n     implement OSCE commitments.\n       The OSCE, however, is also a means of addressing and \n     correcting human rights shortcomings. As you note in your \n     letter, the issue of Turkey's human rights violations was \n     raised at the November OSCE Review Meeting, and will likely \n     continue to be raised at such meetings until Turkey \n     demonstrates that it has taken concrete measures to improve \n     its record. Holding the summit in Turkey could provide an \n     opportunity to influence Turkey to improve its human rights \n     record.\n       As you note, the Turkish government has made some effort to \n     address problem areas, through the relaxation of restrictions \n     on freedom of expression and the recent promulgation of legal \n     reforms which, if fully implemented, would begin to address \n     the torture problem. These measures are only a first step in \n     addressing the problems that exist, but we believe they \n     reflect the commitment of the Turkish government to address \n     its human rights problems. We have been particularly \n     encouraged by the positive attitude the new government, which \n     came to power July 12, has demonstrated in dealing with human \n     rights issues.\n       As you know, the fifty-four nations of the OSCE will \n     discuss the question of a summit venue. As in all OSCE \n     decisions, any decision will have to be arrived at through \n     consensus, which will likely take some time to achieve. In \n     the meantime, the Department of State welcomes your views, \n     and will seriously consider your concerns about the OSCE \n     summit site. I welcome your continuing input on this issue, \n     and thank you for your thoughtful letter.\n       We appreciate your letter and hope this information is \n     helpful. Please do not hesitate to contact us again if we can \n     be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Barbara Larkin,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n     Legislative Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11550-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        THE EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        LOTT AMENDMENT NO. 1542\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LOTT submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill (H.R. 2646) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntax-free expenditures from education individual retirement accounts for \nelementary and secondary school expenses, to increase the maximum \nannual amount of contributions to such accounts, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after ``1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE YEAR 2000 PROBLEM.\n\n       With the year 2000 fast approaching, it is the sense of \n     Congress that the Federal Aviation Administration should--\n       (1) give high priority to correcting all 2-digit date-\n     related problems in its computer systems to ensure that those \n     systems continue to operate effectively in the year 2000 and \n     beyond;\n       (2) assess immediately the extent of the risk to the \n     operations of the Federal Aviation Administration posed by \n     the problems referred to in paragraph (1), and plan and \n     budget for achieving Year 2000 compliance for all of its \n     mission-critical systems; and\n\n[[Page S11567]]\n\n       (3) develop contingency plans for those systems that the \n     Federal Aviation Administration is unable to correct in time.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Gorton, Senator \nHollings, and Senator Ford, in submitting an amendment to the bill \n(H.R. 1271) the Federal Aviation Administration Research, Engineering, \nand Development Authorization Act of 1997. This bill would authorize \nthe Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] Research, Engineering, and \nDevelopment [RE] program. The program funds projects to improve \nfacilities, equipment, techniques, and procedures so that our Nation's \naviation system can operate safety and efficiently.\n  The FAA's research and development activities help to provide the \nadvancements and innovations that are needed to keep the U.S. aviation \nsystem the best in the world. Our Nation's ability to have a strong \naviation-related research and development program directly impacts our \nsuccess in the global market and our standard of living. Investment in \nthe FAA RE program will fund projects to determine how limited \nairport and airspace capacity can meet ever increasing demands, \naviation security can be improved, and flight safety concerns can be \naddressed.\n  The FAA has divided its RE program into nine key areas. These \ninclude capacity and air traffic management technology; communications, \nnavigation and surveillance systems; weather; airport technology; \naircraft safety technology; system security technology; human factors \nand aviation medicine; environment and energy; and innovative/\ncooperative research. The FAA funds various projects in these nine \nareas.\n  Ongoing or planned FAA RE projects will provide important benefits \nfor the U.S. aviation system and its users. The aircraft safety \ntechnology area, for example, includes continued research on improving \npassenger evacuation in the event of an aircraft accident. The system \nsecurity technology area will include efforts to develop more effective \nexplosives detection technologies. In addition, several recommendations \nof the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security will \ninvolve the FAA RE program, including modernizing the Nation's air \ntraffic control system.\n  I strongly support the FAA's efforts under the RE program to work \nin partnership with public and private entities. These partnerships \nenable the FAA to gain expertise in specialized areas of technology, \nand to leverage limited Federal funds. The FAA, for example, now has \nmore than 250 agreements for research and development partnerships with \nresearch organizations, foreign governments, and industry consortia. In \naddition, the FAA has established several university-based research \ncenters.\n  This bill also asks the FAA to address problems that the Agency may \nface if the software in any of its various computer systems \nmalfunctions when they hit the year 2000. In particular, we cannot \nafford to have air traffic control systems affected by this problem. I \nunderstand that the FAA is behind schedule in determining which of its \nsystems are affected by the Year 2000 problem. The time to make this \ndetermination, and then make necessary software modifications, is \ngrowing short. That is why the bill includes a Sense of the Congress \nthat the FAA should, among other things, develop contingency plans for \nthose systems that the Agency is unable to correct in time.\n  The FAA RE program is a key component of the Agency's total ongoing \nefforts to provide the most safe and efficient aviation system \npossible. I would strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this bill to authorize the program.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and Senator Ford, in \nsubmitting an amendment to the bill (H.R. 1271) the Federal Aviation \nAdministration Research, Engineering, and Development Authorization Act \nof 1997. The bill authorizes the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] \nResearch, Engineering, and Development [RE] account for fiscal year \n1998. The FAA RE account finances projects to improve the safety, \nsecurity, capacity, and efficiency of the U.S. aviation system. The \nauthorization for the RE account expired at the end of September.\n  Recognizing the key role that research and development efforts play \nin improving our Nation's aviation system, the Congress over time has \nstrengthened the FAA RE program. In 1982, the Congress determined \nthat a comprehensive research and development program was necessary to \nhelp ensure that the FAA could maintain a safe and efficient air \ntraffic system. In 1988, the Congress established the FAA RE Advisory \nBoard to help the FAA set research priorities. After the terrorist \nbombing of Pan Am Flight 103, the Congress approved the Aviation Safety \nImprovement Act of 1990, which required the FAA to support activities \nto accelerate the research and development of new technologies to \nprotect against terrorism.\n  This bill would authorize the FAA to finance important research and \ndevelopment efforts. These efforts include developing new fire-\nresistant insulation materials for use on aircraft. Fires are a major \nthreat to aircraft, and this new insulation is intended to give \npassengers additional time to evacuate if an accident occurs. The FAA \nalso has ongoing research to develop procedures for enhancing terminal \narea capacity and safety.\n  It is noteworthy that the FAA works with other Federal agencies and \nthe private sector to leverage RE funds. The FAA, for example, has \ncooperative arrangements with the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration and the Department of Defense. The FAA is also currently \nworking with more than 80 private industry partners on 15 major \ntechnology development projects. Working with private industry, for \nexample, the FAA recently completed development of a new concrete foam \nmaterial that will safely stop a large airliner that overshoots a \nrunway because of problems during take off or landing. In addition to \nleveraging Federal funds, such partnerships facilitate the \ndissemination of research results to the private sector where they can \nbe used to produce commercial products that will benefit the users of \nthe U.S. aviation system.\n  The bill includes a Sense of the Congress concerning the so-called \nYear 2000 problem as it relates to the FAA. Simply stated, the problem \nstems from the inability of some software to recognize the change from \nthe year 1999 to the year 2000. In these cases, software code must be \nrewritten to prevent computer systems from crashing. Because the FAA \nhas many systems, including various air traffic control systems, the \nbill states that the FAA should assess immediately the extent to which \nits systems will be affected, and to develop a plan and budget to make \nneeded corrections.\n  Funding appropriate research and development projects today can help \nto achieve a safer and more efficient air transportation system \ntomorrow. The bill that I am introducing authorizes this funding. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11566-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11567-S11568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

SMITH\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on June 5, 1997, a remarkable woman \nand superb scientist, Dr. Helene Smith, died at her home in California.\n  Dr. Smith's scholarly activities and indefatigable personality \ninfluenced the scientific community well beyond San Francisco's \nCalifornia Pacific Medical Center, where she directed the Geraldine \nBrush Cancer Research Institute.\n  There is great sadness as well as irony associated with Dr. Smith's \ndeath from breast cancer, a disease she devoted much of her life to \nstudying.\n  Her friend and colleague, Dr. Ann Thor, professor of pathology and \nsurgery at the Northwestern University School of Medicine, has written \na very moving tribute which will be published in the Journal of Mammary \nGland Biology and Neoplasia (Volume 3, Issue 1, in press).\n  I am grateful to Dr. Thor, Dr. Peggy Neville, editor of the Journal, \nand to Plenum Publishing Corp. for permission to use this tribute, and \nI ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n                    Helene Smith, Ph.D.: A Memorial\n\n                          (By Ann Thor, M.D.)\n\n       Dr. Helene Smith, who has contributed greatly to our \n     understanding of and research devoted to breast cancer, died \n     recently of that disease. Dr. Smith was a leader in the \n     scientific community--publishing extensively in the fields of \n     breast cancer cell biology and molecular genetics. Helene had \n     a uniquely personal battle with breast cancer, as it claimed \n     several family members including a sister. Her enthusiasm and \n     involvement in breast cancer research was unique. Those who \n     knew her well understood that her motivations went beyond the \n     norm and closely approximated a religious zeal, even before \n     her own diagnosis. As noted by Dr. Edison Liu, Director of \n     the Division of Clinical Sciences of the National Cancer \n     Institute of the National Institutes of Health, ``Her sense \n     of conviction to the conquest of breast cancer made her one \n     of the most compelling advocates. This sense was contagious \n     and invigorated her colleagues to overcome petty barriers to \n     interaction so that we may act as a unified force in breast \n     cancer research.''\n       As both patient and experienced researcher, she developed \n     insights regarding the positive and negative aspects of our \n     current health care system, traditional medical approaches \n     and the infrastructure which supports breast cancer research \n     in this country. Helene actively promoted interactions \n     between clinicians of all specialties, basic researchers and \n     patient advocates to foster new approaches where traditional \n     measures have failed. She served tirelessly as the principal \n     investigator of a program project to develop new molecular \n     and cellular markers for predicting breast cancer prognosis, \n     and as co-principle investigator of a Special Program of \n     Research Excellence (SPORE) to develop novel approaches to \n     breast cancer therapeutics. Dr. Smith was Chair of the \n     Integration Panel of the Department of Defense Breast Cancer \n     Research Program and served as well on the National Advisory \n     Board of the Susan G. Komen Foundation. Helene received many \n     honors for her accomplishments in traditional breast cancer \n     science. In 1995 she was honored by the Komen Foundation with \n     the prestigious Brinker International Award for Breast Cancer \n     Research.\n       Dr. Smith was a pioneer supporter of breast cancer patient \n     advocates and encouraged their participation in research \n     programs. According to one advocate, Deborah Collyar, ``When \n     I first met her, she was very much against advocates getting \n     involved in science . . . however, she began to see how \n     important it was to start bringing in the patient \n     perspective. Helene became one of the best patient advocates \n     I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.'' In this unusual \n     role, she worked tirelessly with patient groups to explain \n     the science and serve as a translator of traditional \n     medicine.\n       Helene believed that her own role in research was best \n     carried out at a small institute rather than at a large \n     university. She used the metaphor that her institute (the \n     Geraldine Brush Cancer Research Institute of California \n     Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco) was a canoe and that \n     universities were ocean liners. According to her husband, \n     Allan Smith M.D., she believed that a canoe was best to \n     explore new territory and negotiate sudden turns (e.g., new \n     research directions) and ocean liners were better at \n     conventional work (e.g., major research protocols). She \n     believed that both of these approaches were necessary for the \n     advancement of science, but novel research was more fun.\n       Helene's immersion into breast cancer from all aspects of \n     her professional and personal life allowed her to develop \n     novel ideas regarding cancer therapeutics as well. Spiritual \n     and physical aspects of the disease overlapped, driving a \n     renewed interest in cancer immunology, epigenetic factors and \n     complementary medicine. Some transgressions away from \n     traditional science were not always favorably considered by \n     more traditional scientific colleagues, but Helene persisted \n     and sought to apply strict scientific methods and study \n     designs to test complementary approaches. As noted by her \n     clinician Debu Tripathy, M.D., ``The popular field of \n     alternative and complementary medicine, ranging from herbal \n     medicine to mind-body interaction, was of great interest to \n     Helene, although she adopted a rigorous scientific approach \n     in order to evaluate them.'' As an outgrowth of those \n     interests, she helped found the California Pacific Medical \n     Center's Institute for Health and Healing as\n\n[[Page S11569]]\n\n     well as the Research Institute's new division, the \n     Complementary Medicine Research Institute, which encompasses \n     clinical and scientific laboratory based programs to study \n     alternative medical approaches. ``Helene envisioned a \n     practice of science and medicine without boundaries,'' \n     according to Dr. Tripathy.\n       Dr. Smith graduated BS Cum Laude from the University of \n     Pennsylvania in 1962 and received a Doctorate in Microbiology \n     from the University of Pennsylvania in 1967. A postdoctoral \n     research position at Princeton University in Professor Arthur \n     B. Pardee's laboratory from 1967-69 laid the ground work for \n     her interests in cell culture and cellular transformation. \n     Her first breast cancer research manuscript was published in \n     1973. This was followed by decades of important citations--\n     resulting in over 100 publications. One of her last \n     manuscripts published by Science, ``Loss of Heterozygosity in \n     Normal Tissue Adjacent to Breast Carcinomas'' (Vol. 274, \n     1996), described genetic losses in morphologically normal \n     lobular epithelium adjacent to breast cancers. These findings \n     support her ``stochastic model of breast carcinogenesis'', a \n     multivariate model of acquired genetic change. Helene \n     believed that molecular alterations might someday be used to \n     predict breast carcinogenesis or the biology of breast \n     cancers in individual women. Her findings also suggest that \n     our current methods of tissue evaluation (histopathologic \n     evaluation) may be inadequate as the science is further \n     developed. Helene sought to identify new intermediate \n     endpoints and understand early changes in the process of \n     breast carcinogenesis. She felt that a combination of \n     traditional pathology and molecular diagnostics would be \n     more informative for individual patients than a \n     categorical system based on histopathology alone.\n       As a result of her leadership in science, ability to cross \n     over disciplines, devotion to translational advancements, \n     mentoring and recruitment capacities, ability to \n     conceptualize novel ideas and service in numerous \n     administrative roles, she has forever changed traditional \n     approaches to breast cancer science. In addition to fostering \n     research in many areas, Helene was particularly important as \n     a mentor for young scientists--particularly women.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \n``Jeopardy'' and its efforts in educational outreach. The show has been \nsuccessful in providing more than just entertainment for its audience. \nIn over 3,000 episodes spanning 14 years, ``Jeopardy'' has challenged \nviewers to expand their horizons and learn more about some fundamental \nfields of study.\n  ``Jeopardy'' seeks and demands attentive participation. Accordingly, \nthis forum has often been used by schools throughout the country to \nimprove students' performance in a wide array of subjects.\n  The show will be taping in 2 weeks worth of episodes from Washington, \nDC, at Constitution Hall. The first week will pay tribute to the \neducational accomplishments of our Nation's best and brightest \nchildren. The second week will spotlight members of the political \ncommunity to raise more than $150,000 for worthy causes and stress the \nvalue of education.\n  It seems clear that ``Jeopardy'' realizes the significance of \nlearning for people both young and old. I salute ``Jeopardy'' for \nreaching beyond the television screen to provide quality programming \nwith truly profound educational benefits for every community across the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11569-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TITLE VII OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I submit the following \nclarification to the fiscal year 1998 Interior and related agencies \nappropriations bill on behalf of myself and Senator Mack.

It should be \nunderstood that the lawsuit referred to in section 702(2) and elsewhere \nhas already been dismissed. However, since the lawsuit formed the \nunderlaying basis of the dispute and could be revived absent this \nsettlement, the settlement and this legislation refers to the lawsuit \nand settles all claims based on the underlying facts of the lawsuit. It \nshould also be understood that the concurrence of the Board of Trustees \nof the International Improvements Trust Fund referred to in section \n702(7)(B)(ii) relates only to the transfer of land to which the Board \nholds title.

Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to \njoin the celebration of the 75th anniversary of American ORT, and to \ncongratulate Senior Federal Judge Abraham Lincoln Marovitz on being \nAmerican ORT's Diamond Jubilee Award winner.\n  Each year, American ORT provides high-technology vocational training \nand education to over 6,000 students in cities across the country, \nincluding Chicago at the Zarem/Golde ORT Technical Institute. \nWorldwide, ORT teaches comprehensive technical skills to over 250,000 \nstudents in 60 countries. As a private, nonsectarian, nonpartisan, \nnonprofit organization, ORT has provided hope and opportunity to \nhundreds of thousands of people through high quality vocational \neducation.\n  The stunning success of American ORT during the past 75 years \ncertainly would not have been possible without the presence of its \nbrightest star, Senior Federal Court Judge Abraham Lincoln Marovitz. \nThe contributions made by Judge Marovitz to American ORT, the State of \nIllinois, and our Nation are, quite simply, without peer.\n  Judge Marovitz overcame humble beginnings amidst the poverty of \nChicago's west side to lead a remarkable life of public service. After \ngraduating from Chicago-Kent College of Law at the age of 19 in 1927, \nJudge Marovitz went on to serve as an Assistant Illinois states \nattorney and an Illinois State senator. In 1943, at the age of 38, \nJudge Marovitz waived his senatorial deferment and enlisted as a \nprivate in the U.S. Marine Corps. After seeing combat and being wounded \nin the Pacific Theater, he retired from the Marines with the rank of \nsergeant major.\n  In 1950, Abraham Lincoln Marovitz was elected judge of the Superior \nCourt of Illinois. From 1958 to 1959, he served as the chief justice of \nthe Criminal Court of Cook County. Judge Marovitz received national \nrecognition for his jurisprudence in 1963 when President Kennedy \nappointed him as the U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois. In 1975, Judge Marovitz assumed senior status as \na U.S. District Court Judge, a position in which he continues to serve \nthe people of Illinois and the Nation.\n  Judge Marovitz has not been content to focus solely on his career. \nInstead, he has freely given both his time and talents to a wide range \nof community organizations. In addition to his association with \nAmerican ORT, he has served groups including the Jewish War Veterans of \nthe United States, the National Conference of State Court Trial Judges, \nand the American Legion. Moreover, Judge Marovitz served as chairman of \nthe board of the Lincoln National Bank for 17 years, was a board member \nand trustee of Chicago-Kent College of Law and the Chicago Medical \nSchool, the Chicago Bar Association, and numerous other civic, \nreligious, and veterans organizations.\n  For his voluntarism, Judge Marovitz has been honored by organizations \nsuch as the Variety Club, the Daughters of the American Revolution, the \nAnti-Defamation League, the United Neighborhood Organization of \nChicago, the Jesse Owens Foundation, the Chicago City Council, the \nState of Illinois, and the State of Israel. These awards are but a few \nof the many testaments to his unyielding devotion to and enduring love \nfor his fellow man and woman.\n  For all his civic commitments, Judge Marovitz has never lost his \ncommon touch and regard for individuals no matter their station in \nlife. Specifically, I am personally ever indebted to him for the many \nkindnesses he showed me years ago, when I was a young assistant U.S. \nattorney.\n\n[[Page S11570]]\n\n  Without a doubt, the city of Chicago, the State of Illinois, and our \ncountry have benefited greatly from the many selfless contributions \nthat Judge Marovitz has made over the years. He is not only a Chicago \ntreasure, but a national treasure as well. I take great pride in \ncongratulating him on his American ORT Diamond Jubilee Award. It is \nalso my distinct honor to celebrate 75 wonderful years of ORT in the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11569-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION \n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of Senate \nresolution 141, and that the Senate then proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 141) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding National Concern About Young People and Gun \n     Violence Day.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank my many colleagues, who \non such short notice, agreed to cosponsor and enact this resolution \nestablishing November 6, 1997, as National Concern about Young People \nand Gun Violence Day. I know the many volunteers and organizations \nworking to protect our children also offer their thanks.\n  Today, Halloween, is a perfect day to reaffirm our national \ncommitment to stopping youth violence. On this night, children across \nAmerica will be going trick or treating dressed in all sorts of \nwonderful costumes. They will enjoy seeing each other, visiting their \nneighbors, and--best of all--getting mountains of sweets.\n  But in many cities, parents will keep their children inside. There \nwill be no trick or treating because the streets are too dangerous for \nchildren. There might be block parties, but there won't be the fun and \nfreedom that comes from frolicking through the streets in search of the \ngood treats. All of us recognize the importance of making our streets \nand communities safe for children.\n  One person, Mary Lewis Grow, thought something we might do to make \nour young people safer was to establish a national Day of Concern. So, \nthis Minnesota homemaker, in 1996, persuaded Senators Wellstone, \nSpecter, and Bradley to introduce this resolution. Other groups, such \nas Mothers Against Violence in America, joined her effort. The \nproclamation of a special day of recognition also provided support to a \nnational effort to encourage students to sign a pledge against gun \nviolence. In 1996, 32,000 students in Washington State signed the \npledge card, as did more than 200,000 children in New York City, and \ntens of thousands more across the Nation.\n  The Student Pledge Against Gun Violence calls for a national \nobservance on November 6 to give students throughout America the chance \nto make a promise, in writing, that they will do their part to prevent \ngun violence. The students' pledge promises three things: first, they \nwill never carry a gun to school; second, they will never resolve a \ndispute with a gun; and third, they will use their influence with \nfriends to discourage them from resolving disputes with guns.\n  Mr. President, just last week I joined several colleagues on the \nfloor of the Senate as we decried the murder of Ann Harris, a 17-year-\nold Virginian, by a 19-year-old man in Washington State. This random \nact of violence was apparently precipitated because the car in which \nAnn was a passenger was going too slowly for the driver of the car in \nwhich the murderer was riding. The young man was angry enough and \nmorally numbed enough to fire his gun into Ann's car, killing Ann. What \na tragedy. What a waste.\n  In another example, a 14-year-old boy opened fire in a Moses Lake, \nWA, classroom, killing a teacher and student and wounding others. He \nhas been convicted, but that does little to ease the pain of the loss \nsuffered by that small community. Maybe if he had signed a pledge, \nmaybe if he had heard the message over and over from parents and \nfriends that gun violence was the wrong way to solve problems, maybe \nif, maybe if. We don't know how we might have stopped this act of \nviolence, but we know we all have to try education, try outreach, try \neverything.\n  Mr. President, we need to help all of our kids feel a part of this \nsociety. Yet\n\n[[Page S11573]]\n\noften we overlook the young people themselves when trying to develop \nsolutions. Students and other young leaders represent the great \nuntapped resource for improving our communities. As many teachers and \npolice officers have told me, ``if a young person doesn't succeed \nanywhere else, they can always find success in a gang.'' We need to \nmake sure they have more productive options. The road to creating these \noptions, and to healing our communities, starts with the young people \nthemselves.\n  Young people increasingly grow tired of getting all of the blame for \ncrime in our neighborhoods, and none of the responsibility for \nsolutions. If you ask young people what they think will make a \ndifference for them, you'll find them to be highly creative. Many times \ntheir solutions work far better than solutions put forward by adults.\n  Young people in my State and across the country don't like school \nuniform requirements, curfews, and other policies enacted for young \npeople. Young people with the Seattle Youth Involvement Network decided \nto do something about it. They opened a dialog with the police \ndepartment. They shared perspectives. They looked across the lines that \nseparated their cultures. They spoke about ways police see and speak \nwith young people and vice versa. And they found solutions to many \nproblems facing them both.\n  For more than a year now, I've been in a dialog with young people \nfrom all over the State of Washington who have joined the Senate \nAdvisory Youth Involvement Team I established. They advise me on issues \naffecting them, and I help them with local community action. Crime, and \nhow to prevent it, is a large concern with the young people I talk \nwith, whether they are in gifted programs or youth offender programs.\n  This resolution today should be seen as an invitation for young \npeople across the country to tell us what they think about how to solve \nthe problems of crime and gun violence. It should be displayed in every \nschool, community center, and on every street corner in America.\n  Mr. President, let us work with our kids to show them we care. And \nwith our communities to give these young people other options to \nviolence. I again affirm my commitment to work with our young people to \nlet them know we care about them and to help them learn gun violence is \nnot the answer to any problem.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to, en bloc, that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, that any statements relating thereto \nbe placed in the record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 141) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 141\n\n       Whereas every day in America, 15 children under the age of \n     19 are killed with guns;\n       Whereas in 1994, approximately 70 percent of murder victims \n     aged 15 to 17 were killed with a handgun;\n       Whereas in 1995, nearly 8 percent of high school students \n     reported having carried a gun in the past 30 days;\n       Whereas young people are our nation's most important \n     resource, and we, as a society, have a vested interest in \n     helping children grow from a childhood free from fear and \n     violence into healthy adulthood;\n       Whereas young people can, by taking responsibility for \n     their own decisions and actions, and by positively \n     influencing the decisions and actions of others, help chart a \n     new and less violent direction for the entire Nation;\n       Whereas students in every school district in the Nation \n     will be invited to take part in a day of nationwide \n     observance involving millions of their fellow students, and \n     will thereby be empowered to see themselves as significant \n     agents in a wave of positive social change; and\n       Whereas the observance of this day will give the students \n     the opportunity to make an earnest decision about their \n     future by voluntarily signing the ``Student Pledge Against \n     Gun Violence'', and sincerely promise that the students will \n     never take a gun to school, will never use a gun to settle a \n     dispute, and will use their influence to keep friends from \n     using guns to settle disputes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) November 6, 1997, should be designated as ``National \n     Concern About Young People and Gun Violence Day''; and\n       (2) the President should be authorized and requested to \n     issue a proclamation calling upon the school children of the \n     United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/31/senate-section/article/S11572-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11573-S11574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
