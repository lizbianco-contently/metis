This article shall take effect beginning with \n     fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning \n     after its ratification, whichever is later.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the amendment I have just sent to the \ndesk essentially differs from the Senate Joint Resolution 1, the \nmajority balanced budget amendment, in just four ways. I would like to \nquickly summarize the distinctions and then go over each one of them \nand explain why I believe this amendment will stand the test of \nscrutiny. This substitute approach, in my view, represents how we need \nto address the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, we have just had quite a bit of debate on the Reid \namendment. The arguments have been made as to why the Social Security \ntrust funds, should be removed from the unified budget. This amendment \nwould allow Social Security trust funds to continue to remain as part \nof the unified budget up to the point Congress achieves balance, which \nhas been estimated at 2002. The administration and Congress have both \nindicated a commitment to balancing the budget by 2002. This amendment \nrespects that goal.\n  The amendment would require that 1 year after enactment, whenever the \namendment is ratified by three-quarters of the legislatures of the \nStates, the amendment would go into effect and be binding. If the \namendment becomes effective in 2002, the year in which bipartisan \nconsensus exists for balancing the budget, the year in which Social \nSecurity would be excluded would be 2003. This provides an opportunity \nto transition away from our current reliance on the Social Security \ntrust funds to offset deficit spending in other areas and reach balance \nunder a balanced budget amendment.\n  As Senator Hatch will recall, last year when the amendment was on the \nfloor, we held some negotiations to try to reach agreement. Many of us \nfeel very strongly that Social Security should not be part of balancing \nthe budget. We had some negotiations to review whether we might agree \nto a balanced budget, that excluded the Social Security trust funds, by \nthe year 2008. The majority did not support the approach and the \nresponse to the offer was that it is too difficult to balance the \nbudget if you withdraw Social Security trust funds from the unified \nbudget. I have given that considerable thinking and believe that if we \nuse it up to the point of balance, and then separate it out, that gives \ntime to adjust to this withdrawal of Social Security. My amendment \nprohibits the use of the Social Security trust funds after Congress has \nreached balance and would prohibit the use of the trust funds \nthereafter.\n  My amendment's second point would retain restrictions on lifting the \ndebt limit. However, it would require a majority vote, rather than a \nthree-fifths vote, as the majority balanced budget amendment provides.\n  The third point of the amendment would permit Congress to respond to \nserious economic emergencies or major national disasters. Without that, \na bailout for a California earthquake would have to be paid for within \nthe confines of balanced outlays and expenditures. A savings and loan \nbailout would have to be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget, \nbalancing revenue and expenditures. This balance, if the Nation faced \nan economic emergency or major natural disaster, would be much more \ndifficult to achieve in the outyears.\n  Fourth, this amendment would clarify that passage of the amendment \nwould not prohibit Congress from developing a capital budget. It does \nnot mandate a capital budget, but as has been made clear by Senator \nTorricelli and others, the majority amendment would essentially prevent \nthe Federal Government of the United States of America from ever \ndeveloping a capital budget. A capital budget has been a useful budget \nstructure for many of the States, as you know from experience, Mr. \nPresident, and many of the cities, as I know. These cities and States \nhave capital budgets separate and distinct from their operating \nbudgets. They fund these capital budgets for physical assets, like \nbuildings, bridges, and highways, in a multiyear funding mechanism. \nThis structure could make sense for the Federal Government as well, and \nwe should not close the door on this option. Unfortunately, the \nmajority balanced budget amendment does precisely that.\n\n  So these are the four points of difference. I would like to elaborate \non these concerns.\n  Let me just tell you why I feel so strongly about Social Security. To \nbegin with, Social Security is already separate and discreet. Every \nworker, workers in your family and in my family, have 6.2 percent of \ntheir paycheck deducted every month for FICA taxes. This is matched by \n6.2 percent from every employer in the country for a total of 12.4 \npercent FICA contribution. Workers are told that this money goes into a \ntrust fund to be used for their retirement, invested by the Federal \nGovernment, so it will be there when they retire for their Social \nSecurity benefits. This I view as a solemn pledge. The workers are \nnever told that the 12.4 percent FICA contribution is actually part of \nthe unified budget. They are never told their payments, in fact, \nsupport the purchase of a battleship, or the payment of a lawyer's \nsalary, or the payment of a clerk's salary, or the building of a \nhighway or for any other activity of our Government's general \noperations.\n\n  Now, this is also wrong because of the looming retirement of the baby \nboom generation. Analysts concluded Congress needed to increase FICA \ntaxes a while back to be able to provide for the retirement of our \nlarge baby boom generation. Well, the taxes were increased, but, again, \nthe funds are part of the unified budget and they support a battleship, \na lawyer, a clerk, recreation programs, and so on and so forth.\n  I think that is wrong. I also think the Congress recognized it was \nwrong when this House, virtually unanimously, enacted the Hollings \nresolution in 1990. As you know, the Hollings resolution said, \nhenceforth, we will not include Social Security as part of the unified \nbudget.\n  The majority amendment essentially enshrines in the Constitution, for \nall time, the use of Social Security trust funds as part of the unified \nbudget. The funds will be used to pay for every soldier, every \nbattleship, every highway, every clerk, and every park employee of the \nFederal Government.\n  I think this is wrong. I think it is wrong morally, I think it is \nwrong ethically, and I think if it were ever tested, it would be found \nto be wrong legally, as well. But we have been using the Social \nSecurity trust funds and we\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\nare in a budget hole as a result. It is really a catch-22 situation. \nThe only way out is to amend this majority balanced budget amendment, \nand this is what I propose to do.\n  Now, let me give you some idea of the challenge Social Security \nfaces. This chart represents the Social Security trust funds, between \n1996 and 2002. According to the Social Security Administration data, we \nuse approximately $570 billion of these surplus trust funds to balance \nthe budget. Between 2002 and 2019 we use $1.8 trillion of Social \nSecurity trust funds part of the unified budget. My amendment \nrepresents a compromise, if you will. The amendment recognizes how \ndifficult it is to balance the Federal budget without the Social \nSecurity trust funds. We will only use the $570 billion up to 2002, and \nafter 2002, these funds will be separated out from the unified budget. \nThese Social Security receipts will remain in a separate and discreet \ntrust fund. They will not be used to pay for a battleship or a soldier \nor a clerk's salary or a lawyer's salary or anything else. That is $1.8 \ntrillion that will essentially be saved to pay for retirements. This \nrestriction makes the task of shoring up the long-term solvency of \nSocial Security, which the majority balanced budget makes more \ndifficult, a lot easier to achieve.\n  As a former mayor, I know that one of the things you do to really \nassess spending at any government level is look at outlays. Outlays are \ndollars the government actually spends. If you look at outlays, you \nwill see in 1995, more than 50 percent of all of the money spent by the \nFederal Government was essentially spent for entitlements, like \nMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and welfare, and 14 percent was \ndedicated to pay interest on the debt. Interest, which buys nothing, \nhas doubled since 1969. Therefore, if you do nothing by the year 2003, \nalmost 75 percent of all of the outlays of the Federal Government are \neffectively Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, welfare, and interest \non the debt. The spending trends are what really motivates me, and I \nhope others, to accept a constitutional balanced budget amendment.\n\n  These spending priorities will run into each other and it becomes \nmore difficult to balance the budget under any balanced budget \namendment. One has to understand what we are going to protect. I think \nSocial Security is critically important to protect for a number of \nreasons.\n  If we look at the funding patterns for Social Security, Social \nSecurity revenue, payroll taxes and interest that has built up a \nsurplus, begins to drop around 2019. As soon as these funds begin to \ndrop, Social Security outlays begin to exceed our Social Security \nrevenue. Under the majority balanced budget amendment, total \nexpenditures and the outlays meet. When outlays exceed our revenue, \nCongress either has to increase taxes, cut Social Security payments or \ncut other programs or in some way find revenues so that those outlays \nand expenditures match. This is the significance of the Congressional \nResearch Service memo that has been discussed by several Senators. So \nas it goes straight down, every year you have to either make deeper \ncuts, in Social Security or somewhere else, or you have to increase \ntaxes just to pay these Social Security checks.\n  Now, is this fair? Is this what we want to do? Is it fair in these \noutyears to place Social Security recipients so deeply at risk? I have \ncome to the conclusion that it is not fair, that it is not the right \nthing to do. Therefore, my amendment would permit the use of the Social \nSecurity trust funds up to 2002 and remove it from the unified budget \nthereafter.\n  Critics suggest this amendment creates a big problem in the year \n2003. However, this amendment would also provide the ability to develop \na capital budget. Our Nation has significant capital needs, yet we are \nunderinvesting in this important area. In 1965, the United States \ninvested 6.3 percent of its budget in infrastructure spending. We built \nthe Nation's highways, we built bridges, we built other major projects \nwhich benefit this Nation. This is not a nation whose population is \ngoing down. It is a nation whose population is increasing and a growing \npopulation has infrastructure needs. However, by 1992, our investment \nin capital infrastructure declined to 3 percent of the budget. When \npush comes to shove, Congress reduces capital spending, dropping those \nthings that enable us to provide a decent quality of life for our \ncitizens, such as the ability to get to a job without gridlock or the \nability to travel over a bridge on a Federal highway that is not going \nto fall down. Our infrastructure has been decaying and it needs \nadequate funding.\n  More than one-third of the major highways of the United States, \nrepresenting one-quarter of a million miles, are in poor or mediocre \ncondition and need to be repaired. Approximately 25 percent of our \n570,000 highway bridges are described as structurally deficient, or \nfunctionally obsolete. What does this say? We are becoming capital poor \nin infrastructure.\n  Those of us that have been Governors and mayors know that one of the \nprime responsibilities of government is infrastructure, something that \nis not very sexy for the public. Our responsibilities are the streets, \nkeeping potholes off of streets, keeping bridges and roads in good \nrepair and minimizing the risk of accidents for people. I contend we \ncannot do that under the restrictions of this balanced budget, unless, \nat some point in the future, Congress has the ability to enact a \ncapital budget and to fund long-term capital improvements on a \nmultiyear basis rather than in cash up front as is done now.\n  If you take 2 percent of GDP as your measure of investment, it would \nbe about $160 billion right now. Congress could create a limit based on \na percentage of GDP. I think we spend about $140 billion now. So if you \nwanted to ratchet it up, to permit a higher level of investment, you \nwould simply set a limit at a higher percent of GDP.\n  The limit would operate similar to a kind of bond limit, as we use in \nStates. The Government would have a certain bonding capacity and you \nwould stay within the limit of that bonding capacity, which would \nreflect our economic strength, interest payments, and payback schedule \nand similar factors.\n  I think it makes tremendous sense. I think that without providing for \na capital budget, we undermine our Nation's ability to do and carry out \none of the most important responsibilities of a Federal Government, the \nproviding of safe and adequate Federal infrastructure for the future of \nour people.\n  Now, let me speak about the economic emergency. The majority \namendment does not provide for an economic emergency. In an economic \nemergency, it is important that the automatic stabilizers be able to \nfunction. It is important that we be able to respond to extreme and \nserious national emergencies, whether this be a major depression or, I \nmight say, a savings and loan crisis, that develops in the future, or \nanother crisis. Congress was forced to spend an additional $135 billion \nto clean up the fiscal mess of the savings and loan crisis in the \n1980's and 1990's. These costs weren't anticipated and they weren't \nprojected. Yet, we had to honor the United States' commitment to \nprotect depositors.\n  If Senate Joint Resolution 1 were in place, Congress would have been \nforced to cut the budget by $66 billion in 1991, to meet its savings \nand loan bailout obligations in that year, by cutting education, \ncutting highways, cutting crime fighting and other priorities in order \nto pay off depositors. Now, is that really the situation we want to \nplace ourselves in for, not just 10 or 15 years, but in perpetuity, \nforever and ever and ever?\n  If you asked me in the 1960's or 1970's, would I ever think that \nthese savings and loans would default, the answer would have been no. \nBut the fact of the matter is that they did. The fact of the matter is \nthat the cost to the Federal Government was $135 billion, and in 1991 \nthis Congress ponied up $66 billion. Now, that is $66 billion that \nwould be pitted against the purchase of a new battleship or soldiers' \nsalaries or their cost-of-living raise, or a clerk in the Agriculture \nDepartment, or a lawyer in the Justice Department. That is the \ninescapable truth of budgeting.\n  Therefore, the majority amendment prohibition on the development of a \ncapital budget, even if this or a future Congress believes it would be \nnecessary or prudent or wise to enact one, I think, is a major error. \nConsequently, my amendment would permit Congress to develop a capital \nbudget in the future.\n  Now, let me briefly address extending the debt limit. A three-fifths \nvote in\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\nGovernment is something you do when you really want the minority to \ncontrol the process. We are a representative democracy. We represent \nthe people, and the bulk of votes in a representative democracy are a \nmajority. The majority speaks. All of you down there, Mr. and Mrs. \nAmerica, how many of you favor more police on your streets? The hands \ngo up. A majority. How many favor more firefighters? Hands go up. A \nmajority. We reflect those views when we come back to the Congress. We \ngenerally know what the majority believes. It is very hard to know what \na minority really believes, and this gives inordinate power to a \nminority.\n\n  People often argue it is easy to receive a majority vote. That is \nwrong and let me try to show you how wrong it is. Since 1990, no budget \nresolution or conference report has received a three-fifths majority. \nSince 1990, no vote to raise the debt limit has received a three-fifths \nmajority.\n  In 1985, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law was adopted in the Senate by a \nvote of 51 to 37.\n  The 1990 budget reconciliation bill was passed with a budget vote of \n54 to 45.\n  The 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act was passed with a vote of \n51 to 50.\n  The 1995 budget reconciliation bill was adopted on a vote of 52 to \n47.\n  The 1995 temporary debt limit increase was adopted on a vote of 49 to \n47.\n  If that doesn't demonstrate that majority votes even are tough to \nget, I don't know what does.\n  Now, the issue here is, what happens if the debt limit isn't \nextended, and what happens if we permit 41 people to make that \ndetermination? Well, we just saw that. The Government shuts down. We \ndefault on our obligations. The full faith and credit is cast in doubt.\n  I think it is a huge mistake to put forward a balanced budget \namendment that would permit a minority in Congress to hold the \nGovernment hostage, shut it down, bring it to the brink of default, \nrisk the loss of our full faith and credit, and the respect that goes \nwith it. This gives 41 Senators and 179 House Members the power to hold \nthis Nation's credit hostage during budgetary disagreements. So I think \nit is a big, big mistake.\n  In closing, I am pleased to submit this amendment on behalf of \nSenators Torricelli, Durbin, and Cleland.\n  Essentially, this amendment keeps Social Security as part of the \nunified budget up to the point we reach balance. As I mentioned, \napproximately $570 billion will be taken from the trust funds and used \nto balance the budget by 2002. The amendment separates Social Security \nout at the point of balance and is able to retain $1.8 trillion of \nSocial Security trust funds outside of the unified budget for the \nfuture. This means Social Security will remain financially viable much \nlonger.\n  Social Security is critical for many recipients. Fourteen percent of \npeople on Social Security today are totally dependent on it. Social \nSecurity prevents abut 57 percent of beneficiaries from falling into \npoverty. It is important to protect it. It is the one Government \nprogram, beyond all others, that guarantees that people in their golden \nyears will have an opportunity for a decent quality of life.\n  Second, this amendment provides for a national economic emergency. I \nhave spoken about the savings and loan bailout, an unpredictable event, \nwhich cost the Treasury $135 billion, a $66 billion appropriation in \n1991, alone. Emergencies occur and will need congressional attention. \nThe majority amendment will undermine our ability to address emergency \nneeds.\n  Third, this amendment does not mandate a capital budget, but it would \nsay that the Constitution does not prohibit the development of a \ncapital budget if a majority of the Congress desires to develop and \nimplement one.\n  Fourth, this amendment would change the restrictions on extending the \ndebt limit from three-fifths to a majority vote. I am a member of the \nJudiciary Committee and attended the hearings and listened to the \ntestimony. I sincerely believe, that my amendment is a balanced budget \namendment that will stand the test of time and has an opportunity to be \nratified by three-fourths of the State. The Senate should adopt this \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor for the moment.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have a question on some of the things the \nSenator has been talking about on capital budgeting.\n  Could the Senator give me a little better definition of what she is \ntalking about with capital budgeting? Is the Senator talking about all \ncapital projects being off budget? Are we talking about that? What kind \nof limitations do we have on what can be a capital budget item?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to answer that question. I want to read my \namendment's specific language. The language does not talk about any \nspecific capital budget plan. All the language says is ``Nothing in \nthis article shall preclude the authority to enact and implement a \nseparate capital budget for those major capital improvements which \nrequire multi-year funding and which would be excluded from the \nrequirements of section 7.'' That is the requirement that outlays and \nexpenditures balance.\n  I will tell the Senator what I would develop a capital budget. I \nwould set a basic amount of capital. Whether that amount would be \nanything above $5 million, $10 million, $15 million, or $20 million \nwould be up to the Congress. But you set the basic amount for major \ncapital purchases, for bridges, office buildings, or a battleship, \nwhatever you want that to be. Also, because you float debt to be able \nto fund these items, you would also set a debt limit. That would most \nlikely be a percentage of our Gross Domestic Product. For example, 2 \npercent of GDP would provide about $160 billion, 3 percent would be \nmore, and so on.\n  As I mentioned, we have dramatically dropped our infrastructure \nspending. It was 6 percent of the budget in the 1960's. It is now down \nto 3 percent of the budget.\n  Mr. ENZI. So the amendment really says that there won't be any \nrestriction on doing capital budgeting, which is exactly where we are \nat the moment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No. I respectfully direct the Senator to the \namendment. It simply says, ``Enact and implement a separate capital \nbudget.''\n  With every constitutional amendment, as the Senator well knows, the \nCongress would enact enabling legislation. The Congress would sit down \nand develop a capital budget if one was desired. My amendment does not \nmandate one, but if they felt that a capital budget was worthy and \ndesirable and needed by this Nation, they would sit down and discuss \nthe legal parameters and develop the legislation.\n  All this does is permit it. That is all.\n  Mr. ENZI. I did read it. It says, ``Nothing in this article shall \npreclude authority.'' It doesn't give authority to do it. It just \neliminates the preclusion of doing it. It does not define what major \ncapital improvements are. All of the things that the Senator from \nCalifornia has in section 8 could be done in enabling legislation under \na balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No, I disagree. Under the majority amendment it could \nnot be done because, in the majority balanced budget amendment \nexpenditures must equal outlays in every year. Therefore, you could not \nprovide multi-year financing of major capital projects by floating \ndebt. You have to meet the expenditures. Every opinion we have had says \nthat the development of a capital budget would be prohibited.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Does this mean under this that if education is more than a \n$5 billion expenditure, that education would be a capital expenditure?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No. As I understand it, for example, title I would \nnot be a capital expenditure. The money that is given to poor children, \nwhich is I think the largest expenditure, would not be a capital \nexpenditure. Capital expenditure would be reserved for infrastructure.\n  Mr. ENZI. In the President's budget I notice that he listed social \ninvestment as a capital expenditure. That is why I was asking the \nquestion about education. I am concerned that the capital budget \nprocedure is just an attempt to be able to move everything outside of \nthe normal budgeting procedure so, in fact, we do not have to balance \nthe budget. That is why I want more definition on what is meant by \n``capital budget.''\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much. Perhaps\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\none way of answering this would be to place in the Record a letter sent \nto Senator Daschle by the Secretary of the Treasury on February 3. Let \nme simply read one sentence. Referring to the majority amendment, the \nSecretary writes:\n\n       The amendment as drafted does not distinguish between \n     capital investment and current spending. Outlays are defined \n     as ``all outlays in the United States except for those for \n     repayment of debt principal.'' Even if Congress were to \n     create a separate capital budget by statute, outlays from \n     that budget would still be ``outlays of the United States.'' \n     Under the majority amendment, a capital budget would be \n     prohibited.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 1997.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: You asked for our views on whether the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment (the Amendment), as currently \n     proposed, would allow Congress to establish a separate \n     capital budget unconstrained by the Amendment. We discussed \n     this with counsel and, in our view, the present language of \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment would not allow for statutorily \n     exempting capital expenditures from the Amendment's \n     requirement that ``total outlays for the year shall not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.'' Your inquiry \n     illustrates the inflexibility of the Amendment.\n       The Amendment as drafted does not distinguish between \n     capital investment and current spending. Outlays are defined \n     as ``all outlays of the United States except for those for \n     repayment of debt principal.'' Even if Congress were to \n     create a separate capital budget by statute, outlays from \n     that budget would still be ``outlays of the United States.'' \n     Indeed, a provision in such a statute that capital \n     expenditures were not ``outlays of the United States'' for \n     purposes of the Balanced Budget Amendment would be \n     unconstitutional because, under fundamental principles of \n     statutory construction, it would be at odds with the express \n     language and intent of the Amendment.\n       Proponents of the Balanced Budget Amendment cite the state \n     experience with balanced budget requirements as precedent for \n     a federal Constitution amendment. In relation to your \n     specific question regarding capital budgets, most state \n     requirements are not analogous because spending for capital \n     investments does not have to be offset. States with balanced \n     budget provisions generally have separate operating and \n     capital budgets. Many states require only the operating \n     budget to balance--a situation prohibited by the Amendment. \n     Although the remaining states with balanced budget provisions \n     also require the capital budget to balance, they include bond \n     financing for capital expenditures as a receipt. In other \n     words, in these states, capital funds may use borrowed funds \n     to balance--a solution expressly barred by the definition of \n     receipts in the present Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       Proponents of a capital budget argue that the absence of a \n     capital budget has reduced investments in infrastructure and \n     other capital improvements that would add to future growth. I \n     do not believe we should move to a capital budget, but under \n     different circumstances in the future, others might want to \n     do so. The Balanced Budget Amendment before you now would \n     prevent us from moving to a separate capital budget, even if \n     we wanted to.\n       I hope this answers your question. We would be happy to \n     respond to any further inquiries you may have.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, does the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia create kind of a loophole, though, by not defining what \n``capital expenditure'' is even in the slightest way?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It does permit a separate capital budget for major \ncapital improvements. I believe it would be foolish to put strictures \nin the Constitution of the United States. It seems to me that the \nConstitution of the United States should provide general concepts, and \nthe specifics of those concepts should be worked out by the Congress of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. ENZI. So the Senator is suggesting, then, that there would have \nto be a much greater detail on the enabling legislation?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely, as there is with every amendment to the \nConstitution. Implementing legislation carries with it court tests and \nstandards regarding how the legislation is to be carried out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, may I ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois how much time he would require? Ten minutes?\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 31 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to have the Senator use as much time as he \nwishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nyielding time.\n  I rise in support of the Feinstein substitute. I think that we ought \nto reflect for a moment what we are about. This is not the passage of a \ncongratulatory resolution, nor is it enactment of a law which can be \nreconsidered at a later date. We are talking about amending the \nConstitution of the United States. In the last 205 years of our history \nwe have done that 17 times. We should pause and reflect, and I think \nreflect on what the Senator from California has noted as the obvious \nflaws and weaknesses in the balanced budget amendment that is being \nbrought to us today.\n  Last night, many Members of the Senate were given the opportunity to \nvisit the National Archives. I have to tell you quite honestly that in \nall the years I have lived in Washington I have not done that. I did \nlast night, and saw the original of our Constitution. Just stopping for \na moment, pausing, and looking at this great document in its original \nform humbles anyone who would call himself a modern day legislator. If \nwe are to change the words of that great document, let us take care to \ndo it rationally, calmly, and in a way that can be defended for decades \nto come.\n  I am concerned that this whole debate over the balanced budget \namendment has taken on a different style, a different life of its own, \na different velocity than most political issues.\n  We have over the last 10 or 15 years in Washington come to believe \nthat this balanced budget amendment is the answer to America's prayers. \nThose who support it would suggest if we could just pass the balanced \nbudget amendment, then things will be better--our debt lessened; \ninterest rates will come down; the economy will forge forward helping \neveryone: businesses, working families alike.\n  I do not doubt that some of those suggestions are true, but I think \nwe should pause for a moment and really reflect on whether or not we \nare exaggerating the impact of this amendment, whether we are \noverstating the case. We in America have done that many times in our \nhistory. We have found what we considered to be those silver bullets, \nthose big fixes that this Congress, many of its supporters, came \nforward with and said this is what we will do to change America and its \nfuture.\n  For a moment, as we reflect about the historical impact of this \ndebate, let us consider some of the big fixes in American history. \nConsider, for example, the battle for free silver. The free silver \nmovement in the late 19th century called for unlimited free coinage of \nsilver at a time when unstable economic factors were causing \ndevastating economic depressions. Proponents of free silver, including \nthe People's or Populist Party, agrarian interests, and silver miners, \nthought that free coinage of silver would increase the money supply, \ndrive up the prices of agricultural products and help struggling \nfarmers and working families.\n  In the famous speech of William Jennings Bryan, of Illinois, ``Thou \nshalt not crucify mankind on a cross of gold'' was his basic plea for \nfree silver. He believed, as did many in his time, if we just had free \nsilver, that would be what America's economy needed to prosper.\n  We hear echoes of William Jennings Bryan in the Chamber in this \ndebate: if we just have a balanced budget amendment, then our Nation's \nproblems will be solved. But some of us reflect on the fact that \nwithout a balanced budget constitutional amendment we are making real \nprogress. We are, in fact, moving toward a balanced budget. We have \nseen more deficit reduction in the last 4 years than any time in this \ncentury. Our economy is moving forward, creating millions of jobs and \nopportunities for family farmers, for small businesses, for working \nfamilies. And so as to the big fix of the balanced budget\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\namendment, one has to question whether or not it is truly necessary to \nput this in our Constitution.\n  Of course, after the free silver movement came another solution, the \ngold standard. This was an idea that had been kicking around for a long \ntime. Unfortunately, it was too simplistic. Changes in the supply of \ngold were tied to mining discoveries rather than economic progress and \ncaused shifts in commodity prices unrelated to the economy. The Gold \nStandard Act of 1900 reaffirmed the gold standard of the time, but by \nlimiting the amount of base money in the economy the gold standard \nfailed to allow the contraction and expansion of America's money \nsupply. As the efforts to maintain the gold standard helped deepen the \nDepression, our Nation was forced to shift away from that gold \nstandard. By 1971, dollars could no longer be exchanged for gold at an \nofficial rate. In 1976, the statutory link between the dollar and gold \nwas officially severed.\n  I can tell you, after 14 years of service in the House, there were \nmany of my colleagues during that period of time who still believed \npassionately in the gold standard. They felt that if we returned to a \ngold standard, America's economy would spring forward--echoes again of \ndebate we hear on the balanced budget amendment: if we can just pass \nthis amendment, this will certainly solve America's economic problems.\n  We went through an era of protective tariffs in America's history, \ntoo. This was another big fix. There were people who pushed for these \ntariffs, saying they would generate revenue for the Federal Government \nat the same time as protecting American manufacture and American \nagricultural production. The worst of these, the Smoot-Hawley tariff of \n1930, which occurred right after the Depression started, is credited, \nif you can use the term, with driving the American economy even deeper \ninto a depression.\n\n  In the early part of our Nation's history, the second half of the \n19th century, the national banking issue was always on the forefront. \nIt was one that was debated long and hard in this Chamber and by many \nothers in terms of whether or not it would be the answer to America's \nproblems. It was unable to fully address the problems of our Nation. \nCooler heads prevailed. The idea of a national bank was amended.\n  The point of these stories is to show you that in a quick survey of \nour Nation's history the silver bullets do not always hit their \nintended targets. Big fixes, like this balanced budget amendment, do \nnot always have the intended effects.\n  There is a critical difference between the suggestions of those in \nthe past and what we are dealing with today. These were legislative \nproposals. If there was a mistake made on free silver or a national \nbank or the gold standard or a protective tariff, the next Congress \ncould address it, change the law. But in this case, we are enshrining \nin our Constitution words that we believe will be the big fix. But what \nif we are wrong?\n  And the Senator from California raises questions about the inherent \nwisdom of the balanced budget amendment before us: Do we really want to \nput in our Constitution for all times language that threatens the \nfuture of the Social Security trust fund?\n  I think it has been clearly demonstrated with reports from the \nCongressional Research Service, with the statement of the Senator from \nCalifornia this morning, that we put our Social Security trust fund at \nrisk with the balanced budget amendment that is before us.\n  We also know that this balanced budget amendment does not give \nCongress or the Federal Government the flexibility to respond to a \nnational economic emergency or a natural disaster.\n  Over 1,000 economists have come forward in a rare show of unanimity \nand said this balanced budget amendment is bad economic policy for \nAmerica. And yet when I offered an amendment to give more flexibility \nto respond to an emergency, it was rejected. I hope the Senator from \nCalifornia has better luck today. But her substitute will take care of \nthat problem.\n  There is also a concern about gridlock. What the Senator from \nCalifornia is proposing is that an extension of the debt limit be \napproved by a majority vote and not three-fifths. Those of us who have \neven a short memory can recall that within the last 24 months we had \nthe two longest shutdowns in Federal Government history because of the \nfailure of Congress to rally a majority to extend the debt limit. This \nconstitutional amendment will up the ante, will increase the \nresponsibility, raise the bar--a three-fifths vote. I think the Senator \nfrom California is right in saying that when it comes to extending the \ndebt limit, it should be done by majority vote.\n  I also applaud her comments on a capital budget. I would ask my \ncolleagues to reflect on the fact that every business and virtually \nevery State government has a capital and operating budget. At my town \nmeetings people would come in and say: ``Congressman, you just don't \nget it. I balance my checkbook every month. Why can't you balance the \nbooks out in Washington?'' A good point.\n  But I always ask them a question: ``Do you have a mortgage on your \nhome?''\n  ``Oh, sure.''\n  ``Do you pay it off at the end of every month?''\n  ``Oh, no. It's a 25- or 30-year mortgage.''\n  ``What's the difference?''\n  ``Well, this is a home that we are going to have for a long time. \nThis is an investment, Congressman. This isn't the annual operating \ncosts of our family. This is the annual investment of our family.''\n  Families understand that. Americans understand that. The question is \nwhether Members of the Senate understand it because this balanced \nbudget amendment makes no distinction between capital investments for \nthe future of our Nation and the operating expenses.\n  And if we should decide, as part of the telecommunications revolution \nor for some other reason, to make a massive American investment in our \nfuture, in economic progress, this balanced budget amendment will tie \nour hands. It treats the interstate highway system the same way it \ntreats the purchase of paper clips. That is wrong.\n  The Senator from California addresses that and gives to Congress, \neven with the balanced budget amendment, the authority to establish a \ncapital budget.\n  Congress can and should balance the budget. I do not believe we need \na constitutional amendment to do it. But if we are going to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment, we must do it right. That is why I support \nthe Feinstein substitute.\n  I cannot support a balanced budget amendment that jeopardizes Social \nSecurity, prohibits prudent capital planning, risks even deeper \nrecessions and unemployment, and invites gridlock and danger of default \non Capitol Hill. The Feinstein substitute protects Social Security; it \nallows a capital budget; it allows a way to provide for economic \nrecessions and avoid the threat of gridlock and default.\n  The choice is clear. The Feinstein substitute is clearly the better \nchoice, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Let me say in closing, those who are resisting any amendment to this \nunderlying resolution, to the balanced budget amendment, I think are \nunfortunately taking the wrong approach. There are possibilities that \nthose who support this amendment are just wrong. And if they are wrong, \nthere is a lot at stake.\n  Would it not be better if we could come together with a bipartisan \nconsensus to address the serious flaws in this bill? Would it not be \nbetter if there were a little humility on the floor of the Senate and \nthe House, and an understanding that perhaps these words, although \npolitically right, may not be right for America's future? Would it not \nbe better if the Members of the House and Senate could take a little \nwalk down through the National Archives, take a look at that \nConstitution, and realize the gravity of the decision we are about to \nmake?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate all the words that have been \nsaid here this morning, particularly those that call for us to do a \nbipartisan consensus.\n  I am a big believer in the U.S. Constitution. I carry my own copy of \nthe U.S. Constitution. In article V it tells us how to amend this \nConstitution, and it says that it is going to have to be a bipartisan \neffort if it is going to take two-thirds when the majority party\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\nhas 55. This is going to be a bipartisan effort, but it has to be an \neffort that winds up with a constitutional amendment that will do what \nthe American public is demanding. They are demanding that we come up \nwith a balanced budget.\n  I get to stand next to these unbalanced budgets, the last 28 years of \nwork in this body, and I know that, individually, the people in this \nbody have said we have to balance the budget. And I am willing to do \nit. It is collectively that we have had a little trouble getting it \ndone. It is in that bipartisan manner that we have had trouble getting \nit done. It is in that situation when we are having to tell the people \nback home ``no'' for any particular issue. Somebody told me it takes \npolitical will to balance a budget. I really contend it takes political \n``won't'' to balance a budget.\n  We are talking today about an amendment that will deal with capital \nbudgeting. As the only accountant in the Senate, I am fascinated by \nsome of the definitions of capital budgeting that I am hearing here and \nreading about in the paper, that the President has said. It looks to me \nlike the Federal idea of capital budgeting is not only a risky gimmick, \nit is also a loophole so big that you could drive an interstate through \nit, or an aircraft carrier, or planes and buses, or buildings. Anything \ncan be driven through the loophole that will be created by this nice \nterm ``capital budgeting.''\n  I, too, have run into the people at home who say, ``Wait a minute, I \nhave a mortgage on my house. How is that different from the United \nStates?'' And I say, ``Are you paying off the mortgage, or are you just \npaying the interest? And can you buy two or three or five houses and \nonly pay the interest?'' That is what we are trying to do with capital \nbudgeting with the Federal Government. We are saying we don't have to \npay the principal back; interest is the only thing that is important.\n  You and I know if you borrow enough, pretty quick the interest equals \nall of your revenue. We are a little ways away from that yet in the \nUnited States, but it is a distinct possibility. We are talking about a \npossibility of telling our kids or our grandkids, ``You have to pay 84 \npercent of your wages in taxes and you will get nothing for it because \nyou are going to be paying the interest on the houses that we bought \nand used up.''\n  At that point, we are going to have a revolution in this country. It \nis not going to be the same kind of gentle change we are used to. It is \nnot going to be subject to the same slow processes. We are going to \nhave a generation that is going to say, ``I am paying Social Security \nto people I don't even know, and I am never going to get any.'' And \nthey are going to take Social Security away. If we do not begin \nbalancing budgets, there will not be Social Security.\n  I don't think there is a single person in this entire body who does \nnot want to protect Social Security. But how long are we going to wait \nbefore we protect Social Security?\n  We keep talking about capital budgeting. I have said any kind of \nbudgeting would be really great. What we are really talking about is \ncash-flow budgeting, I think, rather than capital budgeting, unless we \nare talking about that tremendous loophole, the one that says we can \ndesignate anything we want as capital and we can shift it off budget--I \nhate those words; it is not a good accounting term--but we no longer \nhave to be responsible for anything that we can call capital budgeting, \nwhich is a very good accounting term.\n  The President's commission on setting up a capital budget will not be \nnearly as restrictive as was the question that I asked earlier. That \ncommission will report on including physical capital and intangible or \nhuman capital. That is the social capital I was talking about, the \nsocial investment I was talking about before. This loophole would \nvirtually allow anything to be deemed as a capital investment.\n  I would like to go into a little bit of what happens in some of the \nother entities that we do allow the right to do capital budgeting, and \nreally what we are talking about is loans for capital. The Federal \nGovernment has such an extensive budget that we have not been forced to \ndo any capital budgeting, nor in the foreseeable future would we have \nto do capital budgeting. We should do cash-flow budgeting so we can \nbuild all these capital items we are talking about in a logical \nprogression and within budget, and pay back some of the debt that we \nalready owe so there is less interest, so we have more money to spend.\n  Probably one of the toughest levels of capital budgeting or loans \nthat we allow to be made is at the local level. I used to be the mayor \nof a boom town out West that more than doubled in size. We had to have \nsewer treatment. Yes, there was a Federal program for sewer treatment, \nbut our community had already applied for one of those grants and \ngotten one and built a sewer treatment plant. Then we had all of these \npeople move in and we exceeded the capacity and were fined for \nexceeding the capacity of this lifetime plant. So we had to build \nanother sewer treatment plant, and we were last on the list for getting \nanother grant in that area.\n  We had to build streets. You cannot have houses without streets that \nlet you get to the houses. We had to increase our garbage collection. \nWe also had our own electrical service. The first day I was in office, \nI got a call from one of the electrical suppliers who wanted to know \nwhat I was going to do when my substation blew up. I had to ask him \nwhat a substation was. That is a great big transformer for a town. He \ntold me it was operating at 1.2 capacity, and any warm day it would \njust be eliminated and my town would be out electricity for maybe 2 \nweeks while we got a portable substation. I pictured myself for quite \nawhile being tarred and feathered and ridden out of town, as people's \ndeep freezes thawed or they couldn't read at night or iron or any of \nthe things that we really rely on electricity for but never think about \nit.\n  And water, that was really the biggest problem. That has to be one of \nthe most basic things any of us is involved in, is water. We did not \nhave enough water before the boom. We went on water rationing in May \nand we got off in October, and our water was color-coded. The cold \nwater came out kind of red because there was iron in the water and it \ntook on that color when it mixed with oxygen, and the hot water came \nout black because we have a lot of coal in the area I am from and the \ncoal would settle out in the hot water tank and then come out when we \nused hot water. You have to have water. You can do, maybe, without \nelectricity. You cannot do without water.\n  It was not an option to do without either of them, so we had to issue \nbonds. We had to borrow on a long-term basis. Our water project alone \nwas 43 miles and $23 million away. Out here, that is not a microdot in \nthe budget. It does not mean anything out here. But that was $3,000 in \ndebt for every man, woman, and child living in that town at the time.\n  They don't just let municipalities print their own money. There is a \nprocess that you have to go through that has a lot of review, because \nyou have to prove to the people who might buy the bonds that those \nbonds will be paid off.\n  I want to make a distinction again on that ``paid off,'' something we \ndon't even consider around here. In all of the discussion that I have \nheard on the balanced budget constitutional amendment, in all of the \ndiscussion that I have heard on balancing the budget, I have not heard \nanybody say, ``Where's the number here that pays down the national \ndebt?''\n  That is what we do with bonding. That is what we do with States when \nthey bond. We have an elaborate process to do everything we can to make \nsure that those bonds will be valid, which means they will be paid off \nin a reasonable amount of time.\n  So what did I have to go through to get that $23 million? One of the \nthings I had to do was go before Standard & Poor's and Moody's in New \nYork and explain how a town of 8,000 people was going to pay off $24 \nmillion in debt. I know that is real small stuff compared to cities in \nCalifornia, but for a guy from rural Wyoming, that was a lot of money.\n  It also happened to be at the very same time that New York City was \ngoing broke, and Standard & Poor's was having daily meetings with the \ncity to see how they were going to pay off the debt that they already \nhad. I didn't mention forgiving the debt. I know there was some talk \nabout that.\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\n But what Standard & Poor's and Moody's was interested in was how it \nwas going to be paid off. They didn't care whether it was Federal \ngrants or how.\n  So they had a lot of extra special questions for us on how to do \nthat, and as a result of the discussions, there were also criteria that \nwere placed on the bond issues. This is normal stuff that happens with \nbond issues. There are covenants. That means that you have to dedicate \nsources of revenue. I have not heard us talk about any really special \ndedication of revenues to paying off any of this capital budgeting. I \nwill tell you, they come in and they take that revenue before you get \nto do anything else with it if you default on the bonds. If you even \nmiss a payment, they come in and demand the money, much the same as if \nyou own a home.\n  Then they also put a restriction on, they call it coverage, and \ncoverage is an additional amount beyond the normal payment that goes \ninto a special fund to make sure that you will not default on the \nbonds. In the case of our bonds, it was 1.25 percent. That means we had \nto pay into another fund 25 percent more than our payment to assure \nthat we would make future payments. Again, that is something we don't \ntalk about with capital budgeting for the United States. We just talk \nabout spending the money and how we can build loopholes to do more \nspending outside of the normal budgeting process.\n  We also had a requirement of a front-end sinking fund. That means \nbefore we could even start the project, we had to put money in a fund \nto show that we could make the first part of the payments.\n  And then, and here is a real divergence from what we do back here, we \nhad to have a vote of the people to go into debt--a vote of the people. \nWhat would happen with our budgets, these 28 years of no balanced \nbudgets? Would the people let us do that if they had to vote on what we \nwere spending? I know from the State-level discussions on this that \nthat would be an incredible burden and extreme expense, and we can't go \nto that extent. No, we can't go to that extent, and we were elected to \nmake those kinds of decisions. But we were elected to make them within \ncertain constraints. The people back home tell me that they expect that \nconstraint to be paying things off. They expect us not only to balance \nthe budget, but to get to a situation, to plan for a situation where we \npay down the national debt. That is good budgeting; that is good \naccounting.\n  There was a happy side to this story. We did do capital budgeting. We \ndid cash flow budgeting. We built the things that I talked about, and I \nwant to tell you that today, not because of my efforts, but because of \nthe people who followed me, who followed the cash flow budgeting, that \nthose projects are not only in place, but they are paid for. Gillette, \nWY, is one of the few places in the United States that is debt free. \nThat is how you run a city. That is how you should run a State, and \nmost States do. Most States are required to, because they have a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment that forces them to live \nwithin their means. And that is how the United States ought to work.\n  Capital budgeting could be a great idea, but not if the purpose of \ncapital budgeting is to build loopholes so that we can spend whatever \nwe want to by merely designating it as capital budget.\n  We also ought to have performance budgets. There are a whole bunch of \nthings that the private sector is doing that would be very adaptable to \nthe Federal Government, and some States have already done them and some \nStates have found them to be very successful.\n  How do you balance a budget? You do it by strategic planning. You \nhave every single person in the Government, down to the very smallest \nagency, talk about what their mission is, who their customer is, what \nthey are trying to achieve, and how they will get it done. You get them \nto focus on the real problem of what they are trying to achieve and how \nthey can most efficiently do it. Focus saves money.\n  In Wyoming, we talked a long time about strategic planning for the \nState. We have a thing we call management audits. I am not familiar \nenough to know if we do that here, but we had a special committee that \nlooked at State agencies. And the purpose of that look was to see if \nState agencies were doing what the State legislature and the Governor \nsaid they were supposed to be doing, if they were following the \nstatutes. I am pleased to say, in most instances, they were doing \nexactly what we had told them. However, it was in pretty broad terms.\n  It wasn't good enough to be a mission statement. It wasn't good \nenough to give them the finite direction they needed to have the best \nperformance possible. So we instituted strategic planning. We forced \nall of the agencies to come up with a strategic plan, and most of them \ndid. The ones that were most reluctant today are the biggest supporters \nof strategic planning. Once they tried it, they couldn't believe how it \nworked.\n  The way that it works is the agencies for the budget process, \nactually the individuals in the agencies actually wind up saying, \n``These are the things that we shouldn't be doing in our agency.'' I \ncan tell you that the general public said, ``Wow, I didn't even know \nthey were doing that stuff.''\n  If we had decisions to make here that were based on the employees of \nthe Federal Government saying these are things we shouldn't be doing \nand the American public telling us, ``Why were you doing those \nthings,'' we would cut them and nobody would complain.\n  That is not how it works, though, in Government. If you allow it to \nhappen, what gets cut in Government are the things that are the most \nvisible. Call it the ``athletic team syndrome.'' If you want to really \nmake an impact, you threaten to cut the athletic team in a small \nschool, and that will get a furor bigger than anything you ever \nimagined, and it will be reinstituted. Not only will it be \nreinstituted, but I have this principle of government that if it is \nworth reacting to, it is worth overreacting to. So you not only \nreinstitute into the budget what happened, you put a little bit more \nmoney into that.\n  We had that example in Yellowstone Park where they were $80,000 short \non a $19 million budget, and they asked for extra money and threatened \nto close down our park early. Now, that is a major economic, as well as \nrecreation, benefit to the entire United States, and particularly to \nthose of us in Montana and Wyoming.\n  If we had a manager who was short a few dollars who said they needed \nmore money or had to close down early, we would probably fire the \nmanager. We need strategic planning so that we can make the decisions \nand be sure that the things that should not be done are not being done.\n\n  We talk about capital budgeting. We have to be sure that capital \nbudgeting is not just building another loophole into the system, that \nit is good accounting. We need to have good accounting. We need to have \ngood accounting to protect Social Security.\n  Social Security right now is being called a trust fund. But it is not \nthe fund with money stuck out there being invested on behalf of the \nperson who paid it in so that when they retire there will be a \nguarantee of that money being there. It is money that is flowing \nthrough the system. It is money that is being paid out as it comes in \nwith some small amounts being left over. Now, $80 billion this year \nsounds like a lot of money to me. And it is a lot of money. But it is a \ntittle in the budget for what needs to be put in if we are going to \nhave an actuarially sound Social Security System.\n  Not only should we be capital budgeting, not only should we be paying \noff the national debt, we should be making our trust funds into true \ntrust funds. That is good Government. That is what I am interested in. \nIf we are going to save Social Security, we are going to have to do \nadequate budgeting to build it up to some point in time where it is \nactuarially sound.\n  Mr. President, the Feinstein amendment creates a loophole to the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. As I mentioned when I started \nthis speech, you can drive an interstate through it. The Feinstein \namendment actually harms the balanced budget amendment because it \nultimately will increase debt. It is a license to increase debt.\n  Congress has been borrowing dollars to no end in order to deficit \nspend. And that is the problem. The Feinstein\n\n[[Page S1601]]\n\namendment does not tell us how we will pay back the bonds for capital \nspending. It puts no limitation on the bonds for Federal spending. It \nhas no oversight for the bonds for capital spending. It is more and \nmore debt. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I ask, how much of my time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 18 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, let me try and sum up what I have presented here, and \nthen speak specifically in answer to some of the concerns of the \nopposition.\n  Essentially, the amendment that I have on the floor differs from the \nmajority amendment in four ways.\n  The first and most important way this amendment differs is that it \ncontinues to use Social Security trust funds as part of the unified \nbudget up to the point where we reach balance. According to Social \nSecurity Administration data, that represents about $570 billion, \ncumulatively, of Social Security trust funds that would be used to \noffset other spending by 2002. For 1996, we used about $77 billion of \nthe surplus.\n  Once Congress balances the budget, we would remove Social Security \ntrust funds from the unified budget. That would essentially save for \nSocial Security recipients a cumulative total of about $1.8 trillion \nand, therefore, maintain the integrity of the Social Security system.\n  Additionally, unlike the majority amendment, it would not enshrine in \nthe Constitution that Social Security is part of the unified budget \nforever, which, reneges on a major commitment to senior citizens in our \ncountry.\n  As I pointed out earlier, Social Security is not funded from the \nincome tax. Its revenue is not supposed to go into general operations \nof the Government. Social Security is funded from a specific FICA \npayroll tax. A worker pays 6.2 percent, matched by the employer who \npays 6.2 percent. The 12.4 percent is supposed to go into a separate \ntrust fund held for the retirement of workers. Social Security taxes \nhave one purpose and one purpose only. That purpose is to provide a \nsafety net for our Nation's seniors with supplemental income when they \nretire.\n  Social Security deserves its unique treatment. Social Security is our \nlargest single Federal program. It has more than 43 million \nbeneficiaries, with 1996 spending of $350 billion. Additionally, Social \nSecurity plays a critical role in reducing poverty among seniors. \nWithout Social Security, the poverty rate of the elderly would be 53 \npercent rather than the current 14 percent. For 38 percent of all \nretirees, Social Security is the difference between poverty and no \npoverty. If those statistics do not speak eloquently for the need to \nkeep Social Security intact, I do not know what does.\n  So this amendment, with regard to the point of Social Security, is a \ncompromise. We meet the majority's concern that if we take Social \nSecurity trust funds out of the unified budget right now, it is too \ndifficult to balance the budget. My amendment would continue to use the \ntrust funds up to the point of balance and then separate them out after \nthat. The practice of using Social Security trust funds to offset other \nspending is not enshrined in the Constitution forever and ever as a way \nof doing business.\n  Second, we provide in this amendment for a serious economic emergency \nand for major natural disasters. I can tell this body that the \nprobability of a major earthquake in Southern California, according to \nseismic experts, has gone up. If that should happen--I should say when \nthat happens--the State's disaster needs are going to be tremendous. \nPassing the majority's balanced budget amendment tells California that \nthe Federal Government will have no way of meeting these disaster \nneeds. This is a critical difference.\n  Let me speak about other economic emergencies. Earlier, I mentioned \nthe savings and loan bailout. I was not here for the savings and loan \nbailout. I do not know how many Members of this body or the other body \nactually predicted it, but I never would have thought it would have \nhappened. The total costs were $135 billion of taxpayer's moneys to \nmaintain the full faith and credit of the Federal Government's \nguarantee to depositors. In 1 year alone, 1991, the cost to the \nTreasury was $66 billion.\n  I would really be concerned about providing for an economic \nemergency. Last month, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report, \nciting the sensitivity of the budget deficit to the economy. They \nindicated this:\n\n       If economic growth was one-half percent lower, it would \n     increase the deficit by $50 billion in FY 2002. And these \n     effects would continue to grow over time.\n\n  So you see, this kind of even economic change impacts the deficit \ntremendously.\n  If the economy fell into recession and growth were five-tenths of a \npercent below its forecast, a budget thought to be in balance, would \ndevelop a $50 billion deficit or higher. Under Senate Joint Resolution \n1, the budget deficit would need to be eliminated in that fiscal year.\n  As you can see, even a drop of five-tenths of a percent in the \neconomy would create an additional $50 billion shortfall in the \nestimates of that fiscal year which Congress would have to eliminate. \nTo close a $50 billion budget deficit, Congress would have to eliminate \nthe equivalent of nearly the entire defense procurement budget in that \nyear.\n  Let me give you another example as to why providing for economic \nemergencies would be necessary.\n  Economists estimate that a ticket shock triggered by higher oil \nprices similar to those of 1973 and 1974 and 1979 and 1980 could \ntrigger a 1- to 2-percent drop in our economy. That would necessitate \nbudget cuts of $100 to $150 billion that year. It would be devastating \nto an economy. I do not know if anyone here remembers what it was like \nwhen those prices of oil rose. Economists state it was the major reason \nfor the economic downturn. No one can guarantee, that such a situation \nwould not happen in the future.\n  So the majority's balanced budget amendment does not address economic \nrisks that face the Nation. I think that is a major weakness in the \namendment. Our amendment would suspend the amendment in the event of a \nserious economic emergency or major natural disaster. This would have \nto be enacted by a constitutional majority of both bodies.\n  We also permit a capital budget. My thinking is that when Social \nSecurity is withdrawn from the unified budget, we will need to be able \nto review our budget structure and proceed in a way that does not have \na dramatic impact. One way is through the enactment of a capital \nbudget.\n  Now, the Constitution is not a document that should carry enabling \nlegislation. The Constitution should be worded in general words subject \nto interpretation and also subject to enabling action by the Congress.\n  Our amendment reads: ``Nothing in this article shall preclude,'' \nwhich means prevent, ``the authority to enact and implement''--that \nwould have to be done by congressional enactment and implementation--\n``a separate capital budget.''\n  The amendment defines a capital budget: ``Those major capital \nimprovements.'' Congress would have to determine what is a major \ncapital improvement, which would require multiyear Federal funding. \nThose would be excluded from the provisions of this constitutional \namendment that requires the strict expenditures must meet outlays.\n  This means that for, say, Federal office buildings that would maybe \nrun $40, $50, $80, $100 million or more, or a major transportation \nsystems which could run $200 or $300 million, a multi-year financing \nprogram could be established. The interest on those programs would be \npaid out of operating capital, and the amount of interest would \nprobably be limited every year.\n  The amount of debt would be strictly limited. Perhaps the Congress \nwould limit debt by using a percent of gross domestic product, of GDP. \nAs I said, 2 percent would be about $160 billion. If you had 3 percent, \nit would be more, and still more at 4 or 5 percent. An effective limit \nwould probably be somewhere between the 2 percent and, say, 6 percent, \n7 percent, or 8 percent of GDP.\n  Now, is this necessary to do? Even without a balanced budget \namendment, spending for infrastructure since the\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\n1960's has dramatically dropped. It was 6 percent in the 1960's. It is \n3 percent today, 3 percent of the budget.\n  We have 250,000 miles of Federal highways that are in disrepair. We \nhave more than 100,000 bridges in disrepair, unable to be repaired in \nthe present day situation. I think at some point the Congress may wish \nto look at a capital budget. All this amendment does is enable that \nreview to take place.\n\n  We mentioned what it means to be controlled by a minority. The fourth \narea where this amendment differs from the majority is with respect to \nthe debt limit. I have tried to show this body how difficult it is to \neven raise a majority vote.\n  Since 1990, no budget resolution or conference report has received a \nthree-fifths vote of this body.\n  Since 1990, no vote to raise the debt limit has received a three-\nfifths majority.\n  The 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, was passed by 51 to 37.\n  The 1990 budget reconciliation bill was passed by 54 to 45.\n  The 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act was passed by a vote of 51 \nto 50, just one vote.\n  The 1995 budget reconciliation was passed by 52 to 47.\n  The 1995 temporary debt limit increase was passed by 49 to 47. \nConsequently, last year, we reached our apex of minority rule when the \nGovernment was shut down not once, but twice while trying \nunsuccessfully to prove a point.\n  Allowing a minority to block an effort to extend the debt limit \nessentially jeopardizes the full faith and credit of this country, \nsomething that those of us who have held executive office know is the \ntrue measure of the financial acumen of your city or your State. If you \nget a bad bond rating by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the full faith \nand credit of the bonds you float is dramatically affected.\n  But a minority in pique, pouting, desirous of showing their enormous \nclout, can effectively jeopardize the full faith and credit of this \nGovernment and put this Government into default. I must tell you, I \nthink that is absolutely dreadful as a matter of public policy.\n  Those are the four issues in this amendment.\n  Social Security: Congress can use it up to 2002 to reach balance, but \nafterward, we must separate it out. This step will preserve $1.8 \ntrillion in the trust funds for retirees.\n  Economic emergency: Congress should treat spending for serious \neconomic emergency or major national disasters just like it treats \nmilitary emergencies.\n  Capital budget: Congress should at least enable it, rather than \nprohibit it, which the majority amendment does.\n  Debt limit: Please, have some sense and address it with a majority \nvote.\n  These four issues are the only way this amendment differs from the \nmajority amendment.\n  Perhaps the majority has their votes. Perhaps they know they have 67 \nvotes. If they do not, I respectfully submit to them, maybe this is \nworth looking at and reviewing.\n  Maybe it solves a major problem.\n  Maybe it provides some kind of constitutional flexibility to meet \nwhat might develop in the future. We could face another savings and \nloan crisis, or another shock from oil prices. We could face a major \nearthquake in southern California, the probability of which has been \nincreased, or a major flood in the Mississippi River basin, a major \nearthquake rift zone in the center part of our country.\n  We could face a range of emergencies and people will need Federal \nhelp. That is what we are here to do. We are here to protect the \nwelfare and well-being of our citizens, and not the least among them \nare seniors. For many seniors, Social Security is the difference \nbetween a life of poverty and a life of being able to eat and pay the \nrent.\n  I think this is a worthy amendment. I have given it a lot of thought.\n  My distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee is present on \nthe floor. I have listened to the hearings, heard the testimony of \nSecretary Rubin and really thought about whether your amendment could \nbe improved. I decided that it could, but for some reason the balanced \nbudget amendment is frozen in stone. I do not know who drafted the \nmajority amendment. It was drafted, I assume, by the majority, but it \nhas become the be-all and end-all: ``If you do not support us, you \ncannot be for a balanced budget amendment.'' I cannot accept that.\n  I represent a big and deeply troubled State. I hazard a guess that \nthe State of California will never ratify this balanced budget \namendment. I cannot speak for any other State, but I think I can for \nCalifornia. And they will not do it because they know about serious \neconomic emergencies. They know about a capital budget. We have 40 \nmillion people currently on Social Security, and it's going up every \nday. The people want this protected.\n\n  So this is a compromise with Social Security, economic emergency, \ncapital budget permitted, debt limit by a majority. I would hazard a \nguess that if this became the amendment of the majority, not only would \nit pass both bodies, it would be ratified by three-quarters of the \nStates.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 29 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from California has 17 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I will try to save some time for the distinguished \nSenator from California so she can make her wrap-up remarks out of our \ntime.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I think that was my wrap-up.\n  Mr. HATCH. If you desire to say anything else, I will certainly \nextend that courtesy to you.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment was written by both \nsides of the floor. This amendment has been developed over a period of \nalmost 40 years. It has taken both Republicans and Democrats to do it. \nIt is a bipartisan amendment. Even though some in this body might try \nto see some flaw in it, it is the only balanced budget amendment that \nhas a chance of passage. It is well thought through, it makes sense, \nand it's the only one that can end having unbalanced budgets year after \nyear, like this stack represents the last 28 years of our budgetary \nlife in this country. I might add that for 58 of the last 66 years we \nhave had similar unbalanced budgets. These stacks are obscene; we know \nthat. I think it tells the story better than anything else I can do. \nThese folks just want to continue the status quo.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator from California is very sincere, and I \nadmire her for it. She is on our committee. I care for her and I care \nfor her ideas. But in all honesty, I have to rise in opposition to the \nsubstitute offered by my colleague from California. With the various \nescape clauses she has built into her amendment, it would be too easily \ngamed, and I believe it would be ineffective in stopping Washington's \ndebt addiction. As we have debated the balanced budget amendment here \non the Senate floor for the past several weeks, we have seen amendment \nafter amendment that seeks to gut the substance of the proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  What we have here is yet another attempt to make the balanced budget \namendment ineffectual by carving out ways to deficit spend. How does \nthis amendment of the distinguished Senator from California, as sincere \nas she is, make it easier to deficit spend? ``Let me count the ways,'' \nto paraphrase Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\n  No. 1, it scales back the number of votes necessary to raise the debt \nlimit. We know how easy it is to raise the debt limit around here, when \nthat is the only methodology you have. So it scales that back from a \nthree-fifths vote to a constitutional majority.\n  No. 2, it provides a waiver for undefined economic emergencies. These \npeople are really clever in the Congress. They can define anything as \nan economic emergency. All they have to do is pass a statute saying it \nis an economic emergency.\n  No. 3, it provides yet another waiver for undefined natural \ndisasters.\n  No. 4, it exempts Social Security from the balanced budget \ncalculation beginning in the year 2003.\n  No. 5, it carves out a separate exemption for items designated as \ncapital investment.\n  Can you imagine what these intelligent, ingenious, and, in some ways, \ndevious people in the Congress who have done this to us over the last \n28 years could do with capital investments?\n  Now, Mr. President, I wonder what is left. The reason we are here on \nthe\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\nfloor debating a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is not \nto make it easier to deficit spend. We are here to constrain that sort \nof runaway spending that has produced unbalanced budgets in every one \nof the last 28 years. The Feinstein amendment does not do that.\n  Let me take a few minutes to address the substance of each of the \nchanges proposed by the Feinstein amendment individually. The Feinstein \namendment would alter section 5 of the bipartisan balanced budget \namendment to allow for a waiver of the balanced budget rule by a \nconstitutional majority in any year ``in which the United States is \nexperiencing a national economic emergency or major natural disaster.''\n  As an initial matter, the undefined terms ``economic emergency'' and \n``natural disaster'' are malleable terms and could be abused by any \nfuture Congress bent on deficit spending. What constitutes an economic \nemergency? We have already resoundingly rejected an amendment on this \nissue because it is a broad loophole.\n  Now, what about natural disasters? Does this amendment mean to say \nthat the balanced budget amendment can be waived by 51 votes in the \nSenate in any year in which there is a natural disaster in some region \nof the United States? There is hardly any year when we don't have \nsomething somebody claims is a natural disaster. If that is the case, \nand given the fact that natural disaster is not defined, isn't it \nplausible, or even likely, that Congress will routinely find something \nto classify as a natural disaster, thereby providing an excuse to waive \nthe requirements of the balanced budget amendment. Twenty-eight years \nof unbalanced budgets would suggest that this is the case. Congress \nwill find a way if you give them these kinds of generic terms that are \nnot defined and really can't be defined.\n  What's more, nothing in this amendment of the distinguished Senator \nfrom California would require the additional spending to be directed to \nthe communities affected by a natural disaster or to be used to get us \nout of a recession. ``Natural disasters'' or ``economic emergencies'' \nare only the triggers that let us spend whatever we want for whatever \npurpose. Because these terms are so malleable and subject to abuse, we \nneed a supermajority provision to guarantee fidelity to the balanced \nbudget rule.\n  The general three-fifths waiver contained in section 1 of Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 is both sufficient to answer the concerns raised by \nthis amendment and strong enough to keep the balanced budget amendment \nmeaningful. The Feinstein amendment would exclude Social Security \noutlays and receipts from unified budget calculations until 1 year \nafter the effective date of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n\n  In essence, the Feinstein amendment is nothing more than the Reid \namendment we debated yesterday to exclude Social Security from Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 and unified budgets, with one wrinkle--the exemption \nwill not go into effect until 1 year after the date that the balanced \nbudget amendment becomes effective. This would allow, of course, \nPresident Clinton to include the current Social Security surpluses in \nhis budget calculations but would leave future Presidents and \nCongresses holding the bag when they are forced to unnecessarily slash \nprograms like Medicare because the budget deficit appears larger \nwithout Social Security surpluses than it really is.\n  Moreover, the explanation of the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia of her provision, and the charts that illustrate it, \ncontemplate implementing this change by a one-time massive cut in a \nsingle year. Opponents of the balanced budget amendment have regularly \nargued that such an abrupt change would cause serious economic \ndistortions in our country. The Feinstein amendment suffers from the \nsame disease as the Reid amendment. It is not a workable compromise \nbecause, for the most part, Social Security surpluses will be excluded \nfrom the protections provided by the balanced budget amendment.\n  As King Solomon wisely knew, there is no practical way to split the \nbaby without destroying life. If you split the baby and put Social \nSecurity exposed out there without any balanced budget protections and \neverything else is in the budget and protected, Social Security will \nbecome a political football to be used by those who want to get around \nthe balanced budget. And everybody here knows that. Everybody knows \nwhat a phony issue that is.\n\n  So, too, the Feinstein amendment will destroy the viability of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  First, as I discussed during the debate on the Reid amendment, it is \nnecessary to include Social Security in any balanced budget plan. \nObviously, without including Social Security, the largest single item \nin the Federal budget, other programs must be cut far more than they \nreally need to be. I have the belief that the distinguished Senator \nfrom California would be among the first to want to oppose those cuts. \nCertainly I wouldn't feel good about cutting things beyond where they \nshould be cut. But that is what inevitably would happen if the Reid \namendment had passed yesterday, or the Feinstein amendment is passed \ntoday.\n  The proponents of this amendment have not told us which programs they \nwill cut in order to come up with approximately $100 billion per year \nthat the total exclusion of Social Security surpluses will cost us. \nAstoundingly, this figure is greater than our combined annual \nexpenditure on education, the environment, and transportation and \ninfrastructure. In fact, between 2003 and 2019, when the Social \nSecurity outlays will exceed receipts, the trust fund is expected to \nearn more than $1.8 trillion. Where do the supporters of the Feinstein \namendment propose to come up with the money necessary to cover this \nself-imposed shortfall? It is no secret around here that many on the \nother side support this amendment because they want to kill the \nbalanced budget amendment. That is the whole game here. I do not \nbelieve that is the motive of the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. At least I hope it isn't. But that is the only reason why \nthis amendment will be supported by our friends on the other side, if \nyou really analyze it.\n  Let's put it in perspective. Discretionary savings from last year's \nbudget resolution, which were described as draconian, were only $291 \nbillion. The Feinstein amendment would require that Congress cut \nspending or raise taxes more than six times that amount.\n  Similarly, the projected revenues from the 1993 Clinton tax \nincrease--the largest tax increase in history, many assert--were only \n$241 billion. The Feinstein amendment would require that Congress cut \nspending or increase taxes over six times this largest tax increase in \nhistory. These levels of spending cuts and tax increases are clearly \nunworkable. And the adoption of the Feinstein amendment would kill any \nchance the balanced budget amendment has of being ratified. That is \nreally in the eyes of many who hate this balanced budget amendment, who \ndo not want fiscal restraint, and who really want to continue their \ntaxing and spending ways. That is really why they support the Feinstein \namendment.\n  One person who testified against the balanced budget amendment said--\nif you are going to have a balanced budget amendment you should not \nexclude anything from the budget.\n  Second, exempting Social Security from the mandates of the balanced \nbudget amendment for any considerable period of time will probably \nresult in the demise of the Social Security program years earlier. Such \nan exemption will create a powerful incentive to redefine taxing and \nspending programs as Social Security, and to pay for them through what \ncould become a giant loophole in any attempt to balance the budget.\n\n  Opponents of the balanced budget amendment incorrectly contend that \nincluding present-day Social Security surpluses in a unified budget \nwould raid the trust funds. Give me a break. This is a complete \nmisnomer because the surpluses are nothing more than an accounting \nrecord. Social Security FICA taxes are deposited with other revenues. \nInterest-bearing securities are purchased equal to the amounts of \nSocial Security receipts. And those are Federal Government U.S. \ninterest-bearing securities. These securities provide safe investments \nas long as we are financially solvent in this country, as long as we \ndon't go broke, as long as our economy is going ahead, and the\n\n[[Page S1604]]\n\nonly thing that is going to keep us doing that for sure will be if we \npass the balanced budget amendment.\n  The fact is that these securities provide a safe investment, the \nsafest in the world, I have to say, as long as this country is safe. \nThis safety, however, would be wrecked if Social Security were removed \nfrom the protection of Senate Joint Resolution 1's balancing \nrequirements. In fact, the very fears of the advocates of the Feinstein \namendment will be realized. Their exemption of Social Security will \nreally cause the trust fund to be raided. That is the ironic situation \nhere. Why? Because under the Feinstein amendment trust fund receipts \nwould be used to finance other costly programs that they would simply \ncall Social Security.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, 2 days \nago say that Social Security is defined by statute. If it is defined by \nstatute, it can be redefined by statute. There is no argument against \nthat. It is ridiculous to sit here and argue that it will not be used \nas a loophole to spend anything they want to spend by calling it Social \nSecurity. Trust fund receipts really could be used to finance other \ncostly programs by simply relabeling them ``Social Security.''\n  With the loophole proposed by this exemption in place there will be \nan irresistible impulse in future Congresses to redefine unrelated \nprograms as Social Security. This in turn will create an incentive for \nCongress to include costly programs as part of Social Security. \nCongress has not been able to restrain itself.\n  Look at these. There is just no answer to this by those who oppose \nthe balanced budget amendment. Anything they try to say just comes out \nwhen you look at 28 years of unbalanced budgets, and 58 of them over \nthe last 66 years. This is not rocket science. It doesn't take any \nbrains to understand that Congress is incapable of living within its \nmeans unless we put in some sort of restraint within the Constitution \nthat requires them to live within their means.\n  So I am saying that if you carve out Social Security that in turn \nwould create an incentive for Congress to include costly programs as \npart of Social Security. Like I say, Congress can't restrain itself \nfrom either wasteful spending or increasing this web of services \nprovided by Social Security. What is going to prevent them from doing \nthat in the future if you have all of the loopholes that the Feinstein \namendment provides for? Are we willing to let future Congresses roll \nthe dice with the financial security of America's seniors? That is what \nis going to happen if we do not have a balanced budget amendment. Mark \nmy word, it certainly is going to happen if we pass the Feinstein \namendment and put Social Security out there exposed all by itself and \nnot subject to balanced budget protections. Frankly, if the Feinstein \namendment passes the balanced budget amendment is dead. There is no use \nkidding about it. It would be killed, and for good reason because it \nwouldn't work anyway. So that is what we are talking about.\n\n  Passing an exemption loophole would essentially create two Federal \nbudgets. One would be based on sound principles of solvency, and the \nother, the Social Security budget, which would not be based on sound \nprinciples of solvency. One budget would be required to be in balance \nunless a supermajority voted to allow a deficit. The other the Social \nSecurity budget would be raided and bloated with unrelated spending \nprograms and projects.\n  Taking Social Security off budget will subject the funds to \nWashington's special interest scavengers. As I have said before, when \nyou have rats in your house, you need to plug up the holes. If you do \nnot, they are going to find a way in. If we leave Social Security off \nbudget all of the special interest spending initiatives, which cannot \nsurvive or make their way in under a balanced budget plan, will smell \nout the scent of Social Security and devour it.\n  This loophole would not only blow a hole in the balanced budget \namendment but it would also seriously harm Social Security. This in \nturn could mean--and I think would mean--the end of Social Security as \nwe know it, transforming it into the least secure of all Federal \nGovernment programs. I do not see how anybody can argue with that.\n  Third, let's not forget about the troubling future for Social \nSecurity. The Feinstein amendment does absolutely nothing to protect \nSocial Security, and, in fact, it will make it extremely difficult, if \nnot impossible, to achieve balanced budgets. The Social Security Board \nof Trustees estimates that by the year 2070, if we keep going the way \nwe currently are, Social Security is expected to run an annual $7 \ntrillion deficit. If we include Social Security in our balanced budget \ncalculations we will be able to prepare for and budget for these \nmassive shortfalls. Under the Feinstein proposal we will not be \nincluding this deficit in our budgetary planning.\n  As a result, under the Feinstein amendment, in order to raise revenue \nand increase the debt ceiling sufficient to cover the expected Social \nSecurity shortfalls of the next century, we will have to dramatically \nincrease taxes or cut spending on other important programs or face an \nannual three-fifths-vote fiscal crisis to avoid financial default by \nraising the already staggering $5.3 trillion national debt ceiling. The \nway to protect Social Security benefits is to pass the balanced budget \namendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1.\n  The proposal to exempt Social Security will not only destroy the \nbalanced budget amendment but in all probability will cause the Social \nSecurity trust funds to run out of money sooner than they would have \nwithout an exemption.\n  The final change in the amendment of the distinguished Senator would \npermit the creation of capital budgets for those major capital \nimprovements which require multiyear Federal funding. Most programs are \nfunded for more than 1 year. Exempting capital budgets from the \nbalanced budget amendment is bad policy because it creates a powerful \nincentive for Congress and the President to balance the budget by \nredefining more programs as capital expenditures. This is just another \nloophole. A gimmick capital budget exemption could actually endanger \ncapital investments as fake investments crowd out real investment.\n  For these reasons, budget experts, including the President's Office \nof Management and Budget, the General Accounting Office, and the \nCongressional Budget Office, have suggested that capital budgets are \ninappropriate at the Federal level and certainly do not justify \nincreasing debt to finance them. The amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from California would enshrine that into the Constitution.\n  The most basic problem with the separate capital budget as envisioned \nby the Feinstein amendment is that there is no clear standard \ndefinition of a capital budget. So no one knows what expenditures will \nfall within that definition. For example, in President Clinton's \nproposed fiscal year 1998 budget, the Office of Management and Budget \nlists four broad categories of programs that may or may not be \nconsidered capital expenditures, ranging from physical assets owned by \nthe Federal Government to social investment, including nutrition \nprograms, health care and drug rehabilitation, all under the idea of a \ncapital budget.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the point was best made in a Washington Post \neditorial criticizing the Reagan administration for floating the idea \nof a capital budget. In that editorial, the Post wrote that ``The \nconcept of the capital budget applied to the Federal Government is pure \nfakery. It is the resort of an administration that, finding the \nrealities of the budget intractable, wants to fuzz up the numbers.'' \nPretty hard to argue with that. Pretty hard to argue with that.\n  Finally, Mr. President, given all these holes in the balanced budget \nrule proposal offered by the distinguished Senator from California, it \nis no wonder the proponents of this substitute have concluded that they \nneed to reduce the supermajority requirement to raise the debt ceiling \nin their substitute. Given the high likelihood of substantial borrowing \nunder this substitute for undefined capital spending, undefined \neconomic emergencies and natural disasters and the possible loophole \nfor the abuse of Social Security, no wonder the proponents of this \nsubstitute do not want to have the three-fifths vote to raise the debt \nceiling. Instead, they reduce the antidebt protections of Senate Joint \nResolution 1 to a constitutional majority.\n\n[[Page S1605]]\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I hope we will reject this substitute, which is \nessentially a hit parade of loopholes repeatedly offered over the years \nby opponents of the bipartisan consensus balanced budget amendment and \nwhich could literally endanger Social Security.\n  The Feinstein amendment is a hit parade of loopholes offered in past \ndebates. How can we keep borrowing? How can we keep doing this to \nourselves, doing this to future generations, doing this to our children \nand our grandchildren? These volumes, this picture speaks a thousand \nwords, a million words, maybe I should say trillions of words, as to \nwhy we have to get strong about doing something about these unbalanced \nbudgets.\n  Let me count the ways why this amendment is wrong.\n  No. 1, it exempts an undefined capital budget, allowing any level of \nborrowing for capital as defined by future Congresses. They could do \nanything they want to under this amendment. Just define them--any \nstatute, any simple majority.\n  No. 2, it allows for a waiver of the balanced budget rule in times of \neconomic emergency or natural disaster, however interpreted by any \nfuture Congress. They could do anything they want to if we adopt the \nFeinstein amendment. The balanced budget amendment would be a thing of \nthe past. There would be no hope to have any fiscal mechanism at all. \nIn fact, it would be the biggest joke you could possibly have.\n  No. 3, it exempts whatever a future Congress calls ``Social \nSecurity.'' They could define anything as Social Security. This \nendangers the retirement security of current and future American \nseniors.\n  And No. 4, because of all these loopholes for deficit spending, it \nreduces the supermajority requirement to raise the debt ceiling from a \nthree-fifths majority to a constitutional majority or 51 percent.\n  The substitute offered by the Senator from California should be \nrejected. It would allow continued deficit spending and borrowing, as \nhas happened in the past 28 years, or should I say in 58 of the last 66 \nyears. It would just continue the process, only make it easier to do it \nunder the guise that we are somehow or other living within a balanced \nbudget amendment constraint as defined by this amendment.\n  Mr. President, look, we are talking about the future of our country. \nWe are talking about our children. We are talking about our \ngrandchildren. We are talking about our seniors. We are talking about a \ncountry that is going to be swallowed up in debt if we do not pass a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I had one of the leading liberals from the Democratic side tell me \nyesterday in no uncertain terms that--in fact, more than one--I have \nhad at least three or four just flat out admit that if it had not been \nfor these fights for the balanced budget--and these people, all but one \nof these people are against the balanced budget amendment--if it had \nnot been for these fights over the balanced budget amendment, if we had \nnot waged this battle, we would not even be talking about balanced \nbudgets.\n\n  All you have to do is look at this year's balanced budget submitted \nby President Clinton, and he is not alone. I saw budgets by several \nPresidents that also were smoke and mirrors because they have to; there \nis no restraint; there is nothing that forces them to do right. But you \nlook at the budget that President Clinton called a balanced budget this \nyear, that he just submitted. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which has been pretty accurate on some of these matters, that \nbudget by the year 2002 will not be balanced; it will be at least $49 \nbillion in deficit, and that is assuming that all these rosy scenarios \nthe President has plugged into it are coming to pass. That is assuming \nthat. The fact is, it will not be balanced.\n  Second, even if it was true that it would be balanced, everybody \nknows the only way we can reach balance is to attack the deficits each \nand every year up to the year 2002. President Clinton's budget goes up \nfor the next 4 years, and then he calls for a 75-percent reduction in \nthe 2 years after he leaves office. It does not take a rocket scientist \nto realize that is a phony budget, that they have tried to get around \nthe requisite of bringing up here a balanced budget. He said he would. \nBut it clearly is not a balanced budget. And it clearly could not be \nbalanced. Even if you assume that it is--and the Congressional Budget \nOffice says it is not--the fact is, it could not be balanced by a 75-\npercent reduction in the 2 years after the President leaves office. It \nis as phony a budget as you can have from that standpoint. But we are \ngoing to work from it because we are going to have to.\n  Let me just say this. If we pass the substitute amendment of the \nSenator from California today, those games will become even more \npronounced. No, what we have to do is, we have to realize that over the \nlast 20 years--frankly, longer than that--good Democrats and good \nRepublicans have fought together to work this out. We have worked it \nout. This is the only amendment that has a chance of passage. It has to \npass unamended.\n  Frankly, I hope that our colleagues will vote down the Feinstein \namendment and support the balanced budget amendment in the end. If this \ngoes down, it is going to be because of one vote. No matter what the \nfinal vote is, it is going to be because of one vote. I can tell you \nthat right now. I do not believe it is going to go down. I believe we \nwill pass this amendment in the Senate, and I am hopeful that this will \nbe an incentive to go to the House.\n  Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I yield back the remainder of my time, and I move to \ntable and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I would add very quickly, Mr. President, that there \nis one, deep, soft underbelly in the majority balanced budget \namendment. You cannot use Social Security trust funds and spend the \nmoney on operating expenditures, whether it be for a battleship or a \nsatellite, and save those moneys for someone's retirement.\n  I rest my case.

The capital budget shall \n     include only investments in major public physical capital \n     that provides long-term economic benefits.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I offer my amendment recognizing that \nthe context of this debate is fundamentally different because of over \n20 years of effort by the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and a Member in \nthe House from Texas, Mr. Stenholm, who have worked diligently to bring \nbefore this institution of the Congress an amendment to require a \nbalanced budget.\n  While their efforts to date have not succeeded, the fact that we meet \nwith a Federal deficit which has been reduced by over 60 percent in \nannual terms in the last 3 years is no small testament to their \nefforts.\n  The national debate has been fundamentally changed. It is no longer a \nquestion of if there is going to be an operating balanced budget in the \nU.S. Government, but when and how it is going to be achieved.\n  I take great pride in that, through the years, on three occasions I \njoined with them to do so, because, in my judgment, 15 years ago this \ncountry began a radical and even dangerous experimentation with \nchanging the finances of the U.S. Government. There had been for some \n200 years an unspoken compact among the generations--the Nation would \nborrow for its national defense or to provide for its domestic economy \nin times of danger or severe deprivation, but quickly return to an \noperating surplus and to pay those debts when the situation allowed.\n  So from the War of 1812, and the Civil War, through the Second World \nWar and the time of the Great Depression, succeeding giants of American \nhistory borrowed so much as was necessary to ensure the survival of the \nRepublic, but almost immediately in each and every circumstance \nreturned to an operating surplus and dealt with the principal of the \ndebt in fairness to future generations and to assure the financial \nhealth of the U.S. Government.\n  Our generation has the unfortunate distinction of being the first to \nbreak that compact. During the 1980's, the Federal deficit, from less \nthan $1 trillion, grew to in excess of $4 trillion. Indeed, during the \nReagan Presidency alone, the annual Federal debt grew at a rate in \nexcess of 13 percent, reaching the extraordinary drain on the Federal \nTreasury for interest alone of 20 percent of all revenues.\n\n  When the Clinton administration assumed office 4 years ago, President \nClinton inherited an operating deficit of $290 billion. In 4 years we \nhave experienced an extraordinary change, a 63-percent reduction in the \nannual debt of the U.S. Government as a result of the deficit reduction \ninitiative of 1993. So at this point the United States has the lowest \noperating annual debt of any industrialized nation in the world with \n1.4 percent.\n  The question, therefore, is whether the United States has learned a \nvaluable lesson from the excesses that began in 1981 and began to abate \nin 1993, or whether, indeed, this change of fortunes in the last 4 \nyears is itself an aberration, and a permanent amendment to the \nConstitution is required.\n  There have been few instances in the life of this Republic when any \nCongress has found it necessary to change the Constitution by which we \ngovern ourselves. We recognize that the U.S. Constitution is a precious \ndocument in its balances, its allocation of powers. It is, I think, \nimportant to note, and no small achievement, that when the 20th century \nends in but a few brief years there will be only two governments on \nthis globe who will end the century with the same basic form of \ngovernment, under the same Constitution, with the same allotment of \npowers with which they began the century. The United States of America \nis one. The certain genius of our Constitution, both how it was written \nand how it distributed powers, is certainly a reason.\n  I rise, therefore, Mr. President, recognizing that any decision to \namend the Constitution of the United States is extraordinarily serious \nand, indeed, sobering for every Member of the institution. I, \ntherefore, believe if it is to be amended, it is to be done so \ncarefully, and in every respect, ensuring that we understand the \nconsequences.\n  The amendment that I bring before the body today deals with three \ncentral elements of the resolution. First, whether or not the U.S. \nGovernment should continue to both have its current accounts and its \ncapital budget reflected in a single accounting; second, how, indeed, \nunder this amendment the Government will respond to times of economic \nrecession; and third, how the U.S. Government would respond to threats \nto our national security under the provisions of the resolution.\n  I begin, Mr. President, with a question of a capital budget. \nThroughout these last 20 years, much has been spoken about the mounting \ndeficit of the U.S. Government. We have convinced the American people, \nI believe, of two conclusions that bear further scrutiny. First, that \nthe principal and only debt of the United States that bears witness is \nthe debt operational of the U.S. Government; and second, that the \nappropriate level of debt of the U.S. Government is zero. Neither \nconclusion, Mr. President, bears scrutiny.\n  No institution which plans for its future, is properly taking \nadvantage of its ability to borrow, has no operating deficit. Indeed, \nMr. President, 43 States in this Union by calculation set the proper \nand appropriate level of deficit borrowing. The States do so through \ncapital borrowing commissions. They evaluate the transportation, the \ninfrastructure needs, the investment needs of their States and \ncarefully calculate their ability to pay back those loans and what they \nwill contribute to the economic performance of their States.\n\n  Indeed, this has been so successful that for the last 50 years not \nonly has no State defaulted, but, indeed, I know in no instance when \nthere has been a serious issue of a Governor of either party or their \nrespective legislatures engaging in inappropriate or excessive \nborrowing, or any borrowing, other than what was required for the \neconomic future of their State.\n  Unique in our society is the U.S. Government. Unlike all major \nbusinesses in each of these States, and all of our economic \ncompetitors, the U.S. Government has no capital budget. In our \nplanning, we regard the construction of a road or a railroad or a \nschool which may last for 20, 50, or 100 years the same way we regard \nthe hiring of a new employee, the buying of a piece of paper, paying \nfor the lights. The fact is that by any standard accounting--one is the \nexchange of financial resources for a lasting and productive resource, \nand the other is an immediate consumption--this has not been addressed \nand has never been changed.\n  My fear, Mr. President, is that if we adopt the balanced budget \namendment as now offered by the Senator from Utah without a capital \nbudgeting provision, the thirsts of the U.S. Government for consumption \nwill certainly begin to exclude what remains of long-term investments \nin this country. Because, indeed, over these years, we have seen a \nserious deterioration in the amount of investment by the United States. \nIn 1960, 25 percent of the Federal budget was dedicated to long-term \ncapital investments. The United States constructed a highway system \nthat was the envy of the world. Our mass transit systems for railroads \nwere still on the cutting edge. We built a university system that was \nwithout peer. By the time the 1960's concluded, no nation on Earth \nwould want to be in a position to not be able to trade the American \ntransportation or infrastructure or research base with their own.\n  I doubt, Mr. President, few nations would make that trade today. The \nUnited States is now last in all developed nations in the world in our \nlevel of infrastructure investment in capital planning. Today, our \nGovernment invests only 7 percent of our revenues in capital \nexpenditures, the Japanese having a rate of nearly 6 percent, as \nindicated on this graph, the Germans having a rate half again as great \nas our own. Our percentage of GDP dedicated to infrastructure \ninvestment is now barely 1.7 percent.\n  The question, therefore, is if today we proceed to a balanced budget \namendment without this exemption for capital expenditures, will this \n1.7 percent rate of GDP, this 7 percent rate of all Government \nspending, deteriorate further? The irony, Mr. President, of this \nsituation is the exact opposite of what has happened with American \nbusiness. American business today operates a $4.5 trillion deficit. \nAmerican businesses learned that deficit spending, if it involves \nproductivity, new\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\nplant and equipment, and operating efficiency, is not only necessary, \nit is required for future economic growth.\n  Mr. President, I attempt to bring that same lesson to the floor of \nthis Senate. We are potentially putting a straitjacket financially on \nthis Government and our ability to be competitive.\n  In the United States today, there are a quarter of a million miles of \nroads that are substandard and in need of immediate repair. They will \nnot serve us another century of efficient business performance. Twenty-\nfive percent of all the bridges in America that are handling the cargo \nof our industry, servicing our towns, leading to the productivity of \nour businesses, are in need of immediate repair. The great ports of \nAmerica, which once rivaled any in the world--and now, indeed, the port \nof New York, once the most efficient and busiest port in the world, now \noffloads cargo in the outer harbor because it is too shallow to take \nmodern ships like Japan and Europe. We are disinvesting in America, \ntransforming places in this country into the efficiency of Third World \nnations. This disinvestment in the American future cannot continue.\n  The Senator from Utah, in previous discussions in the Judiciary \nCommittee, makes a worthwhile point: Who is to ensure that worthwhile \ncapital projects are not placed in the general operating budgets of the \nU.S. Government, or vice versa? Who is to draw the line? Well, Mr. \nPresident, in our corporations, in our homes, and indeed in our States, \nwe have learned to draw that line. States have capital planning \ncommissions. Every homeowner has learned the difference between a home \nmortgage and buying a new suit or paying for the evening meal. Indeed, \nevery corporation in America has learned in the marketplace to \ndistinguish. So can this Government, and so it must.\n  Mr. President, I believe that, more perhaps than any other provision \nI offer in my amendment today, this call for capital planning in the \nU.S. Government will reflect how serious we are at long last about \nrearranging the spending powers of the U.S. Government and making them \nresponsible again. And so the first of three provisions in my amendment \nto the balanced budget amendment is for dealing with capital spending.\n  Mr. President, my second provision deals with the ability of the U.S. \nGovernment to respond to another set of contingencies, just as \nimportant as dealing with the long-term financial planning of this \nGovernment and its investments. I mentioned the question of dealing \nwith national military emergencies. The Senator from Utah appropriately \nhas placed in his balanced budget amendment a provision that, if the \nUnited States engages in a war, through a declaration of war, three-\nfifths of the Congress can waive the provision of a balanced budget. He \nis right to do so. But it is also inadequate.\n  Mr. President, in the experiences of the 20th century, the most \nimportant military expenditures to defend this Union have not always \nbeen made solely after a declaration of war. Given the enormity of \npreparing for armed conflict, the complexity of technology and the time \nnecessary to construct the implements of war, the most important \nexpenditures have often been made in the months or years preceding \narmed conflict. Indeed, the principal battles of the Second World War, \nwhen the implements of war were considerably less costly or complex \nthan those that we will meet in the 21st century, the principal \ninvestments for that conflict were made not only in the months, but in \nthe years preceding the Second World War.\n  President Roosevelt's decision to rebuild the U.S. Navy and double \nits size was made not after Pearl Harbor, but in the years before. The \nquestion, therefore, with this amendment, that we are to waive these \nprovisions only after a declaration of war--what does that do to an \nAmerican President and the American military that recognizes an \nimminent threat, can discern an almost certain conflict, and needs \ndesperately to prepare the Union to defend itself?\n\n  Indeed, Mr. President, in our own time, in the Persian Gulf war, on a \nfar smaller scale, we recognized exactly these circumstances. It was 5 \nmonths from the time that Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait to the \nbeginning of hostilities on the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border. In those 5 \nmonths, the U.S. Government was operating at a $220 billion deficit. \nPresident Bush consumed an additional $10 billion in deficit spending \nto prepare for the almost certain conflict with Iraqi Armed Forces. \nThere was no declaration of war, but there was no mistaking what was \ngoing to happen. It was as certain as Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw an \nimminent conflict with Germany and Japan, and as certain as President \nWilson knew there would be a conflict in Europe, and indeed as certain \nas in the opening weeks of his administration, President Lincoln knew \nthe inevitability of a war between the States. Each began to plan for \nconflict. Each began to borrow. And when the conflict began, this \ncountry at least approached being prepared.\n  And so, Mr. President, the second principal change that I offer to \nthe balanced budget amendment--the first was to allow for a separate \ncapital planning expenditure budget to deal with long-term economic \ninvestments. My second is to allow, by a joint resolution, the \ndeclaration of a national military emergency so that the country can \nproperly plan.\n  I do so in fairness to the Senator from Utah. I also want to mention \nthat I do so without there being a declaration of war, but also \nchanging to a majority vote, in recognition that I do not want any \nforeign adversary to ever miscalculate that because we are unable to \nreach a three-fifths vote, we will also be unable to defend the United \nStates.\n  It is worth noting that, at no point in the years preceding the \nSecond World War, at no point preceding the First World War, and it was \ndemonstrated at no point before the Persian Gulf war, did three-fifths \nof this institution stand for the proper preparations for war. Indeed, \nas a Democratic author of the Persian Gulf war measure in the House of \nRepresentatives, we never did get a three-fifths vote. With Germany \nhaving overrun half of Europe, these institutions of the Congress \npassed the Selective Service Act to prepare the United States for a \nwar, which was almost certain, by a single vote. Therefore, not only do \nI provide for a joint resolution so the United States can prepare for \nimminent hostilities, but I do so by a majority vote.\n\n  Third, Mr. President, I have an additional change which deals with an \nequally important matter of economic recession. There are those who \ncome to the floor of the Senate and argue that deficit spending is \nnecessary to maintain the economic performance of the United States, \nand they provide evidence that, indeed, the rapid growth of this \neconomy in the latter half of the 20th century and the extraordinary \nstandard of living that we have achieved is due in no small part to the \nability of the United States to borrow. Others argue that that right \nhas been abused. Indeed, we have drawn upon our credit to such an \nextent that we have placed a burden on the future which is \nunsustainable, and, with 20 percent of our tax dollars going not to \nbuild new roads, not to educate another generation, but to only pay \ninterest on the debt, they are right. Indeed, Mr. President, both are \nright on the question of achieving a balance between the two.\n  There has been in this latter half of the 20th century a notable and \neven extraordinary change in the business cycle of growth and \nrecession. Indeed, between 1900 and 1950 there were 33 quarters of real \nnegative economic growth. Through the experience of the Great \nDepression the U.S. Government learned, and then admittedly abused, the \nability to adjust the business cycle through borrowing in times of \nrecession to compensate for declining private investment and \nexpenditures. The result is that in these last 47 years compared with \nthe 33 quarters of negative economic growth in the first half of the \ncentury, we have experienced only four quarters of negative economic \ngrowth since 1950.\n  The question then is, How do we achieve a balance? The Senator from \nUtah appropriately noted that the power to borrow has been abused with \na mounting deficit which is unsustainable on its face versus losing \nthis ability to deal with real economic downturns and provide \nadjustments. Indeed, Secretary Rubin in his testimony provided a \nwarning that without some ability to stabilize we could\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\n``turn slowdowns into recessions and recessions into more severe \nrecessions or even depressions.''\n  The Treasury Department has estimated that during the 1992 recession, \nwithout the ability to engage in some deficit spending, the recession \nthat lasted from 1990 to 1992 would have had in excess of 9 percent \nunemployment instead of 7.7 percent with an additional 1 million jobs \nbeing lost.\n  Mr. President, I have attempted in my amendment in its final \nprovision to strike a balance. That is where the institutions of the \nCongress could by joint resolution declare an economic emergency and \nallow it, only for so long as it believes that emergency exists, to \nengage in deficit spending to ensure that the public works programs and \njob creation ability of the Government is not lost.\n  Mr. President, we will never know what would have happened in the \nGreat Depression had there not been a Second World War or a New Deal \nand the massive deficit spending of that period to end the economic \ndebt into which this country had gone. It was by any measure a real \nthreat to American democracy. In the Second World War this country \napproached 60 percent of GDP in deficit spending. It is a debt burden \nwhich the Nation must bear. It also provided a foundation for a \nstandard of living and an economic performance which in all of human \nhistory has never been equaled.\n\n  My amendment seeks to use the creditworthiness powers of this \nGovernment to deal with those economic contingencies but making certain \nthat they are used only in periods of economic emergency.\n  In short, Mr. President, in each of these provisions I have attempted \nto do by constitutional amendment what common sense provided that we do \nthrough 200 years of American history. I do so with considerable \nregret. Succeeding generations in this country provided for capital \nspending because they cared about the future. The Constitution didn't \nrequire that they do it. They did it because it made sense for the \nAmerican future. Succeeding generations borrowed to defend the Nation \nwhen it was threatened because they cared about the defense of the \nRepublic, not because the Constitution required that they only borrow \nto provide for the national defense and not exceed that authority when \nthe Nation was not threatened. Succeeding generations borrowed to deal \nwith economic recessions and depressions because they cared about the \neconomic future of the country and our people and did not abuse it.\n  No Member of the Senate should take pride in the fact that in our \ngeneration it might be necessary to amend the United States \nConstitution to provide for these capital expenditures in dealing with \nmilitary threats and economic emergencies, to assure that our country \nis responsible in dealing with that borrowing, and that the borrowing \nis done only to the extent and to the degree that it is appropriate. We \nshould do so because we care about our people and the future of the \nRepublic. Yet, like the Senator from Utah, I rise because there is the \nunmistakable fact that in our own time that power has been abused.\n  Therefore, I rise with amendments to the resolution recognizing that \namending the Constitution is unlike any other action taken by the \nCongress of the United States. We legislate not for our time; we write \nfor all time. These are words that will govern contingencies that we \ncannot imagine, circumstances that we cannot foresee. If it is \nnecessary to amend the Constitution of the United States, it is \nnecessary to do so to the fullest extent possible with all the wisdom \nthat we can muster. I believe the amendment of the Senator from Utah \nwould be improved and enhanced by these changes. Indeed, I believe \nthese changes are necessary to responsibly add to the work of our \nancestors who wrote this great document and provided for the political \nstability of this Nation through these two centuries and allowed it to \nbecome the unique society and the extraordinary Nation that we have \nbecome.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a strong supporter of the \nbalanced budget amendment and a strong supporter of the Torricelli \namendment. I do not believe that the two are inconsistent\n\n  Those of us who support amending the Constitution to balance the \nbudget have an obligation to make sure that we are supporting the best \npossible balanced budget amendment. I listened carefully to Senator \nByrd earlier this week when he talked about the sanctity of the \nConstitution. He argued, and I agree, that we ought to amend this most \nbasic and important document of our Government with only our best \nideas, principles and language.\n  The balanced budget amendment does, in my opinion, embody a principle \nsimple and vital enough to deserve inclusion in the Constitution. It \nsays that we ought to spend no more than we take in. It says that this \ngeneration has no right to finance its own consumption with money \nborrowed from the next generation. It asks the Federal Government to \nrun its finances in a manner that both provides for a strong America in \nthe present and builds a stronger America in the future.\n  The Torricelli amendment would improve the balanced budget amendment \nby bringing it closer to this fundamental principle. The Torricelli \namendment would exclude investments in physical infrastructure that \nprovide long-term economic benefits from the definition of Federal \noutlays. In other words, it would put into the balanced budget \namendment the requirement that we balance our operating budget but \nwould allow debt financing of long-term public investments.\n  To me this makes eminently good sense. It is how everyone else keeps \ntheir books, from State governments, to businesses, to families. You \npay now for things that are going to benefit you now, and you pay over \ntime for investments, the value of which accrues over time. A State \ngovernment issues bonds to finance major highway projects and new \nconstruction of public buildings. A business goes to the bank for a \nloan to upgrade its machinery. A family takes out a mortgage to buy a \nhouse.\n  When we say on the Senate floor that the Government ought to balance \nits books just like an American family has to, we mean that the \nGovernment ought to balance its operating budget just like an American \nfamily has to. No one is suggesting that a family wait until they save \nup enough money to pay cash for a home. If we operated that way, there \nwould be very few homes bought in this country.\n  If the Federal Government must balance its budget without separating \nout its capital expenditures, there will be very few public investments \nmade in this country, and that would be very wrong. Already, the \nFederal Government woefully underinvests in the capital that will grow \nour economy--in our roads, in our schools, in our cities. The \nTorricelli amendment will ensure that in pursuing a balanced budget we \ndo not have a perverse incentive to avoid those public expenditures \nthat would most benefit future generations.\n  State governments understand this. Forty-three of them have balanced \nbudget requirements that separate out the capital budget. In my State \nof Wisconsin, the constitution requires that taxes cover expenses. But \nit also states that debt may be incurred ``to acquire, construct, \ndevelop, extend, enlarge or improve land, waters, property, highways, \nrailways, buildings, equipment, or facilities for public purposes.''\n  That is a simple, straightforward and correct approach that we ought \nto take in the Federal balanced budget amendment, and I hope my fellow \nsupporters of the balanced budget amendment will agree. This debate has \nalways been about stopping the practice of robbing Peter and Paul, Jr. \nto pay for Peter and Paul, Sr. Supporters of a balanced budget \namendment want to look beyond our needs today and toward our hopes for \nthe future.\n  That means not spending more than we take in. And that means making \nwise, long-term investments in the economy that will sustain future \ngenerations. We can do both with a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution if we also pass the Torricelli amendment, and so I urge my \ncolleagues to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee.\n\n[[Page S1610]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Utah for \nhis strong leadership on this issue. It is not easy carrying the ball \nfor so long and so well. He has done such an admirable job of that. I \nam sure our colleagues on both sides of the aisle admire him for what \nhe has done.\n  I want to talk for a few minutes on the broader question of the need \nfor the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. It seems to me \nthat among all of the things we address in this body, there are some \nbasic considerations that should underlie it all, and we should focus \nfrom time to time on what we really should be about, what we should do \nas those who govern.\n  I think it comes down to two basic categories, that is, trying to \ninstitute policies that make for the long-term strength of this \ncountry, and to try to do things that will encourage people to have \nmore confidence and faith in their system of government.\n  I believe those are the two basic things we ought always keep in mind \nas we go about our structured existence around here, the hurly-burly \nthat we all have to contend with in passing thousands of pieces of \nlegislation. Does it contribute to the long-term strength and viability \nof this country and does it contribute to people's confidence in their \nform of Government. I feel that is what we are dealing with here. I \nfeel that every once in a while something comes up that really is \nimportant with regard to one or the other of those considerations, and \nI think the constitutional amendment to balance the budget has to do \nwith both of those considerations, because I fear for the economic \nfuture of this country if we do not pass such an amendment.\n\n  I feel that when the results of our economic policies today are felt \na little bit further down the road and we see that once again the so-\ncalled balanced budget agreements that we may reach around here do not, \nin fact, balance the budget, we are going to increase the cynicism that \nthe American people already have toward this Government. That is why I \nthink a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is so important.\n  There has been a lot of discussion as to whether or not there really \nis a need. I think most all of us take seriously the proposition of \namending the Constitution, even though our forefathers certainly \ncontemplated it. Thomas Jefferson is often quoted. Certainly they felt \nthat from time to time we need to reexamine our basic institutions and \nnot be afraid after due deliberation to make changes that in the course \nof history are proven necessary to improve our system of government. \nBut it is not something to be taken lightly, and I do not think any of \nus do take it lightly.\n  It is clear that from time to time we must sit down and see whether \nor not we are functioning as we should, whether we are getting the job \ndone for this country and, if not, what should we do about it. We can \ngo down the same old road or we can try to do something about it.\n  This constitutional amendment constitutes doing something about it \nbecause it is clear that we will go down in history under present \ncircumstances as the first generation to leave their children in worse \nshape than they found their country when they took positions of \nleadership. It is true, without question, that we are leaving the next \ngeneration with astronomical tax rates to face, astronomical interest \nrates to face, a slower economy. We certainly are on the road, the path \nthat most and great civilizations have followed through history. Some \nhistorians say you can calculate it almost to the year. Some say they \nsurvive for 250 years. A case can be made that we are on the downside \nof that mountain, that we are certainly going in the same direction of \nother great powers--the Turks or Ottoman Empire or Spanish Empire, ones \nthat ruled the world once upon a time but proved they could slide off \ninto second-rate powers and nations that were much less than what they \naspired to be or were in prior times.\n  A good case can be made that we are on track for that. We know, our \nown entitlement commission tells us that by the year 2012 we will be \npaying out all of the tax collections we receive in entitlement and \ninterest rates and have nothing for national defense, have nothing for \ninfrastructure, have nothing for education. That is the road we are \ngoing down.\n  Some say, no, we are making progress; all we need to do is get about \nthe business of balancing the budget, that we are really making \nprogress. If history is to be any indication of that, though, I hope \nthat plea falls on deaf ears, as it should.\n  The President's budget is used as an example of the fact that we are \nmaking progress, we might even have a so-called balanced budget \namendment agreement. However, upon examination, we see readily that the \nPresident's budget or anything that might come from the President's \nbudget that we might agree to is not going to solve the problem. It \nwill not balance the budget. It adds over $1 trillion to the debt. It \nis based on assumptions that in all likelihood will not play out. It is \nbased on assumptions having to do with current economic expansion which \nis now in the sixth year, making it the third longest on record. The \nlikelihood is that will not continue indefinitely. It is based upon \nhigh projections of corporate profits that the CBO says are \nunrealistic. It is based upon the proposition that we will continue to \nhave medical savings, and many, many experts, including the Budget \nCommittee, think we have got most of those savings on the front end, \nthat they will not be occurring year after year after year, and that \nwill impact our tax revenues.\n  The President's budget is based upon extremely optimistic projections \nfor long-term interest rates. And last but not least, of course, three-\nquarters of the cuts in the President's budget come after the President \nis no longer in office, the last 2 years.\n  In other words, it is based on the proposition that a future Congress \nwill have more courage than this one does and we will be making cuts in \ndiscretionary programs, things that most all of us agree we need to be \nmore attentive to, things like infrastructure and research and \ndevelopment and things of that nature that provide for the long-term \nviability of this Nation. But the proposition is that we will continue \nto squeeze that 17 percent of nonentitlement, nondefense, noninterest \nportion of the budget, that narrow 17 percent, for those infrastructure \nitems and parks and that sort of thing, and get astronomical savings \nfrom cutting those areas in the last 2 years.\n  We know that will not happen. We know that will never take place. So \nthat is why David Broder referred to the budget as one of ``no hard \nchoices.'' But, as we know, the time is past for no hard choices. We \ncannot get by with that any longer. We cannot get by with that \nindefinitely.\n  Last Saturday I was watching on television, on C-SPAN, a former \ncolleague of ours, Senator Packwood. He was speaking to a group out in \nOregon about things that he knows a lot about, about our tax structure, \nabout budgetary matters. As chairman of the Finance Committee, of \ncourse, he was deeply involved in those matters. He had some charts.\n  I called and asked for those tables with regard to percentages of \ntaxing and spending as a percentage of gross domestic product with \nregard to this country and other countries. There are some very \ninteresting things in there in terms of where we are today and where we \nare likely to be tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those tables be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n FEDERAL, STATE/LOCAL AND TOTAL GOVERNMENT TAXES AND SPENDING AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS

Many nations use different methods of calculating government expenditures and revenues than the standard budget accounting\n  method the U.S. government uses. These series can, however, give an approximate comparison of these spending and revenue trends of these countries.\n \nSource: Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, International Monetary Fund, 1995. Asia Development Outlook, 1995-1996, Asian Development Bank.\n\n\nMr. THOMPSON. What road are we on? If we do not need a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget and if we do not have that, what is \nlikely to happen based on history and based on reasonable projections?\n  First of all, he gave me a chart that had to do with United States, \nState/local, and total government taxes and spending as a percentage of \nGNP. It showed a couple of different things.\n  In 1950, the tax take was 21.4 percent. In 1950, 21.4 percent of GDP. \nIn 1995 it was 30.4 percent. But, spending went from 23.1 percent to \n32.4 percent.\n  So the point that he made, which I think is a valid one, is you \ncannot tax your way out of this problem. We are increasing taxes both \nin real terms and in terms of percentage of GDP, but of course, \nspending continues to increase right along with it. So, today, we are \ntaxing a little over 30 percent and spending a little over 32 percent.\n  Then he made some comparisons with some other countries. I think it \nis some indication of our future, and some indication of maybe our past \nin a way. As far as our future is concerned, the direction it looks \nlike we are likely to go is the same direction that many of our friends \nin Europe and Scandinavian countries went. Figures with regard to \nGermany, France, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden--there, interestingly \nenough, they, too, are spending a greater percentage of their GDP than \ntheir taxing reflects.\n  In Germany they are taxing 46 percent, spending 50; France, 49 \npercent, spending 54; Norway and Denmark and Sweden--Denmark, of \ncourse, taxing 60 percent of GDP and spending 62 percent.\n  What is in common among all of these countries is they all have \neconomic problems. They are all having problems with unemployment. They \nare all having the problems with the demographics that we will soon be \nfacing, problems of a growing elderly population. They are all \neconomies that, I think it would be fair to be say, generally are \nstagnating and having great problems. They are all economies that \nhistorically, just like us, always spend a little more than they tax. \nThey continue to raise taxes, but always spend a little more than they \ntax. That seems to be our future on the present course.\n  On the other hand, if you look at some countries around the Pacific \nrim--Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, countries of that nature, you see \nthey are taxing in the neighborhood of between 14 and 17 percent of GDP \nand spending in the neighborhood of 16 and 17 percent of GDP. So, not \nonly do they have very low rates of taxation and low rates of spending, \nbut their spending is not outstripping their taxes.\n  What do we have there that is common among those countries? High \nrates of growth, high employment rates, economic prosperity. They are \nbehind us right now in many respects. They are on the move. They are \ncatching up with these policies, and we are looking to a future with \nthese other policies.\n  There is no reason to believe we will not go down that same road that \nour European neighbors and our Scandinavian neighbors have gone. That, \nof course, will put us in an extremely vulnerable position when the \nbaby boomers start retiring and all of our social services are flooded \nwith those numbers. We are not going to be able to make it. It is going \nto take all of our revenues. We all know that. We all dance around and \nmake sounds about a balanced budget because we are putting the numbers \ndown on the back of an envelope. You could put numbers on the back of \nan envelope, saying that future Congresses will cut when the time comes \nso, therefore, we have a balanced budget. It is the easiest thing in \nthe world to do on paper but everybody knows it is not going to happen. \nAnd when it does not happen, once again we will wonder why only 48 \npercent of the people in this Nation are even bothering to vote. It is \nbecause they feel there is a kind of joint, tacit understanding we will \nsay whatever is necessary and do whatever is necessary for temporary \npolitical advantage, telling people we are going to have something that \nwe are not really going to have, while continuing to spend because \nspending garners political support, political votes, and political \ncontributions, and hoping that the hatchet will fall on somebody else's \nwatch, years down the road.\n                                ____\n[[Page S1612]]\n\n  That is what this is all about. We can make arguments about various \namendments to this constitutional amendment. Some of them are well \nthought out, well reasoned and so forth. But they avoid the hard \nquestion. Are we going to limit ourselves?\n  Again, people say we do not need to mess with the Constitution in \norder to do that because we have it within our means to do the right \nthing. By that logic, we should not have to have the first amendment. \nWe have it in our means not to pass a law abridging freedom of speech. \nAll we have to do is not do it. Yet, we decided that we ought to have a \nconstitutional amendment because we know historically, and our Founding \nFathers certainly knew, that there seemed to be a tendency--I ask \nunanimous consent for another 3 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I yield 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Our Founding Fathers knew historically governments like \nto pass laws abridging freedom of speech. They knew historically that \ngovernments like to pass laws or carry out activities that constitute \nillegal searches and seizures, and that is why we came up with the \nfourth amendment. Governments historically like to do things that we \ndecided a long time ago that we don't want them to do.\n  What has history shown with regard to our ability to pass a balanced \nbudget, or our ability to restrain spending? If we have any track \nrecord at all, it is one that is clear as can possibly be and that is \nwe do not have that ability, we do not have that will in order to do \nthat.\n  Interestingly and parenthetically, after it was over with, in Q and \nA, Senator Packwood was asked, ``Senator Packwood, where do we get that \nwill?\"\n  He thought for a minute and said, ``I am reluctantly coming to the \nconclusion that the only thing that will cause it will be term \nlimits.''\n  But that is a debate for another day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have before us an amendment that \ncontains three separate changes to the balanced budget amendment. I do \nnot believe that any of these three changes would be appropriate. I \ndon't think they are wise or necessary, and so I have to oppose Senator \nTorricelli's amendment.\n  Let me add that all of these things, at least in concept, have \nalready been rejected by the Senate. There is no reason to adopt them \nnow.\n  The first change in the amendment would allow for a waiver of the \nbalanced budget rule by a majority vote in any year where the United \nStates is in a period of economic recession or significant economic \nhardship.\n  Mr. President, this portion of the Torricelli amendment is similar to \nthe Durbin amendment that the Senate defeated by an overwhelming 64 to \n35 vote just 2 weeks ago. The reasons it was rejected apply to the \nTorricelli amendment as well. In fact, they may apply with greater \nforce, as this language is more permissive and less clear than was the \nDurbin amendment.\n  The terms used in this amendment are undefined. The determination of \n``an economic recession,'' or ``significant economic hardship,'' could \neasily be manipulated by a spendthrift Congress as a way to avoid the \ndiscipline of the balanced budget amendment. Nearly anything could be \nseen as a significant economic hardship if considered from a certain \npoint of view. It is important to note that even during times of \nnational economic prosperity, some regions may experience localized \ndownturns. This proposal could allow such regional hardships to justify \nwaiving the balanced budget amendment and giving the country deficits \nat the exact time it should be running surpluses.\n  Thus, the amendment, I am sorry to say, would create a huge loophole, \na giant loophole, that would swallow the balanced budget rule. It is \nalso important to note that if the balanced budget amendment is waived \nfor a session, it is waived for all spending in that year. In other \nwords, the amendment would permit deficit spending for any number of \nprojects that are in no way related to the so-called significant \neconomic hardship.\n  Just remember President Clinton's 1993 attempt to push through a \nmultibillion-dollar emergency stimulus boondoggle under the guise of \ntrying to end a recession which had, in fact, already ended. Mr. \nPresident, if you take your finger out of the hole in the dike, then \nthe whole town can be flooded.\n  One of the arguments made in favor of this proposal is that without \nit, the balanced budget amendment will somehow inhibit the functions of \nthe so-called automatic stabilizers. I have spoken extensively on this \nissue, and I think it is clear that the importance of automatic \nstabilizers has been overstated and, in any case, the balanced budget \namendment will not inhibit their functioning.\n  Moreover, this amendment does not respond to the concerns raised \nabout the automatic stabilizers. It simply allows Congress to avoid the \nbalanced budget by a lower threshold. Put simply, this proposal is a \nloophole and should be rejected, as I hope it will be, just as a \nsimilar proposal was overwhelmingly rejected a couple of weeks ago.\n\n  The next change this amendment would make to the balanced budget \namendment would be to permit a waiver by a simple majority when the \nUnited States ``faces an imminent and serious military threat to \nnational security.'' If this proposal sounds familiar to my colleagues, \nit is because it is the same amendment that Senator Dodd proposed about \n2 weeks ago. That amendment was discussed thoroughly and soundly \ndefeated by a vote of 64 to 36.\n  This provision would permit a waiver if the United States merely \nfaces a threat. I understand what military conflict is. It involves \nshooting. But the notion of a mere threat is far more pliable. Indeed, \never since the advent and proliferation of nuclear weapons, it could be \ncogently argued that the United States ``faces an imminent and serious \nmilitary threat to national security'' every minute of every day. Thus, \nanyone who seeks refuge from the tough choices necessary to balance the \nbudget could invoke this threat and waive the balanced budget rule if \nthis provision is incorporated into this balanced budget amendment.\n  In short, Mr. President, this proposal is another huge loophole, or \nwould create a potentially huge loophole. Its effect is to weaken and \nconfuse the standard by which the balanced budget amendment may be \nwaived and, thus, it would weaken the balanced budget amendment. It \nshould be rejected, as it was before.\n  The third change that the amendment of my friend from New Jersey \nwould make would be to exempt spending on capital items from the \nbalanced budget rule. Similar proposals were contained in the Feinstein \namendment that the Senate just rejected only a few moments ago.\n  One part of this proposal is that the definition of receipts, instead \nof excluding all funds derived from borrowing, would now exclude only \nthose derived from ``net borrowing and the disposition of major public \nphysical capital assets.'' Outlays still include repayment of debt \nprincipal, but also would exclude ``those dedicated to a capital \nbudget.''\n  While I am not entirely clear on the purpose or full ramifications of \nthe net borrowing provision from its placement, it appears to take \naccount of depreciation of the current year's capital or economic \nincome of an item in the capital budget. It might perhaps have other \neffects. In any event, it might artificially make receipts seem higher, \nas a matter of accounting, than they really are. That, in turn, could \nallow future Congresses to avoid a three-fifths vote in some years \nwhere there is a deficit by manipulation of the net borrowing provision \nof this amendment. I expressed concerns about this language when my \ncolleague from New Jersey proposed it in the Judiciary Committee. Those \nconcerns have increased now that he has expanded the exception from \nwhat it was in his committee amendment. Depreciation is a highly \nmalleable concept which could allow\n\n[[Page S1613]]\n\nsubstantial gaming of this provision. Additionally, this proposal would \nnot count the proceeds from the sale of capital assets. I do not \nunderstand why we would limit commonsense flexibility in this way.\n  The next change this amendment would make would be to exclude \n``investments in major public physical capital that provides long-term \nbenefits'' from the definition of outlays. Mr. President, what does \nthis mean? How big must an investment be to be considered major? How \nfar into the future must benefits be realized for the investment to be \nconsidered long term? Is a health program for children physical because \nchildren are an asset?\n  I could go on for hours on the interpretation, or the potential \ninterpretations, this huge loophole would make and allow. Exempting \ncapital budgets from the balanced budget amendment opens up a \ntremendous loophole in the amendment. There would be powerful \nincentives for Congress and the President to balance the budget by \nredefining more programs as capital expenditures.\n  A gimmick capital budget exemption could actually endanger capital \ninvestments, as fake investments crowd out real capital investments. \nThe most basic problem with that is that all discussions of capital \naccounts are that there is no clear standard definition of a capital \nbudget. So no one knows what expenditures will fall within that \ndefinition. Attempts to limit the reach of the capital budget \ndefinition are largely exercises in futility, because the terms are \ninherently malleable.\n  Creative budgeters can find a way to get more spending into that \ncapital category.\n  Just yesterday the President recognized these activities and created \na Capital Budget Commission to study whether the Federal Government \nshould implement a capital budgeting procedure, since many in his \nadministration, including the Secretary of Treasury, think it would be \nhorrible to implement a capital budget procedure from the Federal \nstandpoint.\n  One of the primary duties of this Commission will be to report on the \nappropriate definition of capital budgets including ``use of capital \nfor the Federal Government itself or the economy at large; ownership by \nthe Federal Government or some other entity; defense and nondefense \ncapital; physical capital and intangible or human capital; distinctions \namong investments in and for current, future, and retired workers, \ncapital to increase productivity and capital to enhance the quality of \nlife; and existing definitions of capital for budgeting.''\n  Gee, that covers everything. It just means that the balanced budget \namendment would be a worthless piece of paper--with this amendment, it \nwould become a worthless piece of the Constitution.\n  This list of possible items to be included certainly suggests the \ndifficulties in defining capital budgets and limiting the exceptions to \nthe balanced budget amendment. Yet, today we are asked to enshrine some \nform of capital budgets in the Constitution before this Commission has \neven started its work.\n  To be honest with you, nobody should be deceived. I think we are \ngoing through what we went through before when they needed a vote and \nformed a Commission to get that vote, and then totally ignored the \nfindings of the Commission afterward. There is nobody in this \nadministration that really believes in capital budgets for the Federal \nGovernment, or at least I do not know of anybody. And I have seen \nplenty of evidence that they do not believe in the use of capital \nbudgets and that it is inappropriate to use them for the Federal \nGovernment. So it is just another attempt to try to defeat the balanced \nbudget amendment by the White House. And I do not think anybody fails \nto understand that who has been around here for any period of time.\n  The definitional problems inherent in capital budgeting are made \nclear in President Clinton's proposed fiscal year 1998 budget. In it, \nthe OMB, that is, the Office of Management and Budget, lists four broad \ncategories of programs that may or may not be considered capital \nexpenditures, ranging from physical assets owned by the Federal \nGovernment to social investment including nutrition programs, health \ncare, and drug rehabilitation, among other social welfare spending. \nThat is taken from the ``Office of Management and Budget, Analytical \nPerspectives, Proposed FY 1998 Budget,'' at page 101. Even within those \nfour broad categories, there are questions about which programs should \nbe included. It is particularly inappropriate to place capital \nbudgeting in the Constitution when there is no agreement on what \nconstitutes a capital budget. Nor is there likely to be agreement after \nthe so-called suddenly created Commission does its work.\n  This concern has been echoed by the Congressional Budget Office in \nthe testimony of Robert Hartman before the House Subcommittee on \nEconomic Development in 1993. He stated the following:\n\n       Establishing a capital budget imposes a significant risk of \n     increasing Government consumption by reducing budget \n     discipline and encouraging the reclassification of operating \n     expenditures as investment.\n\n  Now, put another way, capital budgets are a loophole which could \nreduce budgetary discipline. The very last thing our children need is \nfor us to have less budgetary discipline.\n  Mr. Hartman continued his criticism of capital budgeting by noting \nthat the Federal Government is not constrained by the normal \ndisciplinary factors that face most potential borrowers. Most people \nwho want to borrow must demonstrate to the bank a reasonable likelihood \nthat the investment will pay off, so that the bank can judge the risk \nof the investment.\n\n       [T]he Federal Government--with the sovereign power to tax \n     and create money--faces little discipline from lenders, who \n     are assured of being repaid independent of the productivity \n     of the Government's investment. The restraint that does exist \n     is almost entirely internal and must be self-imposed. That \n     was Robert Hartman.\n\n  You know, we have seen, Mr. President, what happens when Congress \ntries to discipline itself. I think the best illustration I could give \nis standing right here, 28 straight undisciplined, unbalanced budgets.\n  The fact is, these two stacks represent 28 solid straight years of \nunbalanced budgets. Yeah, we have people coming in here and saying, we \ncan just do this. All we have to do is vote. This is the kind of \ndiscipline that we have without the balanced budget amendment. I tell \nyou this. If we do not pass a balanced budget amendment, these two \nstacks are going to go to the ceiling of this Chamber and beyond \nbecause there is no way that there is going to be the fiscal discipline \nthat really is needed. We have 28 straight years of unbalanced budgets.\n  In the absence of external discipline, borrowing choices may not be \nmade on economic grounds. Borrowing can instead become a source of \nseemingly unlimited money from which Congress could fund any special \ninterest with sufficient political clout. It is exactly these types of \nperverse incentives that have gotten us into $5.3 trillion of debt.\n  Building on the testimony of Robert Hartman, CBO has noted that:\n\n       [The Federal Government] Unlike private investment that is \n     guided by market considerations, political factors may \n     dominate the choice of public investment projects.\n\n  That is a nice way of saying what financial markets expert David \nMalpass stated as part of his testimony before the Judiciary Committee \nlast month, regarding a Federal capital budget exemption:\n\n       One person's capital investment is another person's pork-\n     barreling.\n\n  The Washington Post was even less diplomatic in an editorial that was \nhighly critical of capital budgeting when the idea was floated during \nthe Reagan administration. This is what the Washington Post said about \ncapital budgets:\n\n       The concept of a capital budget, applied to the Federal \n     Government, is pure fakery. It is the resort of an \n     administration that, finding the realities of the budget \n     intractable, wants to fuzz up the numbers. . . . To introduce \n     capital budgeting into the Federal accounts would create such \n     wide realms of discretion, and such sponginess of the \n     figures, that a diligent budget director could bring the \n     deficit out at any number he chose.\n\n  Well, as you can see, the Clinton administration joined the consensus \nagainst debt-financed capital budgeting when it stated in the \nPresident's 1998 budget document:\n\n       . . . the rationale for borrowing to finance . . . \n     investment is not persuasive. . . . A capital budget is not a \n     justification to relax current and proposed budget \n     constraints.\n\n  The proposed budget constraints in the balanced budget amendment most \ncertainly should not be relaxed.\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\n  They further suggested that the Government borrowing crowds out \nprivate use of that capital which has offsetting negative effects on \nthe overall economy and the return of the Government's investment.\n  Let me add, that the Capital Budget Commission that the President \nannounced yesterday specifically did not authorize the consideration of \ndeficit-funded capital budgets. The administration clearly appears to \nbe opposed to such proposals. But that is exactly what my friend from \nNew Jersey's amendment encourages. I may not object to having a capital \nbudget that is funded out of annual tax receipts, but it would be a \nrisky gimmick to have debt-funded capital budgets which nearly \neverybody agrees should not be enshrined into our beloved Constitution.\n  Mr. President, the nonpartisan General Accounting Office has also \nfound fault with the notion of debt financing of capital budgeting. In \na 1992 study by the GAO, entitled ``Prompt Action Necessary to Prevent \nLong-term Damage to the Economy,'' the GAO on capital budgets said:\n\n       The creation of explicit categories for governmental \n     capital and developmental investment expenditures should not \n     be viewed as a license to run deficits to finance these \n     categories. In the short run, both consumption and investment \n     goods use economic resources, and deficit financing for \n     either will absorb resources that would otherwise be \n     available for private investment. Deficits also raise Federal \n     interest costs, regardless of the source of the deficit . . . \n     the choice between spending for investment and spending for \n     consumption should be seen as the setting of priorities \n     within an overall fiscal constraint, not as a reason for \n     relaxing that constraint and permitting a larger deficit.\n\n  In other words, capital expenditures should be kept inside the \nbalanced budget role of the amendment, something that my friend's \namendment would not do.\n  Now, Mr. President, OMB, GAO, and CBO have all expressed serious \nreservations about implementing a debt-financed capital budget in even \na statutory manner. Yet this amendment would enshrine it in the \nConstitution. Proponents of capital budgets have suggested that because \nStates rely on capital budgets to finance depreciable investment \nexpenditures, the Federal Government should likewise be able to account \nfor such expenditures separately from its main operating budget.\n  The simple fact is, Mr. President, that the Federal budget, unlike \nState budgets, is sufficiently large to handle capital expenditures. \nThe Federal budget for fiscal year 1997 is projected to exceed $1.6 \ntrillion. Of that we will spend approximately $21 billion in direct \nFederal outlays for what the President's budget defines as nondefense, \nphysical capital investment, the category most analogous to State \ngovernment or private capital budgets. That is a mere 1.3 percent of \nthe total Federal budget for that year. There is no reason why these \nrelatively small investment expenditures cannot compete with other \nbudget priorities under the stricture of the balanced budget amendment.\n  The fact is that the Federal Government does not need capital \nbudgeting as much as smaller entities because it commands such a large \nbudget. The analogy to capital budgeting by businesses or States is \ninept because the Federal Government is not subject to the same checks \nas either private businesses or State and local institutions or \ngovernments.\n  Private businesses are disciplined by markets. State and local \ngovernment capital budgeting is subject to bond ratings. These checks \non the abuse of capital budgets will not exist under a Federal capital \nbudget, making it far more likely that a Federal capital budget would \nbe abused. CBO has observed, and let me just quote them,\n\n       The main difficulty with relying on Government investment \n     spending is that unlike private investment that is guided by \n     market considerations, political factors may dominate the \n     choice of the public investment projects.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, all three proposals in the amendment of my friend \nfrom New Jersey have already been debated, all have been rejected \nduring this debate, two of them in stand-alone amendments. The last \nthing we need to do is weaken the rules requiring a balanced budget. We \nhave 28 years of unbalanced budgets here to show that.\n  Under the Torricelli amendment, we would absolutely be expecting more \nof the same. There is no question about it. I know the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey, and I know that he wants to get spending under \ncontrol. I know that he is sincere in bringing this amendment forth. \nLiterally, it would open up so many doors to violating the balanced \nbudget rule that I have to oppose it, I reluctantly have to oppose it.\n  What we need is a straightforward amendment like we have, like Senate \nJoint Resolution 1, the amendment that most of us are fighting for so \nhard, an amendment without risky gimmicks and without loopholes. Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 is such an amendment. It has been carefully drafted \nover many years and represents a balanced, bipartisan, bicameral \napproach, and it is the only way that we can return fiscal \nresponsibility and sanity to this Government. I am convinced of that, \nand I think there is no question the vast majority of our Senators are \nconvinced of it. The question is, can we get 67 votes in order to pass? \nI believe we can. I have faith that we can. I think this is the last \nchance. This is the only amendment that has any chance of passage for \nthe Congress. It is the last chance to do it, and it really is coming \ndown to just one vote.\n  Now, I pray with all my heart that we will be able to pass it here. I \ndo not know what they will do in the House. I suspect if we pass it \nhere, it will have momentum going to the House, and I expect it to be \npassed there. I expect to pass it here.\n  I do not want to spend any more time on this amendment. I have done \nthe best I can to explain why I cannot support it and why I am asking \nmy colleagues not to support it. Yet I understand that it is a serious \namendment, and I appreciate the seriousness of my colleague from New \nJersey. He is on our committee. He played a significant role during the \ndebate of this matter in the committee, and I respect him.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey yield me 5 minutes of his time?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I have sat on this floor today and listened carefully \nto the distinguished Senator from New Jersey as he explained his \namendment and as he has recounted the reasons for his having offered \nthe amendment. I see no other Senator on the floor other than perhaps \nMr. Hatch, the distinguished manager of the amendment, who sat through \nthe entirety of Mr. Torricelli's speech.\n  Mr. President, I say that to say this: The speech by the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey was one of the most thoughtful, \nmost thought provoking, most reasonable speeches that I have heard on \nany subject, and particularly on the subject matter of the resolution \nthat is before the Senate. One could not listen to Mr. Torricelli \nwithout immediately knowing that a great deal of work and thought and \nagonizing went into that speech.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is the one Senator whose vote has not yet \nbeen announced. We do not know how the Senator from New Jersey is going \nto vote, and that realization in itself would be indicative that he \nmust have spent some tormenting, agonizing moments in the preparation \nof that speech. I am going to vote for the amendment that has been \noffered by Mr. Torricelli because I think it is a needed amendment. \nWhether the Senator, in the final analysis, casts his vote for the \nconstitutional amendment or against the constitutional amendment is \nbeside the point here at the moment. I respect the Senator for the \nthought that he has invested in this speech, and I admire him for that.\n  I would have understood Henry Clay, who was a proponent of the great \nAmerican system, to have made the kind of speech that has been made by \nthe Senator from New Jersey. I would have understood Webster, in his \ndebate with Hayne, on January 26 and 27, 1830--he spoke along the same \nline, saying that the people of New England did not recognize \nboundaries of rivers or lines of latitude, or mountains, as boundaries \nto their political patriotism. He thought that if an investment in \ninfrastructure in South Carolina, for\n\n[[Page S1615]]\n\nexample, would benefit the Nation, it was a matter great enough for him \nas a Senator from New England to support. The Old Cumberland Road was a \nproject that was supported by Henry Clay. They recognized the necessity \nfor building up the Nation's infrastructure. They were looking not just \nat the present, but they were also looking at the future.\n  Now, when they propose investments in infrastructure, investments in \nrailroads, investments in canals, investments in bridges and highways, \nit seems to me that our friends on the other side cannot have it both \nways. I have listened to their speeches, and they support, they say, \ndoing the same thing that the States do--having a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. We have heard them say over and over \nagain, ``Let's do what the States do. The Federal Government should do \nwhat the States do. We need a constitutional amendment to the \nConstitution that will force us to do what the States do, and the \nStates have a constitutional amendment.'' They have amendments in their \nconstitution or they have it written into the constitution that they \nhave to balance their budgets.\n  The proponents don't bother to explain that States have both a \ncapital budget and an operating budget. They don't bother to explain \nthat. The people who listen to this debate are to take it on faith that \nwe are not talking about apples and oranges, but we are talking about \napples and apples.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield on that one point?\n  Mr. BYRD. If I may, I want to ask the Senator from Utah a question. \nThey say, ``Let's do like the States do. They have constitutions that \nrequire them to balance their budgets.'' But the proponents of this \nconstitutional amendment don't bother to enlighten their listeners and \nreaders to the fact that the States have capital budgets which they \ndon't balance every year.\n  So now the distinguished Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli], \nseeks to meet that argument and put, indeed, into the Constitution \nlanguage that will allow the Federal Government to operate on two \nbudgets--an operating budget and a capital budget--so that the Federal \nGovernment will be, indeed, operating like the State governments, it \nwill have a Constitution insofar as capital budgeting is concerned, \nlike the State governments. It will continue to have an operating \nbudget, and it will also have a capital budget. But it cannot have a \ncapital budget, under the language of the proposed constitutional \namendment. Section 1 provides against that. Section 1 says: ``Total \noutlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that \nfiscal year.''\n  So, right there, in section 1, as plain as the nose on your face, we \nwould be precluded from passing a law once this constitutional \namendment is adopted here and ratified by the States--the Federal \nGovernment would be precluded from having a capital budget. Well, the \nSenator from New Jersey seeks to remedy that. He seeks to provide that \nthe Federal Government will have two budgets, so that indeed the \nFederal Government would be on a par with the States.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may ask a question of \nanother Senator without losing the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Utah, \nhow is it that the proponents are able to talk out of both sides of \ntheir mouths? They say, on the one hand, that the Federal Government \nshould be like the States; it should have in its Constitution a \nprovision for a balanced budget; the Federal Government should operate \non a balanced budget. Now, the States all have operating budgets and \ncapital budgets----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes allotted to the Senator from \nWest Virginia have expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I yield 5 more minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend. How can my friends on the Republican \nside--and let me say that I have great admiration for the Senator from \nUtah. He has stood here day after day and labored in the vineyard and \ncarried the burden of the arguments. I marvel at his equanimity, his \npatience, and his characteristic courtesy. But how can the Senator \nargue, on the one hand, that the Federal Government should be like the \nStates, that it should be constitutionally required to balance its \nbudget, but he opposes letting the Federal Government be like the \nStates when he opposes having the Federal Government operate not only \non an operating budget but also with a capital budget?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I think the Senator raises a very good point, which \nis that there are some who say that we ought to balance the budget like \nthe States. Well, there are 44 States that have balanced budget \namendments. First, that is a difference there. We don't have a balanced \nbudget amendment in the Constitution; they do in theirs. Second, some \nStates do have capital budgets and, therefore, are different. But the \nreason they are different is because States don't print the money. We \nprint the money. We have a huge budget. They have to live within \ncertain constraints. So it isn't exactly alike, there is no question. \nWhat we are requiring here is the Federal Government--I mentioned in my \nremarks that in the fiscal 1998 budget are some $20 billion-plus, less \nthan 1.6 percent of the total budget, that would be used for capital \nbudgets.\n  The Federal Government has such a massive budget that it doesn't need \ncapital budgets. Most budgeteers will say don't do it to the Federal \nGovernment, for a wide variety of reasons. Let me read from this \nbecause I think it applies directly to what my friend has raised. He \nalways raises good questions, and this is certainly a good one. This \nbook is entitled ``Analytical Perspectives: Budget of the United States \nGovernment, Fiscal Year 1998,'' prepared by the administration.\n  In one section here, it says:\n\n       State borrowing to finance investment, like business \n     borrowing, is subject to limitations that do not apply to \n     Federal borrowing. Like business borrowing, it is constrained \n     by the credit market's assessment of the State's capacity to \n     repay. Furthermore, it is usually designated for specified \n     investments, and it is almost always subject to \n     constitutional limits or referendum requirements.\n\n  We are not subject to referendum requirements. We are not subject to \nconstitutional limits. If we had the amendment of the Senator from New \nJersey and that became part of this constitutional amendment, we would \nnot have the same designated, specified investment routine. You could \ndo almost anything you wanted to do with the language in that \namendment. Of course, there is no bond rating that can rate the Federal \nGovernment. I think that is why we don't have the same free market or \neven economic marketplace ideas that literally would constrain the \nFederal Government.\n  I have to also say that the amendment of the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey literally opens up the door to anything. You could call \nanything capital budgeting, including perhaps even physical welfare \nmatters which, of course, when you think of capital budgeting you think \nof roads and bridges. Frankly, you could just put anything in there. \nThat is why this language is so broad that it can't be put into the \nConstitution because there is no definition. It could be used in any \nway that the proponents of more spending want to use it. There would be \nno limitation of restraint. There are no referendums that you could use \nto stop impropriety and excessive spending and vesting, if you will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes allotted to the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question from \nthe Senator from West Virginia and for a question from the Democratic \nfloor manager?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair observes that the time is under the \ncontrol of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the distinguished Senator from Utah \nwill exercise his usual fairness and charge a little of the time to \nhimself.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be glad to do that. If my colleague gets short on \ntime, I will try to accommodate him.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am happy to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia. I enjoyed listening to the Senator from Utah. But I would \nenjoy it much more if I was listening to him on my own time.\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is available to this side, Mr. President, of \nthe argument, and how much time to that side of the argument?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 41 minutes and \n2 seconds, and the Senator from Utah has 44 minutes and 34 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Democratic floor manager \ncould have 5 minutes?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I listened to the question of the \nSenator from West Virginia and the response, I do not believe that the \nquestion was fully answered. I say to my good friend from Utah that he \nand I have debated this matter in committee now for several years. We \nhave debated it on the floor of the Senate for the past couple of \nweeks, which also feels like several years. We have gone back and \nforth.\n  Mr. HATCH. Indeed, it does.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask us to think back to 1804 when Thomas Jefferson \nfinanced the Louisiana Purchase. He spent, I believe, $15 million at \nthat time, which he had to borrow. Put that $15 million, I say to my \nfriend from New Jersey, in today's dollars and it would amount to $225 \nbillion. He had to borrow the equivalent of $225 billion in 1 year for \nthat transaction. We have not had a deficit as high as $225 billion, I \ndo not think since the last deficit during the Bush administration. In \nfact, $225 billion exceeds all annual Federal deficits except for those \nin the last 2 years of the Bush administration.\n  I think that we ought to commend Senator Torricelli for the \nconstructive way in which he has acted in this debate. I agree with \nwhat the preeminent historian of the Senate, the Senator from West \nVirginia, said when he spoke of the debates of Clay and others.\n  I also agree that this amendment and this debate shows a great deal \nof thought from the Senator from New Jersey. He was thoughtful and \nserious during our committee proceedings and debate, as well. He has \nconsistently shown that he has thought hard about and wrestled with \nthis matter. I hope everyone, whether they are for or against his \namendment, will listen to his speech. Whether they are for or against \nthis constitutional amendment, I hope everyone will seriously consider \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey. The Nation's \nleading economists all agree that a capital budget is an essential part \nof the State experience with balanced budget requirements, and that the \nomission of a capital budget in this proposed constitutional amendment \nis a major flaw. Over 1,000 economists, including 11 Nobel laureates, \nnoted in a statement of opposition announced by the Senator from West \nVirginia that you should have this. It is a major flaw in this whole \npoorly written Senate Joint Resolution 1. Unfortunately, as I have said \nbefore, this resolution is one that is written more for a bumper \nsticker than it is for the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica, the greatest Constitution ever.\n  I wish the manager, my good friend from Utah, and his cosponsors \nwould abandon their blood oath of not allowing amendments and consider \nthe merits of this suggested amendment.\n  All Senators should consider favorably Senator Torricelli's effort to \ncorrect dangerous aspects of the underlying proposed constitutional \namendment.\n\n\n                           Capital Budgeting\n\n  Senator Torricelli forcefully pointed out during the Judiciary \nCommittee deliberations on the underlying measure that we as a nation \nare suffering from a capital investment crisis. In 1965, more than 6 \npercent of Federal expenditures were invested in infrastructure such as \nroads, bridges, ports, and mass transit systems. By 1992, that share of \ncapital investment had fallen by more than half to about 3 percent of \nour Federal budget and this year it will approach barely 2 percent.\n  At the same time as our infrastructure funding has been shrinking, \nour Nation's needs have continued to grow. The result is that we are \nbecoming a nation in disrepair. For instance, more than a quarter of a \nmillion miles of roads need repair and more than 25 percent of our \nbridges have exceeded their life span.\n  This failure to maintain adequate infrastructure is hurting our \ncompetitiveness in the global economy. We are competing against other \ncountries with the foresight to repair their roads and bridges, \nmodernize their transit systems, maintain their ports, build new \nschools and make the investments in telecommunications infrastructure \nthat are the keys to success in today's global competition. The United \nStates is dead last among the G-7 nations in public infrastructure \ninvestment as a percentage of gross domestic product.\n  Senator Torricelli is correct that we must reverse this trend and \nmake the long-term investments needed to support a strong economy. I am \nglad to see President Clinton calling for study and action on capital \nbudgeting. We must be able to invest in capital improvements--and, in \nmy view, in education--if we are to give our children their best chance \nto compete and win in the coming century.\n  The underlying proposed constitutional amendment prohibits budgeting \nfor capital expenditures. Instead it would include all expenditures on \nan annual basis for purposes of calculating balance. All expenditures, \nwhether the equivalent of operating expenses or capital investments, \nare tallied the same for purposes of the underlying proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The sponsors and proponents of this measure refuse to permit any \nexception and future Congresses will be forever barred from solving our \ninfrastructure crisis by creating a capital budget for long-term \ninvestments.\n  The majority report is silent on this important subject. The \nCommittee's past hearings, however, establish an extensive record in \nsupport of maintaining a separate capital budget. Herbert Stein, of the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute and former economic adviser to President \nNixon; Edward V. Regan, of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute and \nformer New York State Controller; and Dr. Fred Bergsten, on behalf of \nthe bipartisan Competitiveness Policy Council and former Assistant \nSecretary of the Treasury during the Carter administration; differed on \nthe wisdom of enacting a constitutional amendment on the budget but all \nagreed on one thing: If such an amendment were to be considered it \nshould separate capital investments for any annual balance requirement.\n  Nonetheless, when the Judiciary Committee had the opportunity last \nmonth to consider amendments that would have allowed for a separate \nbudget for capital investments, it rejected them. Senator Torricelli \noffered a substitute amendment to establish a Federal capital budget \nbut the committee rejected the Torricelli amendment by an 8 to 9 vote \nwith all Republican members who voted, voting against capital \nbudgeting.\n  This inflexibility is one of the principal reasons that President \nClinton opposes this constitutional amendment on budgeting. The \nPresident stated:\n\n       We must give future generations the freedom to formulate \n     the Federal budget in ways they deem most appropriate. For \n     example, some believe that the Federal Government should do \n     what many State governments do: adopt a balanced operating \n     budget and a separate capital budget. Under this \n     constitutional balanced budget proposal, the government \n     would be precluded from doing so.\n\n  During the committee's January 17 hearing, Robert Greenstein of the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities explained:\n\n       What families do when they balance their budget is families \n     say that all of their income, including money they borrow, \n     equals all the cash they pay out. Families borrow money when \n     they purchase a house through a mortgage, whey they buy a \n     car, and especially when they send a child to college. If \n     families had to operate on the basis that this amendment \n     does, they would have to pay for all of college education out \n     of the current year's income, all of the entire cost of a \n     home, not the down payment, the whole thing, out of the \n     current year's income. Nobody operates that way.\n\n  The actions of Thomas Jefferson as President, as opposed to his oft-\nquoted ruminations about the evils of public debt, are also instructive \nbut ignored by the proponents of the underlying measure. In 1804, \nPresident Jefferson had the United States borrow $15 million, in 1804 \ndollars, by selling bonds to finance the Louisiana Purchase. That \namount approximates more than $225 billion in 1993 dollars and exceeds \nevery Federal budget deficit except for the final 2 years of the Bush \nadministration.\n  Was President Jefferson wrong to invest in the Louisiana Territory \nthat provided this country with 15 States?\n\n[[Page S1617]]\n\nOf course not. But had the provisions of Senate Joint Resolution 1 been \nincluded in the Constitution in the early 1800's, our Nation's westward \nexpansion might well have ended at the Mississippi River.\n  Under this proposed constitutional amendment, the failure to permit a \ncapital budget would have severe consequences by discouraging long-term \ninvestment and ignoring our infrastructure crisis. Just as a budget \ndeficit unfairly harms future generations so, too, does the failure to \ndifferentiate capital investments from operating and consumption \nexpenditures. The inevitable result will be less investment in our \ncountry's future, pressure to operate through inefficient leasing \npractices and gimmickry.\n  The Torricelli amendment should reduce the pressure to engage in some \nof the gimmickry otherwise likely to be occasioned by this proposed \nconstitutional amendment. It may also result in more accurate \ndisclosure to Americans about how their money is being spent and how \nthe budget is being balanced.\n  Not many of us could afford homes if we could not borrow and get a \nmortgage on our home. When we talk about balancing our family budgets, \nwe do not normally mean that we should not invest in a house or a car. \nWe mean that we should not spend more every week or every month than we \ncan afford. We mean to include our mortgage and car payments but not \nthe full extent of the 5-, 15- or 30-year liability.\n  Likewise, small businesses and large corporations could not do \nbusiness is they could not borrow to meet their capital budget needs.\n  Most States with balanced budget amendments have separate capital \nbudgets, as well. I am told that number is 42 States. Indeed, I believe \nthat most States with balanced budget requirements obtain capital funds \nthat finance major capital projects by issuing long-term debt.\n  The Nation's leading economists agree that a capital budget is an \nessential part of the State experience with balanced-budget \nrequirements and that the omission of a capital budget in this proposed \nconstitutional amendment is a major flaw. Over 1,000 economists, \nincluding 11 Nobel laureates, noted in their January 30, 1997 \nstatement:\n\n       Unlike many State constitutions, which permit borrowing to \n     finance capital expenditures, the proposed Federal amendment \n     makes no distinction between capital investments and current \n     outlays. . . . The amendment would prevent Federal borrowing \n     to finance expenditures for infrastructure, education, \n     research and development, environmental protection, and other \n     investments vital to the Nation's future well-being.\n\n  The Torricelli amendment to allow capital budgeting is in keeping \nwith traditional notions of balancing our budgets.\n\n\n                            Military Threats\n\n  I further commend Senator Torricelli for including within his \namendment language to correct a dangerous flaw in the proposed \nconstitutional amendment. The underlying proposed constitutional \namendment requires the United States to be engaged in military conflict \nbefore a waiver may be obtained. Moreover, the Senate report's section-\nby-section on this language compounds the problem by indicating that \nonly military conflict that involve the actual use of military force \nmay serve as a basis for this waiver.\n  I hope that this is not what the authors, sponsors and proponents of \nthe underlying constitutional proposal truly intend, although their \nvotes to table the Dodd amendment seem to indicate that they mean what \nthey say. They are creating constitutional circumstances that make \nmilitary spending and preparations easier only when military force is \nactually used and military conflict ensures. Arming to deter aggression \nwould no longer be the preferred course, aiding allies in a conflict \nrather than dispatching U.S. military forces would no longer be as \nviable an alternative and rebuilding our military capabilities after a \nconflict would no longer be possible without a supermajority vote of \nthree-fifths of the Congress.\n  I cannot support such restrictive measures. I have spent much of my \ntime in the Senate working with Republican and Democratic \nadministrations to avoid the actual use of military force. This \namendment is written is such a way that it serves to encourage such \nuse. Nothing that would serve to place our men and women in harm's way \nmore quickly or would leave them less well equipped or prepared should \ngarner the support of this Senate.\n  I hope that all Senators will consider favorably Senator Torricelli's \neffort to correct this dangerous aspect of the underlying proposed \nconstitutional amendment and render it more consistent with the foreign \npolicy objectives and vision outlined last night by Senator Torricelli.\n  I urge the manager and the sponsors of the resolution to abandon \ntheir ``no amendments'' strategy and consider the merits of this \nsuggested amendment. Balancing the budget is important. But their \nunderlying proposal turns the world topsy-turvy by making that goal the \nbe-all and end-all of national policy without considering what a \nsupermajority requirement can mean to our Nation's security and \ndefense, to our foreign policy and our military preparedness.\n  As Senator Sarbanes has so eloquently reminded us, one historic \nexample points out the folly of such a supermajority requirements. In \nthe summer of 1941, Congress was confronted with extending the time of \nservice of those members of the armed services who had been drafted the \nyear before. With the prospect of war increasing, President Roosevelt, \nin a special message to Capitol Hill, asked Congress to declare a \nnational emergency that would allow the Army to extend the service of \ndraftees. Speaker Sam Rayburn had to twist arms in the well of the \nHouse of Representative to get the House to pass the measure regarding \nthe draft for World War II by just one vote, 203 to 202. It then passed \nthe Senate by a vote of 45 to 30.\n  The Nation was literally a few months away from the outbreak of World \nWar II. But neither the House nor the Senate vote would have met the \nsupermajority requirement in the underlying proposal. Even after the \nPresident had declared a national emergency, Congress could not muster \na supermajority vote in either body.\n\n\n                           Economic Recession\n\n  The third prong of the Torricelli amendment would allow the proposed \nconstitutional restrictions for end of the year balance to be waived in \nthe event of an economic recession or serious economic emergency. He is \nright on point. More than 1,000 of the Nation's most respected \neconomists, including 11 Nobel laureates, as well as the former chair \nof President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisors, the current and \nformer Federal Reserve Board Chairmen, and former Democrat and \nRepublican Directors of the Congressional Budget Office all agree that \nthe underlying proposal is unsound economic policy. They all agree that \nthe underlying proposal would hamper the Government's ability to cope \nwith economic downturns.\n  Economists and financial experts agree that the underlying proposal \nwill straitjacket the economy in hard times. It will hamstring the \nadjustment mechanisms that have been developed since the Great \nDepression to preserve jobs and restore the economy after a downturn. \nThe 1,060 economists and 11 Nobel laureates who are opposing the \nunderlying proposed constitutional amendment condemn it because it \nmandates perverse actions in the face of recessions.\n  If the economy takes a downturn and Americans are losing their jobs--\nas happened in the early 1990's--the underlying proposal makes it more \ndifficult for our Government to respond to the needs of working \nfamilies. As Treasury Secretary Rubin testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee:\n\n       A balanced budget amendment would subject the Nation to \n     unacceptable economic risks in perpetuity. . . . A balanced \n     budget amendment could turn slowdowns into recessions, and \n     recessions into more severe recessions or even depressions.\n\n  I am deeply concerned about the impact that the underlying proposal \nmight have on jobs for working families in Vermont and across the \ncountry during times of recession. As Secretary Rubin explained, the \nso-called automatic stabilizers in our economy would be ineffective \nunder the underlying proposal. These are mechanisms that have been \ndeveloped over the last 50 years to reduce the extremes of the ``boom-\nand-bust'' cycles. They are intended to prevent another Great \nDepression and have proven effective over time.\n\n[[Page S1618]]\n\n  Secretary Rubin testified:\n\n       [W]ithout automatic stabilizers, the Treasury Department \n     has estimated that unemployment in 1992 that resulted from \n     the 1990 recession might have hit 9 percent instead of 7.7 \n     percent, which would have been in excess of 1 million jobs \n     lost.\n\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently reiterated his \nopposition to the proposed constitutional amendment during questioning \nby Senator Lautenberg during his testimony before the Senate Budget \nCommittee. He urged the Senate Budget Committee to continue to \neliminate the deficit, but he joined Secretary Rubin and our Nation's \nleading economists in the conclusion that the underlying proposed \nconstitutional amendment places too many constraints on our economy.\n  Although the sponsors of the underlying measure repeatedly outline \nthe dangers of a budget deficit, they fail to address how the proposed \nconstitutional amendment will provide for the flexibility needed in \neconomic downturns without holding working families and hard hit \nregions hostage to a supermajority vote. This aspect of the Torricelli \namendment restores that flexibility by requiring a simple majority vote \nto respond to economic recessions and emergencies.\n  When he spoke last night in this historic Chamber, Senator Torricelli \nspoke about the proper role of Government and redefining its role \nwithout sacrificing our ability and ignoring our responsibilities to \nhelp our neighbors when they need help. He is right to offer this \nessential change in the underlying proposal to amend the Constitution.\n  A waiver of these provisions by a supermajority vote of three-fifths \nof both Houses of Congress is small comfort to America's working \nfamilies. Many national recessions start out in different regions of \nthe country. For example, the most recent recession hit New England \nfirst. What if citizens of New England, who have fewer Members of the \nHouse of Representatives than other regions of the country, needed \nhelp? Could they get Senators and Representatives from other States, \nwhich were still experiencing good times, to waive a constitutional \nbalanced budget requirement to help protect their livelihoods?\n  Prof. Robert Eisner of Northwestern University and past president of \nthe American Economic Association understood the economic problems \nunder the underlying proposed constitutional amendment when he recently \nwrote:\n\n       One need only recall the near-collapses, in recent years, \n     of the economies in New England, California and Texas. Who \n     would bail them out if their own tax revenues again declined \n     and there were surges of claims for unemployment benefits, \n     food stamps and general assistance?\n\n  Relief for economic recessions and emergencies must be flexible. \nUsually, a swift response from the Federal Government is needed to aid \nState and local relief efforts. Economic emergency relief by \nconstitutional supermajority mandate is a prescription for gridlock, \nnot swift action. When your State or region is hit by recession or \neconomic emergency, do you want critical Federal assistance to hang on \nthe whims of 41 Senators or 175 Representatives from other regions?\n  I find it ironic that the supporters of the underlying constitutional \namendment, who do not trust Congress to continue to reduce the deficit, \nargue that we should trust future Congresses to muster supermajority \nvotes in both bodies.\n  Our Founders rejected requirements of supermajorities. We should look \nto their sound reasons for rejecting supermajority requirements before \nwe impose on our most vulnerable citizens a three-fifths supermajority \nrequirement to provide them Federal relief from recessions and serious \neconomic emergencies. I believe this supermajority requirement would \nrecklessly endanger our economy and our democracy.\n  We do not need to theorize or speculate about the costs and risks. \nThe Nation got a taste of it just 2 years ago with the longest \nGovernment shutdown in history and a debt limit crisis that when on for \nmonths. In 1995, 165 Republican Members of the House of Representatives \npledged to refuse to vote for raising the debt limit, unless President \nClinton accepted their balanced budget plan. The Speaker of the House, \nNewt Gingrich, went along with this ultimatum, by declaring ``I am with \nthem * * * I do not care what the price is.'' As a result of this \nblackmail politics, the American people suffered through two Government \nshutdowns for a total of 27 days. In the 22 years I have served in the \nSenate, I have not seen an action more irresponsible by either \nDemocrats or Republicans.\n\n  Fortunately, the President stood up to this blackmail and the \nAmerican public convinced a majority in Congress to act responsibly. \nWho knows what would have happened under the supermajority votes \nrequired in the underlying proposal.\n  The supermajority requirement lowers the blackmail threshold, in the \nwords of some it its House sponsors. This three-fifths supermajority \nrequirement invites political blackmail and rewards extremism. If both \nthe House and Senate require three-fifths of their Members to agree to \nwaive the end of the year balance requirement or raise the debt limit, \nthen 40 percent plus one in either the House or the Senate could hold \nthe country hostage to their demands.\n  The House sponsors of this proposed constitutional amendment have \nacknowledged this folly. In a November 1996 paper on the underlying \nproposal, Representatives Dan Schaefer and Charles Stenholm wrote that \ntheir proposal would have the effect of ``lowering the `blackmail \nthreshold' * * * from 50 percent plus one in either body to 40 percent \nplus one * * *.'' These are the words of the House sponsors of the \nunderlying proposal, not mine.\n  As Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a \ndistinguished expert on Congress' ways, testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee, the underlying proposal's supermajority requirements would \npermit minority factions to extort pork barrel projects or extreme \nlegislation as their price.\n  Coming from a State with a congressional delegation of three Members, \nI know something about the rights of small States. Supermajority vote \nrequirements trample on the rights of small States and reward large \nones. In the House, a combination of Representatives from six large \nStates could hold a waiver hostage to their demands, even if the vast \nmajority of Representatives from 44 States were in agreement that a \nwaiver was justified.\n  Our Founders rejected such supermajority voting requirements on \nmatters within Congress' purview. Alexander Hamilton described \nsupermajority requirements as a poison that serves to substitute the \npleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or \ncorrupt junta to the regular deliberations and decisions of a \nrespectable majority. Such supermajority requirements reflect a basic \ndistrust not just of Congress, but of the electorate itself. I reject \nthat notion and am prepared to keep faith with and in the American \npeople. We should honor the fundamental principle of majority rule, a \nprinciple that has been enshrined in our Constitution for more than 200 \nyears, and a principle embodied in the Torricelli amendment.\n  Senator Torricelli has approached this matter with seriousness and \nsincerity. He is attempting to perfect the underlying proposal for a \nconstitutional amendment and cure several of its flaws.\n  When the Judiciary Committee considered this proposed constitutional \namendment last month, we did so on an expedited basis. Nonetheless, \nSenator Torricelli was a full participant at our hearings. He examined \nformer Acting Attorney General Stuart Gerson and Mr. Gerson conceded to \nhim that the underlying amendment presents the most likely situation in \nwhich congressional standing, which has never been recognized, might be \nrecognized and Mr. Gerson described to him the unfortunate Federal \nprecedent in which a Federal court ordered local taxes to be raised. I \nrecall his exchange with Senator Simon regarding the relationship of \nour national debt to our gross domestic product and how we compare \nfavorably with the other industrialized countries of Europe and the \nworld.\n  He continued his thoughtful approach to the proposed constitutional \namendment during our committee markup when he offered an amendment that \nChairman Hatch first praised, then defeated by casting a final and \ndeciding vote against it. At least at the committee we afforded members \nan opportunity to offer amendments and to obtain votes on those \namendments.\n\n[[Page S1619]]\n\n  This is one of the most important legislative matters we will \nconsider this Congress. It is a proposed amendment to our fundamental \ncharter, the United States Constitution. In my view, allowing \namendments, debating amendments and voting on amendments is an \nessential aspect of developing any legislation and, in particular, a \nproposed constitutional amendment.\n  Early in this debate the distinguished minority leader made the point \nthat we do not have the luxury of reexamining constitutional amendments \nas we would a statute. Once a constitutional amendment is passed, it is \nalmost impossible to revisit. Accordingly, it is essential that \nSenators have the opportunity to seek to improve the text of the \nproposed amendment. Even the witnesses called by the proponents of the \nunderlying measure acknowledged that it is not perfect, that it has \nshortcomings, and that its text could be improved. To do otherwise is \nto disregard our obligations to our constituents, the Constitution and \nthe future.\n  Senator Torricelli has come forward with a very important amendment. \nHe is most sincere and serious in this effort and he deserves the \ncourtesy and opportunity to have the Senate vote on the merits of his \namendment. Respected economists, the current Chairman and past Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Treasury, numerous \nwitnesses and the President of the United States have all noted that \nthe underlying proposal for a constitutional amendment runs the risk of \nstrait-jacketing the future, of creating military difficulties and \nreducing our ability to respond to international crises and of making \neconomic downturns deeper and turning recessions into depressions.\n  Here is a Senator who has come to this floor willing to put himself \non the line and debate, honestly debate, the critical issues affected \nby this amendment. In matters that affect our Nation's supreme law, we \nneed to vote consistent with our best judgment and our conscience as we \nrepresent those who elected us and entrusted us to make these votes. \nSenator Torricelli has offered this Senate, the people of New Jersey \nand this country his best judgment regarding how to improve this \nconstitutional proposal. Before we return to the economic and fiscal \npolicies of the Hoover era that led to the Great Depression, I urge the \nSenate be given an opportunity to vote on the Torricelli amendment on \nits merits.\n  I hope that the other side, which has rejected every amendment on \nSocial Security, on protecting working families or protecting \nchildren's programs from disproportionate cuts and on everything else--\nno matter how good the amendment might be--would not require their \nfollowers to leap blindly off the cliff of tabling motions but would \nallow them to listen to this debate and vote honestly on it.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has raised a very clear issue. Let me \ntell you right now, anybody who thinks the Louisiana Purchase was a \ngood idea ought to be listening to the Senator from New Jersey and \nsupporting him.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there may be some responsible economists \nwho are for putting capital budgets into the Federal Government's \nbudget process. I personally do not know of any. If there are, I do not \nthink that their arguments would stand up. To compare the State and the \nFederal Government, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia raises \na good issue. You can't fully compare State budgeting with Federal \nbudgeting. I agree with him. On the other hand, you can't say we should \nhave a capital budget in the Federal budget because it is clear that \nthe Federal Government doesn't operate like the States. We print the \nmoney. We don't have a referendum nor do we have a balanced budget \namendment that would restrain the spending. If you have these huge \nloopholes, whether you have a balanced budget amendment or not, it just \nwouldn't work. Plus you have 50 States where it is pretty tough for \nState legislators in an individual State with a balanced budget \namendment to fudge and fuzz up the language. In the Federal Government \nit is a lot easier. We just can't put this kind of language in there. \nIt is just that simple. And if you do that, then you have made a \nloophole, an undefined loophole that would allow any subsequent \nCongress that is irresponsible--and we have had 28 years of \nirresponsibility. I mean all you have to do is look at this stack of \nunbalanced budgets for the last 28 years, and headed higher. I have to \ntell you. Here is one which I am just now discussing which is certainly \ngoing higher, this 1998 budget. Without the balanced budget amendment \nwe are just lost. We are going to have more and more of this and less \nand less responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to take 2 or 3 minutes.\n  I want to close by again thanking the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey. I wish to compliment him. I think he has exposed a major flaw \nin the argument of the proponents. He has made it indubitably clear \nthat the proponents meet themselves in their arguments coming back. \nThey argue both ways, as I have already indicated, that the Federal \nGovernment should operate like the States on a balanced budget. Now, \nwhen the Senator from New Jersey seeks to put the Federal Government on \na par with the States and have a capital budget, on which almost all of \nthe States operate, then the proponents say, oh, no. My friend, Mr. \nHatch, says, oh, no, we do not want to do that. We do not want to put \nthat kind of thing in the Constitution. This is the glittering gewgaw--\n--\n  Mr. HATCH. Now, be nice. Be nice.\n  Mr. BYRD. The glittering gewgaw of glorified garbage that the \nproponents are seeking to nail into the Constitution.\n  But, Mr. President, my friend, Mr. Hatch, says, oh, we do not print \nthe money.\n  Well, that is true but that is not an answer to what we have been \ntalking about here and the need for a capital budget.\n  Let me just close by saying to my friend from Utah, who continues to \ngo over to his props, the books, I hope he will pause to explain that \nbeginning with Mr. Reagan, Mr. Reagan's administration, the total debt \nof the United States at that time was $997 billion. Going right down to \nthe close of September 30, 1981, which was the end of the last fiscal \nyear for which Mr. Carter was responsible, the total Federal debt was \njust under $1 trillion. But going right down to the end of the last \nfiscal year for which Mr. Bush was responsible, September 30, 1993, the \nFederal debt was $4.316 trillion.\n  Now, that will help to explain what is inside those budgets that are \nstacked on the Senator's desk. That would help to explain the great \ndifference between the debt as it stood accumulated after the first 192 \nyears of its existence under 39 administrations, 38 Presidents--one of \nthem, Grover Cleveland, served two terms which were separated--which \nwas slightly under $1 trillion----\n  Mr. HATCH. And $4.3 trillion.\n  Mr. BYRD. Slightly under $1 trillion for all of the administrations \ndown to the last minute of the fiscal year for which Mr. Carter was \nresponsible, and then comparing that figure, which was under $1 \ntrillion, with the massive debt of $4.316 trillion, down to the last \nminute of the last fiscal year for which Mr. Bush was responsible. I am \ntalking about the Reagan-Bush budgets. They are the largest part of \nthat massive pile of books there.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is true.\n  Mr. BYRD. It might be well to consider how much of that massive pile \nof books was debt that was encountered under the Reagan-Bush \nadministrations.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if I could answer that, I would be more \nthan happy to. First of all, these are not props. These are real books. \nThese are real unbalanced budgets, 28 of them.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is real debt.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is real debt. And let us just understand the basic \nprinciple of government. The President proposes, whoever that President \nmay be, but the Congress disposes.\n  To be honest with you, Reagan's tax cuts involved 40 percent growth \nin revenues more than they had predicted. But he had to deal primarily \nwith the House of Representatives where all money bills must originate, \ncontrolled by those who did not agree with him, who kept spending. And \nthat is Congress. And even those in the 1980's who\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\ndid not agree with President Reagan and wanted to spend more in \nCongress, even they should not be totally blamed for this because this \nall began basically with the Great Society programs that have been \ngoing out of control ever since. We now have almost two-thirds of the \nbudget in entitlement spending. I know President Reagan did not ask for \nthat. Neither did President Bush, and neither, I guess you can say, has \nPresident Clinton. I do not even think President Carter asked for that. \nWe did that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could finish. I would like to finish. I want to make \nthis point because the Senator has raised this.\n  We did that. Congress did that. Congress is responsible primarily for \nthis. I admit it could take some Presidential leadership from time to \ntime, too.\n  Mr. BYRD. And some Presidential vetoes.\n  Mr. HATCH. As well as some Presidential vetoes. That is true. I \nremember when President Ford used the veto some 60 times. He was vastly \ncriticized by his political opponents for what he did. Now, I think \nthere is plenty of blame for everybody involved--Presidents, but mostly \nCongress.\n  See, I am not particularly picking on Presidents today. I am picking \non us. The President can propose but we dispose. We are the ones who \ncreate these appropriations bills and these budget bills. We are the \nones who have done the spending. We are the ones who have failed to get \nentitlement spending under control. We are the ones who have failed to \nreform Medicaid and Medicare that are going into bankruptcy. All money \nbills have to originate in the House of Representatives, and during all \nof the Reagan years the House of Representatives was controlled \nprimarily by those of the liberal persuasion, in both parties I might \nadd. I suspect you could say the Senate was, also, if you added up the \nliberals versus moderates and conservatives. I think there were more \nliberals in almost every year of the Reagan administration in both \nHouses of Congress.\n\n  Frankly, I am not going to blame President Reagan. I am not going to \nblame President Bush. I am not going to blame President Clinton or \nPresident Carter. I might go back to President Johnson and say there \nwere some problems there. That is when all these Great Society \nprograms, all well-intentioned, many of which do good but many of which \nare out of control today, that is when they originated. I believe the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia was here at that time\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? He mentioned me.\n  Mr. HATCH. What is the time for both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 34 minutes remaining \non his time; the Senator from New Jersey has 36 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Only to say that I was a part of the problem.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not really.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator was a part of the Congress.\n  Mr. BYRD. I was a part of the problem when I voted for the Reagan tax \ncut, and I have kicked myself in the seat of the pants ever since. That \nwas----\n  Mr. HATCH. I kind of admired the Senator for it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I said I admired the Senator for that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. That the Senator came across the line and actually \nproduced 40 percent more revenues than they thought. The problem is we \nkept spending.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I finish.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. BYRD. I was rolling along pretty well.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am still proud.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I sought to get Mr. Reagan to postpone the \nthird year of his proposed 3-year tax cut until such time as we could \nsee what the budget deficit was, until such time as we could see what \nwas happening to the economy. No, he wouldn't do that. So I offered \nlegislation here, as minority leader, at that time, to require that \nthat third year of the tax cut be delayed. But my amendment was \nrejected, just like all amendments that we are offering now to the \nconstitutional amendment are being rejected summarily. My amendment was \nrejected. And then I voted for the Reagan tax cut.\n\n  My people said, ``Go along with this new President. Give him a \nchance. Give him what he wants.'' And so I did, and I have been sorry \nof it ever since.\n  I voted for that Reagan tax cut. I also voted for his massive \nmilitary buildup. And, so, I am that much to blame. But let it not be \nsaid that the President should escape the charge of having overblown \nspending, and the debt, by saying, ``We are the Congress. The President \nproposes, the Congress disposes.'' Mr. Reagan had a veto pen. Why \ndidn't he veto some of the appropriations bills? He didn't. He didn't \nuse the veto pen, perhaps, enough.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could----\n  Mr. BYRD. But, Mr. President, I was guilty. I supported Mr. Reagan on \nhis tax cut, and to that extent I am sorry.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand.\n  Mr. BYRD. Because that represents the major portion of the Federal \ndebt that we owe today, the massive tax cut, the massive military \nbuildup, and there you have it. I will repeat the figures once more and \nthen I will take my chair.\n  When Mr. Reagan became responsible for his first fiscal year budget--\nthe total debt was $999 billion, total debt over the period of all the \nyears and all the administrations since the Republic began. And when \nthe last fiscal year for which he was responsible had ended, the debt \nwas $2,830,000,000,000. And then when the last moment of the last \nfiscal year for which Mr. Bush was responsible had ended, the debt was \n$4,316,000,000,000. So much for the pile of books.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say this in response. The fact of the matter \nis, I do not think anybody escapes responsibility. But I know one \nthing, the Reagan tax cuts resulted in an increase of revenues because \nthere was more opportunity, more investment, more creation of jobs, \nmore people paying taxes. And we actually had more tax revenues come in \nby 40 percent over what was estimated.\n  Where Reagan got into trouble--and I was here--was in the 1981 or \n1982 tax bill. In order to get the marginal tax rate reductions that \nall of us knew would work--and they did, and this administration is \nbenefiting from that to this day because the tax rates were 70 percent \nat that time. I have to admit they are outrageously high today, but \nthey are not 70 percent. But, in order to get that, they had to agree, \nthe President had to agree to all kinds of congressional spending \nprograms. He wanted the marginal tax rate so bad because he knew that \nwould create a good economy. And it did for 8 solid years, some say \nlonger. And it is really one of the things that is benefiting this \neconomy today, because the tax rates are so much lower than they were \nbefore Reagan took office. But then, in the 1986 tax bill, which I \nvoted against, he wanted marginal rates reduced again, and to get that \nhe had to give all kinds of concessions that I think helped trigger the \nS crisis. And it was Congress that did it. It was Members of both \nparties in Congress that did it.\n  I do not think we can avoid the responsibility by just saying, well, \nthe debt went up during the Reagan and Bush years, and now, with the \nbiggest tax increase, it has come down as a total number. But it is \nstill a $107 billion deficit this year, and next year it will be more. \nIt is going up every year for the next 4 years until we are supposed to \nsomehow conjure up 75-percent savings to bring it down in the 2 years \nafter President Clinton leaves office, according to his budget.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I can just finish? These books were created by us, \nthese 28 years of deficits. I am saying we have to do something to help \nus to be responsible. If we do that, the President, whoever that \nPresident may be--whether that President is a supply-sider like Reagan, \nor not--will have to be more responsible. If we do not do it, we are \ngoing to have more of the same.\n  I have to say it was triggered long before the Great Society \nprograms, because we have had 58 years of unbalanced budgets in the \nlast 66 years. So it\n\n[[Page S1621]]\n\nhappened even before the Great Society. But once the Great Society \nprograms started and this move toward entitlement spending--I know my \ndear colleague knows that. He has to deal with it every day on the \nAppropriations Committee, and he deals with it very intelligently. But \nhe is stuck because almost two-thirds of the budget is entitlements. It \nwas not the Presidents who did that; it is us. I have to tell you, the \nonly hope for this country to get these things under control--and I \nhave to say I don't want my dear friend to make another mistake. He is \nrepentant for having voted for the Reagan tax cuts. I don't think he \nshould make another mistake that he is going to have to repent for \nby not voting for the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  I really am still hoping I can get him to change his ways and to come \nacross here and help get this thing done. Because he, above all people \nin both bodies, knows how really irresponsible the Congress has been \nthrough these years.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. On Mr. Torricelli's time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, no.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will, because I know how much time--how much time do I \nhave left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 26 minutes \nremaining; the Senator from New Jersey has 36.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will you mind if we do it for just a limited period of \ntime?\n  Mr. BYRD. Make it 2 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah. \nLet me remind the listeners as to who was in charge in the Senate \nduring the first 6 years of the Reagan administration. I say this \nbecause my friend has just said, well, after all, Congress has----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Where do all money bills have to originate under the \nConstitution?\n  Mr. BYRD. In the House.\n  Mr. HATCH. Who was in charge during those years?\n  Mr. BYRD. Over here?\n  Mr. HATCH. No, in the House I'm talking about, where all money bills \noriginate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Listen----\n  Mr. HATCH. Wait, it wasn't Republicans in charge. We didn't originate \nthose money bills. Or did we?\n  Mr. BYRD. Listen, the Senator is trying to obfuscate something. I am \nnot going to let him do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. All right.\n  Mr. BYRD. Those bills come to this Senate and, under the \nConstitution, the Senate may amend revenue-raising bills, as in all \nother bills, and appropriations bills. So, let us not say that the \nSenate escapes its responsibility.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not saying that.\n  Mr. BYRD. But my friend, his party was in charge during those first 6 \nyears of the Reagan administration, in charge of the Senate. That is \nwhen I made--that is when I committed my almost unpardonable sin, by \nvoting for that Reagan tax cut.\n  I do not want to chew up the remainder of the manager's 2 minutes \nbut----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. May we proceed 1 more minute?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 1 more minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator from Utah says under that tax \ncut, under that tax cut about which I have just now begged for \nforgiveness for the umpteenth time----\n  Mr. HATCH. I forgive you.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have been begging forgiveness for that mistake for years. \nBut he said, as I recall, under that tax cut the revenues were \nincreased. I hope I didn't misstate it.\n  Mr. HATCH. No. They were.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is that what the Senator said?\n  Mr. HATCH. That's what I said.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let us take a look at what the facts show. I have a chart \nin my hand, which is titled ``Major Causes of Increased Federal Debt, \nFiscal Years 1981 to 1991.''\n  The bar right here is the bar showing the costs of the 1981 tax cuts. \nThey did not bring in revenues----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The Senator's additional 1 \nminute's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could the Senator from New Jersey yield additional time, \nbecause I have some other speakers coming.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The tax cuts were responsible for $2.1 trillion in losses, \nthe tax cut for which I voted. And other causes of increased Federal \ndebt are likewise shown: Entitlements, defense, interest, and so on--\nfailed S's.\n  But the Senator was wrong in saying that the tax cut increased the \nrevenues. The tax cuts were responsible for losses to the Treasury of \n$2.1 trillion over the fiscal years 1981 to 1991.\n  I thank the Senator for having yielded. I hope that he will allow a \nvote up or down on the Torricelli amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say this, I will allow a vote up or down on \nthe Torricelli amendment. It is the only exception I am going to make. \nI hope my colleagues on my side will----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will do it at your request. But let me just say this, \nthe Senator is talking about overall spending. I am talking about \nrevenues that came from the tax cut. We actually had revenues increase \n40 percent during that period of time.\n  Be that as it may, whether I am wrong and you are right, the fact of \nthe matter is that the Congress, during all of those Reagan years, was \ncontrolled by the more liberal persuasion, and all money bills \noriginated in the House, which was controlled by the Democratic Party. \nNow, allegedly we did have Republican control in the Senate, but if you \nlook at the total number of liberals versus moderate conservatives, the \nSenate was still liberal during those years, and we were the ones \nprimarily responsible for these 28 years of unbalanced budgets. To lay \nit at the feet of Reagan, Bush, or Clinton is not right.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Thank you, Mr. President. While it is my hope to \nreturn the debate to the amendment at hand--it is my intention to yield \nto my colleague, the senior Senator from New Jersey--nevertheless, \nsince our debate is in the Record, it should at least be accurate in \nthis respect: I notice the Senator from Utah has the last 28 years of \nbudgets of the U.S. Government. That means his books start in the \nfiscal year 1969.\n  Debate between the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nUtah seemed to be on the relative merits between the Reagan and the \nJohnson administrations and their responsibilities for the Federal \ndeficit. It is extraordinary that the Senator from Utah stopped there \nbefore 1969, the last year of the Great Society, the last budget \nwritten by Lyndon Johnson and the last year the U.S. Government had a \nsurplus.\n  It is, I think, instructive, Mr. President, that as we assign \nresponsibility, which is no doubt, at least as an aside, a useful \nexercise on this day, as someone who served in the House of \nRepresentatives during some of those years, I want the Record to \nclearly reflect one element of that responsibility. In 8 years of the \nReagan administration, in all the appropriations bills passed, Mr. \nReagan vetoed one. He vetoed one appropriations bill in 8 years, while \nthe Federal deficit soared from less than $1 trillion to $4 trillion. \nAnd if you look at his veto message, it is because, in his judgment, \nspending was inadequate in that year.\n  We will leave it for historians to gauge whether it was the Great \nSociety that produced this deficit problem, in spite of the fact that \nhe left office with a surplus, or it was the Reagan administration, \nwhich talked about fiscal austerity but left the Nation with a $4 \ntrillion accumulated deficit and never exercised a veto of any \nappropriation.\n  But perhaps the comments of my colleagues should be punctuated simply \nwith this: The genuine level of debt that should be of concern to every \nAmerican is the debt as a proportion of our national economy. Like in \nour households and our businesses, it is not\n\n[[Page S1622]]\n\nwhether you have a debt--the mortgage on your home, borrowing for \nexpansion--it is your ability to pay it. Two Presidents in the last 40 \nyears have administered the U.S. Government with a deficit under 2 \npercent of gross national product. One was named Johnson, and one is \nnamed Clinton. The others have exceeded that marker, which is now \nrecognized by our friends in Asia and the European Community as the \nmarker to which you do not want to pass.\n  So while I hope we can return to the issue of the balanced budget \namendment and look prospectively and leave to others, the historians, \nthe question of relative responsibility, I did want, along with my \ncolleague from West Virginia, to ensure the Record was accurate.\n  At this time, I yield to the senior Senator from the State of New \nJersey for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, that is very generous of my colleague. \nI will not take 20.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my \ndistinguished colleague, the junior Senator from our great State of New \nJersey, and I salute him for his initiative.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that I strongly oppose the \nbalanced budget amendment. But if we are going to pass it, the least we \nshould do is include the Torricelli amendment. Without it, the \nunderlying balanced budget amendment would forever preclude our Nation \nfrom adopting what I believe is the essential nature of budgeting and \ninvesting in America--capital budgeting.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have long advocated dividing the \nFederal budget into separate capital and operating budgets.\n  This is not budget or fiscal heresy. Quite the contrary. Most States \ndo it. Almost every business does it. It's sound government. It's sound \nbusiness. It's common sense.\n  The balanced budget requirement that many States have affects only \ntheir operating budgets with capital budgets and pension funds \nexcluded. Capital budgeting is a fundamental accounting principle \nemployed by every major corporation in America. Fortune 500 companies \nuse their borrowing power and creditworthiness to brag about their \nfinancial stability.\n  I must admit that I am somewhat perplexed by my colleagues who \nsupport a balanced budget amendment. On the one hand, they say that we \nshould operate the Government like a business.\n  But on the other hand, they reject outright one of the most \nfundamental principles of operating a business--separate capital and \noperating budgets. Mr. President, you can't have it both ways.\n  I come to the Senate from the business world and that experience \ngives me an invaluable and unique perspective. The company I founded \nwith two friends, Automatic Data Processing, is the largest computing \nservices firm in the world, and it employs 29,000 people in a number of \ncountries.\n  But it wasn't always that way. We grew that company from scratch, and \nwe didn't do it with the type of budgeting required of the Federal \nGovernment today. We borrowed money. We took out loans. We didn't make \nacross-the-board cuts or ask someone else to take the responsibility \nfor making cuts.\n  When I was CEO, I would look over my various departments, and say, I \nneed more in marketing or more in product development or more in \nproduction.\n  Mr. President, we budgeted those investments the way any business \ndoes. We didn't have a unified budget like the Federal Government. We \nhad separate capital and operating budgets. We balanced our books in \nterms of day-to-day operations, and cut waste wherever we found it. But \nwe weren't afraid to take out a loan for the long term. And those \ninvestments paid off. That's how most successful businesses do it.\n  This is nothing radical, and it's certainly not confined to the \nbusiness world. Families take out loans to finance homes and cars. \nStudents rely on student loans to help finance their college education. \nStates with balanced budget requirements float bonds and take on debt \nfor capital expenditures. There's no reason why the Federal Government \nshouldn't do so as well.\n  So if Congress wants to run the Government like a business, it will \npass the Torricelli amendment.\n  To get on the right track--the investment track--we must distinguish \nbetween short-term consumption and long-term investment spending.\n  So far we have failed to recognize, let alone embrace, this \nelementary business practice. And as Government continues to \nunderinvest in the long term, all Americans pay a big price.\n  Public investment is crucial because these are investments that the \nprivate sector will not make on their own. Only Government will. The \neconomic benefits of a first-rate education system, or a well-\nfunctioning transportation system, are spread throughout the economy \nmaking life better for all of us. These are capital investments.\n\n  At a recent Budget Committee hearing on education, I emphasized my \nbelief that greater public investment in education is of critical \nimportance to our Nation's economic future.\n  While parents fear for their children's future, and business worries \nabout the quality of the work force, the ratio of workers to retirees \nis predicted to shrink to less than 2 to 1. Improving the output of our \neducation system is not only desirable; it has become an imperative if \nour future work force will be able to support the growing number of \nretirees.\n  The same is true with transportation. When we invest in roads, \nbridges, and transit, we lessen congestion and improve the efficiency \nof the economy for many years.\n  I believe that the solution to many of our long-term investment \nproblems is to create a separate capital budget. I see no other way to \ndo it.\n  So if my colleagues are serious about running this Government like a \nbusiness--if they are serious about investing in America--they will \nvote for this amendment. If they don't, we will never have the chance \nto even consider capital budgeting and that would shortchange our great \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I commend my new colleague from New Jersey for his \nwork here thus far. I salute him for this initiative. I think it is a \nvery wisely developed thesis that this Government ought to operate just \nlike other entities across our country, like the largest of the \nbusinesses, like virtually all businesses. When we talk about a capital \nbudget, it is done for a sensible business purpose--the Government \nrecognizes it--the depreciation of the asset over its life, and it \nentitles companies to take the value of the asset each year, charge \nthat off to its operating statement so that you get an accurate picture \nof what it is that is being done within the company. And so it ought to \nbe here.\n  What we are talking about, almost forgotten in the recent debate, is \nthe balanced budget amendment. I think it is fairly clear around here \nthat this Senator stands in opposition to that balanced budget \namendment. I have done whatever I could to assure that we are not going \nto permit the balanced budget amendment to become part of the \nConstitution. I think it would be poor judgment. I think it would be a \npoor tactic to have the Constitution amended to provide for a balanced \nbudget when, in fact, if we look at the record--and that is one of the \nthings, frankly, that astounds me at times--the record of the last 4 \nyears has been quite spectacular when we examine the results of the \nClinton leadership.\n  The reduction in annual budget deficit has been enormous, some 60 \npercent, down to $107 billion last year. The CBO, our auditing arm, \nsaid in May that they thought we would be some $50 billion higher. And \nthen in February they had to change their estimate to something \nconsiderably lower in a period of 8 months, with no understanding of \nthe fact there was a dynamic change taking place. The same thing was \ntrue in an earlier year when the misestimate was by such an enormous \namount that had we had a balanced budget in place, we would have made \nall kinds of adjustments, and we probably could have, without meaning \nto, sent this country into recession.\n  Mr. President, the principal discussion here is how do we tell the \ntruth to the American public about what is going on here? If we had a \ncapital budget, I think it would be quite clear. Right now, we talk \nabout obscure things. We talk about adjustments in\n\n[[Page S1623]]\n\nthe CPI. We talk about taking Social Security and other trust funds off \nbudget.\n  The fact of the matter is that we would be hamstringing ourselves \nwith a balanced budget amendment that prevented us from responding to \nour national needs at any given time. Whether on the brink of \nrecession, whether on the brink of war, whether on the brink of other \nnational catastrophes, we would be limiting our capacity to operate. \nAnd I do not understand why we insist on doing that when, in fact, the \nrecord is good.\n  The President has presented a budget that will be in balance in the \nyear 2002. As a matter of fact, it is proposed there would be a surplus \nof some $17 billion at that time.\n  But to my colleague from New Jersey, my junior colleague from New \nJersey--I am not quite used to the ranks--but I want to say that this \nis a very thoughtful amendment that you have developed. You have not \nsaid where, when, precisely how--do not lock us out of having a capital \nbudget as part of our accounting process in the future.\n  I come from the corporate world. I ran a fairly large company--today, \nwith 29,000 employees. I never would have dreamed of agreeing to a \nboard of directors directive that said: OK, you can run this company, \nbut understand what the conditions are under which you can run this \ncompany, that at the end of each year you are not allowed to be \nborrowing, not allowed to be doing anything else unless you prevent \nthis company from having any kind of a deficit using an operating \naccounting process all the way through; when, if we erected a building, \nif we bought computer equipment, no matter what it was, you could not \nwrite it off over the life of the assets. Some of these assets are 40-, \n50-year assets. Some of the assets we acquire in the Federal Government \nhave lifetimes going way beyond that.\n  If they said to me, those are the conditions, I would say this job \ncannot be done. You cannot restrict yourself in advance to certain \nconditions at the end of a year over which you have no control. If we \nhad to cut back on expenses, I never took a wholesale approach to it \nand said, OK, cut marketing, cut product development, cut production, \ncut facilities. You could not do it that way. Each of these things \nrequires thought.\n  Here we are, 100 U.S. Senators, sent by people who elect us to \nrepresent them, unable, we are saying, unable to do it by ourselves. We \nneed the constriction of a balanced budget amendment so we will all be \ngood boys and girls here, so that we will remove the intuition, the \njudgment that we bring here from any decision we make because we want \nto be free of that kind of restraint. I, frankly, think that it shows \nvery poorly in the public domain.\n  I think we ought to do it the old-fashioned way. I think what we \nought to do, as proposed by my colleague from New Jersey, is amend it \nif we can to be a better product, to amend that balanced budget \namendment in case it does pass. And I hope it does not. In case it does \npass, we ought to have conditions in there that permit us to operate in \nas free a condition as we can possibly do it.\n  So, Mr. President, I see it as a fairly simple thing. The first thing \nwe should do, look at the record, see where we are. I started to say \nbefore, I am astonished by the unwillingness of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to recognize what has been accomplished since \nPresident Clinton took over, whether it is the reduction in the \ndeficit, the growth in jobs, the icons of American industry, companies \nwith whom you could tie your future, never worry about another thing as \nlong as they do work--gone, shrunken, dissolved, in many cases. The \nPresident found a way to replace many of those jobs by encouraging \nsmall business investment. We have over 11 million new jobs in this \nperiod of time. We have the lowest portion of deficit to GDP of any \ncountry. We are the envy of all the developed nations in the world.\n\n  I looked at the expectation for the future, as we look at the budget \nproposal. Mr. President, in the next 5 years our economy is expected to \ngrow by $2 trillion--$2 trillion of GDP in the next 5 years, at the \nsame time, expecting, based on the numbers developed thus far, that we \nwill have a surplus in our operations for the year without a capital \nbudget, which, again, we should have, without adjustments, in the CPI.\n  I think that it is imperative that we vote on the Torricelli \namendment, that we give it as much support as we can.\n  Mr. President, I hope, perhaps contrary to the view of some very good \nfriends here, that in the final analysis, that despite the fact that I \nwant this amendment to pass, I hope we do not attempt to balance the \nbudget with a constitutional amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I once again commend my colleague.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Maryland 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Three minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Three minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will be very quick.\n  First of all, I commend the able Senator from New Jersey for the very \nthoughtful and careful analysis he made in his statement upon offering \nhis amendment.\n  One of the difficulties with a balanced budget constitutional \namendment generally, of course, is that it is purely symbolic. The real \nway to balance the budget is to do it when Congress considers and \npasses the budget, not by amending the constitution.\n  But the Senator from New Jersey has pointed out three, I think, clear \ndifficulties with this particular version of a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution, Senate Joint Resolution 1. One is that \nour current Federal process does not provide for a capital budget. \nEvery State and locality has a capital budget. Businesses have capital \nbudgets. Private individuals have capital budgets. People do not go out \nand pay for a house, or an automobile, or finance a college education \nwith cash the same year that they make these purchases. They make \nprudent investments in the future, and they borrow and amortize them \nover a period of time. State governments do exactly the same thing. It \nis a prudent and sensible way to do business.\n  I will never forget a budget committee hearing at which we had two \nGovernors testifying in favor of amending the Constitution to require a \nbalanced budget. They said, well, our States require a balanced budget, \nand, as a consequence of our States requiring it, the Governors went on \nto say, our States get a better credit rating, so that when we borrow \nin the market we get a better interest rate.\n\n  Of course, the obvious question becomes, if states have a \nconstitutional requirement to balance the budget, why do they need to \nborrow money? What does a credit rating matter to these states? So I \nasked them that question. Of course, their response was, well, you do \nnot understand. We have a capital budget that is separate and apart \nfrom the operating budget. We have a capital budget that we fund by \nborrowing--by borrowing. So I said, well, we do not have a capital \nbudget at the Federal level. I noted that we in the Federal Government \ndo not make a distinction between capital and operating expenses, \nthough it is a wise distinction because then you can fund your long-\nterm investments through borrowing, get the full benefit of the \ninvestment, and pay back the debt over the useful life of the capital \nasset.\n  The Governors' response was that the Federal Government ought to have \na capital budget. I note to my colleagues that if you are really \nserious about trying to write a balanced budget requirement into the \nConstitution of the United States, the first thing you ought to do, as \na minimum, is separate out operating and capital budgets--just the way \nState and local governments do.\n  So this analogy to State and local government falls of its own weight \nas soon as you recognize the fact that unlike the Federal Government, \nState and local governments have capital budgets which they fund by \nborrowing. We do not have a capital budget at the Federal level, but if \nwe have a constitutional balanced budget amendment, we should.\n  Second, I think the emphasis which the Senator from New Jersey has \nmade\n\n[[Page S1624]]\n\non the necessity of being able to respond in a crisis situation \ninvolving either the national security of the country or an economic \ndownturn is extremely important.\n  As regards economic conditions, we have managed to ameliorate the \nbusiness cycle, not to eliminate it, but to ameliorate it. We are able \nto do that in part because we are now able to conduct countercyclical \nfiscal policy when we have an economic downturn. The balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution, without a provision such as is contained \nin the amendment that has been sent to the desk by the Senator from New \nJersey, runs the very great risk of turning economic downturns into \nrecessions and recessions into depressions, because it will not allow \nus to respond to dire economic circumstances when we are confronted \nwith them.\n  The same thing is true about the national security provisions of the \nbalanced budget amendment as it has been drawn by its sponsors. These \nprovisions are much too restrictive, much too confined, and they run \nthe substantial risk that we will not be able to respond in a national \nemergency.\n\n  Now, the response made to this argument by the supporters of Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 is that if we confront a national emergency we will \nget the supermajority vote in order to waive the balancing provisions \nof Senate Joint Resolution 1 and there will be no problem. Well, our \nown history does not sustain that contention.\n  In 1940, the House of Representatives instituted a 1-year draft. That \ncame up for renewal in the autumn of 1941, literally weeks before Pearl \nHarbor. They took a vote in the House of Representatives on extending \nthe draft for another year. Speaker Rayburn went into the well of the \nHouse in order to plead with his colleagues to pass this extension. It \npassed on a vote of 203 to 202. But that vote, which is a majority, \nwould not have met the supermajority requirements contained in the \nbalanced budget amendment that has been brought forth from the \ncommittee by Senator Hatch. It would have fallen short because it was \nnot a majority of the whole membership of the body, which required 218 \nvotes, and which under this amendment is necessary to avoid the \nbalancing requirements in Senate Joint Resolution 1. There we have a \nclassic example of a crisis situation, right out of our own history. \nThis is not a hypothetical. Looking at our own history, we can see that \nwe would not have been able to respond and meet the requirements of the \ntime, when we were facing this crisis situation, under the provisions \nof the balanced budget amendment as currently drafted.\n  I want to strongly commend the Senator from New Jersey for the very \ncareful analysis that has brought forth these proposals pending before \nus. Clearly, at a minimum, if this constitutional amendment is to move \nforward, it requires the adoption of the Senator's amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, before I yield some time to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are almost 22 minutes for the majority \nand almost 14 minutes for the minority.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield to the Senator from Idaho for a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nyielding. I stand in opposition to the Torricelli amendment. I think it \nis critically important we maintain a unified budget to assure fiscal \nsolvency and responsibility in this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a fact sheet be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the fact-sheet was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nCongressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget--A Capital Spending \n           Exemption Not a Capital Idea for the Constitution\n\n     A special exemption for ``capital'' or ``investment'' \n         spending does not belong in the balanced budget amendment \n         to the Constitution\n       A constitution deals with the most fundamental \n     responsibilities of the government and the broadest, timeless \n     principles of governance. It should not set budget priorities \n     or contain narrow policy decisions such as defining a capital \n     budget.\n       Whatever the merits are of making such spending a higher or \n     lower priority than it has been, this question is best \n     addressed in the annual budget process.\n     The debt is the threat to capital investment\n       Escalating interest payments on the huge federal debt are \n     crowding out all other priorities. According to the National \n     Entitlement Commission's 1995 report: ``By 2012, unless \n     appropriate policy changes are made in the interim, projected \n     outlays for entitlements and interest on the national debt \n     will consume all tax revenues collected by the federal \n     government.'' That means no money left for capital \n     investment--or defense, education, the environment, law \n     enforcement, science, or other domestic discretionary \n     programs.\n     If states, businesses, and families can borrow, why shouldn't \n         the federal government?\n       Everyone else repays the principal they have borrowed. \n     Families take out a mortgage and then spend years paying it \n     down. The same is true of capital investments by businesses \n     and state and local governments. But the federal government \n     just keeps borrowing more. And more.\n     Unlike state budgets or family finances, the federal budget \n         is large enough to accommodate virtually all capital \n         expenditures on a regular, ongoing basis\n       The justification that most businesses and state and local \n     governments have for capital budgeting is that they \n     occasionally need to make on-time, extraordinary expenditures \n     that are amortized over a long period of time.\n       The federal budget is so huge--now more than $1.6 \n     trillion--that almost no conceivable, one-shot project would \n     make even a small dent in it.\n     Even the federal Interstate Highway System, which has been \n         called the largest peacetime undertaking in all of human \n         history, was financed on a pay-as-you-go basis\n       President Eisenhower initially proposed that the Interstate \n     System be financed through borrowing by selling special \n     bonds. However, Congress kept it on-budget and financed it \n     through a gas tax at the urging of then-Senator Albert Gore, \n     Sr.\n     There are protections against the abuse of capital budgets in \n         state budgeting that do not constrain federal borrowing\n       State and local governments have a check on their use of \n     capital budgets through bond ratings. If a state government \n     were to abuse its capital budget, then its bond rating would \n     drop and it would become difficult or impossible to continue \n     borrowing to finance additional expenditures.\n       In addition, many states require that bond issues be \n     approved by the voters.\n     While state capital spending is often placed off-budget, so \n         are state trust fund surpluses\n       According to a Price-Waterhouse study, in recent years, \n     state budgets would have been roughly in balance if both \n     capital expenditures and trust funds (such as retirement \n     funds) were included on-budget.\n     The process of defining ``capital spending'' could be abused\n       Even a category of ``capital'' or ``investment'' spending \n     that appeared to be tightly defined at first could become a \n     tempting loophole to future Congresses and Presidents. For \n     example, New York City, prior to its financial crisis in the \n     1970s, amortized spending for school textbooks by declaring \n     their ``useful life'' to be 30 years.\n     Virtually any form of ``capital spending'' exemption would \n         perpetuate the crisis of deficit spending\n       Even an exemption from the Balanced Budget Amendment for a \n     narrow category in the President's budget, major public \n     physical capital investment, would have allowed a deficit \n     larger than the one that actually occurred in FY 1996 ($116 \n     billion vs. $107 billion). It would result in an FY 1997 \n     deficit that would be, at most, 9 percent lower than current \n     CBO projections ($113 billion vs. $124 billion).\n       Allowing deficit spending for total federal investment \n     outlays would have allowed deficits larger than those that \n     actually occurred in 28 of the last 35 years.\n       These estimates, of course, assume no manipulation of \n     definitions or accounting that would allow still larger \n     deficits.\n     The concept of a ``capital budget'' is too poorly defined to \n         put in the Constitution--Estimates of ``capital \n         spending'' could vary widely\n       There is wide disagreement among policymakers about what \n     should be included in a federal capital budget. There is no \n     commonly accepted federal budget concept of this term. \n     Therefore, any capital spending exemption included in the \n     Constitution would be left open to a wide range of \n     interpretations.\n       In fact, the President's budget includes several different \n     categories of ``capital'' and ``investment'' spending. For \n     fiscal years 1996 and 1997, these include:\n\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       FY 1996   FY 1997\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMajor physical capital investment...................    $115.9    $113.0\nNet miscellaneous physical investment...............       3.1       3.1\nResearch and development............................      68.4      70.3\nEducation and training..............................      43.6      42.5\n                                                     -------------------\n      Total federal investment outlays..............     230.9     228.9\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page S1625]]\n\n     The balanced budget amendment already allows for the \n         establishment of a capital budget--within the context of \n         regularly balanced budgets\n       The amendment does not prevent the creation of separate \n     operating and capital accounts. But extraordinary \n     expenditures which are large enough and unusual enough to \n     require significant new borrowing should be subject to a \n     higher threshold of approval, such as a three-fifth majority \n     vote.\n       This is consistent with the recommendations of General \n     Accounting Office, which stated in its 1992 report, Prompt \n     Action Necessary to Avert Long-Term Damage to the Economy: \n     ``* * * the creation of explicit categories for government \n     capital and investment expenditures should not be viewed as a \n     license to run deficits to finance those categories * * *. \n     The choice between spending for investment and spending for \n     consumption should be seen as setting priorities within an \n     overall fiscal constraint, not as a reason for relaxing that \n     constraint and permitting a larger deficit.''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I believe that we should adopt a capital \nbudget and I strongly urge its incorporation into Senate Joint \nResolution 1. This amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, establishes a capital budget and should \nreceive the support of every Member of this Chamber who truly wants to \nsee a balanced budget become a reality. A capital budget will help us \nachieve that end and will bring more financial accountability to the \nFederal level.\n  Many supporters of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nbelieve that the Federal Government should manage its funds like many \nhard-working families across our Nation. Families must balance their \ncheckbooks or they face serious financial consequences. Why, amendment \nsupporters ask, should the Federal Government be any different?\n  The reason is clear, Mr. President. Families do not balance their \nbudgets, they balance their checkbooks. They sit at the kitchen table \nonce or twice a month to make sure that there is enough money to pay \nthe bills. However, not all of their expenses are paid in full at the \ntime they are purchased. Most Americans can only afford such items if \nthey spread their payment obligations over a longer period of time, \nsometimes with the help of loans. People do not receive the benefits of \nsuch expenditures at one time, either--they drive their cars and live \nin their homes for years, perhaps decades.\n  Most States operate in the same manner. While almost every State has \nsome type of constitutional or statutory requirement to balance their \nbudgets, such limitations normally apply to a state's operating \nbudget--like a family's checkbook. State expenses for constructing such \nitems as roads and buildings or purchasing land do not fall within the \nbalanced budget requirements.\n  The Federal Government, however, is being asked to balance its budget \nwithout a distinction between capital outlays and operating expenses. \nIn fact, were the balanced budget amendment to pass without providing \nfor the establishment of a capital budget, this country would place \nupon itself a restriction not followed by families, businesses or \nStates. Furthermore, such a limitation would make the United States \nunique among the major economic powers in the world--not a single \nnation among the G-7 has such budget constraints.\n  Federal outlays for capital investments are significantly different \nfrom outlays for operating expenses because they represent asset \nexchanges. When the United States spends money to purchase a building \nor land, the United States receives an appreciable asset in exchange \nfor that expense. That asset will produce future streams of revenue to \nthe United States either through the increase in the value of the \nproperty or simply as a place to conduct the Government's business. \nSuch expenditures do not contribute to the deficit wholly because the \nresulting purchase or investment leaves the Government with \ncalculations on both sides of the ledger.\n  Additionally, a lack of such a distinction is an inadequate way for \nthe Government to manage the Nation's funds. To use the example \nprovided by Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist who served in both \nthe Reagan and Bush administrations, a ``$10 million building that will \nlast 30 years must be fully accounted for in a single year's budget, \nthe same as a $10 million outlay for airplane fuel or some other \noperating expense.'' In Mr. Bartlett's view, in my own view, and in the \nopinion of hundreds of economists nationwide, ``the lack of a [Federal] \ncapital budget creates biases in the budget that lead to uneconomical \ndecisions.''\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 12 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Quite simply, no other \nlegislative issue the Senate will consider is more important than this \none. It was true in the last Congress. It is true in this Congress. It \nwill be true in the next one if we do not pass it.\n  Now, there are more reasons than I have ever heard not to balance the \nbudget. We have heard them day after day. We just heard them, and they \nkeep coming. But the future of the United States and the well-being of \nour children, grandchildren, and children yet unborn rests entirely on \nwhether we pass this amendment or not.\n  Mr. President, if we fail to enact this amendment I am concerned we \nwill never balance a budget on any sort of a continuing basis. I have \nheard a lot of talk on the Senate floor about the need to balance a \nbudget. Many have said that we can balance a budget but not necessarily \non a continuing basis. Talk is cheap. The real question is, what will \nguarantee that we balance a budget year in, year out, and guarantee \nfiscal responsibility to the Federal Government, something we have not \nhad? What guarantees will we make to our children and grandchildren and \nchildren yet unborn that we will not continue to mortgage their future \nwith feel-good politics of the day?\n  There is a lot of rhetoric in this body about the need to help \nchildren-- more resources for education, greater health care for \nchildren. In fact, if there is anything we really want to pass, we put \nchildren in front of it. But if we really want to help the children of \nthis country that are here now and yet to be born we can stop piling a \nfinancial burden on them that they cannot pay. It is as simple as that.\n  We could give them a society, if not debt free, at least be coming \nout of debt, reducing it. We are already seeing the effects of the 30-\nyear spending spree. Most two-income families have difficulty \nsustaining the same lifestyle as their parents and grandparents that \nlived on one income. Why is it that one paycheck does not go as far \ntoday? The answer is simple: Taxes and debt. The enormous tax burden \nthat has been created because of bigger government, taxes that are \neverywhere, and the IRS considers taxing everything--endless taxes, \nFederal taxes, State, local, sales, gasoline, property, personal, \nestate taxes, telephone, airline, the list goes on into infinity. We \nare taxing ourselves to death to pay for more government that we do not \nneed because so much of what is already collected is being spent on \ninterest for money we have already borrowed and already spent.\n  Already we send $1.5 trillion to the Federal Government each year. \nThat is not enough. Nor will any amount ever be enough. It is an all-\nconsuming Government and no amount will ever satisfy the appetite.\n  Mr. President, the debt is not going away. Today, every man, woman, \nand child in this country owes $20,000. A family of four owes $80,000, \nthe cost of the average home. The money will have to be paid back. It \nwill never disappear. What we have done is extremely wrong--we have \nignored the reality of our time and have put the burden of the future \non our children to pay for our folly.\n  Mr. President, I have often thought what is it about the last 40 \nyears that has brought us into this position? Certainly, too many \npeople believe Government is the answer to every problem. We have spent \napproximately $5 trillion on Federal welfare programs since 1960, \nroughly the size of the debt. But we have more poverty today than we \ndid when we started--a total failure.\n  Another problem has been that an active Federal Government has \nregulated American business too much, stifling the productivity and \nunduly burdening small business.\n\n[[Page S1626]]\n\n  This is another unique problem that is recent: The Congress has no \nboundaries. The age of instant information and Congress' driven attempt \nto please everyone, we are never forced to choose between programs. We \ncan be for anything and everything and against nothing and it rolls on. \nWe are never forced to make a choice because we do not have the \nrequirement of a balanced budget amendment. This is a fundamental flaw \nof the Federal Government. We have no limit on our ability to incur \ndebt. Thomas Jefferson noted it 200 years ago. It was true then. It is \ntrue today.\n  Mr. President, finally let me talk about the national debt that is \nconsuming us. It took this country 200 years to acquire a $1 trillion \ndebt, and we did that in 1983. Now, in just 14 additional years we have \nacquired an additional $4 trillion in debt. We clearly are out of \ncontrol with our spending, and if we do not constrain ourselves we will \ndestroy the fiscal integrity of this country. By the time we balance a \nbudget, even by most conservative figures, we will have a $6.5 trillion \ndebt. Every person who has ever had a debt knows that interest is a \npiranha and it will eat you alive. The same thing is happening to the \nFederal Government. Interest is eating us alive.\n  We spend $366 billion on gross interest each year--that is, to the \npublic and the Government trust funds. To put it in more real terms, \nwhen we file our tax returns on April 15, we should know that 52 \npercent of all income taxes that are sent to Washington will be used \nfor the one purpose of paying the interest on the Government's gross \ndebt.\n  By the year 2000, our national debt will be equal to 52 percent of \nthe gross domestic product. In 1980, the figure was half that. Besides \ninterest, the only thing we spend more on is Social Security. I think \nit is so ironic that we have heard over and over that Social Security \nis being used as a block to a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. If we want to ensure the future of Social Security and Medicare \nfor the people of this country in the future, the best thing we can do \nis balance the budget. It is the only way we can secure the future of \nSocial Security--with a balanced budget. It should never be considered \nseparately.\n  Mr. President, if we could just control Federal spending, we might \nnot need this amendment. But we won't control Federal spending. For 35 \nyears we have been unable to muster the fortitude to stop or control \nFederal spending. The truth is, had we frozen Federal spending in 1994, \nwe would have balanced the budget in 1997.\n  Mr. President, we all know what the problem is. The question is, what \nare we going to do about it? The answer is that we must pass the \nbalanced budget amendment if we are going to leave our children a clean \nslate, not a lifetime of debt, excessive taxes, and a contingent \nliability of $7 trillion.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, several questions have been raised through \nthe course of this debate. I have a couple of others, as well. I \nappreciate the efforts that have gone into this amendment, but I am \nvery concerned about a couple of the areas we have been talking about, \nthe largest of which is the capital budget area in this.\n  When we talk about capital budget--I have read what the President had \nin his budget message about capital budgeting. With the definitions \nthat I see that appear in this bill, what we are talking about is \nputting anything that we can call a capital investment off budget; and \nby putting it off budget, it removes itself from having to be a part of \nthe formula. I would like more clarification on that term.\n  There is also wording on that which says that net borrowing and the \ndisposition of major public physical capital assets would be excluded \nfrom the receipts. I am concerned about how we handle some of the \ndisposition of major physical capital assets. One of those we are \ntalking about is selling the spectrum. That is one-time revenue. I am \nvery concerned that we may take one-time revenue and use it to buy \nrecurring types of things in the budget. That is why I, too, have been \nasking for capital budgeting and, more important, cash flow budgeting, \nso that we know that when we are getting a one-time revenue, we are \nmatching that up with a one-time expenditure.\n  If we have net borrowing and the disposition of major public physical \ncapital assets excluded, what's the mechanism for handling that? What's \nthe budget phenomenon for handling that? Everybody has to have capital \nbudgets, as has been mentioned here today. Unfortunately, the Federal \nGovernment is the only entity that doesn't have to have oversight--\nunless we pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Then we, \ntoo, will have to have oversight.\n  I mentioned this morning that, as a mayor, we had capital budgeting, \ncash flow budgets, and performance budgets. It is very important not \nonly to building what needed to be built, but to paying off the debt \nfor what we built. I mentioned that the city I was mayor of is now one \nof the few debt-free cities in the United States. That comes from good \nplanning.\n  In the debate we have had on the balanced budget constitutional \namendment, we are not talking about paying off the debt that we have \nalready incurred. We are not talking about planning to pay off what we \nhave already incurred on behalf of the future generations--those kids \nand grandkids that we keep talking about, as well as the parents and \ngrandparents that are relying on Social Security. We have to balance \nthe budget to take care of our kids, grandkids, parents, and \ngrandparents, as well as ourselves.\n  There is a lot at stake in this. Unless we build in some oversight \nfor ourselves, something that forces us to pay back loans, then all we \nare doing is giving ourselves a license to spend. We are coming up with \nanother risky gimmick that will let us slip things into a category and \nnot have to account for them. That is not the purpose of capital \nbudgeting. I have even heard some reference, in capital budgeting, to \nputting things into a capital budget that would be social investments. \nI don't know how you pay off the social investments any different way \nthan you pay for any other expenditure under the budget. That, in my \nopinion, is not a capital budgeting thing. That is an expense budgeting \nitem. I think there has to be a distinction made there.\n  I am really worried that section 7 of this bill will give us a \nlicense to move things from the normal budgeting process to a capital \nbudgeting process and kind of forget about how we handle the payback on \nthat. Somebody mentioned earlier that if you buy a home, you are doing \ncapital budgeting. You are, but you have oversight. The banker sets up \nspecific parameters for you to be able to get the loan. If you don't \nmeet those parameters, he is not going to be a happy fellow. What we \nare trying to do here is set up some parameters for ourselves. Capital \nbudgeting, cash flow budgeting, and performance budgeting need to be \ndone. Those are part of an enabling act of a clean balanced budget \namendment.\n  One of the problems that we have in this body, I think, is that we \nthink of things more as a Christmas list, and I know that at Christmas \ntime I delight in going through the catalogs that come in and seeing \nwhat things I like. There has never been a limit to the number of \nthings that a person could pick--particularly when they are children. \nWe talk about balancing budgets, and every one of us wants to balance \nthe budget. Individually, we say that. It is collectively that we seem \nto run into the problem. The balanced budget constitutional amendment \nwill take care of that. It will force us to uphold the Constitution of \nthe United States. It will force us to put parameters on ourselves.\n  Everybody wants to buy everything, and they want to buy it right now. \nGood budgeting will set up some parameters that will help us with that. \nI am glad we are thinking about good budgeting, good accounting \ntechniques, because we need to start setting up our Social Security \ntrust fund under some better accounting techniques, so that we are \nrecognizing some of the actuarial differences that are there. It is \ngood to be thinking about that. It is a must that we do that. Right \nnow, we are building up some incredible actuarial debts that we are not \nrecognizing at all. We owe about $9.3 trillion to the Social Security \nfund. If we put the same kind of parameters on ourselves that we put on \nbusiness--we tell business they have to set up a trust fund,\n\n[[Page S1627]]\n\nand it has to have the amount of money necessary to pay for the people \nwho are retiring at the time they retire. But we don't put that \nparameter on ourselves. The balanced budget constitutional amendment \nwill put those kinds of things on the line to be done. We will have to \nfollow the promises we made in the campaign.\n  When I campaigned, we talked a lot about balancing the budget. When \nthe President talked, he talked a lot about balancing the budget. In \nhis State of the Union speech, he said, ``We need to balance the \nbudget, but we don't need a balanced budget amendment. All we need is \naction.'' Then we got a budget that was not in balance. We did not get \nthe action to go with the words. I made a promise during my campaign \nthat I would vote for the balanced budget constitutional amendment. I \nknew what that was at the time, and I am here to do that.\n  The people of America want us to protect the future for our kids and \nour grandkids. Our kids want us to end the child abuse of taxation \nwithout representation, cosigning on notes for them without their \npermission. That is what we are doing by balancing the budget. I want \nto say that we either balance the budget--and I think we need the \ndiscipline based on these two stacks of 28 years of unbalanced budgets. \nWe need the discipline of a balanced budget constitutional amendment. \nIf we do not balance that budget we will be the longest running game \nshow, and we will wind up with the lowest possible ratings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, may I have a counting of the time, \nrespectfully, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes and 40 seconds. The \nSenator from Wyoming has 3 minutes and 4 seconds.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I have listened patiently to the \nanalysis of my amendment by Members of the minority and by Members of \nthe majority for some time. I am also aware of the uniqueness of the \nmoment. We are debating an amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates. The vote on that amendment is extraordinarily close. It is \nargued by my friend, the Senator from Utah, that the balanced budget \namendment is as good as we can produce. Mr. President, the Constitution \nof the United States is as close to perfection as has ever been \nachieved in managing the affairs of men and women. This is one case \nwhen good is not good enough. There are those who say that providing \nfor a capital budget and the ability to respond to international \nmilitary emergencies or national economic crises are simply amending \ngimmicks of a balanced budget amendment. Mr. President, meeting our \nhistoric responsibility to defend the United States in military \nemergencies, or dealing with economic recessions, or depressions is not \na gimmick. It is a profound responsibility.\n  I have voted for a balanced budget amendment on other occasions, and \nI want to do so again. I approach it with extraordinary regret because \nI believe that our generation should be no less in managing the \nfinancial affairs of this country than all of those who preceded us. \nThey did so because they cared about the future. They cared about the \ncountry, and they refused to abuse their ability and their power to \nborrow beyond their means. This generation has not so cared for the \ncountry.\n  So it is with real regret on previous occasions that I have voted for \na balanced budget amendment. But I rise today to amend this joint \nresolution to amend the Constitution of the United States because I \nseek for us to meet the same high standard as those who founded this \nRepublic and those who have cared for it through the years; not an \namendment that is good enough but one that approaches perfection.\n  I have offered three principal changes. The first is for a capital \nbudget. But I am told that it would be abused if we were to provide for \na separate capital budget to ensure that we were building an \ninfrastructure and maintaining a modern and productive means of \ncommerce in the country, that it would be abused by regular spending \nand consumption. Yet, the Senator from Utah knows that, whether his \namendment passes in its original form or with my amendment to it, \nenacting legislation will be required. His amendment is not operational \non its face and neither is mine. This Congress would have to return \nafter enactment by the States for enacting legislation to make it \noperational. And under the capital budgeting provisions we would \nclearly have to establish a separate and independent Government agency \nthat would review the actions of the President and the Congress to \nensure that anything in a capital budget is actually designed to \nenhance the productive capabilities of the country and its economy. We \ncould not allow items of consumption to be part of a capital budget. \nThat is the means by which every Governor operates in getting \nindependent authority to ensure that it is a genuine bondable \nexpenditure as I am sure my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, needed to \noperate as a mayor of his own community.\n  But at the end of the day, Mr. President, I leave my colleagues with \nthis reality because this isn't good enough. In our understandable and \njustifiable efforts to balance the budget of the United States, the \nprincipal victim is long-term investment in this country--2 million \nmiles of substandard roads, a quarter of a million bridges that are not \nsafe or operational, deteriorating ports, 100 billion dollars' worth of \nrepairs needed in our schools. We are last among the industrialized \nnations of the world in planning for our future. Without a capital \nbudget, the internal pressures of this institution are going to force \nprotecting consumption and victimizing planning and investment. It is \nnot enough to rise on in this floor and say that a capital budget might \nbe abused but not provide an answer to this reality.\n  Second, we are told that a war powers exemption, the ability to \ndeficit spend if the United States is facing an imminent military \nthreat, could not be accommodated despite the historic analogies that I \nhave raised in World War II, the Persian Gulf, World War I, all of \nwhich required deficit spending in advance of a declaration of war.\n  I am told by my friend, the Senator from Utah, that the cold war is \nevidence that my analogies are not sufficient because we could have \nused this as an excuse throughout the cold war for deficit spending \nunless we have agreement. In 1962, with a nation only hours away, \nduring the worst of the cold war, during the Cuban military crisis, \nJohn Kennedy mobilized the American Armed Forces. The United States was \nin deficit. It was also facing an imminent threat of war. In the Berlin \ncrisis, in succeeding crises of the cold war, the President of the \nUnited States and our military leadership needed the ability to respond \nimmediately. The vision of the amendment of the Senator from Utah is \nthat upon a declaration of war and a three-fifths vote we will then \nrespond and defend the national interest. It is good. It is a good \namendment. It does not approach the historic standards of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Finally, we are told the country has the means and the ability to \nrespond to the vagaries of the business cycle without the need or the \nability to borrow.\n  History teaches us a different result. This Nation has learned a \npainful lesson from a historic perspective when capitalism fails or \ngoes through intense difficulties. The debate in Europe and in the \nUnited States in the 1930's was often between those who believed that \nthe future belonged to fascism and those who believed it belonged to \ncommunism, democratic communism or fascism. Democratic capitalism, to \nmany, was an anachronism that had failed in the depths of the \nDepression. Capitalism was saved by the easing of the business cycle. \nWe learned how in times of high unemployment and deep recession to \nprevent the national economy from victimizing our own people. The \ntriumph of capitalism, as certainly as it was earned on the \nbattlefields and through ideological struggle, was also earned by our \nlearning how to deal with the difficulties of recession, the pain of \ndepression, by using the fiscal and budgetary powers of the U.S. \nGovernment to care for the Nation in times of real need.\n\n[[Page S1628]]\n\n  The Senator from Utah says his amendment is good enough; we can have \na vote to ease its restrictions. Good is not good enough. The level of \nperfection required to amend the Constitution of the United States \nrequires more. These are not theoretical problems, not in another \ncentury, not even in a different generation. Each of them has been \nexperienced in our own time--dealing with the problems of recession, \nthe regular and serious problems of international conflict, and the \ndeterioration of national investment.\n  I stand here prepared to vote to change the Constitution of the \nUnited States. It is something that I believe requires an extraordinary \nburden of proof. Anyone attempting to change this document must bear a \nhigher burden than in any other Chamber and undertaking any other \nlegislative goal because the Constitution of the United States has no \npeer. I am prepared to recognize that this burden would be met given \nthe mounting problems of debt in this Nation and the need to restore \nsome permanent fiscal responsibility, but it cannot be met unless these \nquestions are answered.\n  Constitutions are not written for any one time. Laws are written for \nour time. Constitutions are written for all time. I need the Senator \nfrom Utah to explain to me how a generation unborn, in circumstances \nunforeseen, will deal with renewed military hostilities, deep \nrecessions, with the problem of international economic competitiveness \nin the face of declining national investment. I offer my vote for \nchange, will accept that this burden of proof has been met and will \notherwise change a document which I believe in only the rarest of \ninstances we ever meet the burden of change----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. But that requires enactment of this amendment and \nanswers to these questions.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I might ask unanimous consent just to \nset aside the pending amendment and offer an amendment and lay that \naside. I have been told by the floor staff that would expedite matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming was recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I assume that that will not come out of my time, if that \nwere to happen.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ENZI. We are running out of time. I am sure that will not happen \nin my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time will not be charged for \nunanimous consent.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague so very much.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 16\n\n (Purpose: To provide Federal assistance to supplement State and local \nefforts to alleviate the damage, loss, hardship and suffering caused by \n   disasters or emergencies by exempting spending that is designated \n    emergency requirements by both the President and the Congress.)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment, and I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be set aside for debate at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 16:\n       At the end of Section 5, add the following: ``The \n     provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal year \n     in which there is a declaration made by the President (and a \n     designation by the Congress) that a major disaster or \n     emergency exists, adopted by a majority vote in each House of \n     those present and voting.''\n\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his comments, his \nanswers, and his passion. We share that passion for this country. I am \npleased to be in the entering class with him.\n  I appreciate the approach that he has taken was not set on a course \nto scare anybody but to get something done, and I really appreciate \nthat. I am appreciative also of the talk that we are having here on \nthis floor about good accounting systems. That is of the utmost \nnecessity for our country and for us.\n  The reason it is important for us is to know exactly where we are. I \npledge I will work with the Senator from New Jersey to get those kinds \nof accounting procedures so that we can do the kinds of things we need \nto do for this United States and do it within the constraints of a \nbalanced budget so we are not continuing to pass on things to our kids \nand our grandkids.\n  I will remind everybody that we cannot go into a capital budget \nsituation without the clarification that we are not just creating \nanother loophole. When I was in the legislature, one of the biggest \nfrustrations I had was that we would propose the bill, and I knew there \nwere people listening to that proposition who were already designing \nloopholes in the bill, ways to get around what we were doing and not \nsharing with us the ways to get around what we were trying to do. That \nis what we have to overcome, with the immense responsibility that we \nhave in amending the Constitution.\n  I think the original amendment has that capability. I think it is \nimportant that we vote for the original amendment, not the substitute, \nbut that under any circumstance we do have a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment that will preserve this country for ourselves, \nour kids, and our grandkids, and make sure that we are taking care of \nour parents and our grandparents.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Does the Senator from Wyoming yield back the remainder of his time? \nHe has 27 seconds.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 37, nays 63, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 16 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--37\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--63\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith, Bob\n     Smith, Gordon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 15) was rejected.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, under the previous order, I was to be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 17\n\n              (Purpose: To propose a substitute amendment)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is in the nature of a substitute.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Ford, Mr.\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\n     Reid, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Landrieu, \n     and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered 17.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe considered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following:\n       That the following article is proposed as an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid \n     to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when \n     ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several \n     States within seven years after the date of its submission to \n     the States for ratification:\n\n                              ``Article--\n\n       ``Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall \n     provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts \n     by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States \n     held by the public shall not be increased, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law \n     for such an increase by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays \n     do not exceed total receipts.\n       ``Section 4.

This article shall take effect beginning with \n     fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning \n     after its ratification, whichever is later.''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Ford, Mr. Reid, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Wyden, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Johnson.\n  Mr. President, I would like, as I offer this amendment, to describe \nit and begin at the beginning. I know that this issue has been debated \nagain and again, and yet it seems to me it is probably appropriate now \nto describe what this is and what it is not.\n  Mr. President, I offer a substitute constitutional amendment. This \nsubstitute is essentially the same as the amendment offered by Senator \nHatch, amended, if it would have been amended, by the amendment offered \nby Senator Reid. Senator Reid offered a perfecting amendment. It \nfailed. So I am offering a substitute constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget.\n  Mr. President, the stack of books that has resided on that desk for \nsome long time now is apparently designed to illustrate a number of \nbudgets that have not been in balance. There is no one in this Chamber, \nI believe, who stands on the floor of the Senate trying to make a case \nfor unbalanced budgets. I have known no one who stands up and says, \n``I've come from my office to the floor of the Senate to put in a few \ngood words about the deficit,'' or, ``I come to the floor to be a \nchampion of Federal debt.'' I know of no one who says that, no one who \nbelieves that, and no one who comes and argues that on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  There is not a difference, it seems to me, about the will or the \ninterest of Members of the Senate to see a balanced budget. This \nGovernment ought to spend within its means. It ought not keep charging \nconsumption today to our children and grandchildren. We ought not \ncontinue to add to the Federal debt. We ought to have some fiscal \npolicy that is in balance.\n  But this is not about balancing the budget. This debate is about \naltering the Constitution of the United States. We can alter the \nConstitution of the United States at 3 o'clock--that is 1 minute from \nnow--and at 1 minute after 3, there will not have been one cent \ndifference in the Federal debt or Federal budget deficits.\n  So it is about altering the Constitution. How do we do that? Should \nwe do that? We have some people who come to this floor wanting to alter \nthis Constitution at the drop of a hat. Some people think the \nConstitution is a rough draft and they have better ideas.\n  Last year we had three proposals to alter the Constitution offered in \n1 month here in the U.S. Senate--three. We have had about 2,000 or \n3,000 proposals to alter the Constitution since it was written. I do \nnot peer around the Senate--and I do not mean this to sound \ndisrespectful of the wonderful people I serve with--but I do not really \nsee Madison and Mason and Franklin and George Washington. Thomas \nJefferson was not at the constitutional convention. He was in Europe at \nthe time, but he contributed greatly to the Bill of Rights and \nespecially the first amendment. It is hard to recognize the folks here \nand compare them to those who wrote the Constitution. But we sure have \na lot of folks who want to alter the Constitution.\n  Last evening I was at the National Archives, and I got to take a look \nat Thomas Jefferson's original draft of the Declaration of \nIndependence, written, I think, when he was 33 years old.\n  I got a chance to take a look at the Senate markup of the Bill of \nRights. It is really quite remarkable when you see the documents that \nrepresent the framework of our democracy, the system of Government, \ncreated in a Constitution of the United States by some wonderful \npeople.\n  Included in the Constitution is a procedure by which we can change \nit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes Senate Joint \nResolution 1 on Thursday at 11 a.m., Senator Graham of Florida be \nrecognized to offer his amendment regarding public debt; I further ask \nunanimous consent that there be 90 minutes for debate equally divided \nin the usual form, and following the expiration or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Graham \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \nvote on the Dorgan amendment today, the Senate resume consideration of \nSenator Boxer's amendment No. 16 relating to a disaster exemption, and \nthe amendment be limited to 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the \nusual form, with a vote occurring on or in relation to the Boxer \namendment at the expiration or yielding back of any debate time.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, immediately \nfollowing the disposition of the Graham amendment, the Senate resume \nconsideration of Senator Feingold's amendment No. 13 under a 30-minute \ndebate limitation equally divided in the usual form, and following that \ndebate, the Senate resume debate on Senator Feingold's amendment No. 14 \nunder a 40-minute time limitation equally divided, after which both \nFeingold amendments will be temporarily set aside, and the Senate will \nthen begin 2 hours of debate equally divided on the Kennedy amendment \nNo. 10.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \nexpiration or yielding back of that debate time, the Senate proceed to \na vote on or in relation to the Kennedy amendment No. 10, to be \nfollowed by 1 minute equally divided for debate, then a vote on or in \nrelation to the Feingold amendment No. 13, to be followed by 1 minute \nequally divided for debate, and a vote on or in relation to the \nFeingold amendment No. 14.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following those votes, the \nSenate begin 2 hours of debate equally divided on the Bumpers amendment \nNo. 12, with a vote occurring on or in relation to the Bumpers \namendment at the expiration or yielding back of time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We do not object.\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 17\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I was in the process before the \nunanimous-consent requests of just trying to describe exactly where we \nare and what we are doing here. I was talking about the Constitution of \nthe United States. I pointed out that there is a process in the \nConstitution of the United States that describes how we can change the \nConstitution. And we have, in fact, changed it from time to time.\n  I was not around, but I recall that we changed it and put something \ncalled the 18th amendment in the Constitution. That had to do with \noutlawing drinking; it was called prohibition. And then if you go to \nthe 21st amendment to the Constitution, it says the 18th amendment to \nthe Constitution is hereby repealed. That is a short, little amendment. \nThat is the 21st amendment to the Constitution. I guess because at that \npoint the American people felt we made a mistake on the 18th amendment, \nso the Framers of the Constitution not only provided a method by which \nwe could change the Constitution but also described how we might \ncorrect a mistake. It is far better, however, not to make a mistake \nwhen you are changing the Constitution of the United States. There is a \nright way to do it and a wrong way to do it. This is not a debate so \nmuch about whether we should balance the budget. We should, and some of \nus have cast tough votes to reduce the budget deficit by 60 percent. \nSome have not cast those tough votes. Some have just bellowed on the \nfloor of the Senate, thumbing their suspenders and going out and \npuffing on their cigars and ranting to anybody who listens, how much \nthey oppose the deficit. But would they vote to reduce the deficit? No, \nit was ``count them out.'' They just wanted to talk about it.\n\n  Some of us have cast hard and tough votes and paid a price to reduce \nthe budget deficit. The only way you can reduce the budget deficit is \nindividual votes on taxing and spending issues. You can change the \nConstitution until you are purple, and it will not alter the budget \ndeficit or the Federal debt.\n  Shall we, however, change the Constitution? I say that yes, there are \ncircumstances under which I will support that, and I have supported \namending the Constitution dealing with fiscal policy, because I think \nthere is merit--especially after the last decade and a half--there is \nmerit in suggesting that the fiscal discipline that would come from \nrequiring a balanced budget in the Constitution would be worthy and \nworthwhile. So then the question is, if a suggestion to alter the \nConstitution to require a balanced budget has merit, how do you alter \nthe Constitution to do that? That is the question today.\n  I have said before, and the Senator from Utah will not find it \nsurprising, that I think this amendment is terribly flawed with respect \nto the Social Security surpluses that it will use to claim it has \nbalanced the budget.\n  Madam President, when Abe Lincoln and Stephen Douglas were involved \nin their famous debates, I was reading at one point that Abe Lincoln \nwas enormously frustrated with Douglas because he could not get Douglas \nto understand his point. He just could not get it through. Finally, he \nsaid to Douglas, ``Listen, tell me, how many legs does a horse have?'' \nMr. Douglas said, ``Why, four of course.'' Lincoln said, ``Yes, and now \nif you call a horse's tail a leg, then how many legs will the horse \nhave?'' And Douglas said, ``Why, five.'' And Lincoln said, ``You see, \nthat is where you are wrong. Simply calling a tail a leg does not make \nit a leg at all.''\n  That is what we have here. We have a tail called a leg. They say if \nwe pass this constitutional amendment to balance the budget, the budget \nwill be balanced. But a ninth grader with elementary math will have \nknown the budget is not balanced because, guess what? This will \nenshrine in the Constitution a practice of using $1 trillion and more \nof Social Security trust funds, and in the year in which they claim the \nbudget is balanced, that neon debt clock that ratchets up the Federal \ndebt so we can all see where it is going, that debt clock will keep \ngoing, because the very year in which the budget is supposedly balanced \nthe Federal debt will increase by $130 billion. The year in which the \nFederal deficit that is supposed to have been in balance, eliminate the \ndeficit, 2002, the year in which those who support this will claim they \nhave eliminated the Federal deficit, they will have to increase the \nFederal debt limit by $130 billion.\n  I have asked why, I guess for 2 weeks now, and no one will be able to \nanswer: Why is the Federal debt continuing to increase at a time when \nthey claim they balance the budget? Because they will have locked in \nthe Constitution a process that allows them to use tens and tens of \nbillions of dollars that are needed elsewhere, that are taken from \nworkers out of paychecks to put in a trust fund to be saved for the \nfuture. They are able to use that money over here to claim they \nbalanced the budget even as the Federal debt continues to increase. \nThat is the weakness and the fatal flaw of this proposal. That is why \nthis is not a balanced budget proposal. That is why this is \nmasquerading as a leg, when, in fact, it is not a leg at all.\n  Now, I want to go back to the beginning, and I know that for some \nthis is probably a debate that provides wonderful sleep medicine. It is \nso filled with complexity and dates and positions and laws. But I want \nto go back to the beginning, in 1983. In 1983, there were no Social \nSecurity surpluses. The Social Security system was taking in almost as \nmuch as it was spending out. But we knew that, in the long term, there \nwas going to be a real problem because we knew of the baby boom--the \nlargest baby crop in the history of our country. These folks would \neventually find their way through the work system and go onto the \nretirement rolls, and we knew that at some time we would have a \nproblem.\n\n  In 1983, the Greenspan commission convened and said, all right, \nRepublicans and Democrats and outsiders and insiders working, here is a \nmenu or a strategy by which we are going to respond to this problem in \nour country, where in the future we have the largest baby group retire, \nsupported by the smallest working group, and we have a demographic time \nbomb and a problem. Here is the recipe by which we address it. That \nrecipe included a lot of things. It included increasing the retirement \nage, beginning after the turn of the century, to age 67. That extends \nout some long while before it finally happens, but it goes to 67, the \nnew retirement age. That was done in 1983. A series of benefits were \ncut from the Social Security system in 1983. In addition to that, \nSocial Security payroll taxes were increased for workers and for \nemployers in 1983 and beyond. And the point and purpose was that the \nSocial Security system would accrue a surplus, year by year, to be used \nlater when it is needed.\n  I would like to just show my colleagues some of these surpluses that \nare going to exist. This chart shows what is happening to the Social \nSecurity trust fund. The Social Security trust fund isn't contributing \na penny to the Federal deficit. In fact, the taxes taken out of the \nworkers' paychecks and the taxes coming in from business, which are \nbeing paid for the purpose of keeping the Social Security system \nsolvent, are in this year $78 billion more than is necessary to be \nspent in Social Security--just this year, $78 billion more. But you \nwill see from the chart, every year from 1996 on up to the year 2010--\nand the surplus goes on out to 2019--surpluses every single year. This \nprogram doesn't contribute a penny to the Federal budget deficit, not a \npenny. It is taking in far more than it is using, at this point, every \nsingle year. This year, $78 billion more than is spent--just in this \nyear alone--is taken in and put into the Social Security trust fund.\n  Now, I don't think those facts are in dispute. At least I have not \nheard anybody come to contest them. These are numbers from the Social \nSecurity Administration. I think the Congressional Budget Office \nreaffirms these numbers. Nobody is contesting that. So if these \nsurpluses exist, why do they exist? Why are workers paying more than is \nneeded to run the Social Security system today? Because the plan was to \nsave it for the future when they and their children will need it.\n  What happens under this constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget? Under the majority's proposal, this money is not part of a \nsavings account, in a trust fund. This money becomes\n\n[[Page S1631]]\n\npart of all the other money in the system. This money is no different \nthan a dollar of income tax. It is no different than any other dollar \nof revenue the Federal Government has and is used as an offset against \nall other spending.\n  In 1983, I was on the House Ways and Means Committee and we largely \naccepted the Greenspan commission's report. That report included a \nwhole series of steps to respond to the Social Security problem that we \nfaced. In 1983, when the Ways and Means Committee considered this \nlegislation, I offered an amendment and I had thought the amendment was \ndefeated. I said that on the floor, and I was wrong. I looked it up. \nThe amendment actually passed in the Ways and Means Committee of the \nHouse of Representatives. It was dropped out in conference with the \nSenate. That was before I served in the Senate, and I spoke less well \nof the Senate at that point. But the amendment I offered in the Ways \nand Means Committee was approved, and it got through the House. I want \nto describe the amendment, just to say that I am not on this floor as a \nJohnny-come-lately on this issue.\n\n  Fourteen years ago, in 1983, when we debated the Social Security \nreform package in the Ways and Means Committee, which was the committee \nof jurisdiction--that is where it all originated, and I was a member of \nthe committee--I offered an amendment on March 1. My amendment was \nexactly what I am talking about here, in 1997, in the U.S. Senate, to \ntake the Social Security system and its trust funds and the surpluses \nit is going to have out of the unified budget so that its money cannot \nbe used for every other purpose in Government that some would want to \nuse it for--take it out, separate it, make Social Security whole and \nmake decisions about Social Security, both on spending and taxing, on \nthe basis of whether you are going to make the Social Security System \nsolvent. Don't make Social Security decisions on the basis of whether \nyou want to fund the star wars program, or whether you want to fund \nsome other program in some other agency. Make decisions about Social \nSecurity and its future based upon the merits of Social Security \nsolvency. On March 1, 1983, I offered an amendment. The amendment would \nhave removed the Social Security system from the unified budget \neffective October 1, 1988. I gave it a 5-year phase-in, so it could be \nremoved completely in 1988. I made a statement. I will not make it \ntoday, but it is essentially what I have been saying ever since. There \nis a tendency for everyone to want to use those funds for purposes \nother than solvency of the Social Security system.\n  Now, when I offered that amendment, in 1983, I was supported, among \nothers, by Congressman Archer, who now happens to be chairman of the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee. Congressman Archer made the point in \n1983 that ``if the Social Security funds are permitted to be used in \nthe unified budget, it will distort all of the spending and permit \nmassive deficit spending out of the general fund.'' And so Congressman \nArcher supported me--a Republican, now head of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, supported me. Congressman Gradison supported me, also a \nRepublican on the Ways and Means Committee.\n  The point is, in 1983, we started down the road of doing the right \nthing with my amendment, and then it got thwarted. Here we are, 14 \nyears later, building substantial surpluses in the system that we need \nwhen the baby boomers retire. This constitutional amendment--yes, every \nPresident, including this President, and every Congress, including this \nCongress, has used the money the same way. It is wrong. The budget \ndeficit, last year, was not $107 billion, as advertised by the CBO; it \nwas $107 billion plus the $70 billion they used of Social Security \nfunds. The same was true back when it was a Federal deficit of nearly \n$300 billion. It was more than that, because then they were using the \nSocial Security funds as well.\n  My point is, the proposal in the Senate will enshrine in the \nConstitution a practice that is fundamentally wrong. It says, take all \nthese Social Security trust funds--one of the few sober things done in \nthe 1980's, to save for the future--and just throw them in with other \nrevenue and balance it out and measure it. If you come to zero, that is \nfine. But it is not fine, because nobody can answer the question I have \nasked: When you say you have come to zero, why does the Federal debt \ncontinue to increase? Why, in the year in which you claim you balance \nthe budget, does the debt increase $130 billion? Because you are not \ntruly saving in the Social Security trust funds. That is the point of \nthe substitute amendment I offer.\n  If we had done the right thing 14 years ago, in 1983, we would not \neven be discussing this. Well, we might. My fear back then was the \ntendency for those who want to get their mitts on this and use it for \nanother purpose.\n  But I can't think of one Member of Congress who would come to the \nfloor and say: I have a plan. Here is my plan. I think it is going to \nbe really politically popular. My plan is to tell workers and their \nemployers that we want to have them contribute to Social Security, and \nthen take some taxes from them and call it the Social Security tax, \npromise them to put it in a trust fund, promise that we are going to \ndedicate it for one purpose, and that it will be available when it is \nneeded in the future. And then the second part of my plan is more \nintriguing. The second part of the plan is that, once we get it, then \nignore all the promises and throw it in a pot with all the rest of the \nmoney and use it to add up the revenue so you can say you have balanced \nthe budget.\n  I would like to know of one man or woman serving in the House or \nSenate who is willing to stand up and wave their handkerchief and say, \n``Count me in, sign me up to that, let me do that right now.'' Is there \none? Is there one Senator? I do not think so. Yet, if you vote for this \nconstitutional amendment, that is exactly the proposition you support, \nexactly. There isn't any way to argue it another way.\n  You can argue that pigs fly and shrimp whistle and that this piece of \npaper is purple and that grass is black. You can argue it in whatever \nway you like. But when the day is done, what you have described, under \nthe constitutional amendment offered by the majority, is that you \nbelieve it is OK to take dedicated trust funds to the tune of over $1 \ntrillion and mix them up with other revenues so that you can claim you \nhave balanced the budget.\n  What I offer is a substitute constitutional amendment that includes \nthe Reid provision which, if passed, would prevent that very thing from \nhappening. It would say that, if we are going to balance the budget, we \nshould do it honestly. Let's do it honestly. It would say that at the \nend of the day when you have balanced the budget, the debt clock will \nnot still be increasing, the debt clock will be a stopwatch, and there \nwill be no increase in the Federal debt. Maybe we will start seeing a \npaydown or a drawdown on the debt. Wouldn't that be a nice thing to see \nhappen? The proposal that is on the floor of the Senate by the majority \nwould enshrine in the Constitution this practice which I have \ndescribed. My substitute constitutional amendment would prevent that \nvery practice. That is a pretty stark difference. Those who want a \nconstitutional amendment, those who want a balanced budget, if they \nwill support my substitute--I think we will have 70 to 75 votes this \nafternoon--we will have a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, and we will have done it the right way and we will not have \nmisused the Social Security trust funds.\n  We have a law. I know Senator Hollings has been over to the floor. \nLong after 1983 when I did what I did in the House Ways and Means \nCommittee successfully, but then it was dropped in conference, Senator \nHollings in 1990 wrote a law that requires the Social Security System \nto be treated as off budget and not part of the unified budget. That is \nnow the law, section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act. Senator \nHollings has talked about it a number of times. That existing law will \neffectively be nullified by this constitutional amendment. Senator \nHollings makes that point. There is no one in this Chamber who has said \nSenator Hollings is wrong because they can't say he is wrong. This \nconstitutional amendment will nullify Senator Hollings' law. And it \nwill enshrine in the Constitution a practice that I think is \nfundamentally wrong.\n  I said last year that we have three different arguments, and it is \nhard for me to reconcile them. I try to keep them straight.\n\n[[Page S1632]]\n\n  There is one group who stands up and says, ``What are you talking \nabout, the Social Security trust fund? Don't you know there is no trust \nfund? There is no Social Security trust fund.''\n  Then we have the second position. These are the three stages of \ndenial. The second position is, ``Yes, there is a trust fund, but we \ninsist we are not misusing it.''\n  The third position is, ``There is a trust fund. We are misusing it, \nand we pledge to stop doing so in the year 2008.'' That was the third \nthing I was told on the Senate floor in the 1995 debate.\n  So those are the three stages of denial as best I am able to \ninterpret them.\n  I don't know what people think when they hear this debate about this \nissue because it is so intriguing to see all of this maneuvering and \nmovement. This is not rocket science. It is important. It is critically \nimportant. But it is not rocket science to understand that you have a \ncertain amount of money, a certain amount of expenditure, and a certain \nmoney dedicated for a certain thing. So you have money left. Either it \nmatches or it doesn't. Let's say that we take the amount of money \ndedicated for something else and bring it over here and claim it is all \nmatched up. It doesn't take sophisticated mathematics to understand the \nbankruptcy of that. That is why you end up, when they say they have \nbalanced the budget, with $130 billion in increased debt.\n\n  The Congressional Research Service has reviewed this matter several \ntimes. I am amused actually by the folks who came rushing to the floor \nof the Senate with six dozen different interpretations of the \nCongressional Research Service missive on this issue.\n  But the Congressional Research Service has concluded something \ninteresting. What they have concluded is that, under the majority's \nproposed balanced budget amendment, if you save this money to be used \nfor the future, you can't spend it in the future, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, unless when you decide to spend it you \nhave a corresponding tax increase or a corresponding budget cut \nsomewhere else. You are simply, with this amendment that they are \noffering, prevented from spending the savings that you have accrued.\n  That will be interesting--when somebody shows up for their Christmas \nClub savings account or to cash in their bonds someplace and the bank \nsays, ``Well, the only way you can take your savings out is if you \ncough up a like amount yourself,'' people would look at them like they \nhave been drinking all afternoon.\n  That is exactly what the Congressional Research Service says is \nrequired by enshrining this practice in the Constitution: save money \nfor a specific purpose and then later call on that money to be used, \nwhat are you required to do? Raise taxes in order to use it. That is \nnot much of a bargain, in my judgment. That is what the Congressional \nResearch Service says. We had people knocking each other down at the \ndoor over here trying to get through the door waving several iterations \nof the Congressional Research Service memos, all of which said the same \nthing with different language.\n  So they all had a chance to wrap it around on the floor, wave it, \ncreate a bunch of wind with it, and all of them said exactly the same \nthing. There isn't any way, with the proposal that we have before the \nSenate, where you can use the savings that we have promised people we \nwould use for Social Security unless it is timely to do it. You either \ncut other spending or raise other taxes to do so.\n  There are other points that I wanted to make. But I am going to at \nthis point conclude my remarks--there are others who want to speak on \nthis issue--by saying this:\n  There have been a lot of polls cited about this issue on the floor of \nthe Senate. Frankly, I think there are too many polls in our country, \nand there are too many pollsters in our country. I wish people would \nstop polling and stop worrying what the pollsters are telling us and do \nwhat is in their guts, but do what they think is right, do what the \nmessage somewhere between the brain and the pit of the stomach tells \nthem is right to themselves and to their constituents of the country. I \nam a little tired of hearing about this poll or that poll, this cross \ntab and that cross tab. Yes, the polls will show that the American \npeople want a balanced budget, that they support a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, and, yes, polls will show, if you ask \nthem the question: ``Should you enshrine in the Constitution the issue \nof Social Security trust fund?'' those same people will say, ``No; \nabsolutely not.'' Seventy to seventy-five percent will say that is \nfundamentally wrong.\n  So you can find polls every way from Sunday to support every position \non the floor of the Senate. The only thing that matters to the American \npeople, in my judgment, is, are we going to make the decision to \nhonestly balance this budget? If one of those decisions is to alter the \nU.S. Constitution to require more fiscal discipline, I will participate \nin doing so and I will vote for it. But I will not in any event vote \nfor a proposition that alters the Constitution that will in my judgment \nrequire us to come back just as we did on the 21st amendment and repeal \nit because it is a dishonest budgeting practice--yes, practiced by both \npolitical parties. It is dishonest, in my judgment. It takes from those \nwho are now paying taxes under the pretense of savings for the future \nwhen they are going to need it, and it says to them, ``We will give you \nan IOU instead'' that we are not going to be able to pay because we are \ngoing to use the money now. That engages in a practice of let us \npretend that we have balanced the budget even as we increased the debt.\n\n  When this is an honest proposal, and a proposal as I offered as a \nsubstitute that is an honest proposal that will not allow that budget \npractice to occur, then we will alter the Constitution. If my friends \nin this Chamber who are anxious to alter the Constitution will join us \nin doing it the right way, they will have this afternoon 70 to 75 votes \nfor doing it and they will be able to celebrate an achievement that is \nsignificant. If not, they may not be able to alter the Constitution \nbecause there are some of us who refuse to support something that is as \nflawed as that which is being proposed on the floor of the Senate \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I have appreciated the history lesson in \npreserving the Social Security system. I wish that the history lesson \nincluded a much better ending than where the Senator ended. I wish that \nthe Senator's amendment included an ending for where we are going. The \nSenator's chart goes out to the year 2010. I think he could have \ncarried it out to the year 2019 and had a pretty good-looking chart. It \nstarts to curve off the other end if you get past 2010. So he is \nshowing the best of the best, the best times for building up money that \nshould be in a reserve for Social Security. He is leaving off the time \nthat it starts to taper off. And the Senator is leaving off the real \nlie of a substitute amendment that says take Social Security off \nbudget. The Senator is leaving out the part where we have to pay in for \nmy generation to draw the money out. The Senator is talking about a \nshort-term solution rather than a longer term solution. We have to have \na long-term solution.\n\n  I appreciate the efforts the Senator went to when he was in the \nHouse. We have to have a long-term solution for that. And we have to do \nit through enabling legislation so that it doesn't just cover from now \ntill the best of times but covers from now till the best of times \nthrough the worst of times. We need to have an accounting system for \nSocial Security that is honest with our seniors.\n  One of the things I have been doing through this debate is to mention \nthat we are not even talking about what the true cost is out there of \nmaking this system actuarially sound, of putting the same kind of \nrequirement on this retirement fund that we have forced on every \nbusiness retirement fund in this country, one that includes annual \naudits to make sure that we are not lying with those business pensions \nthe way we are lying with Social Security.\n  We tell the businesses of this country that they are going to take \ntheir pension funds and they are going to contribute to those pension \nfunds to the extent that the money will be there at the time that the \nperson retires so that\n\n[[Page S1633]]\n\nthey will have an annuity that lasts through the rest of their \nlifetime. There is a variety of them. Some of them have COLA's with \nthem, some of them do not have COLA's with them. But there is an honest \nattempt by the Senate and the U.S. Government to force them to have \nmoney on hand, true money on hand, true trust funds that will pay those \npeople through the time they expect to be paid. Then we turn around and \nwe say, well, that is not the requirement for us. The Senator is trying \nto go to that in the amendment, but he does not get all the way. He \nonly gets through the good times and we do not talk about the future \ntimes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for a question, I would be \nhappy to share the time with him on this.\n  Mr. ENZI. As long as it does not come out of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to ask the question and have the response \ncome out of my time.\n  This is a chart that shows what happens to Social Security through \n2035. The Senator is correct: at 2029, you run out of money; there is \nnothing left in the trust fund. And the purpose of this saving, \nincidentally, is so that you have an amount of money to cover the \ndeficits, at least between 2019 and 2029. There are going to have to be \ndeficits beyond 2019, no question. But with this constitutional \namendment, if you do not have this money available, what you have done \nis you have shortened the life of the Social Security trust fund by 10 \nyears--10 years, and that is the problem. Current law provides that the \ntrust fund will go broke in 2029 or thereabouts. But this \nconstitutional amendment that is on the floor would in effect make the \ntrust fund go broke 10 years earlier, unless the Government raises \ntaxes or cuts spending to fund the deficits between 2019 and 2029. So \nthe question of the responsibility here on the side of saving to meet \nthe future, the constitutional amendment that the Senator supports does \nprecisely the opposite, and that is the point I was trying to make.\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, the constitutional amendment that I \nsupport recognizes the red that is out there on the end as well as the \ngreen and recognizes a need to stop doing to Social Security what that \nhuge green there shows at the present time. I am saying that we need to \nstart recognizing Social Security honestly, not calling it off budget \nso we can force things into Social Security in future years by merely \nnaming them ``Social Security'' and not having to account for them in \nthe deficit--to recognize them honestly.\n  Our seniors think that there is a trust fund out there, that there is \nmoney out there that will continue to fund them. I am always fascinated \nwhen I see the articles which suggest that we should privatize Social \nSecurity. If we tried to privatize it, we would recognize that it does \nnot have the money there; that the money is not there to be able to do \nit because we have this system of taking the money that is paid in now \nand spending it at the moment that it is paid in, with a piddly \nsurplus. And when you look at the future of Social Security, that \nlittle green line there is not a big surplus. It is $1.3 trillion, but \nthat is not a big surplus. The actuarial liability on the Social \nSecurity system is $9.2 trillion.\n  This is money that people expect to be there. We are giving the \nimpression that it is there. This balanced budget constitutional \namendment is not a constitutional amendment just for the next few \nyears. It is a balanced budget constitutional amendment hopefully for \nthe rest of the history of the United States, and it will require us to \nhave good accounting.\n  As an accountant, I have been fascinated with all of the debate that \nwe have had in this process to talk about things that we should be \ndoing as a nation. This is the place we have to start, not by scaring \nour seniors but by answering our seniors, not by scaring our seniors \nbut by setting up a system where they understand the system and where \nit is and help us to force the kind of accounting, the kind of \ndisclosure that will help to assure that that money will be there, not \njust for the ones on the system now but for you and me and the \ngenerations to come.\n  I have explained before that the kids in this country, if you ask \nthem if they are going to get Social Security, will agree that they are \nmore likely to see an unidentified flying object, than to see $1 of \ntheir Social Security money.\n  They already believe they are not going to get this money, and they \nare paying 7.45 percent of their paycheck, every time they get one, \ninto Social Security. And that is being matched by their employer for \nanother 7.45 percent. That is almost 15 percent. That would be one tidy \npension fund if it were truly a pension fund.\n  I keep asking, if we do not have good accounting for this, beyond the \nyear 2010, not just for the present time, will not that next generation \ncause a revolution in this country if they are paying, and there are \nestimates that they will be paying 84 percent of their wages in taxes--\nthat includes their Social Security taxes, 84 percent of their taxes, \nand at a point that will only be going to pay interest on the national \ndebt. It will not build another road that we have been talking about in \ncapital budgeting. It will not add to the defense of this country that \nwe have been talking about. It will not provide anything for education \nthat we have been talking about. It will pay interest on the national \ndebt.\n  Now, if you and I were paying all of our taxes, and they are not \nnearly as high as what we are talking about those kids paying, if we \nwere paying all of that and it was only paying interest on the national \ndebt, what would we do? We would say we paid into that fund. How come \nwe are not going to get it? Is anybody entitled to it? I am afraid \nthere could be a revolutionary generation there. They may do it calmly \nand precisely by joining this body and the one down there and the \nPresidency and taking that away because they will be paying taxes that \nthey have never see. That is what they already believe.\n  If we move Social Security off budget, if we quit having to account \nfor it as part of the deficit--we can add more stringent requirements \nto the balanced budget constitutional amendment that is before us, we \ncan add more stringent requirements to that to recognize what has been \nsaid here, and it can be done through a normal statute, the enabling \nact, for instance. We can put the enabling legislation in it that will \ntake care of recognizing the surplus spending we are having now and the \nhuge deficits we are going to have in the future.\n  I remember not too long ago sitting in on the President's State of \nthe Union Message, and I was kind of surprised when he got to page 2, \nabout halfway down the page, after he had said all the things about how \nwe needed to be bipartisan and how we needed to balance the budget and \nwe did not need a balanced budget constitutional amendment to do that; \nwe just needed action, and then a couple of days later, making use of \nthe extra time that he was given by this body and the one across the \nhall, he presented a budget. And was it balanced? No, it was not \nbalanced. Did it do with Social Security what the Senator is talking \nabout doing? No, it did not do it.\n  Do we need other constraints to make sure that there is good \naccounting for Social Security? To make absolutely sure, as all of us \nwant to do, that there is Social Security there? No, it did not \nrecognize that surplus from Social Security in such a way as to \npreserve it as a surplus.\n  I have said before that, individually, we all promise a balanced \nbudget; collectively we just don't seem to be able to get there. We \nhave to do that, for our kids and our grandkids.\n  And we cannot ignore the seniors in 2019. On behalf of the seniors, \nwe do need to recognize the debt, we do need to recognize what is \nhappening now and into the future. And we are only going to do that by \nlegislation forced on us by a balanced budget constitutional amendment \nand one that goes further than what is being done here. I join in \nprotecting Social Security, as would all the other Senators, but not \nthrough one that only solves half the problem.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to serve \nwith the distinguished Senator from Wyoming. I appreciated his \nstatement. I obviously disagree strongly with his contention that doing \nwhat he proposes to do will in any way strengthen Social Security. It \nwill do exactly the opposite. In fact, the surpluses that we are\n\n[[Page S1634]]\n\ndesiring to save are not going to be there and that is precisely my \npoint. Let us balance the budget, but let us also do what we need to do \nto make sure the surpluses are to be saved for the future.\n  I ask my friend from Wyoming, it is probably unfair for me to ask him \nthis, but if he is able to answer the question: Why, at a time when we \nhave a balanced budget, presumably, by the constitutional amendment and \nby the mandate, in 2002, why the Federal debt will continue to \nincrease? Is that not because the trust funds are used to show a \nbalanced budget?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, the reason that debt has to increase is a \nrequirement that we be honest with those seniors. That is being honest. \nThat is the utilization of those funds, which are a trust fund, which \nare an intergovernmental transfer that has to be recognized as a part \nof the Federal debt under the accounting system that we use. It is not \nan adequate accounting system to show where the money has gone.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If we are going to be honest with senior citizens and \ntake the money out of the trust fund and claim you take the money over \nhere but the Federal deficit keeps growing, isn't the purpose of \nlimiting the Federal deficit to discontinue the building of additional \ndebt? The whole purpose here, in my judgment, is to stop burdening the \nshoulders of our kids and grandkids with more debt. If we claim to \nbalance the budget at the very time the debt keeps increasing, what \nhave we added onto our children's shoulders? Shouldn't we, and if we \nshould, won't you join us--shouldn't we decide we want to do two \nthings: Balance the budget and stop the Federal debt from increasing? \nAre those not two goals we ought to aspire to? And if we are going to \nrequire discipline in the Constitution, shouldn't we aspire to acquire \nthat discipline rather than say we balanced the budget even as the \nFederal debt keeps increasing?\n  I am not asking the Senator to respond for everybody on his side of \nthe aisle, but I continue to ask the question, and will this week, \nbecause I think the Senator from Nevada and I have proposed something \nthat will respond to both issues. Let us balance the budget and let us \ndo so in a way that does not have the Federal debt continue to \nincrease, even after those who claim they have balanced the budget have \nfinished the job, according to them.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield to the Senator from Nevada, 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada 10 \nminutes and appreciate the response of the Senator from Wyoming. We \nobviously disagree on this, but I hope, as we move through this, maybe \nwe will all understand. I am going to vote for my substitute, as is the \nSenator from Nevada. I will support a constitutional amendment, the \nright one and the one that both discontinues deficits and discontinues \nthe growth in Federal debt.\n\n  I will be happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I saw my friend this afternoon offer the \namendment, my friend from North Dakota. I wanted to come to the floor \nfor a couple of reasons. One is to express my personal appreciation for \nthe determination and the expertise he has lent to this argument over \nthese last several years. The Senator from North Dakota has a \nbackground in finance. He was a State tax commissioner. He served in \nthe other body, the House of Representatives, on the Ways and Means \nCommittee for many Congresses. So he brought that with him when he came \nhere.\n  I have read with interest the numerous op-ed pieces he has written \nfor newspapers all over this country on this issue, on the matter now \nbefore this body. I do not think there is anyone--I can say with \ncertainty--there is no Senate delegation that has the financial \nexpertise that the delegation from North Dakota has. The senior Senator \nand the junior Senator from North Dakota are people whom I, and many \npeople in this body, look to for guidance when it comes to matters \ndealing with finances. So I express my appreciation, again publicly, to \nmy friend from North Dakota for what he has done to narrow the issue \nand to make sure that it is an understandable issue.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a moment? I deeply \nappreciate the compliments. There are probably too many compliments on \nthe floor of the Senate. I suspect there are a lot of people out there \nwho view us all as a bunch of windbags in blue suits. The fact is, \npeople judge us not on what they think we say or do here on the Senate \nfloor but whether the public policy we create improves their lives, \nwhether at the end of the day we advance this country's interests, \nwhether we have helped them find a way to send their kids to a better \nschool, whether we have helped them find a better job, whether kids \nhave an opportunity to breathe clean air and clean water.\n  Compliments aside, the real task is for us to do the right thing for \nthe future of this country, and that is part of this debate. When you \nput something in the Constitution, it ought to be right for the future \nof this country.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota--a couple of things. \nFirst of all, the debate that has taken place, and this is what I \nwanted to add, after my compliment, the debate that has taken place has \nled to the ability of the American public to understand this issue. Now \n75 percent of the American public agrees with us. That is not the way \nit was, when all this information that was not right was put out in \nyears past. We have been able to put this issue so the American public \nunderstands it.\n  That is, the amendment we are offering, the amendment that has been \noffered by my friend from North Dakota, of which I am a sponsor, is \nwhat I refer to as the honest balanced budget amendment. I have been \nstruck by the statements made by those proponents of the underlying \namendment who come on this floor and say we cannot balance the budget \nunless we use Social Security moneys. That is my whole point. I do not \nwant to do that. I want to balance the budget in the honest way and \nthat is the right way.\n  I ask a question to my friend from North Dakota. Why do we refer to \nthis as the honest balanced budget amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. It relates to the question I asked the Senator from \nWyoming a few moments ago. With the alternative that is being proposed, \nthe majority party's proposal, we will not achieve both a balanced \nbudget and a freezing of the debt. What we will have is an increase in \npublic debt, building up even as those in the Chamber claim they have \nbalanced the budget.\n  I come from a very small town, as I have said repeatedly: 300 people. \nOn Main Street on Saturday night everybody would come to downtown. The \nbarber would cut hair until midnight--a wonderful place. You could not \ntake this proposition we are talking about here today to my hometown \nand take it to the barber shop or the bar and tell people about it and \nhave them say, ``Yes, that sounds OK to me.'' There is not anybody who \nsays this sounds OK. You cannot take money from people's paychecks and \nsay to them this money we are taking is for Social Security and we \npromise to put it in a dedicated trust fund and we will save it for \nyou, you cannot do that and say: By the way, we have changed our mind. \nThe trust fund doesn't exist, or the trust fund exists and we are now \nmisusing it, or it does exist and we promise to stop misusing it in 15 \nyears. That does not work in a small town where people think through \nthese things a little more rationally than I think is exhibited by some \nof the debate in Congress.\n  What we are proposing is to amend the Constitution of the United \nStates the right way, sufficient so that at the end of the day we will \nrequire both the budget to be in balance and we will stop the growth of \nthe increase in the Federal debt.\n  Mr. REID. I would also hope that people would look closely at the \nvote yesterday on the amendment that I offered to Senate Joint \nResolution 1. We got 44 votes with one Senator being ill who is here \ntoday. And we will get on this amendment, I assume, a bare minimum 45 \nvotes. I hope there will be some people like John McCain. You really do \nnot have to talk about his courage. I think that has been established. \nIt was established even before he was confined for 6 or 7 years to a \nprison camp in Vietnam. He is a courageous man. I think part of his \ncourage\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\nwas, certainly, apparent yesterday when he decided to vote with us on \nthe amendment that I offered.\n  The senior Senator from Pennsylvania also voted with us.\n  I hope that we would get some other courageous people on the other \nside of the aisle to vote with us. Why? Because the balanced budget \ndebate would be over for all time, because we would have to balance a \nbudget. And it would be hard. We would have to make significant cuts or \nwe would have to phase in and balance the budget, maybe by the year \n2008, or maybe even 2010. But when that budget was balanced, I say to \nmy friend from North Dakota, the debt clock would no longer continue to \nrun.\n  I am willing to do that. If we are going to stop playing games with \nthe American public, then let's balance the budget the right way, the \nhonest way.\n  I had somebody come to me today and say, ``Well, if you want to take \nthe Social Security trust fund, why don't you take the other trust \nfunds?'' I told them the same thing I said on this floor yesterday. The \nSocial Security trust fund is where the big bucks are. As Willie Sutton \nsaid when they asked him why he robbed banks, he said, ``That's where \nthe money is.'' The other trust funds don't mean anything in the whole \nscheme of things. But when you have budget surpluses that go into the \ntrillions of dollars, that is the real money, and that is why we have \nto have a real honest balanced budget amendment. I hope the substitute \nis one that is adopted.\n  I read in the paper today that the majority leader had a trick up his \nsleeve. I hope the trick up his sleeve is they will vote for our \namendment. We can have a celebration. I repeat, the celebration would \nbe short-lived, because we would have to come back here, if the House \nadopts it and the States adopt it, and make some real tough decisions, \nbut we won't be playing games with the American public. We would have a \nreal balanced budget amendment.\n  Madam President, as I said yesterday, we are talking about small sums \nof money for millions of people. We don't have millions and billions \nand trillions of dollars that represent certain interests that want \nthis Senate Joint Resolution 1 passed. We represent small numbers in \ndollars but large numbers in people. They are concerned about whether \nor not they are going to continue to be able to get their check of $700 \na month to maintain their dignity. That is why this amendment is so \nimportant. We represent the working men and women of this country, not \njust the seniors, people who want to maintain the Social Security \nsystem for the years to come.\n  Social Security is the finest social program in the history of the \nworld. This substitute will allow this finest social program in the \nhistory of the world to continue. I support the amendment that has been \noffered by my friend and would certainly ask my friends on the other \nside of the aisle to support it also.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, in the short time that I have been here, \nand this is my first year in the Senate, which means I have been here \nabout 6 weeks, this is not even the first time we have debated and \nvoted on this particular issue. We have had it thrown out several \ndifferent ways, talked about several different ways, but it is always \nthe same thing that we are redoing.\n  Of course, one of the reasons we do that and one of the reasons we \nexclude those other trust funds we talked about is that this is where \nthe people are. It isn't this is where the dollars are, because we are \ntalking about deficits in the year 2019, we are talking about people \nwho rely on Social Security. There are people who need it badly, and \nthey scare easily at the thought of losing it, and should. We are right \nthere worrying about it with them, but we can't accept something that \nis half an answer.\n  I mentioned that we have voted on this three separate times. I think \nwe talked about it most of the ways that we can, but I want to try and \nanswer some of the questions.\n  Madam President, the balanced budget amendment does, indeed, require \na balanced budget. Outlays must not exceed receipts under section 1 of \nthis resolution. But it is also true that gross debt may still \nincrease, even if the budget is balanced. That is because the \nGovernment's exchange of securities for Social Security taxes is \ncounted as gross debt, and we had better count it somewhere. I don't \nthink there is anybody out there who wants us to take those funds and \nnot account for them somehow.\n  We passed a law that says that those Social Security funds have to be \ninvested in the Federal Government. That is where they are. The way \nthat we account for them is to show them as Government debt. Should we \nloan them and not show them as Government debt? It is merely an \naccounting or bookkeeping notation of what one agency of the Government \nowes another agency. It is analogous to a corporation buying back \nstocks and debentures. Such stocks and bonds are considered retired \nobligations that, once paid, have no economic or fiscal significance. \nThus, if we enact a balanced budget constitutional amendment, the debt \nthe United States owes to everyone, but itself, will stop growing. It \nwill not stop growing as long as we have the Social Security funds paid \nout as an investment in the Federal Government.\n  This type of debt, termed ``net debt'' or debt held by the public, is \nlegally enforceable, and it better be. But if we don't balance that \nbudget, the funds will not be there to pay this legal debt when the \ntime for the legal debt comes due. Those bonds that we have in that \ngreat storeroom called Social Security, the bonds that have already \nbeen loaned to the Federal Government, have to be paid off at the time \nthey come due. We will not be able to do that without a balanced \nbudget.\n\n  If the debt zooms because of interest payments of debt, which last \nyear amounted to $250 billion, budget deficits balloon with all the \ndire economic consequences, and we have been talking about those \neconomic consequences and the advantages of a balanced budget. To \nassure that budgets will be balanced, unless extraordinary situations \narise, debt held by the public cannot be increased unless there is a \nthree-fifths of the whole number of each House concurring.\n  That net debt is considered to be a far greater economic significance \nthan the gross debt is a widely held truism among economists. Indeed, \nin the study ``Analytical Perspectives: Budget of the United States \nGovernment Fiscal Year 1998,'' the Clinton administration concludes \nthat net debt, or borrowing from the public, whether by the Treasury or \nby some other Federal agency, has a significant impact on the economy.\n  On the other hand, the study also maintains that gross debt, or debt \nissued to Government accounts, does not have any of the economic \neffects of borrowing from the public. It is merely an internal \ntransaction between two accounts within the Government itself. We have \nto account for the debt. We have to account for it honestly, and we \nhave to balance the budget more than past the year 2010. A balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment is for all time until altered by us, \nand we don't do that on a regular basis. It is extremely tough.\n  Our forefathers did provide a mechanism for doing it. That is the \nprocess we are going through now, and they made it an extremely tough \none, with a two-thirds vote and then ratification by three-fourths of \nthe States.\n  If this balanced budget didn't have so much backing, would there be \nall of this opposition to having it? In checking, if just the Senators \nfrom the States that oppose the balanced budget did not ratify this, \nthere would never be a balanced budget constitutional amendment. But I \nknow from traveling out there that those States are saying we live \nunder a balanced budget constitutional amendment. It works. We don't \nhave to go through all of these other funny little accounting gimmicks \nto get there. The people know when it is balanced. You don't hear of \nlawsuits on a regular basis dealing with their balanced budget \nconstitutional amendments. Consequently, they will ratify this if they \ncan get Senators from those States to back a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I think that in a number of years, if not right now--I do think it \nwill happen right now. I think this is the most\n\n[[Page S1636]]\n\nimportant debate we could possibly be having in our lifetime because of \nthe consequences in our lifetime and for generations to come. This is \nthe most important thing we can be discussing. I do think if the last \nelection didn't make the difference, the next election will make the \ndifference, because people have promised their people at home that they \nwill vote for a balanced budget constitutional amendment. We have to \nmove on those promises so we can meet the expectations of the people at \nhome, the people who voted for us, the people who sent us here with a \ntrust in the political process. It is up to us now to fulfill that \ntrust. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the views offered by the Senator from \nWyoming made the point I have been trying to make so hard here this \nafternoon. The Senator from Wyoming indicated what the Senator from \nUtah has indicated before him, and others, saying that the gross debt \nwill continue to increase even after the budget is balanced because we \nhave to be honest about that to the senior citizens.\n  Gross debt will continue to increase--translated, that means that \nonce the budget is balanced, the Federal debt will continue to \nincrease. But they say, ``Gross debt is different than net debt; net \ndebt is different than gross debt,'' and it is, you know, ``Honey, \nyou're complaining about the credit card debt I owe, but you don't \nunderstand it's net debt versus gross debt. Net debt is more important \nthan gross debt. You just don't understand.''\n  I am sorry. Is it debt or is it not? Is it an obligation or is it \nnot? Will it have to be paid back or won't it? We know the answer to \nthat. Gross debt will continue to increase, the Senator says. That is \nthe problem. That strips naked the entire proposition here and is why I \nhope Senators will vote for the substitute constitutional amendment I \noffer.\n  When the Senator says people have promised to vote for a \nconstitutional amendment, they can vote for the one that I offer today, \nthe right one, the one that at the end of the day will not have a \nbudget in balance with gross Federal debt continuing to increase, but \nwill have instead a budget that is in balance without an increase in \ngross debt. Gross or net does not make much matter to folks in my \nhometown. It is a debt and an obligation, it is saddling their children \nand grandchildren.\n  I will simply observe that as we discuss this, the end goal is not \njust to alter the Constitution of the United States; the end goal is to \nalter the decision-making process here in Congress sufficient so that \nwe have done what the American people want us to do--put our budget in \nbalance, eliminate budget deficits, and especially eliminate the \nincreases in Federal debt.\n  I want to make one more point responding to something the Senator \nfrom Wyoming said. He talked about Governors and States. I have heard \nall these Governors and other folks from States come here and talk \nabout their balanced budgets. It is interesting to me that those same \nGovernors and States who claim to have balanced budgets also have debt.\n  Question: Why would a State that has a constitutional prohibition \nagainst having a deficit, why would a State like that have a debt? \nAnswer: Because they have capital budgets. If they accounted for their \nbudget the way the Federal Government accounts for its budget, they \nwould not have balanced their budgets.\n  In fact, we have had Governors come up to a table and sit there and \ntalk about the fact that they have balanced their budgets and then talk \nabout fiscal policy and how it impacts their credit rating in their \nState. Credit rating? Why do you need a credit rating? Because of \nborrowing money. Why are they borrowing money if they have a \nconstitutional provision that prohibits deficits? Because they have \ndebt. They have a capital budget. I mean, that is a fact of life. We do \nnot, of course. We probably should. I think we should. But, \nnonetheless, that is a different issue. I always am constrained to \nrespond when people talk about the States balancing their budget--\nbalancing their budget and then ending up with a debt.\n  So I will just conclude my presentation--Senator Conrad is on his way \nto the floor, I believe--by again pointing out there is more than one \nconstitutional amendment being offered. I am offering one now as a \nsubstitute. Those who choose to vote for it can choose to alter this \nConstitution of the United States the right way.\n  The Constitution is just a mere, small portion of this booklet. We \ncan alter this the right way. We can do it in a way that will not \nrequire us to come back as we did with the 21st amendment and say the \n18th amendment is hereby repealed. It will happen, I guarantee you, if \nwe pass the amendment offered by the majority party. That will not \nhappen if we enact the amendment and send to the States the amendment I \nnow propose as a substitute because it does the two things \nsimultaneously. It requires the budget be in balance and does it in a \nway that you are not using large portions of trust funds and creating a \nfuture obligation by misusing them now so that you have claimed a \nbalanced budget and then have increased the Federal debt.\n  Again, you can, until you are blue in the face, talk about gross debt \nand net debt and gross and net, this and that.\n  The question I ask is this: At the end of the day, when you claim the \nbudget is in balance, is the Federal debt increasing? The answer is \nyes, and that is exactly what is wrong with this proposal.\n\n  The answer will not be yes if this Senate adopts my substitute. The \nquestion will be: At the end of the day, is the Federal debt continuing \nto increase? The answer will be no. The budget will have to be in \nbalance and there will be no further increases in Federal debt. I yield \nthe floor and reserve my time.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I feel compelled to speak a little bit on \ndebt. That seems to be what we are talking about here today. We have \ntalked about the Social Security debt for quite a while. There does not \nseem to be a lot of willingness to agree on some of the basics on it.\n  Again, I want to explain that if we are paying our Social Security in \nand that money is being invested in the U.S. Government, if we do not \nrecognize it as debt, we are lying to the people right now. We have to \nadmit what we have and what we are using.\n  The solution that is suggested by this substitute amendment is one \nthat wants to take the Social Security numbers and just recognize them \nwhile there is this surplus, but really only recognize them while there \nis a surplus, to scare people about Social Security. We really ought to \nbe worrying about Social Security.\n  Debt is really a difficult thing to explain unless it is your own. \nThen it is even scarier. We heard a little explanation of State debt \nhere a moment ago. State debt is a whole lot different than this \nFederal debt we are talking about, because in every State that has a \nbalanced budget, they are expected to pay the debt back.\n  We have yet to talk about paying debt back. We have a national debt, \nbut I do not recall us saying that we are going to start budgeting not \nonly to balance it, but we are going to balance it and pay back some of \nthe national debt. We put that kind of requirement on the States. The \nStates put that kind of requirement on themselves. They agree that if \nthey borrow money, they have to agree to pay it back by a time \nspecific.\n  They have covenants. They have to meet covenants on those bonds, \nwhich means they put a little extra away. Sometimes they have to fund \nthings up front. So when they are talking about capital debts, they are \ntalking about a whole different ballgame than we are talking about. \nThey are talking about the same one that that mortgage lender is doing \nwhen he enters into a home loan. When you go out and buy a house, you \ndo not just ask to pay the interest and expect to get a house loan. You \ndo not expect to be able to buy two or three houses, if you feel like \nit, and just pay the interest. The banker expects you to pay the loan \nback.\n  I talked about municipal governments this morning. They are expected \nto pay the loans back. They are forced to pay the loans back. Many of \nthem are forced to have a balanced budget. It\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\nis kind of interesting how their balanced budget estimates work. Theirs \nare a little more conservative than ours. They say, unless you can show \nthat the economy has declined and you will not get as much revenue as \nlast year, you will use last year's revenue estimates. That is pretty \nconservative.\n  If we had to say that in a growing economy we had to use last year's \nnumbers, we would be able to pay back some of the national debt with \nwhat was left in a growing economy. We would be putting aside some in \nthe good times to take care of the bad times.\n  That is the kind of an accounting system that we have to get to. That \nis the kind of budgeting that we have to get to if we are going to be \nfair, not only with today's generation alone, but with the ones of the \nfuture. We cannot keep buying the things out of the Christmas book that \nwe want to have and expect our kids and grandkids to pay for it.\n  That is what we are doing at the moment. Any way we try and phrase \nSocial Security so that we only want to recognize the money through the \ngood times, not adjust for it in the bad times, we are not properly \naccounting for Social Security. We have to take care of it past 2010. \nThe amendment before the Senate only takes care of it through 2010 and \nthen allows us to lie about it, to ignore it, to not have to worry \nabout it.\n  That is when the bonds come due. That is when the debt comes due from \nraising the debt limits over these years. I want to protect my seniors. \nI want to be sure there is money there in the year 2019 as well.\n  I yield the floor but retain the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield myself 8 minutes off the time controlled by the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 18\n\n     (Purpose: To protect the Medicare Health Insurance Trust Fund)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so Senator Rockefeller's amendment can be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I now send to the desk that amendent, and immediately \nafter it is reported, I ask unanimous consent Senator Rockefeller's \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] for Mr. \n     Rockefeller proposes an amendent No. 18.\n       Beginning on page 3, strike lines 12 through 14 and insert \n     the following:\n       ``Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this \n     article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts. Medicare outlays shall not \n     be reduced in excess of the amount necessary to preserve the \n     solvency of the Medicare Health Insurance Trust Fund.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 17\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have heard a novel argument just now \nfrom the other side with respect to Social Security. The argument is \nthat the only way we can save Social Security is to raid it. The only \nway we can secure the future of Social Security is to loot it.\n  Now, that is an argument that does not stand up to much scrutiny. The \nargument of the Senator on the other side is that if we take every \npenny of Social Security surplus funds as this balanced budget \namendment that is before the body now contemplates, that once we have \ndone that, we are then faced with a circumstance in which Social \nSecurity goes into deficits.\n  Let me just say the one thing we know for sure is that we are running \nthose surpluses. The one thing we know for certain is that each and \nevery year we are taking in more money on Social Security than we are \nspending. That was designed so that we would save those funds to be \nready for when the baby boomers start to retire. Instead, what we are \ndoing is taking every penny and spending it on other programs. What we \nare going to find when the baby boomers start to retire is that there \nis a cupboard there, but the cupboard is bare, and the only thing in it \nis an IOU. The problem with that is then we are going to face draconian \nchoices.\n  Our friends on the other side who are defending this balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution say that is OK. It is OK if we raid every \npenny of Social Security surplus between now and the year 2019. We take \n$1.8 trillion of Social Security surpluses to claim we have balanced \nthe budget because later on in the sweet by-and-by when this thing \nstarts to go negative, we will be including that, as well.\n  That is an argument that frankly does not stand up very well because \nwe cannot wait until Social Security goes negative. We cannot ever \npermit that to happen, not to the degree they have discussed on the \nother side, because you would never be able to meet your \nresponsibilities and the promises that have been made. Those who have \nbeen taxed have been taxed in a regressive payroll tax in order to \nsecure the promise that has been made. So the Congress is going to have \nto act and it is going to have to act soon to get our long-term fiscal \nimbalances addressed.\n  What our friends on the other side are doing in the short term--and \nby short term I mean the next 20 years--is to take every penny of \nSocial Security surplus, every penny, throw it into the pot, and claim \nthey have balanced the budget. That is not a balanced budget. That \nwould not qualify as a balanced budget in any organization that I know \nof. That would not pass the laugh test in any corporate board room in \nAmerica. If in any corporate board room in the United States had a \ncircumstance in which the chief executive officer came in and said, \n``You know what, we have a little problem in the operations of this \ncompany, and what I am proposing is that we take the retirement funds \nof our employees, throw those into the pot, and call it a balanced \nbudget,'' well, if you tried to do that, he would be in violation of \nFederal law. No. 2, he would be in violation of every accounting \nprinciple known to any financial expert in America.\n  I say to my friends when you hear the sweet siren song that they are \ngoing to balance the budget, you better ask this question, you better \nask this question: What budget is being balanced? Because what you will \nfind, as shocking as it may seem, is that they are not talking about a \nreal balanced budget at all. They are talking about taking every fund \nin sight, every trust fund known to man, and taking the income from \nthose and throw them into the pot and then say they balanced the \nbudget.\n  As I said the other day, out in North Dakota we say you can call a \npig a cow but it does not make it a cow. It does not make it a cow to \ncall a pig a cow. You can call this a balanced budget. You can call it \nanything you want. It does not make it so.\n  In fact, if you look, here is what you will find. They will take in \n1998 $81 billion of Social Security surpluses, they will take every \npenny, throw it in the pot, and say they balanced the budget. By 1999, \n$169 billion, and by the year 2002 they will take $465 billion of \nSocial Security surpluses to claim they have balanced the budget. They \nhave not balanced the budget. They just said they did.\n  That is exactly what people are tired of in Washington. That is \nWashington talk. You say something, you put a label on it, it does not \nmatter if it is a true label, it does not matter if that really fits \nthe description, but we just say it. That is what is wrong in \nWashington. We say things that do not mean what anybody understands \nthem to mean in common parlance.\n  All we have to do is look to the year 2002 to see how misleading this \nwhole argument is. If we look at the year 2002, the year that they are \nclaiming there is a balanced budget, they are claiming no deficit in \nthe year 2002, but you pierce the veil, you look a little further, and \nwhat do you find? The on-budget deficit that excludes Social Security \nand postal service accounts is in deficit by $103 billion. The gross \ndebt of the United States is going to increase in the year 2002 by $110 \nbillion. They are claiming they balanced the budget. They are claiming \nthey balance the budget and the debt is increasing by $110 billion. \nSenator Dorgan had a chart that shows $130 billion. That is last year's \nbudget resolution. This is this year's budget numbers for the year \n2002. That is the difference between them. The principle is identical.\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\n  This, I think, shows how fraudulent this whole balanced budget \namendment that is before the Senate now really is, because what they \nare trying to enshrine in the Constitution of the United States is the \ndefinition of a balanced budget that could not stand the light of day \nin any financial institution in America. There is not a single one that \ncould take the retirement funds of their employees, throw those into \nthe pot, and claim they have balanced their budgets. That is not a \nbalanced budget.\n  We ought to be straight with the American people and straight with \nourselves as to what is happening. The best way for us to deal with \nwhat is before the Senate is to draft a balanced budget amendment that \ndeals with the fatal flaws of this one. No. 1, define a balanced budget \nin an accurate and honest way. Let us say clearly to the American \npeople, we are not going to loot every trust fund in sight. We are not \ngoing to raid every single surplus trust fund in America in order to \nclaim a balanced budget. That is the kind of fire-sale approach that is \njust going to dig us a deeper hole for the future--in fact, a hole so \ndeep we would never dig out.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield myself another minute of my colleague's time. \nWon't he be surprised when he returns.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying there is a better way. \nWe have to deal with the fatal flaws. We don't loot trust funds. That \nought to be principle No. 1. No. 2, we ought to provide for national \neconomic emergencies. No. 3, we ought to have a circumstance that makes \ncertain that the Justices of the Supreme Court don't write the budget \nof the United States.\n  As I said yesterday, I can look through those doors and I can see a \ncorner of the Supreme Court of the United States. Our forefathers never \nintended that Justices sitting around a table at the Supreme Court \nwould write the budget of the United States. We ought to make certain \nthey do not.\n  The proposal by Senator Dorgan would address the first problem--the \nraiding of the Social Security trust fund to claim balance. I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield as much time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the honorable Senator \nfrom Utah [Mr. Bennett].\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, during this debate, we have heard time \nand again from some of the opponents to the balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution that we are getting toward balance without a \nconstitutional amendment. The President has proposed a balanced budget \nby the year 2002. The Republicans have called for a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002. Why do we need a constitutional amendment when we have \nthe result before us?\n  I wish to point out that we do not have this result before us. We \nhave the same kind of rhetoric about the balanced budget that we have \nhad for years and years. I will focus primarily upon the President's \nproposal for a balanced budget by 2002 and express why I do not believe \nthat it will achieve that result and why we need the discipline and the \nbalanced budget amendment in the Constitution to get that result. We \nare not getting it now.\n  If I may, Mr. President, I will show some charts. Here are the levels \nof deficits outlined in the President's budget. If you look at that \nchart all by itself, it looks fine. It shows a downward trend. What it \ndoes not show is that, in the first year of the President's budget, in \n1997, he calls for the deficit at $125 billion, up sharply from fiscal \nyear 1996. So if we are going to have a balanced budget, we start by \nincreasing spending from last year to this year, we start by going from \n$106 billion, up to a deficit of $125 billion. We stay in that \nneighborhood through 1998. We stay in that neighborhood in 1999. We \ndon't start coming back to the level of where we are today, at $106 \nbillion, until the year 2000, and we do not see a significant reduction \nin the deficit from its present level until the year 2001.\n  Now, there will be cynics among us who will say that it's not a \ncoincidence that the year 2001, which is the first real year of \nreduction from where we are now, happens to be the first year that Bill \nClinton will be out of office, and the deficit reduction will come only \nunder his successor and successive Congresses.\n  We have seen examples of how serious the President is about these \noutyear budgets. Outyears, Mr. President, is a term that we in \nWashington use for the future. Folks back home don't understand the \nterm ``outyears,'' and so maybe they don't understand what we mean when \nwe say this problem will come in the outyears, or we will get it solved \nin the outyears. What they really mean is we will deal with that \ntomorrow. I have said on this floor before that I am afraid when it \ncomes to budget matters, the theme song for this administration comes \nfrom the musical Annie: ``Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you tomorrow, \nyou're always a day away.'' That is what we see here in this deficit \nlevel proposed under the President's budget. It will come tomorrow. It \nwill come after the President has left office. It will be future \nCongresses that will have to deal with that.\n  Now, I sit on the Appropriations Committee, Mr. President. As a \nmember of that committee, I see the budget requests that come from \nmembers of the executive branch. Last year, I sat on the subcommittee \nchaired by the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, and we had coming \nbefore us on that subcommittee a number of agencies that talked about \ntheir budgets. One of them was the Veterans' Administration. I have \nhere what Secretary Brown of the Veterans' Administration had to say \nformally and on the record with respect to his budget. Senator Bond, \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, questioned him about the drastic cuts \nin the outyears, and asked the question: ``What is going to happen when \nyou have to make these drastic cuts?'' We got an answer from Secretary \nBrown that says, ``I am not going to have to make those cuts. The \nPresident has assured me that I will not.''\n\n  Reading along, Senator Bond said, ``So you are saying that these \noutyears mean nothing. It is all going to be negotiated in the future. \nSo we should not worry about the President's budget plan. He does not \nintend to hold you to those significant decreases in spending. This 7-\nyear budget plan is a sham. It has no substance is what you are saying. \nYou are not planning to live with that budget.''\n  That is the statement from the chairman of the subcommittee. This is \nthe response from the Cabinet-level officer in the President's \nadministration to that statement. He says, ``I am not planning to live \nwith it. I am not planning to live with your budget * * * nor am I \nplanning to live with the President's line.''\n  If the Cabinet officers are not planning to live with the budgets \nlaid down by the President, what credibility should the Congress give \nto the budget laid down by the President?\n  The Secretary said--lest we think the Secretary is speaking on his \nown, I am quoting from his testimony--the Secretary said, ``The \nPresident understands that. I talked with him personally about it, and \nthat is one of the reasons why he gave me his personal commitment that \nhe was going to make sure that the Nation honors its commitments to \nveterans and that he will negotiate the budget each and every year. So \nthe main point that is realistic up there is the President's 1996 \nbudget and his 1996 budget request. We all know what is going to happen \nto that, but the outyears and the tough decisions will be made each and \nevery year.''\n  He said on the record to the Appropriations Committee of this \nCongress that the only number he was willing to live with was the \nPresident's number in 1996 and the rest of it would be left to the \nfuture. If I may, tomorrow we will deal with that. Tomorrow, and \ntomorrow is always the day away.\n  Lest you think this was an isolated incident, I take you to another \nhearing\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\nthat occurred in that same subcommittee on which I sat. This has to do \nwith NASA. I am a great supporter of NASA. I believe we get our money \nback tenfold that we spend in NASA in terms of the technology spinoff \nthat takes place, the jobs that are created. I think NASA is a place \nwhere we should continue to spend money. It is the same thing. NASA was \ngoing to have a nice budget for the near term, the present budget, and \nthen there would be drastic cuts in the outyears.\n  Senator Bond said to Dr. Goldin, Administrator of NASA, ``Now, I \nunderstand you have been told that the numbers should be expected to \nchange for the outyears, so there is no need to defend any specific \nfunding level in his budget, nor any likely programmatic consequence of \nsuch funding levels. Is that your understanding?'' Dr. Goldin, \nPresidential appointee, Administrator of NASA, said, ``Yes, and based \nupon assurances I have had by discussions with the administration, I \nexpect that as the clarity comes into focus, the outyear budgets will \nchange.''\n  We all know which way they will change. They will go up. As I say, I \nam delighted by that because I am a strong supporter of NASA. But I am \nnot delighted by the sleight of hand that occurs in the overall budget \nfigures which we saw in the first chart where the President says, \noverall, yes, we can continue spending at a level higher than we are \nspending today for all of the years that I am in office and then we \nwill project that the savings will come. This is what we are being told \nis the budget. This budget proves that we do need a budget amendment. \nThis budget shows we do need the discipline which would come from \nwriting something into the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I have one other chart that I want to share with you \nand others who may be watching which puts this whole debate into a \ndifferent perspective. I have used this chart on the floor before. It \nis a slightly different chart than many we have seen. This is not a \nchart of the debt in absolute terms. This is a chart of the debt in \nrelative terms.\n\n  Frankly, to me, as a former businessman, the relative terms make more \nsense. If you take the debt as an absolute number and do not have \nanything to compare it to, it frankly doesn't mean much. I have used \nthis analogy on the floor before. But I have learned since I have been \nin the Senate that there is no such thing as repetition. So I can use \nit again with a perfectly clear conscience.\n  Taking a business with which I was involved before I came to the \nSenate, when I went to work for this business as its chief executive \nofficer it had debt of $75,000. That debt, given the size of the \ncompany, was sufficient to sink the company. They were doing a total of \n$250,000 in business, a total volume $250,000 a year, and they owed \n$75,000 in debt. They were in serious trouble. There was no way they \ncould pay that debt off with $250,000 in total volume because their \nmargin on that total volume that they could keep after they bought the \nraw materials for their product was relatively small. They were in deep \ntrouble at $75,000 in debt.\n  When I left the company prior to my run for the Senate, that company \nhad $7.5 million in debt. And if all you looked at was a chart that \nshowed $75,000 to $7.5 million, you would say this company is clearly \ngoing broke, and what terrible stewardship Mr. Bennett provided as the \nchief executive officer of the company if he allowed the debt to rise \nfrom only $75,000 to $7.5 million in only 6 years. When we had $7.5 \nmillion in debt, the company was doing $80 million in annual revenue \nand we happened to have about $20 million in cash. You say, ``Well, why \nwould you have any debt if you had $20 million in cash?'' It was left \nover from the period of time when we had to mortgage some of the \nbuildings in order to get some built and there were prepayment \npenalties on the mortgages. So it made more sense to the shareholders \nfor us to keep the cash than to pay the prepayment penalties on the \nmortgages. So the size of the debt frankly was not the key issue. The \nquestion was, how big a debt do you have compared to the financial \nstrength of the company? And $7.5 million in debt compared to the \nfinancial strength of the company when I left it was frankly nothing at \nall to be concerned about, whereas the $75,000 in debt when I began \nthere was threatening to destroy the company.\n  So I have taken the national debt and expressed it not in absolute \nterms, not in the debt where it was in this year and how rapidly it has \nrisen to where it is now, but as a percentage of the economy, gross \ndomestic product, the total production of goods and services in a year. \nAnd you will see that the greatest time of debt in the history of this \ncountry as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP as we \nabbreviated it, was at the height of the Second World War. This is \n1945. Our debt stood at 130 percent of our total year's output of goods \nand services.\n  Now, you will notice that at the end of the war the debt as a \npercentage of GDP started falling and kept falling fairly dramatically, \nand kept falling and kept falling and it bottomed out in the mid-\n1970's. It got down to about 30 percent of GDP, from 130 down to 30, \nand then something started to happen. And then something started to \nhappen. It started to happen before Ronald Reagan became President. It \nstarted to happen before the defense buildup under Caspar Weinberger. \nIt started to happen before the tax cuts that were passed by this \nRepublican Senate in the early 1980's. The debt started during the \nJimmy Carter years, and it started back up. And for the first time in \nour history we saw the debt increasing as a percentage of GDP during \npeacetime. Prior to that, the debt always came down during peacetime, \nand only went up during wartime, as a percentage of GDP.\n\n  What happened? Was it Jimmy Carter's fault? Was it the Republican \nCongress' fault? Frankly, it was the kicking in of the automatic \nincreases of entitlements in an aging population that started the debt \nto increase as a percentage of the gross domestic product. No \npolitician was responsible for it, and no politician can take credit \nfor having solved it until we muster the courage and the strength on \nthis floor to address the issue of the automatic nature of entitlement \nincreases.\n  We have been unable to do that. We have talked about it, but we have \nbeen unable to muster the necessary political courage. We meet in the \ncloakrooms, we meet in the dining room where we talk to each other, and \nwe tell each other this is what we have to do, and then we do not \nmuster the majorities to do it. There is one way to make sure we will \nmuster the majorities to do it and start this back down, which is where \nit needs to be moving. The way to do that is to write into the \nConstitution, the basic document that governs all of our activities, \nthe requirement that we balance the budget, and have no deficit. As the \neconomy grows, even if the debt stays exactly where it is, it will \ndiminish as a percentage of GDP as it did in the 30 years between the \nend of the Second World War and the time when it started back up. We \ncan go back to that downward trend if we just keep the debt where it \nis. And the only way we keep the debt where it is is to balance outlays \nwith income every year. I say the time has come to put the requirement \nthat we do that into our basic document, the Constitution, at which \npoint we will then have a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, there are many other things I could say about all of \nthe debate that has gone on on this floor. Frankly, much of what I have \nheard in the debate on this floor I think is irrelevant to the core \nissue. I can comment on the various amendments to the balanced budget \namendment that have been raised. I will not because these issues have \nbeen dealt with by my colleagues in great depth, and I see no point in \nrepeating all of that.\n  I am a reluctant convert to the idea of a balanced budget amendment. \nI have made that point clear before. I do not like amending the \nConstitution. I have voted against amendments to the Constitution that \nmany of my colleagues thought were meritorious simply because I think \nthe Constitution is so significant a basic document that we should \nexhaust every other remedy before we consider amending it.\n  It is with great reluctance that I make an exception to that position \nwith respect to the question of the balanced budget. If we do not have \nthe discipline written into our basic document dealing with this issue, \nour past history shows that we cannot control the impact of the \nentitlement increase on future generations.\n  So for that reason, I announce, with all my misgivings about amending \nthe\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\nConstitution, that in this case the issue is so important, the \nchallenge is so significant that an amendment to the Constitution is \ncalled for. That is why I intend to vote for the amendment that is \nbefore us, why I have voted and will continue to vote against any \ncrippling amendments to that amendment and hope that the rest of the \nSenate and ultimately the rest of the country will come to realize that \nthe only way to start these yellow lines going back down again in a \nsignificant, historic trend is to write a basic requirement into the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 13 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, I certainly compliment the \nSenator from Utah for his very compelling statement on the necessity of \nhaving a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. He rightfully \npoints out the fact that if we fail to place this amendment in the \nConstitution, then there is no guarantee of providing fiscal stability \nfor this country in the future.\n  As we have made the case time and time again in this body, there is \nno issue more central to competitiveness, to security, to stability of \nAmerica's future than the issue of a balanced budget. It means more \njobs; it means increased wages; it means a better standard of living; \nit means less taxes; it means lower interest rates, all of which will \nbenefit the American people and future generations.\n  The overwhelming majority of people in America today are pessimistic \nabout the future when it comes to their children and what kind of life \nthey will enjoy. That is the essence of this issue. This issue points \nto the fact that we need to do all we can to reduce the Federal \ndeficit, to reach a balanced budget, and begin to grapple with the \nburgeoning debt that we have compiled for generations. The fact is the \nnext generation will be required to pay an 82-percent tax rate and a \n50-percent reduction in benefits to manage and to finance the debt that \nwe leave behind.\n\n  I do not think that is the kind of legacy we want to bequeath the \nnext generation.\n  We have had this debate in this body in 1995 and on many previous \noccasions, and in fact when I served in the House of Representatives I \ncan remember we had this debate in 1982, and we had it many times \nthereafter. We heard the same rationale each and every time, that we \nshould be able to have a balanced budget without a constitutional \namendment. In fact, the President himself said it in the State of the \nUnion. He said we do not need to rewrite the Constitution; all we need \nis your vote and my signature.\n  We as Republicans worked very hard in the last Congress to design a \nbalanced budget plan with specifics and in great detail, without \ngimmicks. We presented it to the President of the United States, so he \ngot our vote, but, unfortunately, we did not get his signature.\n  I think the reason is that without a constitutional amendment, it \ndoes not force consensus on all sides and between both branches of \nGovernment. So ultimately there is no will and there is no self-\ndiscipline to reach a consensus on balancing the budget without a \nconstitutional mandate.\n  We have heard many reasons today as to why Senators cannot support \nthis particular amendment. We have had many amendments that proposed \nexemptions to this amendment, all of which were designed and disguised \nas a rationale for avoiding supporting a constitutional amendment.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth than suggesting that \nexempting the Social Security Program from this balanced budget \namendment would protect the benefits of Social Security retirees. There \nis nothing in that amendment that would suggest that. In fact, quite \nthe contrary. The Social Security trust fund, since its inception, has \nbeen on budget. We have always addressed the shortfalls. We have \nprepared for the future by redesigning the program, as was the case in \n1983, with a bipartisan commission that was chaired by the head of the \nFederal Reserve Board, Chairman Greenspan, to address those concerns.\n  We have no idea, we have no track record to know what would happen to \nthe Social Security trust fund off budget. No one has presented us a \nplan for how the surpluses would be used. The surpluses on budget are \ninvested in Government-backed bonds. But no one has told us, those who \npresented amendments exempting the Social Security trust fund, how \nthese surpluses would be invested off budget. Would they be used and \ninvested in private securities with a privatized Social Security? That \nis a major issue, and certainly I think it represents a consequence of \nplacing the Social Security trust fund off budget. Would the Social \nSecurity trust fund off budget be diverted for other purposes? That is \na real possibility, that those funds could be used for programs other \nthan Social Security. So, if I were a retiree--and I will be one long \nafter the turn of the century--I would be very much concerned about how \nthose trust funds would be used.\n  We have also heard and we know that, by exempting the Social Security \ntrust fund from this amendment, we will have to further reduce Federal \nexpenditures by $295 billion over the next 5 years, between now and the \nyear 2002, in addition to the more than $250 billion that is required \nto reach a balanced budget in the year 2002. In addition to that, we \nwould also be required to reduce the budget another $709 billion \nbetween the year 2002 and the year 2007. That represents $1 trillion in \nadditional cuts above and beyond what will be required to reach a \nbalanced budget. Again, I think we have a right to know, from those who \npropose this exemption, as to how they would reach that target, with an \nadditional $1 trillion in cuts? In fact, if you carry it further, to \nthe year 2019, it would be $1.9 trillion--$1.9 trillion in additional \ncuts.\n  Mr. President, 2 years ago when we were having this debate, an \namendment was offered by the minority leader that was called the right \nto know amendment. It says if you are going to propose a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, then, indeed, Members of this body \nhave the right to know and are entitled to know as to exactly how we \nwould accomplish balancing the budget. The same is true here today. We \nhave a right to know exactly how these additional cuts will be \naccomplished over and above the cuts that already will be required in \nachieving a balanced budget between now and the year 2002 and then, of \ncourse, beyond. I repeat, it would require $1 trillion more in \nadditional reductions in order to accomplish that. Yet, again, we do \nnot have a plan as to how, exactly, that would be achieved.\n  In the final analysis, it gets back to the central issue, the central \nquestion in this constitutional amendment. That is whether or not we \nare truly committed to engaging in fiscal responsibility so future \ngenerations can have a secure future. We have an obligation, as one \ngeneration to the next, to provide a better standard of living. I think \nit is regrettable that we in this Congress decide to pursue a direction \nthat accepts budgets that suggest, somehow, that higher taxes, a lower \nstandard of living, sub par growth and anemic recovery are acceptable \nin a global economy as we approach the 21st century. It is certainly \nnot what I want for future generations.\n  So, I hope we would consider this amendment for what it is. In \nreality, it is a way of avoiding the passage of this constitutional \namendment because, in the final analysis, it does nothing to guarantee \nthe benefits for Social Security retirees. In fact, I would say, quite \nthe contrary, it raises a great deal of concern as to exactly what will \nhappen to this trust fund, what will happen to the benefits for \nretirees, because we have no plan from the proponents of this amendment \nas to exactly how the off-budget program would work for Social Security \nand exactly how the surpluses would be used and whether or not this \nprogram, the trust fund, would be used for other purposes other than \nfor Social Security benefits.\n  So, I hope this body will reject this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Senator Dorgan's substitute, simply put, \nwould add to Senate Joint Resolution 1 language that would exempt \nSocial Security from the requirement that ``total outlays for any \nfiscal year not exceed\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\ntotal receipts for that fiscal year,'' unless three-fifths of each \nHouse concurs. In essence, the Dorgan substitute's exemption for Social \nSecurity is identical to the Reid amendment, which we fully debated \nyesterday. As such, we are all familiar with the arguments--pro and \ncon--of the effect of removing Social Security from the safeguards of \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  It is my fervent hope this renewed debate over the proposed exemption \nof the Social Security funds from the requirements of Senate Joint \nResolution 1 will convince my colleagues to support the balanced budget \namendment. As Justice Brandeis so eloquently wrote in the 1927 case of \nWhitney versus California, ``[i]t is the function of speech to free men \nfrom the bondage of irrational fears.'' I truly believe that many of my \nwell-meaning colleagues' desires to exempt the Social Security Program \nis based on unfounded fears. I hope to allay those fears and \ndemonstrate that far from harming Social Security, including the \nprogram within unified budgets subject to the amendment, will help to \npreserve the program. Moreover, ironically, by exempting Social \nSecurity from the amendment, the very fears of some of my colleagues \nmay come about because the program will certainly be weakened if we \nagree to to remove it from the unified budget.\n  Before I directly address my colleagues concerns, it is helpful to \nput this debate in a larger context. Today, the accumulated national \ndebt is nearly $5.4 trillion. Interest payments on this debt consume \n$250 billion annually, which the Washington Times recently estimated, \nis more than the combined budgets of the Departments of Commerce, \nAgriculture, Education, Energy, Justice, Interior, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, Labor, State, and Transportation. This means that the \nshare of the debt for every infant born today is about $20,000.\n  There is a crying need for sound fiscal reform. Unless we do \nsomething, this Nation will continue to have stagnant economic growth \nwith less jobs. Unless we do something, the interest payment on the \ndebt will continue to devour capital that could be otherwise used for \ninvestment or Federal programs. Let's not kid ourselves that Washington \npoliticians will remedy this problem; the blunt truth is that no \nbalanced budget deal has worked in the past, that is why we need to \namend the Constitution to provide for fiscal sanity.\n  Yet opponents of Senate Joint Resolution 1 argue that Social Security \nshould be removed from the protection of the balanced budget amendment. \nBut to do as they request would be a risky gimmick that would harm \nSocial Security and open a loophole in the constitutional amendment.\n\n\n                  The Dorgan Substitute Is Unworkable\n\n  Mr. President, the Dorgan substitute suffers from the same disease as \nthe Reid amendment. It is not workable. Let me tell you why.\n  First, as I discussed during the debate on the Reid amendment, it is \nnecessary to include Social Security in any balanced budget plan. \nObviously, without including Social Security, other programs must be \ncut far more than they really need to be. The proponents of this \namendment have not told us which programs they will cut in order to \ncome up with the approximately $100 billion per year that the total \nexclusion of the Social Security surpluses will cost us--astoundingly, \nthis figure is greater than our combined annual expenditure on \neducation, the environment, transportation and infrastructure. In fact, \nbetween 2002 and 2019, when Social Security outlays will exceed \nreceipts, the trust fund is expected to earn more than $1.9 trillion. \nWhere do supporters of the Dorgan substitute propose to come up with \nmoney necessary to cover this self-imposed shortfall? Show me the \nmoney.\n  Let's put this in perspective. Discretionary spending savings from \nlast year's budget resolution, which were described as draconian, were \nonly $291 billion. The Dorgan substitute would require that Congress \ncut spending or raise taxes more than six times this amount. Similarly, \nthe projected revenues from the 1993 Clinton tax increase--the largest \ntax increase in history--were only $241 billion. The Dorgan substitute \nwould require that Congress cut spending or raise taxes over eight \ntimes this largest tax increase in history. These levels of spending \ncuts and tax increases are clearly unworkable, and the adoption of the \nDorgan substitute would kill any chance the balanced budget amendment \nhas of being ratified.\n  Indeed, as I alluded to, the Clinton administration uses Social \nSecurity surpluses in formulating its own budgetary numbers, and has \ndone so for the past 4 years. Secretary of the Treasury Rubin admitted \nto and defended the practice during hearings before the Judiciary \nCommittee on January 17: ``We will include it * * * I believe that with \nrespect to budget policy that the view of the Congress and the view of \nthe President to include Social Security is correct.''\n  Similarly, in a recent press conference, President Clinton noted that \nSocial Security receipts are used in his budget and admitted that \nneither he nor the Republicans could balance the budget without \nincluding the Social Security surpluses. The fact is that all \nadministrations in recent memory have relied on a unified budget \ncalculation of surpluses, and it is good budgetary policy.\n  Second, exempting Social Security from the mandates of the BBA for \nany considerable period of time will probably result in the demise of \nthe Social Security Program years early. Such an exemption will create \na powerful incentive to redefine spending programs as ``Social \nSecurity'' and pay for them through what could become a giant loophole \nin any attempt to balance the budget.\n  Opponents of the BBA incorrectly contend that including present-day \nSocial Security surpluses in a unified budget would raid the trust \nfunds. This is a complete misnomer because the surpluses are nothing \nmore than an accounting reference. Social Security FICA taxes are \ndeposited with all other revenues. Interest bearing securities are \npurchased equal to the amounts of Social Security receipts. This debt \nprovides a safe investment. This safety, however, would be wrecked if \nSocial Security were removed from the protection of Senate Joint \nResolution 1's balancing requirements. In fact, the very fears of the \nadvocates of the Dorgan substitute will be realized. Their exemption of \nSocial Security would really cause the trust funds to be raided.\n  Why? Because under the Dorgan substitute, trust fund receipts would \nbe used to finance other costly programs that would be relabeled as \nSocial Security. With the loophole proposed by this exemption in place, \nthere will be an irresistible impulse for future Congresses to redefine \nunrelated programs as Social Security. This, in turn, would create an \nincentive for Congress to include costly programs as part of Social \nSecurity. Congress has not been able to restrain itself from either \nwasteful spending or increasing this web of services provided by Social \nSecurity in the past--what would prevent combining them in the future? \nAre we willing to let future Congresses roll the dice with the \nfinancial security of America's seniors?\n  Passing an exemption loophole, accordingly, would essentially create \ntwo federal budgets, one based on sound principles of solvency, and the \nother, the Social Security budget, which would not. One budget will be \nrequired to be in balance unless a supermajority votes to allow a \ndeficit, the other--the Social Security budget--would be raided and \nbloated with unrelated spending projects. Taking Social Security off \nbudget will subject its funds to Washington's special interest \nscavengers. When you have rats in your house, you need to plug up all \nthe holes. If you do not, they'll find a way in. If we leave Social \nSecurity off budget, new and old special interest spending \ninitiatives--which cannot survive or make their way in under a balanced \nbudget plan--will smell out the scent of Social Security and devour it. \nThis loophole would not only blow a hole in the BBA, but it would also \nseriously harm Social Security. This, in turn, will mean the end of \nSocial Security as we know it, transforming it into the least secure of \nall Government accounts.\n  Under the Dorgan substitute, the other possible use for Social \nSecurity surpluses would be for the Government to pay down our \nstaggering national debt. Thus, if there are any surpluses left over \nafter programs are redesignated ``Social Security,'' the remaining \nsurplus would be used to make debt repayments. This sounds wonderful, \nbut\n\n[[Page S1642]]\n\nin fact, creates a dangerous mechanism for the Congress to continue \ndeficit spending. By paying down the debt, the Congress would provide \nitself a debt cushion--that is, a gap between the statutorily limited \ndebt ceiling and the actual paid down debt. Congress could therefore \nuse this gap to continue to deficit spend, thus avoiding the three-\nfifths vote required in section 2 of the BBA to raise the debt ceiling. \nThe surpluses used for the purpose to pay down the debt will have been \nsquandered as the debt ceiling is reached with a new gorge of spending \nequal in amount to the surplus that was used to pay off debt. Such a \nspending device completely frustrates real purposes for which I have \nintroduced the balanced budget amendment--achieving sound fiscal policy \nand a healthy economy.\n  Consequently, the net effect of the loophole will be the depletion of \nthe trust funds years early, with no protection for the benefit checks \nowed our seniors. How ironic. This is exactly what the Dorgan \nsubstitute was designed to avoid. But the Dorgan substitute does \nabsolutely nothing to protect the Social Security trust funds. Let's \njust look at the language--is there anything in this amendment that \nprevents Social Security from being cut? Of course there isn't.\n  I believe that the gamesmanship and gimmickry that the Dorgan \nsubstitute will engender is exactly what must be avoided. The way to \navoid it is to reject such exemptions. The best way to protect retirees \nand future generations is to adopt a clean and strong balanced budget \namendment, free of loopholes.\n  Third, let's not forget about the troubling future for Social \nSecurity. The Dorgan substitute does absolutely nothing to protect \nSocial Security and, in fact, will make it extremely difficult--if not \nimpossible--to achieve balanced budgets. The Social Security Board of \nTrustees estimates that by the year 2070, Social Security is expected \nto run an annual $7 trillion deficit. If we include Social Security in \nour balanced budget calculations, we will be able to prepare for and \nbudget these massive shortfalls. Under the Dorgan substitute, we will \nnot be including this deficit in our budgetary planning. As a result, \nunder the Dorgan substitute, in order to raise revenue and increase the \ndebt ceiling sufficient to cover the expected Social Security \nshortfalls in the next century, we will have to dramatically increase \ntaxes or cut spending in other important programs, or face an annual \nthree-fifths vote fiscal crisis to avoid financial default by raising \nthe already staggering $5.5 trillion debt ceiling.\n\n  Fourth, Mr. President, the Dorgan substitute should be rejected \nbecause the language of the exemption is confusing and its application \nmay harm the Social Security program--the very thing the Dorgan \nsubstitute claims to protect. The substitute exempts the Social \nSecurity trust funds from Senate Joint Resolution 1's balancing \nrequirement. But it also includes the proviso, as and if modified to \npreserve the solvency of the funds.\n  Explicitly exempting Social Security by placing it in the \nConstitution may constitutionalize the program in perpetuity unless a \nsubsequent constitutional amendment provides for the program to be \naltered or abolished. As a result of the Dorgan substitute, do minor \ntechnical changes to Social Security every year require amendments to \nthe Constitution? The constitutional amendment process is a long one; \nindeed it was designed by the Framers to be lengthy to prevent specious \nchanges to the Constitution. If we must go through this time consuming \nprocess for every change to Social Security--even minor technical \nalterations--I fear that major needed reforms to Social Security will \ncome far too late.\n  Similarly, does the proviso language require the solvency of the \nSocial Security system or does that language merely allow Congress to \ntake steps to assure the solvency of the trust funds? And if the answer \nis that Congress must take measures to assure solvency; does this \nrequire tax increases or benefit cuts?\n  Frankly, this proviso language strands us in uncharted territory. We \ndo not know exactly how this language will be interpreted. It could \nalso very well mean that the scope of Social Security, as a \nconstitutional provision, could be amended by statute. For instance, in \n1965, Social Security was broadened by statute to include portions of \nMedicare. My question is this: if, under the Dorgan substitute, Social \nSecurity can be similarly modified by statute, would we be \nconstitutionalizing a massive loophole, through which we could \nconstitutionally enforce spending on any program redesignated as Social \nSecurity? If, on the other hand, we can only modify Social Security by \nconstitutional amendment, won't that require a two-thirds Senate vote, \napproval of 37 States and a 7-year delay to enact even the most minor \nchanges?\n  All this demonstrates the danger that the Dorgan substitute as a \nwhole creates--that Congress ought to be responsible and not amend the \nConstitution to include specific statutory programs like Social \nSecurity. A constitutional amendment should be timeless and reflect a \nbroad consensus, not make narrow policy decisions. We should not place \ntechnical language or overly complicated mechanisms in the Constitution \nand undercut the simplicity and universality of the balanced budget \namendment. Explicitly exempting Social Security may constitutionalize \nthe program in perpetuity unless a subsequent amendment provides for \nthe program to be altered or abolished. It would also invite gaming and \nendless litigation as the terms of the program are altered.\n  Former Assistant and Acting Attorney General Stuart Gerson and \nattorney Alan Morrison have both had extensive experience litigating \nconstitutional issues and testified in a Judiciary Committee hearing on \nSenate Joint Resolution 1. Although the two disagree about the wisdom \nof the balanced budget amendment, they agree that exempting Social \nSecurity is a bad idea, and both strongly opposed exempting Social \nSecurity from the balanced budget Amendment.\n  According to Alan Morrison, a litigator with Public Citizen who \nopposes the balanced budget amendment and testified for the minority:\n\n       Given the size of social security, to allow it to run at a \n     deficit would undermine the whole concept of a balanced \n     budget. Moreover, there is no definition of social security \n     in the Constitution and it would be extremely unwise and \n     productive of litigation and political maneuvering to try to \n     write one. If there is to be a Balanced Budget Constitutional \n     Amendment, there should be no exceptions.\n\n\n                  responses to opponent's allegations\n\n  Supporters of exempting Social Security argue that section 13301 of \nthe 1990 Budget Enforcement Act [BEA] literally exempts the Social \nSecurity trust funds from the President's and the Congress' budget \ncalculations. They claim that the balanced budget amendment would \nchange this because it requires a unified budget. These critics of the \nbalanced budget amendment are wrong on both counts.\n  Under section 13301(a) of the BEA, the receipts and outlays of the \nSocial Security trust funds are indeed not counted in both the \nPresident's and Congress' budgets--but only for certain specific \nreasons. The primary purpose for this exclusion was to exempt Social \nSecurity from sequestration by the President under the Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings procedures and from the act's pay-as-you-go requirement. In \naddition, as added protections, sections 13302 and 13303 of the BEA \nalso created firewall point-of-order protections for the Social \nSecurity trust funds in both the House and Senate. All of this is made \nclear by the conference report accompanying the 1990 act. Indeed, the \n1990 Budget Enforcement Act does not preclude both Congress and the \nPresident from formulating a unitary budget--that includes Social \nSecurity trust funds--for national fiscal purposes. Surely, the \nopponents of the balanced budget amendment are not suggesting that the \nPresident of the United States and the Congress have been flouting the \nlaw when they include the Social Security trust funds in their \nrespective budget calculations?\n  Look, we all know that Social Security will need reform if it is to \ncontinue to be viable over the long haul. But the problem is not the \ninclusion of Social Security funds in the budget. The problem is that \nwith the retirement of baby boomers, there will not be enough FICA \ntaxes to fund their retirement. Moreover, the surplus Social Security \ntaxes being collected today will not cover the future costs of the \nsystem. Most of current Social Security taxes are used to cover benefit\n\n[[Page S1643]]\n\npayments to present retirees. Outlays will exceed receipts of the \nsystem in about 2019. The guarantee of future benefits, therefore, will \ndepend on the Federal Government's future ability to pay benefits.\n  Not including Social Security in the budget would harm the program. \nCongress could rename social programs--as they have done before--as \nSocial Security and use the FICA taxes to fund these programs. Then \nyou'll really see the program raided. The problem that the Dorgan \nsubstitute raises--in reality--is not with the BBA, but with the \nproblems the Social Security program faces. We need to fix that and \nadopting the balanced budget amendment is a good start.\n  Mr. President, in a related argument that seeks to justify the \nexemption, some have argued that the balanced budget amendment will \noverride the existing statutory protections for Social Security.\n  Contrary to this assertion, it is clear that the current statutory \nprotections for Social Security would not be eliminated by the \namendment. Of course, the supremacy clause of the Constitution provides \nthat any legislation contrary to a constitutional provision must fail. \nAs the great Chief Justice John Marshall held in the landmark 1803 \ndecision of Marbury versus Madison, ``[a]n act of the legislature, \nrepugnant to the constitution is void.'' But what critics fail to \nmention is that there is absolutely nothing in the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment that is inconsistent with the current \nstatutory schemes. The Social Security statutory protections are not \nlegislative acts repugnant to the Constitution as amended by Senate \nJoint Resolution 1. Congress under the balanced budget amendment can \nalso create statutory protections for the Social Security program.\n  Further, the Dorgan substitute has absolutely no protection against \nSocial Security benefit cuts. The plain fact is that the best thing we \ncan do for Social Security, the best thing we can do for retirees, and \nthe best thing we can do for all Americans is to enact the balanced \nbudget amendment without loopholes or exemptions, and bring fiscal \nsanity and a little common sense back to Government\n  Finally, opponents of the Senate Joint Resolution 1, in arguing for a \nSocial Security exemption, contend that the balanced budget amendment \nwill not in reality produce a balanced budget because gross debt will \nstill rise. This is clever, but misleading.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment does indeed require a \nbalanced budget. Outlays must not exceed receipts under section 1 of \nSenate Joint Resolution 1. But it is also true that gross debt may \nstill increase even if the budget is balanced. That is because the \nGovernment's exchange of securities for incoming FICA taxes is counted \nas gross debt. It is merely an accounting or bookkeeping notation of \nwhat one agency of Government owes another agency. It is analogous to a \ncorporation buying back its stock or debentures. Such stock and bonds \nare considered retired obligations that once paid have no economic or \nfiscal significance. Thus, if we enact the BBA, the debt the United \nStates owes to everyone but itself will stop growing.\n  This type of debt--termed net debt or debt held by the public--is \nlegally enforceable and is what is economically significant. If net \ndebt zooms--because of interest payments of debt--which last year \namounted to $250 billion--budget deficits balloon with all the dire \neconomic consequences. To assure that budgets will be balanced unless \nextraordinary situations arise, debt held by the public cannot be \nincreased unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House concur.\n  That net debt is considered to be of far greater economic \nsignificance than gross debt is a widely held truism among economists. \nIndeed, in the study ``Analytical Perspectives: Budget of the United \nStates Government Fiscal Year 1998,'' the Clinton administration \nconcludes that net debt or ``borrowing from the public, whether by the \nTreasury or by some other Federal agency, has a significant impact on \nthe economy.'' On the other hand, the study also maintains that gross \ndebt, or debt issued to government accounts, ``does not have any of the \neconomic effects of borrowing from the public. It is [merely] an \ninternal transaction between two accounts, both within the Government \nitself.'' Analytical Perspectives at 218-219.\n  It is true that a balanced budget amendment does not by itself reduce \nthe $5.3 billion national debt. But what it does do is to straighten-\nout our national fiscal house. Passage of Senate Joint Resolution 1 \nwill increase economic growth and allow us to run surpluses. With this, \nour national debt may be decreased if Congress desires to do so in the \ninterest of national economic stability and prosperity. Without Senate \nJoint Resolution 1, this will be an impossibility.\n  The Dorgan substitute, on the other hand, adds nothing to protect the \ntrust funds from accumulating debt. In fact, by creating this loophole, \nthe Dorgan substitute may cause the trust fund to dry up sooner and run \ndeeper deficits. Thus, the Dorgan substitute is a risky gimmick that \nendangers Social Security.\n  Mr. President, the biggest threat to Social Security is our growing \ndebt and concomitant interest payments. Debt-related inflation hits \nhard those on fixed incomes, and the Government's use of capital to \nfund debt slows productivity and income growth, and siphons-off needed \nmoney for worthwhile programs. The way to protect Social Security \nbenefits is to pass Senate Joint Resolution 1. The proposal to exempt \nSocial Security will not only destroy the BBA, but in all probability \nwill also cause the Social Security trust funds to run out of money \nsooner than it would have without an exemption.\n  Benjamin Franklin, moments after the Philadelphia Constitutional \nConvention adjourned in 1787, was asked what type of government was \nestablished. He replied, ``[a] Republic if you can keep it.'' Franklin \nknew his history. The judgement of history has always been that \nrepublics and democracies were frail entities prone to collapse because \nof the greed and envy of an unchecked majority. It would take a \ncitizenry imbued with civic virtue to prevent that collapse. Indeed, a \nwise philosopher once opined that without that virtue a democracy \ncannot last as a permanent form of government:\n\n       It can only exist until the voters discover that they can \n     vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that \n     moment on the majority always votes for the candidate \n     promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the \n     result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal \n     policy, always followed by a dictatorship.\n\n  The fundamental question facing the American Republic in the coming \nmillennium is how our Nation deals with the future fiscal crisis born \nof a volcano of rising debt. The success of our Republic depends on the \nvirtue and morality of America--on the willingness of her people to \neschew largesse that we simply cannot afford. We need to get our fiscal \nhouse in order. And to do that, past Congresses have proved that this \nNation needs to place within our Constitution a balanced budget \namendment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I compliment my colleague for her excellent \nremarks. She has been a stalwart on this balanced budget amendment, and \nrightly so. She has been an inspiration to me, and I personally want to \nexpress my gratitude.\n  Mr. President, we have only 1 minute left. This is the Reid amendment \nrevived. There is only one reason for this amendment and that is \nbecause they do not want the balanced budget amendment. I guess they \nwant to continue just the same 28 years of unbalanced budgets; 58 out \nof the last 66 years.\n  Let us just be honest about it, this amendment, along with most of \nthe others, is what I call a downright phony amendment. First of all, I \ncannot imagine why anybody in their right mind would believe you could \ntake the largest item out of the Federal budget and put it out there to \ndrift aimlessly on its own where anybody could amend it, anybody could \nredefine it, anybody could add any program, anybody could use the \nsurplus for additional spending rather than trying to balance the \nbudget, and to argue that it is raiding the trust fund when, in \nessence, we are going to continue to put money into U.S. Government \nsecurities and bonds regardless of what happens.\n  What they do not tell you is that unless we have a balanced budget \namendment, we are not going to be able to\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\npay off those bonds. When the baby boomers come, and maybe even \nbefore--and I suggest it is going to happen before--we are going to hit \nthe skids where we are not going to know what to do for our seniors \nbecause of the games that are played on the balanced budget amendment.\n  I am not going to accuse anybody of insincerity, but I can say this: \nThere is no question that there is a desire on the part of many who \nlike to spend and tax to kill this balanced budget amendment, no matter \nwhat it takes. If they can hide behind something they can demagog \nlater, they will do it. That is what this whole game is about.\n  This amendment is not a good amendment. This amendment is something \nthat anybody in their right mind would say, ``My gosh, how can you even \npresent it as an amendment that might do some good in this country?'' \nIn fact, the only thing that will do good is the balanced budget \namendment.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah is overanxious.\n  ``Phony,'' ``demagog,'' he uses the words with great abandon. Phony? \nYou show me a plan that says I have balanced the budget but my debt is \nstill increasing, that is what I call phony. That is what the folks in \nmy hometown call phony, a plan that says we have balanced the budget \nbut the debt goes up.\n  You say, why is that the case? Is that the case?\n  Oh, yes, you don't understand, it is debt held by the public, and net \ndebt is more important than gross debt. Tell that to the folks who are \ngoing to bear the burden of the debt.\n\n  I have watched people make sausage and try to sell it as tenderloin. \nI see what is going on. We have a stack of books, a Tower of Babel here \nabout balanced budgets. The way we are going to balance the budget is \nto make taxing and spending decisions. We had one big chance to do that \nin 1993. I signed up, and I said, ``Count me in.'' Some of the folks \nnow speaking the loudest said, ``Count me out; I'm out the door because \nI want to vote no and tell the folks back home that what they did back \nthere was unpopular.''\n  It is not popular to make the tough decisions to really balance the \nbudget. I suppose it is popular to suggest we should alter the \nConstitution and then not want to describe to the American people why, \nafter we boasted we balanced the budget, we are still increasing the \nFederal debt. They may have some popularity from this, but it's not the \nright way to alter the Constitution, and it will not ultimately balance \nthe Federal budget.\n  Let's alter the Constitution the right way, and let's balance the \nbudget the right way. At the end of the day, when the dust has settled, \nlet's decide we are not increasing the Federal debt and we are not \ncontinuing to saddle our children and grandchildren with additional \ndebt.\n  Mr. President, this is a substitute constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. I intend to support it, as I have in the past, and \nthose who want a constitutional amendment to balance the budget to pass \nin this Chamber, and to do so with 70 or 75 votes, should decide to \nsupport this substitute constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 17, offered by the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Dorgan]. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 16\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much. I have an amendment \nat the desk and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment before the Senate is amendment \nNo. 16, proposed by the Senator from California. There are 30 minutes \nof time to be equally divided. The Senator from California will have 15 \nminutes, and the Senator from Utah will have 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Budget Committee and now of the \nAppropriations Committee, I am keenly aware of the benefits of a \nbalanced Federal budget. I have voted for three balanced budget plans--\nthe Conrad plan, the Bradley plan, and the bipartisan Chafee-Breaux \nplan. As a Member of the House, I voted for a balanced budget statute.\n  While I have very serious reservations about a balanced budget \namendment, which I spoke about on this floor--as do, by the way, 1,100 \neconomists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan--I \nbelieve if we are to have a balanced budget amendment, however, which \nwe cannot predict today if we will or not, it should be flexible enough \nto respond to emergencies which occur as a result of natural disasters.\n  Now, Mr. President, I hope that Members of this U.S. Senate will \nunderstand that it is not one State of the Union that gets all of the \nnatural disasters, although sometimes I feel, certainly, that my State \ngets far more than its fair share. I can tell you, if you look at this \nnatural disaster risk profile that was put out by the U.S. Geological \nService, you can see that there are tremendous risks for natural \ndisasters all over this country. The light blue is the low risk, the \ndarker greenish blue is the high risk, and this is the medium risk. \nAlmost all over the country we have serious risks. This hatched area \nshows the extreme risk of tornado in the midsection of our Nation, and \nhurricanes, the extreme risk of hurricanes, as my friends in the Gulf \nStates know so well, which are also on the Atlantic.\n  Clearly, in California we run the risk of earthquakes. That is our \nbiggest risk. But we have many other risks, as well: such as volcanos \nand floods. Floods occur all over the country.\n  I say to my friends in the Senate that I pray that none of us ever \nhas to come to the floor of the Senate asking for help in times of \nemergency. I will say under this amendment if you do that and you have \nhundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars of damages--as \nwe have seen in Florida, as we have seen in California, as we have seen \nin the Midwest, as we have seen in many other parts of the country, in \norder to get this aid under this particular balanced budget amendment, \nyou need to get 60 votes in this U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S1645]]\n\n I will tell you right now there is no certainty of that.\n  So what we do in our amendment, Mr. President, is simply say that \nwhen there is a declaration of a natural disaster, and that declaration \nis supported by a simple majority vote in both Houses of Congress, we \nwill be able to move by a simple majority vote, not a 60-vote majority, \nand send the aid that is needed.\n  Mr. President, I want to remind you by way of some photographs of \nsome of these disasters that we have seen in my State. Here is a \npicture of the damage to a freeway in Northridge in 1994 where \nbasically the freeway completely collapsed, people were killed, and we \nhad to act very, very fast. In that particular earthquake, Mr. \nPresident, due to the kindness, the kindness of the Clinton \nadministration and this Congress, we were able to pump into the Los \nAngeles area in excess of $11 billion to repair lives, to repair homes, \nto make sure that people had shelter--children, families. And I will \ntell you, Mr. President, if we had to find that $11 billion elsewhere \nin the budget or we needed to come up with 60 votes, I think it would \nbe a very difficult thing to do. A supermajority is wrong in any case. \nIt is wrong to give so much power to a minority when a natural disaster \nis a question of life or death.\n\n  Here is another photograph, Mr. President. This is from this year. \nThese are homes, and you can barely tell that because they are buried \nin water. That is the kind of flooding we had when levees broke--very \nsimilar to the Midwest. We need to move quickly when these disasters \nhit.\n  Here is a photograph of Yosemite this year, Mr. President. You can't \neven pass through the road here. The communities that rely on tourism \nare in deep trouble.\n  If Senators had to go to the floor and cut other parts of the budget \nto meet the needs of these emergencies, I will tell you, it would be \nvery difficult. So I am very hopeful that we will not put this U.S. \nSenate into a straitjacket. This Senate already defeated some very \nimportant amendments to protect Social Security. They defeated, with a \nblock of votes, amendments that would have allowed us to react in a \nserious recession or depression. Those 1,100 economists said that what \nthe Senate is doing is dangerous. It is dangerous to put this \nGovernment into an economic straitjacket. And Alan Greenspan, whom so \nmany of my friends on the other side of the aisle credit with this \neconomic recovery--they turn away from his advice.\n  But I say to them, here we are talking about life or death. Here we \nare talking about shelter for people who get hurt in a disaster. Here \nwe are talking about a serious problem where we must act and we must \nact swiftly. And if we have to do it with 60 votes, or if we must cut \ncorresponding amounts from the rest of the budget, I am saying this as \nsure as I am standing here--and I am proud to be standing here--we may \nleave Americans in dire straits because we are handcuffing our ability \nto react.\n  There are some people here who obviously have no trust in their \ncolleagues. They are calling for a supermajority. They don't trust \ntheir colleagues. They want a minority to be able to hold back a very \nimportant vote, perhaps to save people in my State, or people even in \ntheir own States. I think this is wrong. I said, when I came on to this \nfloor several days ago at the beginning of this debate, I believe this \nis a very radical proposal.\n  I believe the evidence is in and that those people who are following \nthis debate now understand that we don't need this amendment to balance \nthe budget. All we need to do to balance the budget is cast the tough \nvotes. What is extraordinary to me is that most of the people voting \nfor this balanced budget amendment weren't there when the tough votes \nwere taken and when we were able to reduce this deficit--4 years in a \nrow--from $290 billion down to $107 billion. Where were those people? \nSo they offer up this fiscal figleaf, and it will put us in a \nstraitjacket. It will tie our hands. We won't be able to protect Social \nSecurity or protect jobs in a depression or a severe recession. And \nnow, without my amendment--and I am not that hopeful that we will win \nthis because we have not won any of these amendments--a minority of the \nSenate, or a minority of the other body, could hold up desperately \nneeded disaster aid.\n  I will reserve the remainder of my time to respond to my good friend \nfrom Utah, and I am hopeful that Members will look at this and support \nthe Boxer amendment, which is also supported by Senator Durbin and \nSenator Murray.\n  Again, I reserve my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes for the Senator from \nUtah, and 5 minutes 17 seconds for the Senator from California.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened to my colleague, and I know she \nis sincere. But I have to point out that her amendment, like all of the \nothers, is just another way of making sure the balanced budget \namendment has no effect. Let me read it to the people:\n\n       At the end of section 5, add the following: ``The \n     provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal year \n     * * * ''\n\n  That means for the whole fiscal year.\n\n       * * * in which there is a declaration made by the President \n     (and a designation by the Congress) that a major disaster or \n     emergency exists, adopted by a majority vote in each House of \n     those present and voting.\n\n  This amendment is simply a permutation of the amendment we voted on \ntoday, the Feinstein amendment, which was rejected by 67 Senators just \na few hours ago. It would have provided for a waiver of the balanced \nbudget requirement for any fiscal year in which the United States is \nexperiencing a serious economic emergency or major natural disaster. I \nwas one of the 67 Senators who opposed that amendment. But I have to \nsay that I actually prefer that amendment to the one being offered now \nby my friend from California. For one thing, the spending loophole \ncreated by this amendment is even more gaping than the one in the \namendment we voted down this evening. As Senator Enzi said, you can \n``sail an aircraft carrier through the loophole created by the \nFeinstein amendment.'' If so, then you can sail an entire fleet through \nthe loophole this amendment would provide. This would provide for a \nwaiver of the balanced budget requirement in any fiscal year in which \nCongress and the President declare there is a major disaster or \nemergency. Unlike earlier amendments, this amendment does not even \nrequire that the disaster be a natural disaster or that the emergency \nbe an economic one. That being the case, I wonder what exactly \nqualifies as a disaster and an emergency under this amendment.\n  According to the language of this amendment, a disaster is whatever \nCongress says it is. I think the worst disaster we are facing are these \ncontinual, piled-up unbalanced budgets every year. That is what we are \ntrying to resolve here. Just think of all the things that a creative \nCongress, bent on deficit spending, could categorize as a disaster or \nemergency in order to justify more borrowing. Does this amendment mean \nto say that a drop in SAT scores can be deemed an emergency by Congress \nand thereby be used as a basis for borrowing to increase educational \nfunding, without having to abide by the strictures of a balanced budget \namendment?\n  The fact is that, under this amendment, just about anything can be \nclassified a disaster or emergency and serve as a springboard for \ncontinued deficit spending.\n  For one thing, Mr. President, this is precisely the type of behavior \nthat has put us into the $5.3 trillion of national debt. These \nunbalanced budgets for the last 28 years demonstrate that. They \ndemonstrate the sad result of such loosely defined exemptions from \nborrowing or spending limits. For another thing, this amendment does \nnothing more than preserve a distorted version of the status quo.\n  Under this amendment, a waiver of the balanced budget requirement may \nbe obtained by a declaration made by the President and a similar \ndeclaration by Congress. But the precise procedure is not clear. Does \nthis mean that the President must first declare an emergency or \ndisaster by Executive order before the Congress acts to ratify or adopt \nthat declaration? Does it then need to be signed by the President? Or, \nif that is not what this amendment means, then perhaps, in effect, it \nmeans that Congress must declare an emergency or disaster--by a joint \nresolution or some other legislative vehicle--adopted by a simple \nmajority vote\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\nand then signed by the President. That is what we have been doing when \nwe came up with these 28 straight unbalanced budgets. That is also what \nwe've done in piling up unbalanced budgets in 58 of the last 66 years. \nThat sounds more familiar to me. Indeed, it is familiar to me because \nit is exactly how we operate today. It is exactly how we have gotten \nour Nation into a $5.3 trillion national debt and have produced \nunbalanced budgets for every one of the last 28 years.\n\n  Mr. President, Senate Joint Resolution 1 is a clear, concise \namendment carefully drafted over several years with input from Members \non both sides of the aisle. I heard earlier in the day one of our \ncolleagues say that this is a Republican amendment. Give me a break. \nYes; all 55 Republicans are supporting it. But there are 11 courageous \nDemocrats supporting this. I wonder what Charlie Stenholm thinks about \nremarks like that, another courageous Democrat from the House who has \nhelped to work on this. And Senator Bryan, Senator Graham, Senator \nRobb, and so many others who have played a pivotal role in this.\n  The three-fifths waiver contained in section 1 strikes an important \nbalance in that it is both sufficient to answer the concerns raised by \nthe Senator's amendment and strong enough to keep the balanced budget \namendment meaningful.\n  The simple fact is that in actual circumstances of disaster or \nemergencies, Congress has had little difficulty achieving the \nsupermajority vote required under the balanced budget amendment. I have \ndone some research on the disasters in this Nation during the past 7 \nyears with the help of the Congressional Research Service. I found that \nin virtually every circumstance, emergency spending bills placed before \nthe House and Senate passed with supermajorities, even when no such \nrequirement was in place.\n  For example, in fiscal year 1995 the House and Senate voted on H.R. \n1944, which provided $7.2 billion in disaster aid, mostly to help with \nrecovery efforts in Los Angeles from the 1994 earthquake. The bill \npassed the Senate with a vote of 90 to 7--well over the supermajority \nrequirements of Senate Joint Resolution 1. In the House, the bill \npassed by 276 votes--also a supermajority.\n  The 1994 fiscal year disaster supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. \n3759, received similar treatment. That bill, to provide nearly $10 \nbillion in new appropriations for emergency expenses of the Los Angeles \nearthquake, humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping activities, as \nwell as for Midwest flood assistance, and highway reconstruction from \nthe San Francisco earthquake, passed the House by a vote of 337 to 74--\nsome 75 votes more than would have been necessary under Senate Joint \nResolution 1's supermajority requirement. The same measure passed the \nSenate by a vote of 85 to 10.\n  Mr. President, I could go on, but I will summarize by saying that in \nthe past 7 years we have voted many times on emergency disaster \nfunding. I count only two situations where a supermajority was not \nreached--this despite the fact that no supermajority was needed. The \nreality is that when there are truly meritorious circumstances the \ngeneral three-fifths waiver will not stand in the way of what is best \nfor the American people. What will stand in the way is the kind of \nfrivolous expenditures and disregard for the financial well-being of \nfuture generations that has plagued our budget process for each of the \nlast 28 years, exemplified by these two stacks of unbalanced budget \nbooks.\n  Mr. President, we are here to instill in the budget process the \nfiscal discipline that has been lacking for much of this century. I \nwill say once again that what we need to do is pass a balanced budget \namendment free of loopholes and gimmicks. Unless we do, we will never \nrein in the out-of-control spending habits that have brought us to \nwhere we are today.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Boxer amendment, and \nhopefully we will move quickly to pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, there was a discussion earlier today on whether or not \nthe Reagan tax cuts enacted by Congress caused the debt we now have or \nwhether it was congressional spending that has run up our debt. I would \nlike to add some more concrete figures to illuminate that discussion. I \nbelieve the facts are clear--the Reagan tax cuts increased revenues. \nBut spending increased faster.\n  Let me explain further:\n  Excessive spending and not tax cuts are responsible for increased \ndeficits during the 1980's.\n  Even with tax cuts, Federal tax revenues continue to increase.\n  In fact, Federal revenues have continued to grow in every fiscal year \nafter the 1981 tax cuts. The only exception to this was fiscal year \n1983, after the recession of 1982.\n  This increase in Federal revenues was consistent through the sources \nof Federal receipts--individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, \nSocial Security insurance taxes and contributions, and other taxes.\n  Total receipts went up by the following percentages: 1980-1986: 48.7 \npercent; 1981-1986: 28.8 percent; 1981-1987: 42.5 percent. The middle \npercentage from 1981 to 1986 is probably the most representative of the \neffects of the Reagan tax cuts.\n  Further, tax revenues grew faster after the Reagan tax cuts than they \nhave following the Bush and Clinton tax increases. From 1983 to 1989, \ntax revenue grew at a real rate of 8.7 percent compared to a 5.9-\npercent growth rate from 1990 to 1996.\n  Similarly, President Kennedy knew the growth effects of lower taxes. \nDuring the years of the Kennedy tax cuts revenues increased 6.4 percent \na year.\n  As President Kennedy said in his address to the American people \nconcerning his tax proposal:\n\n       Prosperity is the real way to balance our budget. * * * By \n     lowering tax rates, by increasing jobs and income, we can \n     expand tax revenues and finally bring our budget into \n     balance..\n\n  To further illustrate these points, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record two tables from the 1996 Economic Report of the \nPresident.\n  For further detail, I also refer my colleagues to the Joint Economic \nCommittee report on taxes and long-term economic growth, dated February \nof 1997.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              TABLE B-74.--FEDERAL RECEIPTS, OUTLAYS, SURPLUS OR DEFICIT, AND DEBT, SELECTED FISCAL YEARS, 1929-95\n

I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to respond to my friend's comments. \nAnd I hope he can stay on the floor because I think he raised some \nimportant points, some of which I agree with.\n  He said this isn't a partisan issue. I agree with my friend from \nUtah. Alan Greenspan, who is the hero of many on the Republican side of \nthe aisle--indeed, when we say the President's policies have brought us \nmillions of new jobs and the lowest misery index, they always say it is \nAlan Greenspan. Alan Greenspan, Republican, opposes this amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  I will give you another voice, Jean M. Ross of the nonpartisan \nCalifornia Budget Project, wrote that a balanced budget amendment would \nlimit the Federal Government's ability to help States needing economic \nassistance. I can say to my friend that economic assistance to States \nis not only needed during the recessions, which my friend thought was a \nbig loophole, but it is certainly needed in times of disaster.\n  If you look at this map, you can see almost the entire country is \nunder some risk for disaster.\n  My friend says we can never balance the budget. He has all these \nbudgets up there. I was glad to see Senator Byrd point out that the \nbiggest deficits occurred in the 1980's in those books because of \ntrickle-down economics, and a huge military buildup. We didn't pay for \nit. Those are what those books say.\n  My friend says we are never going to have a balanced budget until we \nhave a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We will never \nhave a balanced budget until we vote for a balanced budget, and I have \ndone that three times. I voted the tough votes, and the deficit is \ngoing down. I feel standing up here is quite fiscally responsible \nbecause of those votes. But when you put this country in an economic \nstraitjacket, I think it is dangerous.\n  My friend says he doesn't understand my amendment. I find that \nextraordinary because I offered it the last time we voted on this \nbalanced budget. No one had problems understanding it. It is the same \namendment. But let me read to my friend the purpose as written in my \namendment, in case he doesn't understand it. The purpose is to provide \nFederal assistance to supplement State and local efforts to alleviate \nthe damage, loss, hardship, and suffering caused by disasters or \nemergencies by exempting spending that is designated emergency \nrequirements by both the President and the Congress.\n  The point is that it is very clear that the President will declare a \ndisaster or emergency. The Congress will then take a look at it. The \nCongress will then act. And, if the Congress agrees that this is a \ndisaster or an emergency, then the 60-vote requirement is waived.\n  My friend says it is easy to get 60 votes in an emergency. I would \nlike to tell my friend a story. We had an earthquake in San Francisco \nand a freeway collapsed. It was called the Cypress Freeway. It is in \nOakland, and it was destroyed. I am very familiar with this because my \nhusband crossed that freeway an hour before it went down. So I am very \nfamiliar with the Cypress Freeway. We are rebuilding the Cypress \nFreeway.\n  And one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--as a matter \nof fact, it was the then majority leader, Bob Dole, who decided that he \ndidn't like the rebuilding plan and brought the issue before us. And I \nhad to fight for my life, along with Senator Feinstein, to keep the \nrebuilding of the Cypress Freeway on the floor and alive and fulfill \nour obligations to the people of Northern California. We forced a vote \non it. We got 53 votes, and we were able to move forward. We did not \nget 60 votes. Had this balanced budget requirement been in place we \nwould not have been able to finish building the Cypress Freeway.\n  So for anyone who comes on this floor and thinks that it is easy to \nget 60 votes when politics plays a role in some of it, and budget \ndeficits will play a role in it, I would just say to them, please don't \ngive that kind of power to a minority of the U.S. Senate. Let us vote a \nsimple majority vote in case of natural disasters.\n  There is no confusion about this amendment. If my friend has \nconfusion, all he has to do is read the purpose. It is clear what we \nare talking about.\n  I will just show one more picture again of what we are talking about. \nWe are talking about flooding and storms that cause roads to shut down. \nWe are talking about houses being buried in the water because of \nfloods. It is real simple, I say to my friend. Let's not tell people it \nis confusing. It is pretty clear.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in spite of the sincerity of my colleague \nfrom California, I think I have said all that needs to be said on this. \nI yield back the remainder of my time, and I move to table and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion to table the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 40, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 18 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith, Bob\n     Smith, Gordon H.\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 16) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senate has had before it several \namendments that include provisions their proponents say will exempt \nSocial Security from the balanced budget amendment. I do not doubt the \nSenators who propose the amendments are sincere in their desire to \nprotect Social Security; none of us wants to harm Social Security, \nwhich is so important to so many older Americans. I have to say, \nthough, that well-intentioned as their amendment may be, I cannot think \nof a greater threat to Social Security.\n  Consider for a moment what it would mean to exempt Social Security \nfrom the balanced budget amendment. In effect, Social Security would \nbecome the only Federal program--the only program--where deficits would \nbe permitted. The rest of the Federal budget would be required to be in \nbalance.\n  How on earth does allowing Social Security to be in deficit protect \nour seniors? Quite the opposite. If a balanced budget is good for other \nprograms, why is it not good for Social Security? There is no greater \nprotection for seniors than having the money to take care of our \nobligations. In fact, we have been able to provide for seniors \nprecisely because Social Security has usually been in balance or \nsurplus; it is the rest of the budget that has been plagued by big, \nchronic deficits.\n  Now, at the very time it appears we are near consensus about how \ndetrimental deficits are, some are proposing that we allow deficits to \nbegin to infect the retirement program. In fact, the amendments to \nexempt Social Security would establish a constitutional presumption \nthat Social Security will be run in deficit. Why else would the program \nbe exempt from a balanced budget requirement?\n  Mr. President, we have always made sure that Social Security is \nactuarially sound. When Social Security faced problems back in the \nearly 1980's, Republicans and Democrats came together in a bipartisan \nway to rescue the program and make sure that the benefits of current \nretirees were protected and paid on time.\n  On a bipartisan basis, we have abided by rules in the Senate that \nmake it virtually impossible to pass a budget that adversely affects \nthe Social Security surplus; it would take a supermajority vote to pass \nsuch a thing. On a bipartisan basis, we made sure that Social Security \nwas exempt from the across-the-board spending cuts required by the \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law in the 1980's. The \nRepublican budgets of the last 2 years proposed ways of achieving \nbalance without touching Social Security, and I assume President \nClinton's new budget will not touch Social Security, either.\n  So the reality is that Republicans and Democrats have worked together \nevery step of the way to protect the integrity of the Social Security \nsystem.\n  Why? Because there is general consensus in the country that Social \nSecurity must be protected. It has broad bipartisan support in Congress \nand around the country. It is supported by people young and old, rich \nand poor. It works. And unlike other programs run by our Government, it \nworks because we have made sure that it has always operated in balance \nor with a surplus to cover unforeseen circumstances or expected future \nneeds. That commitment to sound budgeting would be upheld by the \nbalanced budget amendment--and applied to the rest of the budget as \nwell.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak for a few moments about what I believe \nare some of the misperceptions about the balanced budget amendment and \nthe Social Security exemption that is being proposed.\n  First, there is nothing in the balanced budget amendment that \nrequires cuts in Social Security benefits. In fact, the budgets that \nCongress passed during the last 2 years would have achieved balance \nwithout touching Social Security, so obviously it can be done without \nharming the retirement system.\n  Second, there is nothing in the exemption that is being proposed that \nwould prevent Congress from cutting retirement benefits, means-testing \nbenefits, reducing cost-of-living adjustments, or raising payroll \ntaxes. The exemption would not prevent the expenditure of Social \nSecurity funds for other purposes; in fact, it would do just the \nopposite. Given that the exemption would allow Social Security to run a \ndeficit, Congress will in all likelihood simply shift spending that \ncannot be accommodated within a balanced budget to the Social Security \nbudget.\n  Since Social Security is a program defined in statute--and Congress \ncan amend that statute at any time by simple majority vote--Congress \nwould be free to call virtually anything Social Security--whether it be \nMedicare, Medicaid, education, infrastructure development, or welfare--\nand thereby extend the exemption to cover those programs, too. The \nincentive would be to raid the trust funds for any project or program \nthat might otherwise bust the Federal budget, and that would endanger \nthe solvency of what today constitutes the Social Security Program. It \nwould also mean that a provision of the Constitution could be amended \nby a simple majority vote--by just amending the statute that is \nreferred to in the constitutional exemption. That, of course, would \ndirectly contradict the amendment clause of the Constitution itself.\n  Third, there is nothing in the exemption that precludes the Social \nSecurity surplus from being invested in Government securities and, in \nturn, being used to cover general operating expenses, just as it is \nnow. Even those using Social Security as a pretext for opposing a \nbalanced budget know that Congress has always made sure that the debt \nto the Social Security trust fund has been repaid--repaid with \ninterest.\n  Mr. President, the fact that the Social Security surplus is invested \nin government securities and used for general operating expenses does \nnot mean beneficiaries are being shortchanged of any benefits due them. \nThe surpluses do not exist for current retirees, but to help cover the \ncost of benefits when the baby-boom generation retires years down the \nroad.\n  So, the only relevant question regarding the safety and soundness of \nSocial Security is whether, when it comes time to pay those benefits to \nfuture retirees, the Federal government will be able to cover its IOU's \nto the Social Security trust fund. That, in turn, depends on how deeply \nin debt the Federal government is.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office projected just last \nmonth that the budget deficit will reverse course and begin to rise \nagain--from $107 billion in 1996 to $124 billion in 1997--and it will \nkeep rising to $278 billion in 2007. Debt held by the public will \nincrease 55 percent in just the next 10 years. The more debt that \naccumulates, the harder it will be for the Government to repay Social \nSecurity in the future while also meeting all of the Nation's other \nneeds--for example, in law enforcement, education, the environment, and \nhealth care. The balanced budget amendment will help minimize the \naccumulation of debt and the threat to future retirees that is inherent \nin it.\n\n  If Congress does not balance the budget--if it does not constrain the \nnational debt--the temptation will ultimately be to monetize the debt--\nthat is, pay it off by printing more money. And that would lead to \nrampant inflation. No industrialized nation has ever\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\nreached the level of debt that our country is expected to face in the \nnext century without monetizing the debt, printing more money, and \nexperiencing destructive, rampant inflation.\n  If inflation drives the cost of basic goods and services beyond the \nreach of most Americans--if, for example, bread costs $100 a loaf--it \nwill not matter that a retiree's $1,000 Social Security check arrives \npromptly in the mail. The worst enemy of those on fixed incomes is \ninflation.\n  So the exemption neither guards against cuts in benefits nor ensures \nthat the government has the ability to repay its debts to the trust \nfund to cover future benefits. It is a false promise to the millions of \nAmericans who depend on Social Security to meet their most basic of \nneeds.\n  Leaving Social Security under the balanced budget amendment will, \nhowever, make sure that the retirement system remains safe, sound, and \nbalanced. And that is important because, while the system is running \nannual surpluses now, it will soon begin running huge deficits. \nBeginning in 2012, Social Security will begin spending more than it \ncollects in payroll taxes. By 2029, benefits will amount to more than \nall payroll tax revenue, accumulated surpluses, and interest--meaning \nthat the trust fund will have neither sufficient income nor savings to \nmeet then-current obligations. If allowed to continue operating in \ndeficit, the Social Security Program will rack up $7 trillion in debt \nby 2070. These deficits are the greatest threat to the Social Security \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, the exemption will not protect benefits or guarantee \nrepayment of IOU's to cover future benefits. It will not even ensure \nthat Social Security surpluses are invested in something other than \ngovernment IOU's. But it will make it far more difficult to balance the \nrest of the budget by not allowing the amounts invested in Government \nsecurities to be counted toward a balanced budget.\n  That would mean Congress would have to cut spending, raise taxes, or \nboth by an additional $706 billion over the 5-year period 2002 through \n2007 beyond what would be necessary to balance a unified budget.\n  The exclusion would force deep spending cuts--an additional across-\nthe-board reduction of 10 percent--in education, the environment, \nMedicare, law enforcement, and other discretionary spending programs. \nOr, it would require huge tax increases--up to 12 percent higher than \nthey are today.\n  To put that into perspective, President Clinton's 1993 tax increase \namounted to $241 billion. Last year's congressional budget resolution \nproposed slower Medicare-spending growth to provide savings of $158 \nbillion, and discretionary spending savings totalling $291 billion.\n  The $706 billion in additional deficit reduction that would be \nrequired by the Social Security exemption would amount to more than the \nClinton tax increase and those two sources of savings combined. It \nwould obviously be very difficult to find any consensus for such huge \nreductions, and therein lies the rub. I am very concerned that the \nSocial Security issue--that older Americans--are being made the \nscapegoats for a vote against the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, if proponents of the exemption are serious about \nwanting to balance the budget, excluding Social Security, then they \nshould lay out how they will deal with tomorrow's Social Security \ndeficit as well as how they intend to cover the $706 billion gap in the \nshort term.\n  Or they should simply admit that they do not support a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is for a fallen \ncolleague on the other side of the rotunda. We lost the Congressman \nfrom San Antonio a few weeks ago at the age of 51 to a battle with \ncancer.\n  Frank Tejeda was a great Congressman, he was a great friend, and he \nwas a patriot for this country. He left high school at the age of 17, \njoined the Marine Corps, came back and graduated from St. Mary's \nUniversity. He then went on to distinguish himself and earn degrees in \nlaw from U.C. Berkeley and Yale, as well as a masters in public \nadministration from Harvard.\n  Frank Tejeda was a hero. He earned the Bronze Star for valor, and \nreceived the Purple Heart for wounds sustained in combat in Vietnam. \nBut most of all, he never forgot where he was from--south San Antonio, \nTX. As a leader in his community and as a public servant, Frank always \nremembered the people he represented and was always there for them.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, my colleague Senator Gramm and I want \nto name the Postal Service facility being constructed at 7411 Barlite \nBoulevard in San Antonio, TX, as the ``Frank M. Tejeda Post Office \nBuilding.'' So I am going to make two unanimous-consent requests to \ndischarge H.R. 499, which passed unanimously in the House of \nRepresentatives on February 5, 1997, in order to complete the naming of \nthis post office for a great patriot, a great friend, and a wonderful \nCongressman from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 499; and \nfurther, that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 499) to designate the facility of the United \n     States Postal Service under construction at 7411 Barlite \n     Boulevard in San Antonio, Texas, as the ``Frank M. Tejeda \n     Post Office Building.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleague, Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison, in offering a tribute to our late colleague, \nCongressman Frank Tejeda.\n  Frank will be remembered as a man who dedicated his life to serving \nAmerica. He was widely admired for his friendly common sense, but in \nparticular for the special place that he kept in his heart for the men \nand women who wear the uniform of our country.\n  In his short tenure, Frank Tejeda left his mark on our country, on \nthe people of Texas, and most personally on the people of San Antonio, \nwho knew him best. It is most fitting that we designate the Post Office \nfacility to be constructed in San Antonio as the ``Frank M. Tejeda post \noffice Building,'' not to remind people of who Frank was, for they do \nnot need to be reminded. We designate the facility in Frank's name to \nrecall for future generations that a man, whose life was too short, \nmade a difference and will live in our hearts.\n  The Frank M. Tejeda Building will stand as a monument for dedication, \ncommitment, and for the precept that with God-given talents and the \nwill to work, we can do anything we set out to do in America. Frank \nTejeda epitomized those qualities in his life and we honor him.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Phil Gramm and \nmyself, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be deemed read a third \ntime and passed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; \nand that any statements relating to the bill appear at the appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 499) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. We have now finally passed \nthe bill in both Houses of Congress that will name a post office for \nFrank M.\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\nTejeda. It is a fitting tribute to a wonderful former Member of the \nU.S. Congress. Senator Gramm and I are very proud to have served with \nhim and to cosponsor this bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                the fbi and the alcee m. hastings matter\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke to my colleagues about \nmanagement problems within the FBI, and within the Bureau's reputed \ncrime lab. I spoke about the consequences of this mismanagement. \nConfidence and trust in the Nation's premiere law enforcement agency is \ndwindling. It is because of the FBI's own abuses of its very enormous \npowers.\n  Yesterday, I mentioned that I would talk about a specific case, with \nspecific allegations. The case involves apparent false statements and \nevidence tempering by an FBI agent in a high profile case brought \nbefore the Federal judicial system and the U.S. Congress.\n  In a letter to me dated February 21, FBI Deputy Director Weldon \nKennedy stated that the Justice Department inspector general ``found no \ninstance of perjury evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or \nfailure to report exculpatory evidence.''\n  Mr. President, my first response to that is as follows: The IG \ninvestigation was not a criminal investigation. It therefore would not \nfind perjury, evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure to \nreport exculpatory evidence. If it had been a criminal investigation, I \nbelieve Mr. Kennedy would not have said what he said. His credibility \nis undercut by the facts.\n  This morning's Washington Post contains a story about how one FBI \nagent, Special Agent Michael P. Malone, apparently shaved evidence, \nprovided false statements, and tampered with evidence for an Eleventh \nCircuit Court proceeding involving then-Judge Alcee L. Hastings. Mr. \nHastings is now a Member of the House of Representatives. Mr. Malone is \nstill an FBI agent, and has testified in thousands of cases.\n  Despite well-documented evidence of this wrongdoing, the FBI covered \nit up. The evidence was documented by an FBI lab scientist, who \nperformed lab tests on a piece of evidence in the Hastings case. Malone \nfalsely claimed to have done the tests himself.\n  The FBI scientist who made the allegations is not Dr. Frederic \nWhitehurst, the more well-known whistleblower from the FBI lab. Rather, \nit is Dr. William Tobin of the same lab. By the way, this undercuts the \nFBI's assertion that Dr. Whitehurst is the only one in the lab making \nthese allegations.\n  A memorandum written by Dr. Tobin in 1989 details the alleged false \nstatements, evidence shaving, and evidence tampering by Agent Malone. \nIt was the basis of reports in the last 24 hours in the media. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nWashington Post story.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 26, 1997]\n\n                     FBI Role in Impeachment Probed\n\n                           (By Pierre Thomas)\n\n       The Justice Department inspector general has been \n     investigating whether the FBI intentionally gave misleading \n     testimony to a judicial panel that was deliberating whether \n     to recommend that then-U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings \n     be impeached.\n       The Justice Department probe has uncovered evidence that an \n     FBI examiner who worked on the Hastings case, now a \n     Democratic representative from Florida, vigorously challenged \n     the bureau's laboratory analysis of a key piece of evidence \n     relating to the judge's truthfulness in a bribery trial in \n     the early 1980s. But Justice Department investigators found \n     that FBI supervisors largely ignored the examiner's critique \n     and never provided the dissenting information to Congress, \n     which later removed Hastings from the bench.\n       The revelation is the first detailed account supporting \n     allegations by FBI whistleblower Frederic Whitehurst about \n     shoddy FBI laboratory work. Whitehurst claims that bureau \n     officials routinely manipulated forensic work and allowed \n     flawed expert testimony during court proceedings if it helped \n     prosecutions.\n       ``It is not just Dr. Whitehurst who has alleged wrongdoing \n     in the FBI crime lab,'' Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) \n     said yesterday.'' . . . I fear the FBI has covered up the \n     lab's shortcomings.''\n       Documents obtained by The Washington Post in connection \n     with the Hastings investigation raise questions about the \n     bureau's willingness to address criticisms of its laboratory \n     procedures, even when its own employees raised them, Grassley \n     and others said.\n       ``The misrepresentations and misstatements in the \n     transcript (regarding FBI forensic testimony in the Hastings \n     case) . . . represent a glaring pattern of conversion of what \n     should have been presented as neutral data into incriminating \n     circumstances by complete reversal of established laboratory \n     test data with scientifically unfounded, unqualified and \n     biased testimony,'' wrote frustrated FBI examiner William A. \n     Tobin in 1989.\n       Tobin wrote that, while he agreed with the FBI's overall \n     forensic assessment in the Hastings case, he was concerned \n     that the bureau's testimony had gone too far in an apparent \n     attempt to bolster the case against Hastings. Tobin's \n     memorandum noted no fewer than 27 exceptions, or challenges, \n     to bureau testimony against Hastings, Florida's first black \n     federal judge, after he was acquitted of federal bribery \n     charges. The judicial inquiry begun after his acquittal \n     raised allegations of racism from African American \n     leaders.\n       During an interview with the Justice Department inspector \n     general's office, Tobin reiterated his concerns to \n     investigators, according to sources familiar with the \n     inspector general's ongoing review. He also told \n     investigators that he turned his memorandum in to his \n     supervisor, but the bureau apparently did nothing to address \n     his concerns. In fact, he never heard back from his superiors \n     on the matter, Tobin said. In addition, sources said that \n     investigators have been unable to find Tobin's original \n     forensic report, which should have been used to prepare for \n     the testimony in the Hastings case.\n       ``Alcee Hastings and I have believed for some time that a \n     fair amount of evidence against him was manipulated or \n     manufactured,'' said Terence Anderson, Hasting's attorney \n     during impeachment proceedings.\n       Hastings called the revelation ``astounding beyond belief. \n     I need to understand who withheld this information, why they \n     withheld it and what effect it would have had if it were \n     presented to Congress,'' which impeached and convicted him.\n       Whitehurst's attorney, Stephen Kohn, agreed, saying that \n     ``if the FBI could put forth false evidence regarding a \n     sitting judge, every American is at risk to FBI \n     lawlessness.''\n       In response to a broad inspector general investigation of \n     the FBI crime laboratory, Justice Department officials have \n     notified at least 50 state and federal prosecutors of \n     potential problems in their cases.\n       Hastings was charged in 1981 along with friend and \n     Washington lawyer William A. Borders Jr. of engaging in a \n     conspiracy to accept a $150,000 bribe from an undercover FBI \n     agent posing as the brother of two men convicted of \n     racketeering. In exchange, Hastings was to reduce the men's \n     sentences and return nearly $1 million in forfeited property.\n       Borders was convicted of the crime. Hastings, in a separate \n     trial in 1983, was acquitted of the same charges. He has \n     steadfastly maintained his innocence.\n       But after a 3\\1/2\\-year investigation prompted by an ethics \n     complaint from several of his fellow judges, successive \n     judicial panels concluded that Hastings had not only engaged \n     in a bribery conspiracy, but lied and manufactured evidence \n     at the trial to win acquittal.\n       Investigators sought to challenge Hastings' truthfulness on \n     a number of fronts.\n       Hastings testified he was with Borders at the time he was \n     alleged to have taken the bribe in part because he was trying \n     to find a leather shop to repair a men's purse whose strap \n     had broken.\n       FBI forensic experts were asked to test the strap to see if \n     it could be snapped by accident, as Hastings described, or \n     whether it was too strong and would have had to have been \n     cut. The FBI's lab experts concluded the strap had been cut. \n     The inference was that Hasting had cut the strap in an \n     attempt to concoct an alibi.\n       Tobin generally agreed with that conclusion but said he was \n     deeply troubled about FBI testimony in the case and believed \n     it ``revealed a pattern of complete omission of crucial \n     conditions, caveats, premises and or assumptions which may be \n     viewed as tending toward exculpatory.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Higher ups in the FBI never did a thing about this \nproblem. Yet, it speaks to exactly the charge made by Dr. Whitehurst; \nnamely, that the culture within the FBI is to overstate lab results to \nget a conviction. They do this by withholding any data that might show \nthe opposite.\n  That makes me think of an analogy, Mr. President. Imagine me standing \nby a dog. You ask me if my dog bites. I say ``no.'' You reach down to \npet the dog, and he bites you. You say, ``I thought you said your dog \ndoesn't bite.'' And I say, ``That's not my dog.''\n  The point is, I withheld valuable information to keep you from having \nan informed judgment. That is what the FBI does, according to Dr. \nWhitehurst, and in this specific case according to Dr. Tobin. And when \nthe IG's investigative report comes out next month, we'll see if there \nare other examples that need following up.\n  In an interview with Federal investigators, Dr. Tobin called this \n``forensic prostitution.'' Those were his\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\nwords, Mr. President. Forensic prostitution. It must be really bad when \na senior, supervisory agent in the FBI's own lab calls that practice \n``forensic prostitution.'' What does that say about the standards in \nthe lab? And does not that back up what was charged by Dr. Whitehurst? \nOf course it does.\n  The impact of the Tobin memo, in my view, is not whether it would \nchange the outcome of the Alcee Hastings case. I have heard arguments \non both sides. I don't know, for instance, whether it would make enough \nof a difference for me to have changed my vote to convict Mr. Hastings. \nOne thing is for sure: Agent Malone sure thought it was important. But \nis not it simply a matter of fairness for Mr. Hastings?\n  And that is not the only issue. The impact is much broader, much more \nserious. It raises questions about the integrity of the criminal \njustice process, especially the FBI's role. It raises the inference, in \nthis highly visible case before the American people, that other \nevidence could have been tainted.\n  This alleged wrongdoing by an FBI agent wasn't done to a terrorist, \nor a mad bomber. He was a sitting Federal judge, a man who held a \nposition of prestige and influence in a separate and coequal branch of \nour Government. The testimony was used in a court of law, and before \nthe U.S. Congress.\n  Senior officials in the FBI knew about this. Nothing was done to \ncorrect the record. And nothing was done to discipline the agent. Is \nthis because the culture in the FBI condones this? Is Dr. Whitehurst \ncorrect? Is Dr. Tobin correct, that forensic prostitution is condoned?\n  Last night, Director Freeh issued a statement saying that this was \nthe first time he was aware of the Tobin memo. I don't understand this, \nMr. President. The Justice Department's inspector general looked into \nthis matter. It is in the report that has been sitting on Mr. Freeh's \ndesk since January 20. How can he say that this is the first time he \nhas heard of this?\n  Instead, he has his deputy, Weldon Kennedy, out making misleading \nstatements to the public about how the IG didn't find any problems in \nthe lab. I detailed this in my statement yesterday. And now we hear the \nDirector telling us he was unaware of an issue that was on his desk for \nover a month.\n  There is another serious issue, Mr. President. There appears to be a \nmissing document. The Tobin memo was written after the fact of Agent \nMalone's allegedly false testimony. But the original report by Dr. \nTobin of the testing he did on the evidence has been missing. Director \nFreeh's statement last night alludes to that document and the fact that \nit was sent to the chief counsel of the 11th Circuit, which found Judge \nHastings unfit to serve.\n  However, there was not a copy of that report within FBI headquarters, \nwhere it should have been. The reason it should be there is in case the \ninspector general or others wanted to investigate what happened. The \nfact of Mr. Freeh document, and that the eleventh circuit has it, does \nnot answer the relevant question.\n  Also not mentioned in the Freeh statement are concerns about the \npublic's perception of all this. The public's confidence in Federal law \nenforcement is already on the wane. The FBI lab situation will only add \nto that. I sense that the FBI is still dancing around the truth and \nfull disclosure. Nothing short of the truth can and will be tolerated.\n  I have written today to the Justice inspector general requesting that \nhe investigate the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the \noriginal Tobin analysis. I have also written today to the Attorney \nGeneral asking that the IG take the lead on this investigation because \nof possible conflicts of interest for the FBI.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me reiterate a warning I made yesterday \nabout action against Dr. Whitehurst or any of the other scientists who \nmight come forward. This Congress will not tolerate action against Dr. \nWhitehurst, or any other individual who might come forward with the \ntruth. And that message goes for Justice Department officials, as well, \nwho have now removed authority from the FBI for any action taken \nagainst Dr. Whitehurst.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Tobin memo, plus attachments, and the two letters I sent today, to \nwhich I referred earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Memo To: Section Chief Ken Nimmich.\n       From: SA William A. Tobin.\n       Subject: Exceptions to Testimony of SA Michael P. Malone in \n     the Matter of U.S. District Judge Alcee S. Hastings.\n       Purpose: To advise of exceptions taken to testimony of SA \n     Malone in 11th Circuit judicial inquiry, Atlanta, Georgia.\n       Details: In preparation for anticipated congressional \n     testimony on August 3, 1989, SA Tobin reviewed the transcript \n     of the 11th Judicial Circuit testimony in Atlanta, Georgia, \n     of SA Malone. Because of the potential for serious conflict \n     and substantial embarrassment to the Bureau, an audience was \n     requested with you late in the day of August 3, 1989, wherein \n     you requested the specific details of may objections, my \n     exceptions to SA Malone's testimony, and technical analysis \n     as to the effect of the testimony.\n       Attached hereto are the requested exceptions and analysis, \n     as well as two photographs of test breaks.\n       Recommendations: None. For information only.\n\n\n exceptions to testimony of sa malone re u.s. district judge alcee l. \n                                hastings\n\n       1. p. 113, line 2: Metallurgical testing procedures \n     utilized were not ``winging it''. I did not have to ``design \n     a test''. The apparatus is, in fact, designed to test any \n     solid material (including hairs).\n       This statement, repeated in various forms several \n     additional times, undermines the legal value of the \n     metallurgical testing as not in compliance with the Frye and \n     ``generally accepted guidelines'' rules.\n       2. p. 116, line 23: False statement. SA Malone had no \n     participation in the tensile testing, and had only requested \n     to watch because he had ``. . . never seen such a test . . \n     .'' and wanted to see how they were conducted.\n       3. p. 117, line 11: False statement. Either the writing is \n     that of SA Tobin or the evidence has been altered subsequent \n     to the tensile testing. On every nonmetallic item in which I \n     have induced tensile failure on behalf of the FBI Laboratory, \n     I have placed evidence or plain white tape at the fracture in \n     order to identify Laboratory-induced failures, with Sharpie \n     Marking Pen writing ``test tear'' and an arrow pointing to \n     the failure. If my recollection serves me correctly, I \n     believe I noticed when I saw the purse some time later that \n     my own markings had been removed and those of SA Malone had \n     replaced them.\n       4. p. 117, lines 21-23: False statement. Photos were made \n     outside the presence of SA Malone by SA Tobin during the \n     course of metallurgical examinations.\n       5. p. 118, lines 17, 18: False statement. Neither the test \n     tears nor the photographs were made by SA Malone.\n       6. p. 120, line 22: Not true. I did not have to ``jury rig \n     it'' . . . I used standard test fixtures for this type \n     material and specimen. The equipment was designed for any \n     solid material of suitable configuration. The testing was in \n     conformance with the Frye and ``generally accepted \n     guidelines'' rules, contrary to the manner in which the \n     testimony is presented.\n       7. p. 123, line 23: False statement, particularly following \n     the specific words ``actually'' and ``yourself''.\n       8. p. 124, lines 3-5: Incorrect. In fact, designers and \n     users abhor sudden breaks because of the potential for \n     catastrophic loss of life. Designers, therefore, attempt to \n     insure gradual failures so that it is not instantaneous. The \n     terms ``gradual'' and ``slowly'' are deceptive and relate \n     only to the strain rate selected by SA Tobin for the testing: \n     almost any strain rate could have been selected for the test.\n       9. p. 124, lines 6, 7, and 15: The tears did not proceed \n     (propagate) on a ``. . . diagonal line across the entire \n     strap until finally the entire strap went.'' The effect of \n     this ``observation'' is to enhance differences between the \n     questioned tear and the test tears. In addition, \n     characterization of the test tears as ``diagonal across the \n     entire strap'' puts the failure mode in a different category \n     (when reviewed by a metallurgist or materials scientist), not \n     supported by either expectations or actual test behavior.\n       10. p. 124 line 24: Use of the term ``pressures'' is not \n     appropriate and is not interchangeable with ``force'' posing \n     a potential technical review problem. On a strap \n     approximately \\3/4\\\" wide and \\1/8\\\" thick, a force of 29 \n     lbs. results in approximately 309 lbs/in \\2\\ on the same \n     cross sectional area results in a force of 2.7 lbs exerted on \n     the strap, a significant difference on technical review.\n       11. p. 126, lines 1-3: same comments as #9 above.\n       12. p. 127, lines 13-15: same comments as #5 above.\n       13. p. 126, line 9:\n       14. p. 129, line 9: Direct contradiction to laboratory (AE) \n     findings supported by data. Presents apparently and \n     potentially exculpatory information as incriminating.\n       15. p. 129, line 11: Contrived/fabricated response and \n     false. Renders metallurgical test data very likely \n     inadmissible because such data can be deemed to fail the Frye \n     test and the ``generally accepted guidelines''.\n       16. p. 130, line 14, 15: Deceptive, if not outright false.\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\n       17. p. 130, line 24: Not true. The figure is not \n     meaningless with regard to the strap.\n       18. p. 131, line 14: Contradicts #17 above, and not \n     accurate. ``Pressures'' likely vary along the entire length \n     of strap.\n       19. p. 132, lines 2: Unfounded and in direct contradiction \n     to laboratory test data. In fact, test data indicates the \n     strap would not be capable of supporting or hanging 30 \n     pounds. Aggravates incriminating nature of evidence/data and \n     omits assumptions, premises or qualifying stipulations which \n     might be viewed as potentially exculpatory.\n       20. p. 133, line 15: Inaccurate and deceptive.\n       21. p. 133, line 19: Failure initiation and propagation \n     assessment is completely fabricated.\n       22. p. 134, lines 3-8.\n       23. p. 135, lines 6-10: Completely fabricated failure \n     propagation assessment.\n       24. p. 135, line 21: ditto.\n       25. p. 136, line 4: ??? as to where cut started. Unfounded \n     and not supported by data.\n       26. p. 143, line 17: Unfounded. There is not data or \n     indication that the cut was made by a person.\n       27. p. 144, line 24 and p. 145, lines 7, 8: Inaccurate \n     observations and contrary to expected and actual test data.\n       Again suppresses apparent exculpatory material behavior and \n     presents test specimens as incriminating data.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          Effect of Testimony\n\n       The misrepresentations and misstatements in the transcript \n     would, on review by metallurgical/materials personnel, \n     represent a glaring pattern of conversion of what should have \n     been presented as neutral data into incriminating \n     circumstances by complete reversal of established laboratory \n     test data with scientifically unfounded, unqualified and \n     biased testimony. [See exceptions # 8, 9, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, \n     21, 23, 24, 26, 27].\n       Additionally, the transcript reveals a pattern of complete \n     omission of crucial conditions, caveats, premises and/or \n     assumptions which may be viewed as tending toward exculpatory \n     in nature. Even Mr. Doar had to intercede to bring the \n     testimony back to reality (see p. 146, line 14).\n       As an example, existing laboratory reports indicate that \n     the strap failed consistently at approximately 29.2 lbs. and \n     that a weight up to that of an individual can be exerted on \n     the strap by anyone attempting to break the strap. After \n     applying what is one of the weakest motions for exerting \n     force by an individual (pulling an object with both hands \n     exerting forces in opposite directions), he testified that, \n     as a 200 lb. ``weightlifter'', he could not break the strap. \n     [It does not require an expert to visualize how an individual \n     might apply loads greater than what SA Malone exerted]. The \n     strong inference is that it is impossible to accidentally or \n     intentionally exert a breaking load on the straps and, \n     therefore, the strap must be cut to successfully break it. \n     Another example [exception # 26] is the statement that a \n     person made the cut.\n       The opinions expressed in the transcript can not be viewed \n     as constituting professional differences. The witness has no \n     apparent academic or empirical training to provide such \n     testimony. Even had the witness undertaken the minimal \n     studies for such testimony, to include Introduction to \n     Materials, Strength of Materials, Engineering Materials, \n     Behavior of Matter, Properties of Materials, Materials and \n     Advanced Materials Laboratories, Mechanical Testing & \n     Laboratory, and Failure Analysis courses or their equivalents \n     (26 credit hours of study), he has not conducted any such \n     testing, utilized the test apparatus, or even observed its \n     use in the prior 15 years or more.\n       The testimony, almost in complete entirety, relates to \n     materials strain or deformation, stress applications, tensile \n     test procedures, tensile data, and failure (propagation) \n     assessment. It was very apparent even before SA Malone \n     testified in Atlanta, Ga., that the metallurgical \n     examinations and test results would be of importance to the \n     inquiry, but I was told that I was not needed. From the early \n     stages of judicial proceedings I was queried a number of \n     times for information as to these topics with an explanation \n     of ``personal curiosity''. However, both the number of \n     queries and complexity (specificity) indicated more than a \n     casual interest. I cautioned SA Malone about attempting to \n     present the metallurgical data without some of the crucial \n     caveats, premises or assumptions which must be made, such as \n     system constraints (eg., wearer's hand grasping the strap), \n     lack of complete specimen adjustment to applied forces \n     (varies with the manner in which individual is carrying \n     purse), initial condition statements, strain rate \n     considerations, and manner of stress application. All of \n     these cautions have been ignored and omitted in the \n     testimony, and all of them can be viewed as exculpatory in \n     nature.\n       Contributing to the perception of complete exculpatory \n     information suppression, review of the transcript reveals no \n     indication that the Chief Judge or the 11th Circuit panel was \n     in receipt of FBI Laboratory report 51025051 S RU; in fact, \n     it suggests the contrary.\n       Further, the metallurgical test data may well be rendered \n     inadmissible because the witness states that I was ``. . . \n     winging it'', that I had to ``jury rig'' and ``fiddle'' with \n     the test apparatus, and that ``. . . nobody in our . . . lab \n     had ever done a test like this, and I have never heard of any \n     studies being published, it's almost a meaningless figure . . \n     .''. Testifying as, what the court thought was, an expert in \n     that area, this is a fairly strong indictment of the testing. \n     These statements beg for a ruling of inadmissability in view \n     of the Frye and ``generally accepted guidelines'' standards.\n       These exceptions were originally discussed with Section \n     Chief Ken Nimmich because of a potential for serious and \n     embarrassing conflict in congressional testimony tentatively \n     scheduled for August 3, 1989. Not unexpectedly, our testimony \n     was not needed in the congressional proceedings. However, \n     this is being made a matter of record to indicate that the \n     testimony is not reflective of the metallurgical testing, \n     test data and guidance provided.\n       Overall, the exceptions to the testimony of SA Malone do \n     not affect the technical assessment that the purse strap has \n     been cut.\n                                  ____\n\n  \n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 1997.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I want to briefly address an item that was \nin the news this morning titled ``New Study Faults Pentagon's Gay \nPolicy.'' This morning the New York Times reported that with great \nalarm. It seemed that 850 men and women were discharged last year from \nthe military for being homosexuals. They talk about an alarming \nincrease in the number of people discharged under this policy that the \nCongress enacted just a couple of years ago.\n  First of all, we should put this in perspective. The 850 discharged \namounts to six one-hundredths of 1 percent of active duty military \npersonnel, and I do not think anybody on that basis can claim there is \nsome kind of vendetta or witch hunt or anything else going on. It is \nreally important for us to stand back and review where we are today \nfollowing the debate that we had on gays in the military in 1994.\n  First, it is important to understand that the U.S. military maintains \na\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\ncommitment, a consistent commitment to the principle that homosexuality \nis incompatible with military service. This conviction has been one \nthat was more thoroughly investigated and examined than perhaps any \nother policy, at least controversial policy, that this Senate body has \nexamined in my memory and in many people's memories. We held exhaustive \nhearings. We held field hearings. We brought in experts from every \nperspective from the left, the right, and everywhere in between. \nRegardless of what their philosophical position was, we gave people the \nopportunity to express their opinion on this issue.\n  The evidence and the findings of fact that are laid out in the law \nitself that this Congress passed by a very substantial margin and which \nwas signed by the President clearly demonstrated a factual basis and a \nrational basis for the policy that was adopted. The conviction is \njustified and, I think, clearly won the support of an overwhelming \nmajority of both the House and the Senate and reaffirmed and signed \ninto law and now has been reaffirmed into law.\n  Now, I know there are some who still disagree with the conclusion \nthat the Senate arrived at and that the Congress arrived at, but they \npresented their argument in a national debate. That argument did not \nprevail and did not come close to prevailing. They lost that argument \nbecause we were able to demonstrate, on a bipartisan basis, led by \nSenator Nunn and was something I participated in and many others, that \nclear, open homosexuality undermines unit cohesion and military \neffectiveness. It creates an unavoidable sexual tension, often in close \nquarters, which compromises the central purpose of the military, and \nthat is to be effectively prepared to be able to fight and win wars if \nnecessary or if called on.\n  Second, the U.S. military defines homosexuality as it has always \ndefined homosexuality. First, making a statement that you are a \nhomosexual is a presumption, is a clear indication, that you have \nadopted a homosexual lifestyle and is grounds for discharge. Second, \nengaging in a homosexual act is prima facie evidence of the case that \nyou are a homosexual as defined in the law. Third, entering into a \nhomosexual marriage. Those are the criteria.\n  In the public debate, people have tried to call this policy many \ndifferent things, but in fact it is the policy the military held even \nbefore we passed the so-called don't ask, don't tell policy in 1994, \nand it is the policy we enforce today. So when military commanders \nimplement this policy, they are not violating the rules. They are \nsimply enforcing the law as we in the Congress wrote the law, supported \nthe law, voted for the law, on a bipartisan basis, and as that law was \naccepted and signed into law by the President, the current President, \nof the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1653-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1654-S1655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will comment on another article in the \nNew York Times which is titled, ``An Abortion Rights Advocate Says He \nLied About Procedure'' of partial-birth abortions.\n  Many here remember the very heated and controversial and difficult \nand emotional debate that we had on this floor in attempting to \noverride the President's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill \npassed, again on a bipartisan basis, in both the Senate and the House \nbut vetoed by the President on the grounds that this was a rare \nprocedure, it rarely happened, and, therefore, we should not make a \npolicy which would deny on those few rare occasions, as the President \ndescribed them, the opportunity to women to avail themselves of a \npartial-birth abortion.\n  A Planned Parenthood news release of November 1, 1995, which was \ncited by many on this floor as the basis for the fact that this is \nrare, said, ``The procedure is extremely rare and done only in cases \nwhen the woman's life is in danger or in cases of extreme fetal \nabnormality.'' The President cited that and quoted medical experts that \nsaid that this was a rare procedure and used that as the basis for his \nveto of the bill, which prevented us from passing a ban against \npartial-birth abortions.\n\n  Now, today, the New York Times comes out with an article indicating \nthat one of the doctors that was so frequently quoted, and the fact \nthat it was so frequently used by opponents on this floor to argue \nagainst the ban on partial-birth abortions, that doctor has stated that \nhe lied when he said this was a rare procedure.\n  Reading the article:\n\n       A prominent member of the abortion rights movement said \n     today that he lied in earlier statements when he said a \n     controversial form of late-term abortion is rare and \n     performed primarily to save the lives or fertility of women \n     bearing severely malformed babies.\n       He now says the procedure is performed far more often than \n     his colleagues have acknowledged, and on healthy women \n     bearing healthy fetuses.\n       Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National \n     Coalition of Abortion Providers, said he intentionally misled \n     in previous remarks about the procedure.\n       But he is now convinced, he said, that the issue of whether \n     the issue remains legal, like the overall debate about \n     abortion, must be based on the truth.\n       Mr. Fitzsimmons recalled the night in November 1995, when \n     he appeared on ``Nightline'' on ABC and ``lied through my \n     teeth'' when he said the procedure was used rarely and only \n     on women whose lives were in danger or those fetuses were \n     damaged.\n       ``It made me physically ill,'' Mr. Fitzsimmons said in an \n     interview, ``I told my wife the next day, `I can't do this \n     again.' ''\n       As much as he disagreed with the National Right to Life \n     Committee and others who oppose abortion under any \n     circumstances, he said he knew they were accurate when they \n     said the procedure was common.\n\n  As I said, last April, President Clinton vetoed a bill that would \nhave outlawed this procedure, and in explaining that veto, as the New \nYork Times quotes, ``Mr. Clinton echoed the argument of Mr. Fitzsimmons \nand his colleagues.'' And I quote from the President:\n\n       ``There are a few hundred women every year who have \n     personally agonizing situations where their children are born \n     to or are about to be born with terrible deformities, which \n     will cause them to die either just before, during or just \n     after childbirth,'' the President said. ``And these women, \n     among other things, cannot preserve the ability to have \n     further children unless the enormity--the enormous size of \n     the baby's head--is reduced before being extracted from their \n     bodies.''\n\n  Meaning a tube is stuck into the baby's head, the skull, the brains \nare sucked out, and the skull is collapsed. That is the procedure we \nare talking about here. He is reduced before being extracted from their \nbodies.\n\n       A spokeswoman for Mr. Clinton, said tonight that the White \n     House knew nothing of Mr. Fitzsimmons' announcement and would \n     not comment further.\n\n  I bring this to light, Mr. President, and I am putting it in the \nRecord because I hope that the President would have the opportunity to \nnow gain this information that was erroneous.\n  Mr. Fitzsimmons has admitted now on record that he ``lied through his \nteeth,'' was deliberately deceptive. That was the justification on \nwhich the President formed his opinion and decision. I hope we can now \nuse this opportunity to clarify the record, and that the President can \nrevisit his decision, on the basis of this new information that this is \na common procedure and not a rare procedure. The President could--and \nhopefully the Congress will be addressing this at some point--when \npresented again with an opportunity to provide a ban against a \nprocedure that is inhuman, and many believe is infanticide, a grisly \nprocedure that is even difficult to describe anywhere in public, and \nparticularly on the floor of the Senate. I hope the President, now \narmed with this new information, will be able to reexamine his position \non the issue, and when and if a bill is presented to him that bans \npartial-birth abortion, would, on the basis of this new information, \nand the justification he used to veto the previous bill, reverse his \nposition and support our efforts to bring some level of decency and \nhumanity into this abortion procedure.\n  We are not discussing here the issues that have so consumed us on the \nabortion question in the past. We are talking about a situation that \nmost find abhorrent, and which is something I don't believe this Nation \ncan have a policy advocating. So with this new information, we are \nproviding an opportunity for people to revisit their decisions and \ntheir conclusions because, clearly, that was the justification and \nbasis for the opposition to the ban on partial-birth abortion, and \nclearly now we have evidence refuting that opposition and, hopefully, \nthat will provide\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\nthe basis for us to go forward and correct what I believe was a serious \nmistake we made in the last Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1654-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WORKING TOGETHER ON THE ABORTION ISSUE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just heard my colleague talk about \ninformation that he feels would lead people to change their view on the \ntragic issue of late-term abortion. I want to make a clear point that I \nmade today to the press when they asked me about this. I think it is \ndeplorable that anyone on any side of this issue would knowingly \nmisstate the truth, on any side. There is no excuse for that. We can't \nresolve problems in this Nation if people don't tell the truth.\n  The issue here is--and I think it is very important to state it--that \nunder Roe versus Wade, which is the law of the land and has been upheld \nby the Supreme Court several times, a woman has a right to choose, \nwithout Government interference, in the early stages of her pregnancy. \nNow, that is a matter of debate. Some colleagues here think that is a \nvery bad decision by the Court. Some colleagues here would like to \noutlaw abortion at any stage. But what Roe versus Wade said is \npostviability. Once the fetus is viable, the Government can come in and \nregulate abortion. I agree with that.\n  What Roe versus Wade says is that the Government can regulate \nabortion at the postviability stage very clearly, as long as the life \nof the woman is protected and her health is protected.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think we owe it to the women of this Nation to \nensure that they do not die, and if they have a very complicated \npregnancy, where if they were to carry the child to term, they would \nlose their life or endure severe adverse health consequences where \nperhaps they could be paralyzed for life or become infertile--we had \nwomen, several of whom were religious Catholics and consider themselves \npro-life, that had to go through and endure this procedure because they \nwere told either their life was at stake or they could never carry \nanother child.\n  So the issue isn't about how many times this procedure is used. My \nview is that even if it is used once incorrectly, it is wrong. I think \nwhat we ought to do is say that we should never allow an abortion in \nthe late term, postviability, unless it is necessary to protect the \nlife of the woman or her health. And I think that what we ought to \nstart doing in this U.S. Senate is to start to come together on a \ncouple of things. I don't think we are ever going to agree on the basis \nof Roe versus Wade. I think my friend from Indiana believes that \nabortion is wrong, and he is willing to outlaw it. I support Roe versus \nWade. We have a fair disagreement. So we can't come together on that.\n  I think we can come together on two issues surrounding this difficult \nissue. First, family planning. We ought to all support family planning, \nso that every child is a wanted child and so that the number of \nabortions would drop dramatically. I was so pleased to see colleagues \non the Republican side of the aisle join with colleagues on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle and make a profamily planning statement. \nWe ought to come together on that, and we ought to come together on the \nissue of late-term abortion. We ought to say it should not be allowed, \nunless it is necessary to save the life of a mother or spare her \nirreparable harm.\n  I really think we have an opportunity now, because this issue has \nbeen brought up again, to walk down the aisle together on those two \npoints--family planning and on the late-term abortion issue. Consistent \nwith Roe versus Wade, we can do that.\n  So, Mr. President, I know we will be revisiting this issue. I will, \nonce again, bring to the floor the stories of the women who had to have \nthese procedures, postviability, because their life was in danger or \nthey might have been infertile. I will continue to put the woman's face \non the issue. I hope we can reach agreement, in a bipartisan way, on \nthis matter and move forward so that, in essence, we can reduce the \nnumber of abortions in this country and that every child can be a \nhealthy and a wanted child. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom California for her remarks. I find myself in complete agreement \nwith what she has just said. I hope that this year, as opposed to last \nyear, we can find a solution, that we can resolve the differences that \nmay not be insurmountable in coming to grips with both of the issues--\nfamily planning and late-term abortion.\n  If we can find the language that says that, with respect to all \nprocedures, postviability abortions ought to be outlawed, except in \nthose rare, rare circumstances involving the life and emergency health \nsituations so that we would protect the woman from irreparable harm or \nenable her to have another child at a later date, is something that I \nhope we can all support and come together to resolve. So, again, I \nthank her for her comments, and I would like to work very much with the \nSenator from Indiana, who has spent a lot of time on this issue to \nresolve this matter in a successful way sometime this session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1655-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1655-S1656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SENATOR GLENN'S RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last Thursday our colleague, Senator John \nGlenn, announced he will be retiring from the Senate at the end of his \ncurrent term in 1998. While I am saddened by his decision, I certainly \nunderstand it, and I want to take a few moments to pay tribute to a man \nwho has given a lifetime of service to his country.\n  Soldier, astronaut, hero, businessman, statesman, nuts-and-bolts \nreformer. All of these words accurately describe the long, \ndistinguished career of John Glenn. Courage, tenacity, modesty, \nauthenticity, the ``Right Stuff.'' These words describe the character \nof John Glenn, the ingredients that have made this great career so \nmemorable.\n  When he retires on the cusp of the 21st century, John Glenn will \nlikely be remembered as one of the great American heroes of the 20th \ncentury, both for his heroism in battle and for conquering the peaceful \nbut uncharted frontiers of space. But he should also be remembered as a \nSenator who helped prepare his government to enter the 21st century as \na modern, efficient force for good in people's lives.\n  John Glenn first answered his country's call when he joined the Naval \nAviation Cadet Program shortly after Pearl Harbor. He was commissioned \nin the Marines in 1943. First Lieutenant Glenn flew nearly 60 combat \nmissions in the Pacific theater. His great courage and skill earned him \n2 Distinguished Flying Crosses and 10 Air Medals.\n  After the war, John Glenn remained in the Marines, was promoted to \nthe rank of major, then distinguished himself once again in the Korean \nconflict. He flew 90 combat missions in just 8 months, won 2 more \nDistinguished Flying Crosses, 8 more Air Medals, and numerous accolades \nfrom his fellow Marines, including the titles Mig-mad Marine.''\n  John Glenn could have retired from the military after Korea and \nentered civilian life a decorated hero. He chose instead to stay in the \nservice and take on more challenges, including new frontiers that, at \nthat time, existed only in the imaginations of most men.\n  As a military test pilot in 1957, John Glenn established a new flight \nspeed record, earning credit for the first-ever transcontinental \nsupersonic flight. This record flight also earned him his fifth \nDistinguished Flying Cross and caught the eye of NASA's Project Mercury \nprogram, dedicated to launch the first human into space. As a Mercury \nastronaut, John Glenn put in many months of intense training, and in \n1961 he was chosen to make America's first attempt to orbit the Earth.\n  Numerous technical and weather problems delayed his attempt for 2 \nmonths. One can only imagine the pressure of an on-again, off-again \nwait for a risky, dangerous feat that no man had ever accomplished. But \nJohn Glenn's moment finally came when an Atlas-D rocket launched his \ntiny capsule, Friendship 7, into Earth's orbit on February 20, 1962.\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\n  After the first of three planned orbits at up to 162 miles away from \nEarth, he lost the use of the automatic control mechanism that \nstabilized his craft. He then had to complete the final two orbits of \nthe 81,000-mile flight under manual control, an incredibly dangerous \nchallenge. In an interview some years later, John Glenn said of this \nmoment: ``I was fully aware of the danger. And certainly there was \napprehension. No matter what preparation you make, there comes the \nmoment of truth. You're playing with big stakes--your life. But the \nimportant thing to me wasn't fear, but what you can do to control it.''\n  John Glenn left the Marine Corps in 1965 after 23 years of remarkable \nservice. These two heroic decades are emblazoned on the American \nconscience. They are the material of which books are written and movies \nmade.\n  But John Glenn's Senate career of more than two decades will be the \nmaterial serious students of government, cost-conscious taxpayers, and \nanyone concerned with the spread of dangerous nuclear weapons will \nremember. It is a career full of quiet, serious dedication to serve the \npeople of Ohio, to make our Government work better, and to make our \nworld safe from the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  We will remember John Glenn's Senate career for many things. Among \nhis accomplishments, Senator Glenn used his Governmental Affairs \nCommittee post to root out Government waste, modernize Government, and \nsave taxpayer dollars. Senator Glenn shepherded the Clinton \nadministration's reinventing Government'' initiatives through the \nSenate. His efforts helped streamline Federal purchasing procedures and \ntrim the federal workforce by 250,000 employees to the lowest level \nsince John Kennedy was President.\n  He fought to create Chief Financial Officers for most major federal \nagencies, making those agencies more accountable and efficient. He \nhelped to install independent inspectors general in nearly 40 \nGovernment agencies and offices to ferret out wasteful spending, saving \ntaxpayers hundreds of millions per year.\n  In the last few years, Senator Glenn extended his hand across the \naisle to help pass legislation that brought Congress into compliance \nwith Federal workplace laws. He fought for the bill that made it harder \nfor Congress to pass on unfunded mandates to the States and localities. \nAnd he worked to pass legislation aimed at reducing the Government's \npaperwork volume.\n  Senator Glenn has never disparaged Government service nor bashed \nGovernment workers. He knows and recognizes the honor of public \nservice. But he also knows that waste and lack of accountability \nundermine public confidence in Government, and he has dedicated a \nSenate career to combatting them.\n  Senator Glenn also made a career of fighting for a strong defense \nthat balances the demands of national security and common sense. He \nauthored the 1978 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act, the only law on the \nbooks to control and stop the spread of nuclear weapons around the \nworld.\n  A tenacious advocate for veterans, he led the effort to elevate the \nVeterans Administration to cabinet-level status and helped pass a \npackage of benefits for troops serving in the Persian Gulf war. At the \nsame time, Senator Glenn fought against weapons systems he considered \nwasteful, like the B-2, the MX missile, and the Star Wars program. He \nbrought rare experience as a veteran and military hero to these \nefforts. He was rarely wrong, and he rarely lost a legislative battle.\n  Mr. President, the Senate community can be a contentious place. But \nbecause of people like John Glenn and his wife, Annie, it can also be a \nfriendly, decent, and inspiring place, where someone can serve with a \nreal American hero who is also a true gentleman. Our Senate family, \nlike the people of Ohio, will miss Senator Glenn when he retires in \n1999. For your lifetime of service, we are deeply indebted, and we \nthank you, Senator, gentleman, and American hero, John Glenn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is honored to recognize the Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I just wanted to thank my good friend for \nthose overly generous and very kind remarks.\n  It was not without a lot of feeling and emotion that I made the \ndecision not to run again in 1998. But, as I said, we have never \ninvented a cure for the common birthday. And at the end of my next term \nI would be 83, if I assumed that I won. It was for that reason and that \nreason only that I chose not to run.\n  My good friend, the minority leader, is absolutely right. I think one \nof the biggest things we have to face is some of the disparaging \nremarks about Government when some people talk down Government. And we \nare going to be working on those things over the next 2 years.\n  I happened to be in the cloakroom. I had been in another meeting, and \njust happened to come out here on the floor. I had not realized that \nthis was going to be a time when the minority leader was going to be \nmaking the remarks. And I just wanted to say how much I appreciate it.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1655-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1656-S1657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I didn't have the opportunity to respond to \nthe Senator from California when she stated her willingness to \nreexamine the issue of partial-birth abortion. The minority leader was \non the floor waiting to speak, and had reserved time for that.\n  However, I would like to just say that, No. 1, I am pleased that they \nare willing to revisit the issue. It is an issue that I think deserve \nrevisiting.\n  I want to correct some information that might be misconstrued, as \nreferenced by the Senator from California--the fact that, if we could \njust make sure that we provided an exception for women whose lives were \nin danger, were the procedure not proposed. As I think the Senator \nremembers, that was clearly addressed in the bill that was before the \nSenate last Congress--that exception for life of the mother was clearly \nstated in that language. Now this whole addition of the well health of \nthe mother--first of all, as the Senator from Pennsylvania [Senator \nSantorum] so eloquently described, there were no instances, there were \nno partial-birth abortions performed to protect the health of the \nmother. There was a lot of erroneous misinformation discussed about \nthat. And this has always been the reason why opponents--of whatever \nattempts are made to address the question of abortion from the pro-life \nside--it is always, ``If we could just add the exception for health of \nthe mother.''\n  As we have learned over the years and as has been demonstrated in \nnumerous court holdings and other information that is presented to us, \nhealth of the mother is so broadly defined. Are we talking about \npsychological health of the mother, emotional health of the mother? It \nhas really just been used as an excuse to provide abortionists, doctors \nwho perform abortions, a basis for simply saying we will use this \nexception to allow the abortion to go forward.\n  I really think what we are dealing with here is a procedure that goes \nbeyond the pale. It really, as many have said in the debate, is not an \nabortion issue. It is not a pro-choice abortion issue. This is the \nissue of a deliberate taking of life, of a fetus, of a baby that is \nwell beyond the age of viability, however that is defined. My own \npersonal belief is that life begins at conception.\n  Even if you do not agree with my personal belief on this, there is no \nquestion that at the 5th, 6th and 7th month, the times when partial-\nbirth abortions are performed, because the head of the child is so \nlarge it cannot be extracted through the birth canal and therefore has \nto be collapsed by the doctor after the baby is killed, there is no \nquestion that the partial-birth abortion issue is one that is not in \nthe purview of what we generally have been talking about on the pro-\nlife pro-choice issues. It is clearly a situation where we have a baby \nwho, if born at that moment, would be able to sustain life. Someone \nsaid 3 inches and 3 seconds from being declared murder.\n  I remember the situation when the young couple in New Jersey, I think \nit was, was arrested for the killing of\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\ntheir recently born baby. How ironic it is that had they gone to an \nabortionist and had a partial-birth abortion 1 minute before the baby \nwas born and then they killed the baby, it would have been a perfectly \naccepted procedure without any criminal penalty, without any penalty \nwhatsoever. And so we are talking about a human life that is capable of \nbeing sustained on its own that is deliberately ended, terminated, by \nan abortion doctor to provide for a more convenient abortion.\n  That is what is at stake here. That is what the debate is going to \nhave to be about if we bring it back up. I am pleased that the minority \nleader and the Senator from California, who was the primary opponent of \nour efforts to override the President's veto, I am pleased they want to \nrevisit the issue, but let us revisit it on the right terms and let us \nknow what we are talking about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1656-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE FAIR COMPETITION IN FEDERAL PROCUREMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a matter of importance to my \nState. Senator Kerry and I are offering legislation to prevent a \nserious injustice in the Federal Government. Congressman John Olver is \nintroducing identical legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  This issue has come to our attention in the context of the Bureau of \nEngraving and Printing contract for U.S. currency paper production, but \nit could arise in other contexts that would pose similar inequities.\n  A respected and longstanding family-owned business in Dalton, MA, \nCrane and Company, has supplied currency paper for the Treasury for the \npast 117 years. Crane has been a trusted supplier to the Federal \nGovernment, providing high-quality products on a timely basis. It has \nnegotiated reasonable terms with the Government, keeping its price \nincreases below the rate of inflation, and has made substantial \ninvestments over the years to ensure the sophisticated equipment needed \nto produce the currency, including the special security features now \nbuilt into the paper itself.\n  This year, however, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has proposed \nto go to extraordinary lengths to create alternative sources for the \ncurrency paper production. The Bureau has proposed subsidies to other \ncompanies to help them become competitive and buy the state-of-the-art \nequipment that Crane bought on its own.\n  This is not fair competition. It is a misguided policy that will give \nother companies an unfair advantage and create an unlevel playing \nfield.\n  Our legislation is straightforward. It amends section 303 of the \nFederal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to prohibit \nnondefense agencies in the executive branch from financing equipment or \nfacilities to help a contractor compete against an existing contractor \nin Federal procurement.\n  With all the pressures of the deficit, we should not be spending \ntaxpayers' money on this sort of sham competition. It is unfair to \nleading-edge firms like Crane that invested their own resources to \nobtain Government contracts. It is hard to see how any taxpayers will \nbenefit. Crane is in a class by itself. There is no suggestion of \nantitrust problems. Crane wins these contracts fair and square against \npotential competitors, and it should not have to compete with Uncle \nSam.\n  I urge the Congress to enact this legislation and prevent an \nextremely unfair and unwise policy from moving forward at the Treasury \nDepartment or at other Federal agencies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 354\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN CONTRACT PROVISION FOR \n                   PURPOSE OF INCREASING COMPETITION BY \n                   ESTABLISHING ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF SUPPLY.\n\n       Section 303 of the Federal Property and Administrative \n     Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(j) In conducting a procurement of property or services \n     covered by this section, an executive agency may not award a \n     contract that contains a provision allowing for the \n     contractor to acquire, at Government expense, production, \n     construction, or technical equipment or facilities to carry \n     out the contract, if the principal purpose of such provision \n     is to increase competition by establishing an alternative \n     source of supply for that property or service.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1657-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WANNAMAKER AWARDED ORDER OF THE PALMETTO\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, sometimes we forget that it is the \ncitizens of this Nation that serve as its bedrock, men and women who \nlive in our communities and who are committed to making a difference. \nToday, I would like to share with you examples of two such people, \nBetty and the late Charles Wannamaker, who were recently honored by the \nGovernor of South Carolina for their civic activities.\n  There is no higher award that can be given a South Carolinian than \nthe Order of the Palmetto, and late last month, Gov. David Beasley \npresented two of these awards to this married couple who have done much \nto make the Charleston area of my State a place anyone would be proud \nto call home. Unfortunately, Dr. Wannamaker's award was presented \nposthumously, but given the active role he took in local affairs, he \nwas certainly worthy of this high tribute. An elected official in \nCharleston County for 32 years, Charles Wannamaker was the kind of man \nwho epitomized the term ``civic-minded.''\n  His wife, Betty, was equally committed to making a difference in her \ncommunity, and for two decades she served on the Charleston County Park \nand Recreation Commission. During her tenure, parks and open space in \nthis Lowcountry county grew significantly, and countless families and \nvisitors to the Charleston area have benefited from the many new and \nexcellent parks that the commission approved and saw created. In a \nseparate, but equally fitting tribute, I understand that a new park \nbeing built in north Charleston is going to be named in honor of the \nWannamakers, a recognition of which they are deserving and one which is \ntruly fitting.\n  Mr. President, the Wannamakers made an excellent team, and through \ntheir concerted efforts and service, they made many valuable \ncontributions to the Trident area and to the State of South Carolina. \nIt is my hope that other citizens of the Palmetto State will be \ninspired by the standard for community involvement these two people \nset. We would all benefit if there were more people as committed to \nmaking a difference as the Wannamakers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1657-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1657-S1658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WILLIAM F. ``BUDDY'' PRIOLEAU\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, for more than 150 years, the Citadel has \nbeen one of the most historic colleges in the State of South Carolina, \nand an institution that has produced not only a number of leading \ncitizens, but interesting individuals as well. There is no question \nthat the vast majority of Citadel alumni are passionately loyal to \ntheir alma mater, but every once in awhile, a particularly dynamic \npersonality will emerge as a booster of the college. William F. \n``Buddy'' Prioleau, Sr., was one such person, a man who was successful \nin life, possessed a distinctive personality, and an enthusiastic \nsupporter of the Citadel. Sadly, he passed away late last month.\n  Known throughout South Carolina as Mr. Citadel, Buddy was a regular \nfixture at many of the athletic events, parades, and formal and \ninformal functions associated with that college and the Bulldogs. His \nunflagging devotion to the school earned him a long tenure on the \nCitadel's board of visitors, including a term as its chairman, which \nbegan in 1969 and only ended in 1994 when he did not submit his name \nfor reelection. In recognition of his long and almost unparalleled \nservice, he was awarded the distinguished title of board member \nemeritus. Indeed, it is difficult to immediately think of a man more \nassociated with the Citadel than Buddy was.\n  Entering the Citadel in 1939, it was a long road to the ring for \nyoung Cadet Prioleau, whose studies were interrupted by World War II. \nBefore enlisting in the Army in 1942, Buddy was already demonstrating a \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\namount of school spirit by managing the football team, being a member \nof the Block C Club, and serving as the president of the Bucanneer \nClub. Putting his education on hold, Buddy Prioleau traded the gray \nuniform of a Citadel cadet for that of a soldier and he found himself \nserving in the bloody Pacific theater with the 41st Division.\n  At the end of hostilities, Buddy was able to return to the infamous \nwhite barracks of the Citadel and complete his undergraduate education. \nAs was so typical of the veterans of World War II, Buddy recognized the \nimportance of an education, and with his bachelor's degree in hand, he \nmoved from Charleston to Columbia, where he enrolled in the school of \nlaw at the University of South Carolina, and from which he graduated in \n1949.\n  For almost the next 50 years, Buddy practiced law and enjoyed great \nsuccess in the legal profession. He served as legal counsel to \nGovernors Byrnes and Timmerman, as well as myself, when I held the \noffice of Governor of South Carolina. Additionally, he served as an \nacting judge of the Richland County Family Court, was a partner in the \nfirm of Prioleau & Walker, and was very active in the South Carolina \nand American Bar Associations.\n  All the years that he was working as an attorney, building a career, \nraising a family, rising to the rank of colonel in the National Guard, \nand becoming the owner of an inn on Pawley's Island, Buddy Prioleau \nstill made abundant time for one of his true loves, his alma mater. \nThere is not a graduate of the Military College of South Carolina who \ndid not know of Buddy or had some humorous anecdote about him. Without \nquestion, he was much beloved by the entire Citadel family, and they \npaid tribute to him in a number of ways over the years. In 1981, the \nCitadel yearbook, the Sphinx, was dedicated in his honor, and last year \nhe was awarded an honorary doctor of laws and his portrait was hung in \nDaniel Library. Two very high honors that are accorded to only a select \nfew individuals.\n  Mr. President, I know that I speak for all of Buddy Prioleau's \nfriends when I say that not only has the Citadel lost one of its most \ndistinguished graduates, but that our State has lost a civic-minded and \npublic-spirited man. My sympathies go out to Buddy's children, William, \nMary, Roberta, and Elizabeth, as well as his five grandchildren. He \nwill be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1657-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I introduce, along with my distinguished \ncolleague Senator Bob Graham, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act \nof 1997. This legislation will serve as the counterpart to similar \nlegislation that will be introduced in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Porter Goss.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this legislation is to offer some \nmeasure of relief to families that have suffered serious medical and \nfinancial setbacks because of their reliance on the Federal \nGovernment's protection of the blood supply.\n  In 1995, the Institute of Medicine released the findings of a major \ninvestigation into how America's hemophilia community came to be \ndecimated by the HIV virus.\n  According to that report, the Federal agencies responsible for blood \nsafety did not show the appropriate level of diligence in screening the \nblood supply.\n  The Federal agencies did not move as quickly as they should have to \napprove blood products that were potentially safer.\n  And the Federal Government did not warn the hemophilia community, \nwhen the Government knew--or should have known--that there were \nlegitimate concerns that the blood supply might not be safe.\n  The Government's failure caused serious harm to real people--people \nwho were counting on the Government to meet its responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is about trust. A substantial number \nof citizens trusted the Government to exercise due vigilance, and the \nGovernment let them down. It's only right that the Government try to \noffer them some measure of relief.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the budgetary realities we have to \nconfront. As we move through the process, we will have to address the \nissue of compensation. I think it's absolutely essential that we begin \nthis process--now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\n  S. 360. A bill to require adoption of a management plan for the Hells \nCanyon National Recreation Area that allows appropriate use of \nmotorized and nonmotorized river craft in the recreation area, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           HELL'S CANYON NATIONAL RECREATION AREA AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Public Law 94-199, designating the Hells \nCanyon National Recreation Area, was signed into law December 31, 1975.\n  Section 10 of the act recognizes that the use of both motorized and \nnonmotorized river craft are valid activities on the Snake River within \nthe recreation area.\n  The language seems clear. However, assurances by the Congress and the \nForest Service 22 years ago that the long-established and traditional \nuse of motorized river craft would be continued are now being callously \ndisregarded by the agency.\n  The most recent indication of this attitude has arisen during a \nreview and revision of the river management plan for the NRA. Despite \nthe lack of any demonstrable resource problems, and in the face of \noverwhelming public support for motorized river craft, the agency has \nagain decided to close part of the river to powerboats. The new river \nmanagement plan would close the heart of the canyon to motorized river \ncraft for 21 days during the peak of the recreation season. Such a \nclosure would also prohibit traditional motor use of the wild river \nsegment to reach privately-owned lands within the scenic river segment \nof the NRA.\n  The revised management plan is still in dispute as the result of \nappeals filed by commercial motorized river users. The vast majority of \npeople, over 80 percent, who recreate in the Hells Canyon segment of \nthe Snake River do so by motorized river craft. Some are private \nboaters, but most travel with commercial guides on scenic tours. This \npopular form of recreation is accomplished with a minimum of impact to \nthe river, the land or other resources.\n  Most river users, motorized and non-motorized, are willing to share \nthe river. However, a small group of non-motorized users objects to \nseeing powered craft even though they have a rich choice of \nnonmotorized alternatives in this geographic area, such as the Selway \nand Middle Fork of the Salmon Rivers. Motorized users, however, don't \nhave that luxury. The only other white water rivers open to them in the \nentire Wild and Scenic River System are portions of the Rogue and \nSalmon Rivers. Without a single doubt, the Hells Canyon portion of the \nSnake River is our Nation's premier whitewater power boating river.\n  Mr. President, the Snake River is different from most rivers in the \nWild and Scenic System. It is a high-volume river with a long and \ncolorful history of use by motorized river craft. The first paying \npassengers to traverse its rapids on a motor boat made their journey on \nthe 110-foot Colonel Wright in 1865. Later, the 136-foot Shoshone made \nits plunge through the canyon from Boise to Lewiston in 1870 and was \nfollowed by the 165-foot Norma in 1895. Gasoline-powered craft began \nhauling people, produce, and supplies in and out of the canyon in 1910, \nand the first contract for regular mail delivery was signed in 1919, \ncontinuing today. The Corps of Engineers began blasting rocks and \nimproving channels in 1903. They worked continuously until 1975 to make \nthe river safer for navigation.\n  Mr. President, as you can see, the use of motorized river craft is \ndeeply interwoven in the history, traditions, and culture of Hells \nCanyon. That is why Congress deliberately created a non-wilderness \ncorridor for the entire length of the river in the authorizing \nlegislation. During debate, Congress tried to make it clear that use of \nboth motorized and nonmotorized river craft would be valid uses of the \nriver within the recreation area--the entire river for the entire year. \nIt was not their intent in 1975 to allow the managing agency to decide \nthat one valid use would prevail to the exclusive use over the other.\n  Quite clearly, the issue of power boating's validity will not be \nsettled unless decided by the courts or unless Public Law 94-199 is \nclarified by Congress. The courts are already burdened by too many \ncases of this type, resulting in a waste of time, energy, and financial \nresources for both the United States and its citizens. The only \npractical and permanent resolution of this issue is to clarify \ncongressional intent in a manner that will not allow any future \nmisunderstanding. This is what I propose to do with this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 631. A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to \nprohibit the sale, import, and export of products labeled as containing \nendangered species, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                the rhino and tiger product labeling act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today works to \nend the illegal killing of rare and endangered species that are close \nto extinction. These species include rhinos, tigers, bears, and many \nother animals that are slaughtered for senseless reasons. The bill, \ntitled the Rhino and Tiger Product Labeling Act, seeks to amend the \nEndangered Species Act of 1973 to prohibit the sale of products labeled \nas containing endangered species.\n  Since 1970, the world's population of rhinos has declined by 90 \npercent. Among the 5 species of rhinos, fewer than 11,000 individual \nrhinos exist in the wild. Tigers are facing a similar fate. At the turn \nof the century, as many as 100,000 tigers lived in the wild. Today, \nless than 5,000 tigers remain. Three subspecies are already extinct, \nand the remaining five subspecies are found only in sparse pockets of \nAsia.\n  The greatest threat to the existence of rhinos and tigers in the wild \ncontinues to be the high demand for products containing rhino horn and \ntiger parts. The prohibition of the illegal trade in endangered species \nparts has not been well enforced in most Asian countries, where rhino \nand tiger products are valued for their medicinal value. Although the \nprimary market for these illegal products continues to be in Asia, a \nlarge market has developed here in America.\n  Investigators have found that in the United States, the trade in \nendangered species continues to be widely practiced. Many pharmacies in \nLos Angeles and New York offer rhino and tiger products for sale--a \nstrong indication that it is time for the United States to concentrate \non its role as a consumer nation of endangered species parts and \nproducts. In a recent survey, investigators found that 80 percent of \npharmacies and supermarkets in New York's Chinatown district had tiger \nproducts openly for sale. Many of these products were imported from \nChina. Demand for such products here in the United States is leading \ndirectly to the elimination of these species in their native habitat \noverseas. This trade must end.\n  To curb this trade we need effective labeling laws and we must ban \nall products containing or claiming to contain ingredients derived from \nendangered species. Many products which advertise ingredients such as \nrhino horn or tiger parts do not even contain trace amount of these \nendangered species. However, the mere fact that they are on store \nshelves leads to increased demand for the real stuff. In addition, \nthese products have been tested in the United States by the Food and \nDrug Administration and have been found to contain toxic metals that \nare harmful to human health if taken in the doses found in many \ntraditional medicines. A ban on products containing ingredients from \nendangered species as well as those claiming to contain endangered \nspecies parts is vital to protect human health and to maintain the few \nremaining rhinos, tigers and bears in their wild habitat.\n  My legislation will make it illegal to even intend to sell a product \ncontaining an endangered species. Today, Fish and Wildlife \ninvestigators are overwhelmed trying to control the illegal sale of \nendangered species parts and products. This bill will allow \ninvestigators to completely halt the sale of products labeled as \ncontaining endangered species.\n  I am strong proponent of the protection and conservation of \nendangered species. If we do not act now, future generations will not \nbe able to enjoy many of the species of wildlife now in existence. \nCurrently there are insufficient legal mechanisms enabling the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service to forcefully interdict and confiscate \nproducts\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\nthat are labeled as containing endangered species and to prosecute the \nmerchandisers once the products are on store shelves. This bill seeks \nto close a significant loophole in the illegal trade in products \ncontaining or claiming to contain ingredients from endangered species. \nMy hope is that this legislation, when passed in the 105th Congress, \nwill help curb the escalating trade in wildlife and endangered species \nparts and stem the decrease in the populations of some of the Earth's \nmost magnificent animals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 362. A bill to deter and punish serious gang and violent crime, \npromote accountability in the juvenile justice system, prevent juvenile \nand youth crime, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n          the anti-gang and youth violence control act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Anti-Gang and Youth \nViolence Control Act of 1997. This is the President's juvenile justice \nbill, and I am pleased to introduce it on behalf of the administration.\n  Like the Democratic leadership bill, S. 15, the President's Anti-Gang \nand Youth Violence Control Act includes important provisions to address \nthe increases in juvenile crime and gang violence that we have seen \nover the past decade.\n  Just as we proposed measures in S. 15 to streamline the procedures \nfor prosecuting violent juveniles, the President's bill would take \nsteps to ensure that serious juvenile offenses are addressed quickly \nand efficiently by the courts.\n  In addition, the President's bill targets many of the same problems \nwe addressed in S. 15, such as increasing the penalties for witness \nintimidation--a particular problem for prosecutors in gang cases--and \nimproving the rights of the victims of juvenile crime to include \nrestitution, notification of disposition, and greater public access to \njuvenile proceedings.\n  The President's bill also addresses the Federal Government's grant \nauthority in the area of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention. I \napplaud the President for his reform-minded effort for improving the \nFederal Government's role in helping State and local authorities \nprevent juvenile crime and juvenile victimization. I look forward to \nworking with the President and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \non this issue. It is important that we reach a bipartisan agreement on \nthe role the Federal Government should play in this area as we move \nforward into the next century.\n  Certain sections of the administration's bill differ from S. 15, and \nI look forward to sorting out this and other differences in the \nproposals.\n  I commend President Clinton and the Department of Justice on their \nefforts to address the problems of gang and youth violence with the \nconcrete proposals in this bill. I urge my colleagues to put partisan \npolitics aside, to work together on finding constructive solutions to \nthese problems. Our challenge is to resolve any differences in approach \nin ways that make sense and will work to reduce youth and gang \nviolence.\n  As we proceed to meet this challenge, I know we will depend heavily \non Senator Biden, our former chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee and now the ranking member on the Youth Violence \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. He has worked hard and \neffectively on these issues in the past and, I thank him in advance for \ncontinuing to share his expertise on these important issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n ANTI-GANG AND YOUTH VIOLENCE ACT OF 1997--SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS\n\n       The Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act of 1997 is a \n     comprehensive federal effort to address the nation's youth \n     and juvenile crime problem. This legislation contains many of \n     the proposed amendments to the federal code that were \n     contained in legislation introduced, but not enacted into law \n     during the 104th Congress. This legislation also redesigns, \n     refocuses, and enhances the federal government's role in \n     relation to state, local and Indian tribal governments in \n     combating and preventing juvenile and youth crime, violence, \n     gang involvement, and drug use. Additionally, this \n     legislation includes the authorization for several programs \n     submitted by the President in his fiscal year 1998 budget \n     request.\n\n               Title I--Findings, Policies, and Purposes\n\n       This title enumerates findings regarding juvenile crime and \n     violence, as well as purposes tied to the various provisions \n     of the legislation. Additional definitions are provided as \n     needed.\n\n         Title II--Targeting Violent Gang, Gun and Drug Crimes\n\n\n Subtitle A--Federal Prosecutions Targeting Violent Gangs, Gun Crimes \n                   and Illicit Gun Markets, and Drugs\n\n            Part 1--Targeting Gang and Other Violent Crimes\n\n     Section 2111.  Increased penalties under the RICO law for \n         gang and violent crimes.\n       This amendment would boost the penalty for certain crimes \n     typically committed by gangs and other violent crime groups \n     by eliminating an anomaly in the penalty provisions of the \n     federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations \n     statute (18 U.S.C. 1963(a)). Specifically, the amendment \n     would increase the maximum penalty from twenty years to the \n     greater of twenty years or the maximum term applicable to a \n     racketeering activity on which the defendant's violation is \n     based. This principle already applies under the RICO statute \n     where the predicate racketeering activity carries a maximum \n     life sentence. The present twenty-year maximum applicable to \n     all other predicate racketeering offenses is anomalous in \n     light of the fact that several of the predicate offenses that \n     constitute ``racketeering activity'' themselves carry more \n     than twenty-year (but less than life) maximum prison terms, \n     e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1344 (bank fraud) and 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(B) \n     (large-scale drug trafficking).\n     Section 2112.  Increased penalty and broadened scope of \n         statute against violent crimes in aid of racketeering.\n       This amendment would close loopholes in 18 U.S.C. 1959, the \n     law punishing violent crimes in aid of racketeering. The \n     statute presently and anomalously reaches threats to commit \n     any crime of violence (with the requisite intent) but only \n     the actual commission of some such crimes. The amendment also \n     would clarify that the term ``serious bodily injury'' in 18 \n     U.S.C. 1959 shall be defined as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1365.\n       This proposal also would increase penalties for certain \n     violent crimes in aid of racketeering in recognition of the \n     serious nature of such crimes and to bring the penalties in \n     line with other penalties for similar crimes in title 18. \n     First, the amendment would increase from a maximum of ten \n     years' imprisonment to a maximum of life imprisonment a \n     conspiracy or attempt to commit murder or kidnapping, in \n     violation of 18 U.S.C. 1959. That statute punishes various \n     violent offenses committed in aid of racketeering activity. \n     The present ten-year maximum penalty for a conspiracy or \n     attempt to commit murder or kidnapping in aid of racketeering \n     is clearly inadequate. The maximum penalty for a conspiracy \n     to commit a murder within the special maritime and \n     territorial jurisdiction of the United States is life \n     imprisonment, 18 U.S.C. 1117, as is the maximum penalty for a \n     conspiracy to commit kidnapping, 18 U.S.C. 1201(c). Such acts \n     when performed with the additional intent of furthering \n     racketeering activity deserve no lesser punishment. Moreover, \n     an attempt warrants an equivalent sanction as a conspiracy. \n     Second, the amendment would increase from five years to ten \n     years the maximum penalty for committing or threatening to \n     commit a crime of violence under paragraph (4). Finally, the \n     amendment would increase from three years to ten years the \n     maximum penalty for attempting or conspiring to commit a \n     crime involving maiming, assault with a dangerous weapon or \n     assault resulting in serious bodily injury under paragraph \n     (6).\n     Section 2113.  Facilitating the prosecution of car-jacking \n         offenses.\n       This section would eliminate an unjustified and unique \n     scienter element created for the offense of carjacking by the \n     enactment of section 60003(a)(14) of the Violent Crime \n     Control and Law Enforcement Act. The carjacking statute, 18 \n     U.S.C. 2119, essentially proscribes robbery of a motor \n     vehicle. It punishes the taking of a motor vehicle that has \n     moved in interstate or foreign commerce ``from the person or \n     presence of another by force and violence or by \n     intimidation.'' The basic penalty is up to fifteen years' \n     imprisonment but rises if serious bodily injury or death \n     results.\n       Prior to the enactment of VCCLEA, the offense applied only \n     if the defendant possessed a firearm. Section 60003(a)(14) of \n     that law appropriately deleted the firearm requirement, as \n     had been proposed in the Senate-passed bill, but in \n     conference a new scienter element was added that the \n     defendant must have intended to cause death or serious \n     bodily injury. This unique new element will \n     inappropriately make carjackings difficult or impossible \n     to prosecute in certain situations. Robbery offenses \n     typically require only what the carjacking statute \n     formerly required by way of scienter, i.e., that property \n     be knowingly taken from the person or presence of another \n     by force and violence or by intimidation. The Hobbs Act, \n     18 U.S.C. 1951, the quintessential federal robbery law \n     which carries a higher maximum penalty\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\n     than the carjacking statute, essential defines ``robbery'' \n     in this manner. The new requirement of an intent to cause \n     death or serious bodily harm will likely be a fertile \n     course of argument for defendants in cases in which no \n     immediate threat of injury occurs, such as where a \n     defendant enters an occupied vehicle while it is stopped \n     at a traffic light and physically removes the driver. Even \n     when a weapon is displayed, the defendant may argue that \n     although it was designed to instill fear, he had no intent \n     to harm the victim had the victim in fact declined to \n     leave the car.\n       Carjacking is one of the most serious types of robbery \n     precisely because, unlike other person property, a car is a \n     place where people are accustomed to feel safe and where they \n     and their family spend hours of their lives. To give \n     defendants who take cars from the person or presence of their \n     occupants by force and violence or intimidation a new legal \n     tool with which to resist their prosecution is unjustified. \n     This new element should be eliminated as soon as possible \n     from Section 2119. The proposed amendment would do so.\n     Section 2114.  Facilitation of RICO prosecutions.\n       This amendment is intended to overcome decisions in the \n     First and Second Circuits that require proof that a RICO \n     conspiracy defendant agreed personally to commit at least two \n     acts of racketeering activity. United States v. Ruggiero, 726 \n     F. 2d 913, 921 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 831 (1984); \n     United States v. Winter, 663 F. 2d 1120, 1136 (1st Cir. \n     1981), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1011 (1981). See also United \n     States v. Sanders, 929 F. 2d 1466, 1473 (10th Cir.), cert. \n     denied, 112 S. Ct. 143 (1991). Virtually all other circuits \n     have more recently rejected these holdings and have concluded \n     that it is sufficient to show that the defendant joined the \n     conspiracy and agreed that two or more racketeering acts \n     would be committed by some conspirators on behalf of the \n     enterprise. See, e.g., United States v. Pryba, 900 F. 2d 748, \n     759-60 (4th Cir. 1990); United States v. Traitz, 871 F. 2d \n     368, 395-96 (3 d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 821 (1989); \n     United States v. Neapolitan, 791 F. 2d 489, 491-98 (7th Cir. \n     1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1101 (1987); United States v. \n     Joseph, 781 F. 2d 549, 554-55 (6th Cir. 1986; United States \n     v. Tille, 729 F. 2d 615, 619 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 \n     U.S. 845 (1984); United States v. Carter, 721 F. 2d 1514, \n     1528-31 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 819 (1984).\n       There is no reason to require that a defendant charged with \n     RICO conspiracy personally commit racketeering acts. Standard \n     conspiracy law does not contain such a requirement. See, \n     e.g., Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 645-48 \n     (1946). It should be sufficient to show that the defendant \n     joined the overall conspiracy and agreed to the commission of \n     a pattern of racketeering activity by others on behalf of the \n     conspiracy. This amendment resolves this conflict in the \n     circuits.\n     Section 2115.  Elimination of the statute of limitations for \n         murder and Class A felonies.\n       This section makes important changes in federal law and \n     will enhance the ability of federal prosecutors to bring \n     serious offenders to justice. The first proposal relates to \n     the prosecution of certain murders. Current law provides that \n     no statute of limitations shall apply for the commission of a \n     federal crime punishable by death. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3281. This \n     statute should be amended to further eliminate the statute of \n     limitations for any federal offense involving murder, even if \n     the crime does not carry the death penalty. The rationale \n     behind this proposal is straightforward. Most states have no \n     statute of limitations for murder. Moreover, the act of \n     killing another person is so serious that no murderer should \n     go unpunished simply because the government was unable to \n     develop a case for many years.\n       By virtue of the 1994 Crime Act, most murders committed \n     during the course of a federal offense are now punishable by \n     the death penalty--and thus already have no statute of \n     limitations. The 1994 Crime Act only applies, however, to \n     murders committed on or after the Crime Bill was passed on \n     September 13, 1994. The proposed legislation will help bridge \n     this gap by eliminating the statute of limitations for \n     murders committed within five years of the date of passage of \n     the legislation and September 13, 1994. Furthermore, the \n     Crime Act did not provide for the death penalty for murders \n     committed in violation of the RICO statute. 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1961 et seq. The proposed legislation would bridge \n     another important gap by eliminating the statute of \n     limitations for RICO offenses when murders are committed in \n     furtherance of a racketeering enterprise.\n       The second proposal relates to the prosecution of certain \n     violent crimes and drug trafficking crimes. Current law \n     provides that the general federal five-year statute of \n     limitations applies to non-capital crimes of violence and \n     drug trafficking crimes. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3282. This proposal \n     extends to 10 years the statute of limitations for all crimes \n     of violence and drug trafficking crimes (except for cases \n     involving murder) currently classified as Class A felonies. \n     Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3559, Class A felonies are \n     the most serious federal crimes, which carry a maximum \n     sentence of life imprisonment or death.\n       This proposal is necessary for several reasons. First, \n     evidence of gang-related and other violent crimes, as well as \n     drug trafficking crimes, often develops years after the \n     crimes were committed because the organizations, gangs, and \n     racketeering enterprises that typically perpetrate such \n     crimes enforce strict codes of silence--through violence and \n     threats of violence--on their members. Thus, some violent \n     crimes and drug trafficking crimes are not solved until \n     imprisoned defendants begin to cooperate after spending years \n     behind bars--years in which the five-year statutes of \n     limitations may have lapsed. Second, society's interest in \n     repose and fairness to prospective defendants is greatly \n     outweighed by society's interest in punishing those \n     individuals who commit crimes that are so serious that \n     Congress has imposed a maximum sentence of life imprisonment \n     or death. Under current law, theft of major art work carries \n     a 20-year statute of limitations (18 U.S.C. Sec. 3294), and \n     most white-collar crimes involving financial institutions \n     (e.g., theft of money by a bank teller) carry a 10-year \n     statute of limitations (18 U.S.C. Sec. 3293). Given that \n     Class A crimes of violence and drug trafficking crimes \n     generally are at least as harmful to society as these \n     offenses, there is no reason for these Class A felonies to \n     carry such a relatively short statute of limitations.\n     Section 2116.  Forfeiture for crimes of violence, \n         racketeering, and obstruction of justice.\n       This section extends the forfeiture statutes to cover all \n     crimes of violence plus the racketeering crimes set forth in \n     Chapter 95 (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951-60), including extortion, \n     murder-for-hire, and violent crimes in aid of racketeering, \n     and the obstruction of justice offenses set forth in Chapter \n     73 (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1501-17). Presently, there is no \n     forfeiture authority for such offenses except when they are \n     included in a RICO prosecution.\n\n Part 2--Targeting Serious Gun Crimes and Protecting Children from Gun \n                                Violence\n\n     Section 2121.  Gun ban for dangerous juvenile offenders.\n       This amendment would make it unlawful for any person \n     adjudicated a juvenile delinquent for serious violent \n     felonies or drug crimes to receive or possess firearms. It \n     would also make it unlawful for any person to sell or \n     otherwise dispose of any firearm to any person knowing or \n     having reasonable cause to believe that the recipient has \n     been adjudicated a juvenile delinquent for such crimes. Under \n     current law, persons adjudicated juvenile delinquent, even \n     for the most serious crimes, e.g., murder, may receive and \n     possess firearms as adults. This amendment will ensure that \n     such juveniles will be ineligible to possess firearms after \n     the finding of juvenile delinquency.\n       The disability will only apply to the most serious drug \n     offenses and violent crimes, as enumerated in the recently \n     enacted ``three-strikes'' law (but because it would otherwise \n     be impossible to administer, the proposed statutory reference \n     incorporates the basic offenses enumerated in paragraph \n     (c)(2) of section 3559, without the exceptions set forth in \n     paragraph (3)). In addition, this amendment will only apply \n     to findings of acts of juvenile delinquency that occur after \n     the effective date of the statute. Thus, persons who have \n     acted or been adjudicated delinquent prior to the effective \n     date will not be subject to this disability. Adjudicated \n     delinquents would be permitted under the proposal to have \n     their firearms rights restored based upon an individualized \n     determination by an appropriate authority of the state of \n     their suitability for such restoration.\n       The proposal also would make a conforming change to the \n     restoration of rights statute affecting adult convictions. \n     One of the most serious problems today hindering enforcement \n     of a federal firearms statutes arises from the definition of \n     ``conviction'' in 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20). Under 18 U.S.C. \n     922(g), it is unlawful for a convicted felon to possess a \n     firearm. Section 922(g) violations also serve as the basis \n     for the mandatory penalties applicable under the Armed Career \n     Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. 924(e), for 922(g) violators with \n     three or more crime of violence or serious drug trafficking \n     convictions. What is a ``conviction'' is therefore vital to \n     the enforcement of these important provisions.\n       Prior to the 1986 Firearms Owners' Protection Act, a \n     conviction for purposes of federal firearms prohibitions was \n     a question of federal, not state, law. Federal law provided \n     that once an individual was convicted of a felony, that \n     person remained under a federal firearms disability \n     irrespective of state laws purporting to restore the person's \n     rights to possess firearms. Offenders could apply for relief \n     from firearms disabilities to the Secretary of the Treasury. \n     The 1986 Act, however, changed this policy and provided, in \n     18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20), that a conviction for which a person \n     has had civil rights restored generally ``shall not be \n     considered a conviction'' under federal firearms statutes.\n       The 1986 amendment has had adverse effects from the \n     standpoint of public safety. This results from the fact that \n     about half the states have laws that provide for some form of \n     automatic firearms rights restoration, including several \n     states that provide for such restoration after a waiting \n     period, and at least one state that automatically restores \n     firearms possession rights immediately upon completion of a \n     felon's sentence, so that the felon is enabled to walk \n     directly out of prison into a gun dealer's establishment and \n     legally arrange to purchase a firearm. Other states make \n     restoration of rights automatic except for certain categories \n     of felons (typically those convicted of violent crimes), \n     while still other states make restoration automatic for \n     some types of firearms but not others.\n       Under the proposed amendment, state laws restoring firearms \n     rights would continue to be recognized for federal firearms \n     enforcement purposes, but only if the restoration of\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\n     rights was done on an individualized rather than an automatic \n     basis, including a determination that the circumstances of \n     the person's conviction, and his or her record and \n     reputation, make it unlikely that the person will endanger \n     public safety. The Federal Government should not give effect \n     to state restoration of rights statutes that provide for no \n     individualized consideration of the offender's likelihood of \n     committing future crimes. About half the states currently \n     restore firearms rights only after such an individualized \n     review. The remaining states need not change their laws if \n     they do not wish to do so, but the Congressional policy \n     underlying the federal felon-in-possession prohibition in 18 \n     U.S.C. 922(g) should not be deemed superseded by a state law \n     that automatically restores a felon's firearms rights. Such \n     automatic restoration laws insufficiently protect the public \n     safety, not only in the states that provide for such \n     automatic restoration but in other states to which the \n     convicted felon may travel.\n       The proposed amendment also includes a provision, in the \n     final sentence, that would reverse the outcome in United \n     States v. Indelicato, 97 F.3d 627 (1st Cir. 1996). The Court \n     there held, contrary to other courts of appeals, that where a \n     state had never deprived a convicted felon of his or her \n     civil rights as a result of the conviction, that person was \n     to be considered as if the state had ``restored'' such \n     rights. Whether or not this interpretation is deemed correct \n     under the current law, as a matter of policy it makes sense \n     to require a state to make an individualized determination of \n     suitability to possess firearms in every case involving a \n     conviction of a state crime punishable by more than one year \n     in prison.\n     Section 2122.  Locking devices for firearms.\n       The amendment would require Federal firearms licensees, \n     other than licensed collectors, to provide a locking device \n     with every firearm sold to a nonlicensee. The term ``locking \n     device'' would be defined as a device that can be installed \n     on a firearm that prevents the firearm from being discharged \n     without removing the device. It would also include firearms \n     being developed which can ``identify'' their lawful possessor \n     by the use of a personal electronic ``key'', palmprint, or \n     other identifier. The provision is intended to provide added \n     safety to gun owners and to prevent accidental discharges \n     that can result when children gain access to firearms.\n     Section 2123. Enhanced penalties for discharging or \n         possessing a firearm during a crime of violence or drug \n         trafficking crime.\n       In Bailey v. United States, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 501, 133 \n     L. Ed. 2nd 472 (1995), the Supreme Court put a restrictive \n     interpretation of the verb ``use'' in relation to a firearms \n     violation under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c), finding that an \n     offender only ``uses'' a firearm if the weapon is ``actively \n     employed'' in connection with a criminal act. The legislative \n     proposal makes it clear that the statute punishes possession \n     of a firearm, as well as its ``use.'' Under the proposal, \n     possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent \n     crime or drug felony will result in a 5-year mandatory \n     minimum penalty. Offenders will receive a 10-year mandatory \n     minimum penalty if during the commission of a drug felony or \n     violent crime, the offender discharges the firearm or uses it \n     to inflict bodily harm.\n     Section 2124.  Juvenile handgun possession.\n       This proposal would increase the penalties for violations \n     of 18 U.S.C. 922(x), which makes it unlawful for a person to \n     transfer a handgun to a juvenile or for a juvenile to possess \n     a handgun. Existing law provides a penalty of not more than \n     one year for violations of Sec. 922(x) and, if the person \n     transferring the handgun to the juvenile knew that the \n     handgun would be used in a crime of violence, a penalty of \n     not more than 10 years. Existing law also provides for \n     probation by juvenile offenders, unless the juvenile has been \n     previously convicted of certain offenses or adjudicated as a \n     juvenile delinquent.\n       The proposal would eliminate probation as a mandatory \n     sentence for juveniles. Thus, juveniles would be sentenced to \n     a penalty of not more than one year or, if previously \n     convicted under this section or adjudicated delinquent for an \n     act that would be a serious violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \n     3559(c) if committed by an adult, sentenced to up to five \n     years' imprisonment. The proposal also increases the penalty \n     for adults who transfer handguns to juveniles knowing that \n     they intend to use it in the commission of a crime of \n     violence to not less than three years nor more than 10 years \n     (currently only the ten-year maximum applies).\n     Section 2125.  Increased penalty for firearms conspiracy.\n       This section would amend the firearms chapter of title 18 \n     to provide that a conspiracy to commit any violation of that \n     chapter is punishable by the same maximum term as that \n     applicable to the substantive offense that was the object of \n     the conspiracy. An identical amendment was enacted to the \n     explosives chapter of title 18 by section 701 of the Anti-\n     Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-\n     132). This also accords with several other recent \n     congressional enactments, including 21 U.S.C. 846 (applicable \n     to drug conspiracies) and 18 U.S.C. 1956(h) (applicable to \n     money laundering conspiracies). This trend in federal law, \n     which is emulated in the penal codes of many States, \n     recognizes that, as the Supreme Court has observed, \n     ``collective criminal agreement--partnership in crime--\n     presents a greater potential threat to the public than \n     individual delicts.'' Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. \n     587, 593 (1961); accord, United States v. Feola, 420 U.S. \n     671, 693-94 (1975).\n\n                 Part 3--Targeting Illicit Gun Markets\n\n     Section 2131.  Certain gang-related firearms offenses as RICO \n         predicates\n       The proposed amendment would add a number of title 18 \n     firearms offenses that are related to gang activity to the \n     RICO statute. A brief description of the covered offenses is \n     as follows: 922(a)(1) (illegally engaging in business of \n     dealing in firearms); (922(a)(6) (knowingly making false \n     statement to a licensee in order to acquire a firearm); \n     922(i) (transporting a firearm in interstate or foreign \n     commerce knowing it to have been stolen); 922(j) (possession \n     or disposition of a firearm or ammunition knowing it to have \n     been stolen); 922(k) (transporting or receiving a firearm \n     interstate with an obliterated serial number); 922(o) \n     (unlawful possession or transfer of a machinegun); 922(g) \n     (unlawful possession of a firearm that affects or has moved \n     in interstate commerce in a school zone); 922(u) (theft from \n     a licensee of a firearm that has moved in interstate \n     commerce; 922(v) (illegal transfer or possession of a \n     semiautomatic assault weapon); (922(x)(1) sale or transfer of \n     a firearm to a person known to be a juvenile); 924(b) \n     (transporting or receiving a firearm in interstate commerce \n     with intent to commit therewith a felony); 924(g) (traveling \n     interstate to acquire a firearm, with intent to commit a \n     crime of violence, drug trafficking offense, or other \n     enumerated felony); (24(h) (transferring a firearm with \n     knowledge it will be used to commit a crime of violence or \n     drug trafficking offense); 924(k) (smuggling a firearm into \n     the United States with intent to commit a crime of violence \n     or drug trafficking offense); 924(l) (theft of a firearm from \n     a licensee); and 924(m) (traveling in interstate or foreign \n     commerce to acquire a firearm, with intent to engage \n     illegally in business of dealing in firearms).\n     Section 2132.  Felony treatment for offenses tantamount to \n         aiding and abetting unlawful purchases\n       This proposal would increase the punishment for the most \n     serious record keeping violations committed by federal \n     licensees, which are tantamount to aiding and abetting \n     unlawful deliveries or purchases of firearms, to the same \n     level of offense as that committed by the unlawful provider \n     or receiver. Sections 922(b) (1) and (3) proscribe sales of \n     firearms known to be juveniles or to reside out of State, \n     respectively. Each carries a five-year maximum sentence for a \n     willful violation under 18 U.S.C. 924(a)(1)(D). Sections \n     922(a)(6) and (d) proscribe, respectively, making false \n     statements to a licensee in relation to the acquisition of a \n     firearm, and knowingly selling a firearm to a convicted felon \n     or other prohibited category of firearm recipient. Each is \n     punishable by up to ten years' imprisonment.\n       At present, all record keeping violations by licensees are \n     misdemeanors carrying a maximum of one year in prison. This \n     is insufficient in the above situations, where the knowingly \n     false record keeping entry is very serious and closely \n     associate with or in the nature of aiding and abetting a \n     violation involving the provision of a firearm to a person \n     not entitled to obtain it. Accordingly, the amendment would \n     increase the penalty for such record keeping violations to \n     the same as that would attach to the underlying violation.\n     Section 2133.  Secure storage of firearms inventories\n       This amendment would require Federal firearms licensees \n     other than collectors and gunsmiths to store their firearms \n     inventory in accordance with regulations issued by the \n     Secretary. The purpose of the amendment is to provide \n     security requirements for the firearms industry. Thefts of \n     firearms from dealers is a growing problem and contributes to \n     the number of firearms available to juvenile youth gangs and \n     other criminals. In issuing the storage regulations, the \n     Secretary would be required to consider the standards of \n     safety and security used by the firearms industry. The \n     industry, as well as other interested persons, could \n     participate in the rulemaking process and have input into the \n     regulations.\n     Section 2134.  Suspension of federal firearms licenses and \n         civil penalties for willful violations of the Gun Control \n         Act\n       Under current law, the only available administrative \n     remedies to deal with licensees' violations are the extreme \n     measures of denying license renewal applications and license \n     revocation. There may be certain minor violations of the Gun \n     Control Act, e.g., failure to timely record information in \n     required records, that may not warrant license revocation or \n     license denial. This amendment provides new administrative \n     sanctions, less severe than current administrative remedies, \n     including license suspension, civil money penalties, and \n     authority to accept monetary offers in compromise of \n     violations of the law and regulations.\n     Section 2135.  Transfer of firearm to commit a crime of \n         violence\n       Present 18 U.S.C. 924(h) makes it unlawful to transfer a \n     firearm ``knowing'' that the firearm will be used to commit a \n     crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. However, 18 \n     U.S.C. 924(b) makes it unlawful to transport or receive a \n     firearm in interstate commerce ``with knowledge or reasonable \n     cause to believe'' that any felony is to be committed\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\n     therewith. Both statutes carry the same maximum penalty.\n       There is no plausible reason why section 924(h) is limited \n     to instances in which the actor has knowledge that a crime of \n     violence or drug trafficking crime will be committed, as \n     opposed to having ``reasonable cause to believe'' that such \n     is the case. Indeed, the offenses covered by section 924(h)--\n     violent felonies and drug trafficking felonies--are \n     inherently more serious than the offenses covered by section \n     924(b), which extends to all felonies. Accordingly, this \n     section would conform the scienter element in section 924(h) \n     by adding ``reasonable cause to believe'' to that statute.\n     Section 2136.  Increased penalty for knowingly receiving \n         firearm with obliterated serial number.\n       The current maximum penalty for knowingly receiving a \n     firearm with an obliterated or altered serial number in \n     violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(k) is five years. This offense is \n     tantamount to that of receiving a firearm known to be stolen. \n     However, the latter carries a maximum penalty of ten years. \n     Accordingly, this amendment would increase the maximum \n     penalty for receiving a firearm with an obliterated or \n     altered serial number to ten years.\n     Section 2137.  Amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines for \n         transfers of firearms to prohibited persons.\n       The proposed amendment would require the United States \n     Sentencing Commission to provide an increase in the base \n     offense level for certain firearms violators under sentencing \n     guideline section 2K2.1. The increase should assure that the \n     base offense level for a person who transfers firearms or \n     ammunition with knowledge or reasonable cause to believe that \n     the transferee is a convicted felon or otherwise in a \n     prohibited category is the same as that for the transferee. \n     Under Federal law the offense of selling or disposing of a \n     firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having \n     reasonable cause to believe that the person is in a \n     prohibited category is punishable by a maximum term of \n     imprisonment of 10 years--the same penalty that applies to \n     the transferee. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 922(d), 922(g) and \n     924(a)(2).\n       The sentencing guidelines provide that a prohibited person \n     who engages in a firearm offense is subject at least to \n     offense level 14. Thus, for example, a convicted felon who \n     unlawfully acquires a firearm in violation of section 922(g) \n     of title 18, United States Code, would face a sentencing \n     range of 18-24 months of imprisonment if his past conviction \n     resulted in a sentence of imprisonment of 60 days or more. \n     However, the transferor currently faces a guideline offense \n     level of just 12 (10-16 months of imprisonment for a first \n     offender, which can result in five months of imprisonment and \n     five months of supervised release with home confinement). The \n     transferor in this case should be subject to offense level \n     14, like the transferee.\n       Guideline section 2K2.1 also provides an offense level of \n     20 for a prohibited person whose offense involved a \n     machinegun or certain other dangerous firearms. The proposed \n     directive would require the Sentencing Commission to make \n     this offense level applicable to the transferor of such a \n     weapon if the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to \n     believe that the transferee is in a prohibited category. \n     However, the sentencing guidelines currently provide \n     additional base offense level increases in the case of \n     defendants who have prior felony convictions of either a \n     crime of violence or controlled substance offense, \n     Sec. 2K2.1(a)(1), (2), (3), and (4)(A). The directive to the \n     Sentencing Commission specifically exempts these additional \n     increases from its requirements.\n     Section 2138.  Forfeiture of firearms used in crimes of \n         violence and felonies.\n       The amendment adds the authority to forfeit firearms used \n     to commit crimes of violence and all felonies to 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 981 and 982. This authority would be in addition to \n     the authority already available to Treasury agencies under 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 924(d).\n       The purpose of the amendment is (1) to provide for criminal \n     as well as civil forfeiture of firearms; and (2) to permit \n     forfeiture actions to be undertaken by Department of Justice \n     law enforcement agencies who have authority to enforce the \n     statutes governing crimes of violence but who do not have \n     authority to pursue forfeitures of firearms under the \n     existing statutes.\n       Section 924(d) of title 18 already provides for the civil \n     forfeiture of any firearm used or involved in the commission \n     of any ``criminal law of the United States.'' The statute, \n     however, is enforced only by the Treasury Department and its \n     agencies; it provides no authority for the FBI, for example, \n     to forfeit a gun used in the commission of an offense over \n     which it has sole jurisdiction. Moreover, Sec. 924(d) \n     provides for civil forfeiture only.\n       Subsection (d) adds a provision to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(d) \n     intended to permit the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms to forfeit property that otherwise would have to be \n     forfeited by another agency. Under Sec. 924(d), ATF is \n     presently authorized to forfeit a firearm used or carried in \n     a drug trafficking crime. Property involved in the drug \n     offense itself, such as drug proceeds, may also be \n     forfeitable under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 881, but ATF does not presently have authority to \n     forfeit property under that statute and has to turn the \n     forfeitable property over to another agency. The amendment \n     does not expand the scope of what is forfeitable in any way, \n     but does allow the forfeiture to be pursued by ATF when the \n     agency is already involved in the forfeiture of a firearm in \n     the same case.\n       Finally, subsection (e) clarifies an ambiguity in the \n     present statute relating to the 120-day period in which a \n     forfeiture action must be filed. Presently, the statute says \n     that a forfeiture proceeding must be filed within 120 days of \n     the seizure of the property. This was intended to force the \n     government to initiate a forfeiture action promptly. In one \n     case, however, where the government did initiate an \n     administrative forfeiture action within the 120-day period, \n     the claimant filed a claim and cost bond which required the \n     government to begin the forfeiture action over again by \n     filing a formal civil judicial proceeding in federal court. \n     The claimant then moved to dismiss the judicial proceeding \n     because the complaint was filed outside the 120-day period.\n       The court granted the motion to dismiss because the literal \n     wording of Sec. 924(d) requires any forfeiture action against \n     the firearm to be filed within 120 days of the seizure. \n     United States v. Fourteen Various Firearms, __ F. Supp. __, \n     1995 WL 368761 (E.D. Va. June 19, 1995). This interpretation, \n     however, leads to unjust results in cases where the \n     government promptly commences an administrative forfeiture \n     action but the claimant waits the full time allotted to him \n     to file a claim. (Under Section 101 of this Act, the claimant \n     would have 30 days from the date of publication of notice of \n     the administrative forfeiture action to file a claim, which \n     is likely to be several months after the seizure even if the \n     government initiated the administrative forfeiture almost \n     immediately after the seizure.) In such cases, Congress could \n     not have intended the 120-day period for filing a judicial \n     complaint to count from the date of the seizure; indeed, it \n     is often the case that the claimant doesn't even file the \n     claim until more than 120 days have passed. Thus, the \n     amendment clarifies the statute to make clear that the \n     government must initiate its administrative forfeiture \n     proceeding within 120 days of the seizure and then will have \n     120 days from the filing of a claim, if one is filed, to file \n     the case in federal court. The amendment also tolls the 120-\n     day period during the time a related criminal indictment or \n     information is pending.\n     Section 2139.  Forfeiture for gun trafficking\n       This section provides for the forfeiture, under 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 981 and 982, of vehicles used to commit gun \n     trafficking, such as transporting stolen firearms, and for \n     the proceeds of such offenses. The provision is limited to \n     instances in which five or more firearms are involved, thus \n     making it clear that it is not intended to be used in \n     instances where an individual commits a violation involving a \n     small number of firearms in his or her personal possession.\n\n  Part 4--Targeting Serious Drug Crimes and Protecting Children From \n                                 Drugs\n\n     Section 2141.  Increased penalties for using minors to \n         distribute drugs\n       This provision would amend Section 420 of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 861) to increase the current \n     mandatory minimum penalty for using or employing minors to \n     distribute drugs from one year to three years. Similarly, the \n     provision would increase the mandatory minimum penalty for a \n     second or subsequent violation of this statute from one year \n     to five years. The proposed increases are necessary to punish \n     persons who use or employ minors to distribute illegal drugs \n     and to deter others from engaging in such reprehensible \n     conduct.\n     Section 2142.1  Increased penalties for distributing drugs to \n         minors\n       This provision would amend Section 418 of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 859) to increase the minimum \n     penalty for distributing drugs to minors from one year to \n     three years for a first offense, and from one year to five \n     years for a second or subsequent offense. The proposal would \n     also alter the age of the minor that triggers these \n     penalties. Under the proposed amendment, the penalties would \n     apply whenever a person at least eighteen years of age \n     distributes drugs to a person under eighteen. Presently, the \n     statute punishes a person at least eighteen who distributes \n     drugs to a person under twenty-one, thus reaching some \n     transactions in which the buyer is significantly older than \n     the seller. This makes little sense and is inconsistent with \n     the companion statute, 21 U.S.C. 861, which punishes persons \n     who employ minors to distribute drugs. The proposed amendment \n     would bring section 859 into conformity with section 861.\n     Section 2143.1  Increased penalties for drug trafficking in \n         or near a school or other protected location\n       This provision would amendment Section 419 of the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 860) to increase the \n     mandatory minimum penalty for distributing drugs in or near a \n     school or other protected location. The provision also would \n     increase the mandatory minimum penalty for second and \n     subsequent offenses from one to five years. The increased \n     penalties for drug trafficking in or near schools or other \n     protected locations are consistent with the other proposed \n     penalty increases in this legislation and are aimed at \n     protecting children from drug trafficking and abuse, \n     punishing drug dealers who target\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\n     children, and deterring others who might engage in such \n     conduct.\n     Section 2144.1  Serious juvenile drug trafficking offenses as \n         Armed Career Criminal Act predicates\n       This section would amend the Armed Career Criminal Act \n     (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(2)(A), to permit the use of an \n     adjudication of juvenile delinquency based on a serious drug \n     trafficking offense as a predicate offense under that Act. \n     The ACCA targets for a lengthy period of at least 15 years' \n     imprisonment those felons found in unlawful possession of a \n     firearm who have proven records of involvement in serious \n     acts of misconduct involving drugs and violence.\n     Section 2145.  Attorney General authority to reschedule \n         certain drugs posing imminent danger to public safety.\n       Under existing law, the Attorney General is empowered to \n     add temporarily a substance to Schedule I of the Controlled \n     Substances Act when necessary to respond to an imminent \n     danger to public safety. See 21 U.S.C. 811(h). However, the \n     Attorney General is not authorized to reschedule a substance \n     that already has been placed on one of the schedules of the \n     Controlled Substances Act. Once a substance has been added to \n     one of the schedules, any rescheduling of that substance must \n     be done pursuant to the standard procedures for scheduling or \n     rescheduling a substance. Under the standard procedures, the \n     rescheduling of a substance can take several years.\n       The proposal would extend the Attorney General's existing \n     authority to schedule a substance on an emergency basis to \n     include the rescheduling of an already scheduled drug to \n     Schedule I. This authority will give the Attorney General to \n     respond to public health crises involving scheduled \n     substances, such as the rapidly escalating abuse of rohypnol, \n     a Schedule IV drug with no approved medical uses in the \n     United States.\n       The proposal contains the same limitations and procedures \n     as apply to the Attorney General's existing emergency \n     scheduling authority. The Attorney General could temporarily \n     reschedule a substance only for one year, with the \n     possibility of a one-time six month extension under certain \n     circumstances. In addition, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services would continue to have a formal role in advising the \n     Attorney General in any proposed rescheduling.\n     Section 2146.  Increased penalties for using federal property \n         to grow or manufacture controlled substances.\n       This provision would increase the penalty for cultivating \n     or manufacturing a controlled substance on federally owned or \n     leased land. A significant amount of the domestic marijuana \n     crop is grown on federal lands and a substantial number of \n     methamphetamine laboratories also have been discovered on \n     federal lands. Federal law enforcement agencies believe that \n     the use of federal lands for cultivating and manufacturing \n     controlled substances has increased because there is no \n     possibility that the land will be forfeited as is the case if \n     the cultivation or manufacture took place on private \n     property.\n     Section 2147.  Clarification of length of supervised release \n         terms in controlled substance cases.\n       This section resolves a conflict in the circuits as to the \n     permissible length of supervised release terms in controlled \n     substance cases. Under 18 U.S.C. 3583(b), ``[e]xcept as \n     otherwise provided,'' the maximum authorized terms of \n     supervised release are 5 years for Class A and B felonies, 3 \n     years for Class C and D felonies, and 1 year for Class E \n     felonies and certain misdemeanors. The drug trafficking \n     offenses in 21 U.S.C. 841 prescribe special supervised \n     release terms, however, that are longer than those applicable \n     generally under section 3583(b). Those longer terms, which \n     may include lifetime supervised release, were enacted in 1986 \n     in the same Act which inserted the introductory phrase \n     ``Except as otherwise provided'' in section 3583(b). Because \n     of this clear legislative history and intent, two courts of \n     appeals have held that section 3583(b) does not limit the \n     length of supervised release that may be imposed for a \n     violation of 21 U.S.C. 841 when a greater term is there \n     provided. United States v. LeMay, 952 F.2d 995, 998 (8th Cir. \n     1991); United States v. Eng, 14 F.3d 165, 172-3 (2d Cir. \n     1994. One court of appeals, however, has reached the opposite \n     result, holding that the length of a supervised release term \n     that can be imposed for controlled substance cases is limited \n     by 18 U.S.C. 3583(b). United States v. Gracia, 983 F.2d 625, \n     630, (5th Cir. 1993); United States v. Kelly, 974 F.2d 22, \n     24-5 (5th Cir. 1992).\n       Although the issue has not arisen with frequency, the \n     conflict is entrenched and should be dealt with definitively. \n     Accordingly, the amendment would add the words \n     ``Notwithstanding section 3583 of title 18'' to the title 21 \n     controlled substance offenses in the parts of those statutes \n     dealing with supervised release to make clear that the longer \n     terms there prescribed control over the general provision in \n     section 3583.\n     Section 2148.  Technical correction to assure compliance of \n         sentencing guidelines with provisions of all federal \n         statutes.\n       This section would amend 28 U.S.C. 994(a) to assure that \n     sentencing guidelines promulgated by the United States \n     Sentencing Commission are consistent with the provisions of \n     all federal statutes. Currently, section 994(a) contains a \n     requirement of consistency only with statutes in titles 28 \n     and 18 of the United States Code. No discussion of this \n     somewhat peculiar limitation appears in the legislative \n     history, see S. Rep. No. 98-225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., p. \n     163 (1983). The limitation seems to have been based on the \n     mistaken assumption that all provisions pertinent to the \n     promulgation of sentencing guidelines were contained in those \n     two titles. However, other provisions, such as mandatory \n     minimum sentences in title 21, are relevant and clearly are \n     meant to act as constraints on the guidelines. This amendment \n     will insure that guidelines are not created that are \n     inconsistent with the provisions of any relevant enactment \n     of Congress.\n     Section 2149.  Drug testing, treatment, and supervision of \n         incarcerated offenders.\n       This section amends Section 20105(b) of the Violent \n     Offender Incarceration/Truth-In-Sentencing (VOI/TIS) grant \n     program of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \n     of 1994 by adding the language at Section 20105(b)(1)(B) and \n     Section 20105(b)(2). The victims' rights language at Section \n     20105(b)(A) is current law as Section 20105(b).\n       The amendment adds several requirements to the conditions a \n     state must meet in order to receive funding under the VOI/TIS \n     program. First, the state must by September 1, 1998, have a \n     plan for drug testing/monitoring and treatment for violent \n     offender housed in their corrections facilities. This plan \n     needs to include sanctions for inmates who test positive. \n     Second, the language at (2) would permit the state to use \n     funds received under the VOI/TIS program to pay the costs of \n     the testing and treatment required under (B). Currently the \n     provisions at (B) are found in the Conference Report H.Rpt. \n     104-863 that accompanies the Department's fiscal year 1997 \n     appropriations act. The language at (2) is not included. The \n     goal of the amendment is to make the language at (B) \n     permanent and add the language at (2) by amending the \n     underlying law.\n\n\n  subtitle b--grants to prosecutors' offices to target gang crime and \n                           violent juveniles\n\n       This subtitle amends Section 31702, Community-Based Justice \n     Grants for Prosecutors,'' of Title III of the Violent Crime \n     Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 13862) to \n     respond to the increase of violent juvenile offenders and the \n     rate of gang-related juvenile crime. This subtitle provides \n     needed resources for state and local prosecutors to \n     facilitate the prosecution of violent and serious juvenile \n     offenders. There is no existing comparable legislative text \n     and programs previously authorized to assist prosecutors have \n     not been appropriated. As part of the President's fiscal year \n     1998 budget proposal, this program is authorized for \n     appropriations of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 and \n     $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1999.\n       Specifically, the legislation expands authority to: hire \n     additional prosecutors to reduce prosecutorial backlogs; \n     enable prosecutors to more effectively prosecute youth drug, \n     gang, and violence problems; supply the technology, \n     equipment, and training to assist prosecutors in reducing the \n     rate of youthful violent crime while increasing the rate of \n     successful identification and rapid prosecution of young \n     violent offenders; and assist prosecutors in their efforts to \n     engage in community-based prosecutions, problem solving, and \n     conflict resolution techniques through collaborative efforts \n     with law enforcement officials, school officials, probation \n     officers, social service agencies, and community \n     organizations.\n       There is also a two percent set aside of all funds \n     appropriated under this Part to be set aside for ``training \n     and technical assistance'' consistent with the above-\n     mentioned purposes. Similarly, 10 percent is taken ``off the \n     top'' of all funds appropriated under this Part to be set \n     aside for research, statistics, and evaluation'' consistent \n     with these purposes. Numerous jurisdictions have requested \n     training and technical assistance as a priority need. \n     Additionally, through the introduction of various bills, \n     Congress has evidenced its support for enhanced research, \n     statistics, and evaluation.\n\n\n       subtitle c--grants to courts to address violent juveniles\n\n       Subtitle C establishes federal grant funding for states, \n     units of local government, and Indian tribal governments to \n     use in developing and implementing innovative initiatives to \n     increase levels of efficiency, expediency, and effectiveness \n     with which juvenile and youths are processed and adjudicated \n     within the criminal and juvenile justice system. This is a \n     new grant authority to assist state, local, and tribal \n     courts, including probation and parole offices, public \n     defenders, and victim/witness service providers, to respond \n     to violent and serious youthful offenders.\n       This subtitle amends Section 21062 of Subtitle F of Title \n     XXI of the ``Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of \n     1994'' (42 U.S.C. 14161), that currently provides assistance \n     to state and local courts. This subtitle reintroduces the \n     Administration's State and Local Courts Assistance Program \n     Act to authorize the establishment of the juvenile gun \n     courts, drug courts, other specialized courts, and innovative \n     programs to better deal with the adjudication and prosecution \n     of juveniles. As part of the President's fiscal year 1998 \n     budget proposal), this program is authorized for \n     appropriations of $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1998.\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\n   Title III--Protecting Witnesses To Help Prosecute Gangs and Other \n                           Violent Criminals\n\n     Section 3001.  Interstate travel to engage in witness \n         intimidation or obstruction of justice.\n       This section would amend the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. 1952) to \n     add witness bribery, intimidation, obstruction of justice, \n     and related conduct in State criminal proceedings to the list \n     of predicates under the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. 1952). Recent \n     studies demonstrate that witness intimidation is one of the \n     most serious impediments to the prosecution of violent \n     street gangs and drug trafficking organizations in State \n     courts. This amendment responds to the growing witness \n     intimidation problem by authorizing federal prosecution of \n     persons who travel in interstate commerce with the intent \n     to bribe or intimidate a witness, obstruct a criminal \n     proceeding, or engage in related conduct.\n     Section 3002.  Expanding pretrial detention eligibility for \n         serious gang and other violent criminals.\n       This section would make three amendments to the pretrial \n     detention statutes designed to enhance the ability, in \n     appropriate circumstances, to use these statutes in \n     prosecutions against gang members and against other violent \n     criminals. Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. 3141 et seq., \n     defendants charged with certain offenses can be detained \n     pretrial if the court concludes there is clear and convincing \n     evidence that no condition or combination of conditions of \n     release will adequately assure the safety of any other person \n     and the community. See 18 U.S.C. 3142 (e) and (f). The kinds \n     of charges that permit such detention on grounds of the \n     defendant's dangerousness include certain serious drug \n     trafficking offenses and a ``crime of violence''. They also \n     include any felony if the defendant has previously been \n     convicted of two or more crimes of violence or serious drug \n     trafficking offenses.\n       The first proposal would add a definition of the term \n     ``convicted'' to include adjudications of juvenile \n     delinquency. Thus, it would permit pretrial detention, upon \n     the requisite showing, of persons charged with any felony, \n     e.g., interstate transportation of a stolen automobile, who \n     had two or more prior violent or drug convictions, including \n     juvenile delinquency adjudications for such conduct. This \n     should facilitate the use of pretrial detention when \n     appropriate against young career offenders such as gang \n     members.\n       The second proposed amendment relates to the definition of \n     ``crime of violence'' in 18 U.S.C. 3156(a)(4). That \n     definition reaches offenses (A) that have as an element the \n     use or attempted or threatened use of physical force, (B) any \n     other felony offenses that, by their nature, involve a \n     substantial risk that physical force may be used in the \n     course of their commission, and (C), by virtue of an \n     amendment in the 1994 crime bill, any felony under chapter \n     109A or 110 (which proscribe sex offenses and child \n     pornography).\n       It is not clear whether the offenses of possession of \n     explosives or firearms by convicted felons qualify as \n     ``crimes of violence'' under the second or (B) branch of the \n     definition. What little case law exists suggests that they \n     do. See United States v. Sloan, 820 F. Supp. 1133, 1136-41 \n     (S.D. Ind. 1993); United States v. Aiken, 775 F. Supp. 855 \n     (D. Md. 1991). See also, United States v. Dodge, 846 F. Supp. \n     181 (D. Conn. 1994). The Sloan court noted that, although the \n     Supreme Court held in United States v. Stinson, 113 S. Ct. \n     1913 (1993), that a similar definition of ``crime of \n     violence'' in the sentencing guidelines did not encompass the \n     felon-in-possession statutes, because the Sentencing \n     Commission had promulgated a policy statement to that effect, \n     the bail statutes serve a very different purpose from \n     sentencing enhancements and should be more broadly construed \n     to protect the public from continued endangerment by \n     convicted felons charged with a new offense of weapon \n     possession. (Prior to the Commission's policy statement, the \n     courts were divided as to whether a violation of 18 U.S.C. \n     922(a) was a crime of violence for sentencing purposes). This \n     proposed amendment would codify the result reached in Sloan. \n     It would not mandate pretrial detention but would permit the \n     government to show, in the case of a convicted felon such as \n     a gang member charged with violating the certain explosives \n     or firearms statutes, that no one or more conditions of \n     release would be adequate to safeguard society.\n       The third proposed amendment would make membership or \n     participation in a criminal street gang, racketeering \n     enterprise, or other criminal organization a factor to be \n     considered by courts in making bail determinations. \n     Presently, many other personal history and characteristics of \n     the individual charged are required to be considered in \n     making bail decisions, such as prior convictions, drug abuse, \n     and whether the alleged offense was committed while on \n     parole, probation, or other form of release pending criminal \n     trial. Clearly, gang or organized crime group membership is a \n     relevant factor that bears both on dangerousness and risk of \n     flight and that courts should take into account in making \n     bail determinations. The amendment is not intended to impinge \n     on rights of freedom of association but rather to reach \n     membership or participation in those organizations that \n     exist, at least in part, for the purpose of committing crimes \n     or depriving third parties of their lawful rights. See Madsen \n     v. Women's Health Center, Inc. 114 S. Ct. 2516, 2530 (1994).\n     Section 3003.  Conspiracy penalty for obstruction of justice \n         offenses involving victims, witnesses, and informants.\n       Increasingly typical of many criminal gangs is violence \n     directed at silencing or retaliating against witnesses or \n     potential witnesses and informants. 18 U.S.C. 1512 and 1513 \n     set forth offenses and penalties that, generally speaking, \n     adequately deter and punish such offenses. However, a \n     conspiracy to engage in witness intimidation or retaliation \n     in violation of these statutes is punishable only under the \n     catchall conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. 371, which carries a \n     maximum prison term of only five years. This is clearly \n     inadequate to vindicate an offense that involves, for \n     example, a conspiracy to kill a witness or potential witness \n     in a federal criminal proceeding. Such a conspiracy, if \n     perpetrated upon the special maritime and territorial \n     jurisdiction, would be punishable by up to life \n     imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. 1117. This is consistent with the \n     principle, recognized in some federal statutes and \n     prevalent in modern State criminal codes, that a \n     conspiracy warrants the same maximum penalty as the \n     offense which was its object. This principle is reflected \n     in several recently enacted federal statutes, including 21 \n     U.S.C. 846 (drug conspiracies), 18 U.S.C. 1856(h)(money \n     laundering conspiracies), and 18 U.S.C. 844(n)(explosives \n     conspiracies). The proposed amendment in this section \n     would apply this principle to 18 U.S.C. 1512 and 1513 and \n     thus provide better protection from gang violence to \n     witnesses and informants.\n\n                  Title IV--Protecting Victim's Rights\n\n       Title IV contains two Sections that expand the rights and \n     protections afforded to the victims of crime, particularly \n     crimes committed by juvenile offenders and crimes committed \n     against children. It should be noted that a number of other \n     provisions of the Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act of 1997 \n     expand the rights and protections of crime victims. For \n     example, the proposed Section 5002, which amends 18 U.S.C. \n     5032, would establish a rebuttable presumption that juvenile \n     proceedings shall be open to victims and members of the \n     public, with special protections and access afforded to crime \n     victims. In addition, proposed Section 5037 would expand the \n     allocution rights of crime victims, including the right to \n     have input into the predisposition report prepared by the \n     probation officer and the right to appear before the judge \n     and be heard prior to an order of disposition.\n     Section 4001.  Records of crimes committed by juvenile \n         offenders.\n       The proposed Section 40001 would amend 18 U.S.C. 5038(a)(6) \n     to correct an oversight in current law. The amendment \n     affirmatively provides for a victim's or a victim's official \n     representative's allocation at the dispositional phase of the \n     juvenile proceeding. In addition, the new statutory language \n     clarifies that communication is allowable with the victim \n     about ``the status or disposition of the [juvenile] \n     proceeding in order to effectuate any other provision of \n     [state or federal] law''. This language clears up any \n     ambiguity in current law by explicitly extending to victims \n     of juvenile offenders the right to information about the \n     juvenile proceeding that they might need or be entitled to \n     under any other state or federal law, such as the victim's \n     rights set out in 42 U.S.C. 10606. Thus, under this new \n     language, victims of juvenile offenders would be treated like \n     victims of adult offenders. For example, victims would be \n     able: to know about the status of the proceedings and the \n     release status of the offenders; to consult intelligently \n     with the prosecutor; and to make a knowledgeable victim \n     impact statement at the time of the disposition. In addition, \n     if state law allows victim compensation or grants any other \n     rights, this provision allows communication about the federal \n     delinquency proceeding in order to effectuate those \n     provisions.\n       Fingerprints and photographs of adjudicated delinquents \n     found to have committed the equivalent of an adult felony \n     offense or a violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(x) and 924(a)(6) \n     (possession of a handgun by a juvenile) would be sent to the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and made available in \n     the manner applicable to adult defendants.\n       The limited availability of juvenile criminal records is a \n     serious concern in connection with violent and firearms \n     offenses. In order to address this problem, the Department of \n     Justice amended its regulations in 1992 to expand the ability \n     of the FBI to receive and retain records from State courts \n     for ``serious and/or significant adult and juvenile \n     offenses.'' 28 C.F.R. 2032. The proposed bill would further \n     alleviate this problem by making corresponding changes in the \n     statutory rules for reporting offenses by juveniles who are \n     prosecuted federally. This amendment was passed in substance \n     by the Senate in the 103rd Congress as Section 618 of H.R. \n     3355.\n       Further disclosure of records relating to a juvenile or a \n     delinquency proceeding would be authorized if it would be \n     permitted under the law of the State in which the delinquency \n     proceeding took place. The proposal will allow for the \n     development of State systems of graduated sanctions by making \n     it possible for the court to take into account a juvenile's \n     criminal history when imposing sentence. The records could \n     also be used for analysis by the Department of Justice if so \n     requested by the Attorney General.\n       Finally, the new Section 5038(c) would be amended to allow \n     the disclosure of ``necessary docketing data''. This is \n     necessary because the nationwide military justice system \n     cannot process traffic tickets without disclosing some \n     docketing information.\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\n     Section 4002.  Victims of Child Abuse Act extension of \n         authorizations.\n       This section extends the authorization of appropriations \n     for programs under Subchapter I of the Victims of Child Abuse \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 13001 et seq.). The programs authorized under \n     VOCA include regional children's advocacy centers, local \n     children's advocacy centers, and specialized training and \n     technical assistance for state and local practitioners \n     dealing with the prosecution of child abuse cases. These \n     programs currently are administered by the Office of Juvenile \n     Justice and Delinquency Prevention.\n\n Title V--Federal Prosecution of Serious and Violent Juvenile Offenders\n\n     Section 5001.  Short title.\n       The amendments made in this title are designed to provide \n     protection for the community and hold juveniles accountable \n     for their actions. They will help ensure that prosecution of \n     serious juvenile offenders is more swift and certain, and \n     that punishment of juvenile offenders will be commensurate \n     with the seriousness of the crimes committed.\n     Section 5002.  Delinquency proceeding or criminal \n         prosecutions in district courts.\n       Under current law, the decision to charge a juvenile as an \n     adult for specified crimes is made by the United States \n     district court as a result of a motion by the United States \n     to transfer the juvenile for criminal prosecution. The \n     offenses subject to this transfer authority are limited. Even \n     more restrictive are the list of violent offenses for which a \n     juvenile under 15 years of age can be transferred.\n       There is virtually universal agreement among federal \n     prosecutors that the present system is cumbersome and has \n     frequently inhibited them for seeking adult prosecution. \n     Prosecutors who have sought the transfer of juveniles to \n     adult status have experienced many difficulties in the \n     application of an outmoded statute or have encountered judges \n     personally opposed to the transfer of juveniles, even in \n     cases involving very serious crimes. Moreover, there is a \n     presumption under present law in favor of a juvenile \n     adjudication, and a district court's decision to decline \n     transfer to adult status may be reversed only upon a finding \n     of abuse of discretion. United States v. Juvenile Male #1, 47 \n     F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 1995). The result is a juvenile justice \n     system which fails to provide an effective deterrent to \n     juvenile crime and fails adequately to protect the public.\n       The proposed statute would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 5032 to \n     greatly strengthen and simplify the process for prosecuting \n     the most dangerous juveniles as adults in federal court. The \n     legislation would bring federal law into conformity with that \n     of many states by giving prosecutors, rather than the courts, \n     the discretion to charge a juvenile alleged to have committed \n     certain serious felonies as an adult or as a juvenile.\n       The proposed statute would retain the minimum age in \n     existing law for prosecution of a juvenile as an adult but \n     would expand the list of offenses with serious violent, gun \n     or drug felonies. A number of states have similar statutes.\n       The legislation would, however, create a distinction \n     between juveniles 16 years of age and older and those who are \n     younger. Prosecution of juveniles 13 to 15 years of age at \n     the time of the offense would require approval of the \n     Attorney General or his or her designee at a level not lower \n     than Deputy Assistant Attorney General. This internal Justice \n     Department approval requirement (which would not be \n     litigable) has been used in other types of particularly \n     sensitive cases and would ensure that careful scrutiny and \n     uniform standards are used in determining whether to bring \n     criminal charges against very young juveniles. Prosecutors \n     would retain the discretion to proceed against anyone under \n     age 18 as a juvenile delinquent. In those cases, the current \n     requirement for prosecutorial certification would apply, thus \n     assuring that most such cases are handled at the state or \n     local level.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The federal prosecutor would be required to certify that \n     (A) the appropriate State does not have or declines to assume \n     jurisdiction over the juvenile, or (B) the offense is one \n     specified in the statute, and (C) there is a substantial \n     federal interest in the case of the offense to warrant the \n     exercise of federal jurisdiction. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 5032(a).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The proposed bill would amend section 5032, to expand the \n     list of serious felonies for which a juvenile can be \n     prosecuted as an adult to include additional violent crimes, \n     firearms charges and drug offenses. Under the amended \n     statutes, a juvenile could be prosecuted as an adult for the \n     following offenses:\n       (1) a serious violent felony or a serious drug offense as \n     described in section 3559 (c)(2) or (c)(3) or a conspiracy or \n     attempt under section 406 of the Controlled Substances Act or \n     under section 1013 of the Controlled Substances Import and \n     Export Act (21 U.S.C. 846 or 963) to commit an offense \n     described in section 3559(c)(2); and\n       (2) the following offenses if they are not described in \n     paragraph (1): (A) a crime of violence (as defined in section \n     3156(a)(4)) that is a felony; (B) an offense described in \n     section 844(d), (k), or (l), or paragraph (a)(6) or \n     subsection (b), (g), (h), (j), (k), or (l), of section 924; \n     (C) a violation of section 922(o) that is an offense under \n     section 924(a)(2); (D) a violation of section 5861 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that is an offense under \n     section 5871 of such Code (26 U.S.C. 5871);\n       (E) a conspiracy to violate an offense described in any of \n     subparagraphs (A) through (D); or\n       (F) an offense described in section 401 or 408 of the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 848) or a \n     conspiracy or attempt to commit that offense which is \n     punishable under section 406 of the Controlled Substances Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 846), or an offense punishable under section 409 \n     or 419 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 849, 860), \n     or an offense described in section 1002, 1003, 1005, or 1009 \n     of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. \n     952, 953, 955 or 959), or a conspiracy or attempt to commit \n     that offense which is punishable under section 1013 of the \n     Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 963).\n       To ensure the prosecution in one trial of all offenses \n     charged, a juvenile tried as an adult for one of the \n     designated offenses could also be prosecuted as an adult for \n     any other offenses properly joined under the Federal Rules of \n     Criminal Procedure. With these amendments, juveniles \n     convicted as adults could receive substantially higher \n     sentences than under current law, commensurate with their \n     crimes and criminal histories.\n       The existing statute excludes younger juveniles in Indian \n     country charged with certain crimes from prosecution unless \n     the tribal government opts to have the provision apply. The \n     proposal would continue this provision.\n       The proposed bill allows, in certain limited circumstances, \n     the district court to order that a juvenile charged as an \n     adult be tried under the juvenile delinquency procedures. \n     This is sometimes referred to as a ``reverse waiver.'' Any \n     juvenile charged with one of the offenses listed in 3(A)-(F) \n     or a juvenile under the age of 16 would be able to request a \n     ``reverse waiver'' hearing. A motion making such a request \n     would have to be filed within 20 days of the juvenile first \n     being charged as an adult. At the hearing, the juvenile \n     charged as an adult would have the burden of establishing \n     that it would be in the interest of justice that the case be \n     tried under the juvenile delinquency provisions of 5032(a). \n     The criteria by which the court should make its determination \n     are listed in the proposed statute. The procedure for \n     appellate review of the court's ruling would be similar to \n     that presently used after a motion to suppress evidence. If \n     the trial court determined that the juvenile should be tried \n     as a juvenile delinquent, the government would have the right \n     to seek an expedited appeal. In the event the court \n     determined that the juvenile had not carried his or her \n     burden of establishing that it was in the interests of \n     justice that there be a reverse waiver, then the case would \n     proceed to trial as an adult prosecution and the juvenile \n     could appeal in the event of a guilty verdict.\n       Juveniles under the age of 16 charged as adults, but who \n     have not previously been adjudicated delinquent of a serious \n     violent felony, and who are charged with certain limited \n     offenses would be sentenced under the sentencing guidelines \n     but would not be subject to mandatory minimums.\n       Section 5032(a)(4) is amended to make clear that federal \n     juvenile proceedings are normally open to the public but may \n     be closed in the interests of justice or for good cause \n     shown. It also includes a provision allowing victims, their \n     relatives and guardians to be included when the public is \n     otherwise excluded, unless the same two tests applied for \n     exclusion of the public also independently require exclusion.\n     Section 5003.  Custody prior to appearance before judicial \n         officer.\n       Minor changes have been made to make clear that the \n     procedures applicable to the arrest of a juvenile prior to \n     the formal filing of charges apply whether or not it is \n     anticipated that the juvenile will be charged as a juvenile \n     or as an adult.\n     Section 5004.  Technical and conforming amendments to Section \n         5034.\n       This section is amended to clarify that it applies to \n     juvenile proceedings only.\n     Section 5005.  Speedy trial.\n       The proposed status would require that for a juvenile in \n     custody juvenile delinquency proceedings begin within 45 \n     days, rather than the current 30 days. Exclusions in the \n     Speedy Trial Act (18 U.S.C. Sec. 3161(h)) would also be made \n     applicable for the first time in juvenile delinquency \n     proceedings. This additional time is necessary, particularly \n     in cases involving both adult and juvenile defendants such as \n     in the prosecution of gangs, to protect witnesses and \n     critical evidence by ensuring that the trial of a juvenile \n     does not proceed before the case against the adults. The time \n     within which a disposition hearing must be held after an \n     adjudication of delinquency would also be increased from 20 \n     to 40 days. Within the 40 days, the probation office would \n     prepare a predisposition report which would include victim \n     impact information. Forty days is consistent with federal \n     court practice generally and will provide the time necessary \n     to prepare a comprehensive report.\n     Section 5006.  Disposition; availability of increased \n         detention, fines and supervised release for juvenile \n         offenders.\n       The legislation would amend section 5037 to make fines and \n     supervised release--not presently sentencing options--\n     available for adjudicated delinquents in addition to \n     probation and detention. The maximum period of official \n     confinement for an adjudicated delinquent would be increased \n     to ten years or through age 25 to give judges increased \n     sentencing flexibility for juveniles who are adjudicated \n     delinquent. The maximum period\n\n[[Page S1668]]\n\n     for probation would be increased to the same period \n     applicable to an adult. To strengthen the accountability \n     of juveniles to victims, mandatory restitution would also \n     apply to adjudicated delinquents.\n     Section 5007.  Technical amendment of Sections 5031 and 5034.\n       This section makes technical and confirming amendments to \n     Sections 5031 and 5034.\n\n       Title VI--Incarceration of Juveniles in the Federal System\n\n     Section 6001.  Detention prior to disposition or sentencing.\n       Sections 6001 and 6002 relate to the detention of juvenile \n     offenders prior to disposition or sentencing. Specifically, \n     the bill would amend 18 U.S.C. 5035, to provide that juvenile \n     offenders less than 16 years of age being prosecuted as \n     adults but not yet convicted must be placed in an available, \n     suitable juvenile facility located within, or a reasonable \n     distance from, the district in which the juvenile is being \n     prosecuted. If such a suitable juvenile facility is not \n     available, the juvenile could be placed in any other suitable \n     facility located within, or a reasonable distance from, the \n     district in which the juvenile is being prosecuted. Only if \n     neither of these types of facilities is available could a \n     juvenile less than 16 years old be placed in some other \n     suitable facility. In order to protect the safety of these \n     younger offenders, the bill would require that, to the \n     maximum extent feasible, juveniles not be detained prior to \n     sentencing in any institution in which they have regular \n     contact with adult prisoners.\n       The requirement in current Section 5035, that a juvenile \n     charged with juvenile delinquency has regular contact with \n     adult prisoners would generally be retained in the proposed \n     legislation. However, the proposed bill would permit \n     juveniles adjudicated delinquent, once they reach the age of \n     18, to be placed with adults in a correctional facility. This \n     recommended change is consistent with recent regulatory \n     changes to state requirements under the Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention Act, 42 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.\n       Section 5039 of title 18, United States Code, would also be \n     amended to permit juveniles adjudicated delinquent to be \n     placed with adults in community-based facilities in order to \n     provide transition services for juveniles moving from \n     incarceration to the community and to allow juveniles to be \n     housed in their home communities. These changes would help \n     protect younger juveniles 13 or 14 years old, from 19 or 20 \n     year-olds who, although adjudicated delinquent, may be as \n     dangerous as adults.\n       The legislation would also amend Sections 5035 and 5039 to \n     give the Attorney General discretion to confine with adults a \n     serious juvenile offender 16 years of age or older who is \n     charged as an adult, both before and after conviction. As \n     under present law, only those juveniles charged as adults \n     whom a judicial officer has found would, if released, \n     endanger the safety of another person or the community or \n     would pose a substantial risk of flight could be detained \n     prior to trial.\n       The current requirement in Section 5039 that every juvenile \n     under 18 years of age who is in custody be provided with \n     adequate food, heat, light, sanitary facilities, bedding, \n     clothing, recreation, education, and medical care, including \n     necessary psychiatric, psychological, or other care and \n     treatment would continue to apply to every juvenile charged \n     as an adult who is detained prior to trial and sentencing and \n     would be expanded to provide for reasonable safety and \n     security as well.\n       These changes are consistent with current practice in many \n     states and are proposed to ensure that the most violent \n     juvenile criminal offenders are not detained or incarcerated \n     with juvenile delinquents. By providing the discretion to \n     house older juveniles prosecuted as adults, adjudicated \n     delinquents once they reach the age of 18 and all juveniles \n     convicted as adults in adult facilities, this proposal would \n     also solve practical problems reported by the U.S. Marshals \n     Service and the U.S. Attorneys, who have experienced great \n     difficulty in finding suitable juvenile facilities for older \n     and violent juvenile offenders.\n     Section 6002.  Rules governing the commitment of juveniles.\n       The legislative analysis for the amendments made in this \n     discussion are discussed in the analysis accompanying Section \n     5005.\n\n       Title VII--Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention\n\n       Title VII establishes within the Office of Justice Programs \n     the ``Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention,'' the \n     ``Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention Formula Grant \n     Program,'' the ``Indian Tribal Grant Programs,'' and ``At-\n     Risk Children Grants Program,'' and ``Developing, Testing, \n     and Demonstrating Promising Programs Program,'' the \n     ``Incentive Grant Programs,'' the ``Research, Statistics, and \n     Evaluation'' grants, and the ``Training and Technical \n     Assistance'' grants.\n       Subtitle A of Title VII creates the ``Office of Juvenile \n     Crime Control and Prevention'' to replace the Office of \n     Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The new Office \n     of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention responds to the \n     changing nature of juvenile and youth crime and represents a \n     more focused, efficient, and effective office. Fundamental \n     protections safeguarding juveniles and youth within the \n     juvenile justice system have been maintained, while \n     operations within this new office have been streamlined to \n     better coordinate and integrate juvenile and youth crime \n     initiatives with other Department of Justice activities, \n     particularly activities within the Office of Justice \n     Programs, the National Institute of Justice and the Bureau \n     of Justice Statistics, as well as with states, units of \n     local government, Indian tribal governments, and local \n     communities.\n     Section 7001.  Short title.\n       This section provides that Title VII of the Anti-Gang and \n     Youth Violence Act may be cited as the ``Juvenile Crime \n     Control and Prevention State and Local Assistance Act of \n     1997.''\n\n\n   subtitle a--creation of the office of juvenile crime control and \n                               prevention\n\n     Section 7101.  Establishment of Office.\n       Section 2701 establishes the ``Office of Juvenile Crime \n     Control and Prevention'' under the general authority, and the \n     ``supervision and direction'' of the Assistant Attorney \n     General for the Office of Justice Programs, United States \n     Department of Justice. The words ``supervision and \n     direction'' are used to describe the line of authority and \n     reporting relationship between the Director of the Office of \n     Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention and the Assistant \n     Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs in the \n     same way the words ``supervision and direction'' are used to \n     describe the line of authority and reporting relationship \n     between the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services and the Assistant Secretary of Health as cited at 42 \n     United States Code Section 202. This section continues the \n     Department of Justice's efforts in maintaining coordination \n     and cooperation among those federal agencies whose \n     jurisdictions involve the health, welfare, education or \n     general well-being of youths and/or juveniles. There are \n     numerous transitional elements to provide for the continuity \n     between the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \n     Prevention and the new Office of Juvenile Crime Control and \n     Prevention, including a specific transfer for the current \n     Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention to become the Director of the Office \n     of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention.\n     Section 7102.  Conforming amendments.\n       Section 7102 makes minor and technical conforming \n     amendments.\n     Section 7103.  Authorization of appropriations.\n       Section 7103 provides for the authorization of \n     appropriations to carry out the functions of the Office of \n     Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention.\n\n\n                 subtitle b--juvenile crime assistance\n\n       Subtitle B of Title VII of the Act maintains and \n     establishes numerous federal grant programs and initiatives--\n     the ``Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention Formula Grant \n     Program,'' the ``Indian Tribal Grant Program,'' the \n     ``Incentive Grant Program,'' the ``Developing, Testing, and \n     Demonstrating Promising Programs'' program, the ``At-Risk \n     Children Grants Program,'' and two initiatives that provide \n     additional funding for research, statistics, evaluation, and \n     training and technical assistance.\n     Section 7201.  Formula grant assistance.\n       Section 7201 amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n     Streets Act of 1968 by maintaining but revising the formula \n     grant program.\n       This federal grant program has fewer state planning \n     requirements, specifically allocates ten percent of all \n     grants funds appropriated to be set aside and used for \n     research activities (including program evaluations, data \n     collection efforts, and studies to identify initiatives that \n     reduce juvenile and youth crime and violence), and \n     specifically allocates two percent of all grant funds \n     appropriated to be set aside and used for providing training \n     and technical assistance to states and local communities for \n     the implementation of initiatives and programs that have \n     demonstrated a high likelihood of success.\n       Under a new formulation, all states receive 50 percent of \n     their allocation. To receive the remaining funds a state must \n     continue to follow established practices and procedures for \n     protecting juveniles within the juvenile justice system. \n     These provisions are reflected in the Department of Justice's \n     newly issued regulations, 28 CFR Part 31, governing this \n     section. Should a state fail to meet the requirements of this \n     section, the unallocated funds may be redistributed within \n     the state.\n     Section 7202.  Indian tribal grants.\n       Section 7202 establishes for the first time a direct \n     federal grant program whereby funding goes directly from the \n     Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention to Indian \n     tribal governments without utilizing state pass-through \n     procedures. Grant funds under this section shall be used for \n     initiatives designed to reduce, control, and prevent juvenile \n     and youth crime on Indian lands. This method of direct \n     funding is expected to better address and respond to the \n     needs and concerns of Indian tribes as well as increase \n     funding for these tribes. Also included is language \n     amending the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \n     of 1994 to substantially increase funding targeted for \n     correctional facilities on Indian tribal lands.\n     Section 7203.  At-risk children grant programs.\n       The ``At-Risk Children Grants Program'' is a new federal \n     grant program administered by the Office of Juvenile Crime \n     Control and Prevention that provides federal assistance to \n     states, for distribution by states to local\n\n[[Page S1669]]\n\n     units of government and locally-based organizations to combat \n     truancy, school violence, and juvenile crime by providing \n     funding for local crime prevention and intervention \n     strategies. Programs and initiatives funded with these grants \n     are designed to address youth within the juvenile justice \n     system who, with some focused supervision, direction, and \n     discipline, can go forward to lead-crime-free, productive \n     lives. This program is an expansion of what is currently \n     known as Title V of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \n     Prevention Act.\n       Grants awarded pursuant of this Part may be used for: \n     supporting locally based efforts for assisting high-risk \n     juveniles and juveniles within the juvenile justice system; \n     preventing and reducing truancy and school drop outs; \n     enforcing juvenile curfews; supporting school safety \n     programs, juvenile mentoring, violence reduction programs, \n     intensive supervision services, jobs and life skills \n     training, family strengthening interventions, early childhood \n     services, after-school programs for juveniles, tutoring \n     programs, recreation and parks programs, parent training \n     initiatives, health services, alcohol and substance abuse \n     services, restitution and community services activities, \n     leadership development, accountability and responsibility \n     education, and other such efforts designed to prevent or \n     reduce truancy, school violence, and juvenile crime.\n       Local units of government that participate under this Part \n     must utilize a local planning board to develop a three-year \n     plan.\n     Section 7204.  Developing, testing, and demonstrating \n         promising programs.\n       Section 7204 establishes new federal discretionary grant \n     programs for states, units of local government, and Indian \n     tribal governments administered by the Office of Juvenile \n     Crime Control and Prevention to develop, test, and \n     demonstrate initiatives and programs that have a high \n     probability of preventing, controlling, and/or reducing \n     juvenile crime. These grants were developed to motivate \n     states, units of local government, and Indian tribal \n     governments to independently generate innovative initiatives \n     to combat juvenile crime and youth violence.\n       This section replaces the current multiple discretionary-\n     categorical grant programs currently established by the \n     Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, by \n     consolidating several categorical grant programs into a \n     single, flexible, broad program.\n     Section 7205.  Incentive grant program.\n       This section establishes new federal formula grant programs \n     for states, units of local government, and Indian tribal \n     governments to develop and advance initiatives to prevent, \n     control, reduce, evaluate, adjudicate, or sanction juvenile \n     or youthful crime.\n       The state agency that receives a formula grant is eligible \n     to apply for a grant under this Part. Every applicant must \n     submit assurances to the Director of the Office of Juvenile \n     Crime Control and Prevention that they have or will have \n     within one year of submittal of an application:\n       (1) implemented a system of accountability-based graduated \n     sanctions; and/or\n       (2) implemented a system of information collaboration and \n     dissemination regarding acts of juvenile delinquency and \n     adjudication of the same.\n       Grants authorized under this section may be used to:\n       Achieve paragraphs (1) and/or (2) above; advance \n     initiatives that prevent or intervene in the unlawful \n     possession, distribution, or sale of a firearm by or to a \n     juvenile; implement initiatives that facilitate the \n     collection, dissemination, and use of information regarding \n     juvenile crime; implement new initiatives that assist state \n     and local jurisdictions in tracking, intervening with, and \n     controlling serious, violent, and chronic juvenile offenders; \n     implement comprehensive program services in juvenile \n     detention and correction facilities; implement procedures \n     designed to prevent and reduce juvenile disproportionate \n     minority confinement; or for any other purpose related to \n     juvenile crime reduction, control, and prevention as \n     determined by the Director of the Office.\n     Section 7206.  Research, statistics and evaluation.\n       Better research, evaluation, and statistical analysis is \n     critical to understanding and addressing the causes of \n     juvenile and youth crime. Under this section, increased \n     funding is combined with a collaboration between the Director \n     of the Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention and \n     the Directors of the National Institute of Justice and the \n     Bureau of Justice Statistics to better direct and expand \n     these functions.\n     Section 7207.  Training and technical assistance.\n       This section provides for specific federal grant funding \n     for much-needed technical and training assistance for \n     individuals in the fields of juvenile justice and juvenile \n     and youth crime. Funding under this section will enable more \n     communities to implement effective programs and initiatives \n     that reduce, control, and prevent juvenile and youth crime. \n     While this is a new federal grant program, training and \n     technical assistance have been established functions of the \n     Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.\n       In further recognition of the importance of high quality \n     and focused research, statistical analysis, evaluation, \n     training, and technical assistance, Title VII includes \n     specific provisions within each funded program setting aside \n     a percentage of grant funds appropriated for the above-\n     mentioned functions. These monies are in addition to funding \n     appropriated for these functions in Sections 409 and 410 of \n     Title VII. Specifically, Sections 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, \n     and 408 of Title VII of this Act provide that 2 percent of \n     all funds appropriated for each funded program shall be set \n     aside for training and technical assistance consistent with \n     Title VII. Similarly, Sections 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, and \n     408 provide that 10 percent of all funds appropriated for \n     each funded program shall be set aside for research, \n     statistics and evaluation activities consistent with Title \n     VII.\n\n\n               subtitle c--missing and exploited children\n\n       This subtitle amends the ``Missing Children's Assistance \n     Act'' (42 U.S.C. 5771 et seq.) by extending its authorization \n     to the year 2001 and by setting aside funds appropriated \n     under this subtitle to be used for research, statistics, \n     evaluation, and training. Additionally, conforming language \n     is added to the Act to reflect the replacement of the Office \n     of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention with the new \n     Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Leahy in \nintroducing on behalf of the administration, President Clinton's Anti-\nGang and Youth Violence Act, which the President announced last week in \nBoston.\n  Three years ago Congress passed the Biden crime bill into law. Today, \nthe verdict is in--the law is working to reduce adult crime. For \nexample, the projected violent crime rate is the lowest since 1991 and \nthe projected murder rate is the lowest since 1971.\n  But we all know that, unlike adult crime, juvenile crime is on the \nrise. The statistics are all too familiar: Violent juvenile crime \nincreased by 69 percent from 1987 to 1994; from 1983 to 1994 the \njuvenile homicide rate jumped 169 percent; and just recently, the \nCenter for Disease Control has reported that the United States has the \nhighest rate of childhood homicide, suicide, and firearm related deaths \nof 26 industrialized countries. We can and must do better than that.\n  The President's program is based in large part, on success stories \nfrom cities like Boston, MA, which developed a comprehensive community-\nbased strategy to both prevent at-risk youth from becoming criminals \nand deal harshly with those already in the criminal justice system.\n  Boston's Operation Night Light sends probation officers on patrol \nwith police to ensure that youth with criminal records stay out of \ntrouble and to assist in the investigation of new crimes. And Boston's \npolice force has joined with Federal law enforcement to target the \nillegal gun markets that supply most of the guns to gangs and violent \nyouth.\n  The results have been dramatic: Youth homicides have dropped 80 \npercent citywide; violent crime in public schools dropped 20 percent in \njust 1 school year; and most impressively--not a single youth died from \na firearm homicide during 1996. Now that is a record we could be proud \nof.\n  We are taking the same balanced approach to juvenile crime and drug \nabuse as we did in the 1994 Crime Act--tough sanctions, certain \npunishment and protection of vulnerable kids.\n  Like the Democratic crime bill I, Along with Senators Daschle, Leahy, \nand many others introduced earlier this year--S. 15--the President's \njuvenile crime initiative cracks down on violent juvenile offenders and \nyouth gangs, takes concrete steps toward preventing drug and gun \nviolence, and invests in programs that will get kids off the streets \nand into supervised programs during the after-school hours when they \nare most likely to be the victims of gangs and criminals or the \ncustomers of drug pushers.\n  The Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act proposes to use Federal law \nenforcement where its expertise and resources can best contribute to \nfighting crime and the spread of gangs. The act also seeks assistance \nfor local police and criminal justice systems to help them address \nmatters that we all know are local law enforcement challenges that they \nhandle the best.\n  On the Federal level the President's bill: contains tough new Federal \npenalties applicable to gang activities such as racketeering, witness \nintimidation, car-jacking, and interstate firearms and drug \ntrafficking; cracks down on juvenile gun use by extending the Brady \nbill to juveniles and requiring the sale of gun locks; makes juvenile \nrecords more accessible to police and\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\neducators; and targets abuse of drugs popular among youths by giving \nthe Attorney General emergency rescheduling authority.\n  But in recognition that the battle against youth crime and drug abuse \nis fought primarily in our communities and schools, the President's \nbill provides over $325 million annually to support State and local \ngovernments to: hire additional prosecutors to target gang and youth \nviolence; create special drug and gun courts to handle violent \njuveniles more effectively; create safe-havens for at-risk youth; \ninitiate systems of graduated sanctions so youth receive certain \npunishment for their first offense instead of a mere slap on the wrist; \nand promote use of curfews and put truants back in school where they \nbelong.\n  The President also proposes to recraft the Federal Juvenile Justice \nOffice by eliminating bureaucracies, streamlining programs, providing \nadditional flexibility to States and localities, and sharpening the \nOffice's focus on research and development. These are reforms that I \nhave long advocated.\n  However, the President's reform proposal reaffirms our commitment to \na few core principles that have worked well over the past 23 years--\njuveniles should not be housed in adult jails or lockups; juveniles in \ncustody should be separated from adult criminals; status offenders \nshould not be incarcerated; and where it exists, the disproportionate \nconfinement of minorities must be addressed.\n  With the introduction of this legislation the administration, Senate \nRepublicans, and Senate Democrats have now all made it a priority to \naddress the problem of youth violence. Of course, there are other \nproven, effective crime control programs that I would like to pursue--\nsuch as extending the 100,000 Cops Program to put another 25,000 cops \non the beat. I am sure there are initiatives which others would want to \npush.\n  But, instead of trying to pass an omnibus bill--which we all know \nwill be difficult, if not impossible--I think that we should keep our \nfocus on a targetted, specific bill which keeps our focus on the most \nimmediate concern: youth violence and the criminal victimization of \nyouth.\n  I look forward to working with the administration and my Republican \ncolleagues to craft responsible legislation that will address the \npressing concerns of the American public and be signed into law during \nthis session of Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 363. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require \nthat violent video programming is limited to broadcast after the hours \nwhen children are reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion \nof the audience, unless it is specifically rated on the basis of its \nviolent content so that it is blockable by electronic means \nspecifically on the basis of that content; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         the children's protection from violent programming act\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to offer legislation that will \nhelp parents limit the amount of television violence coming into their \nhomes. As my colleagues know well, Congress has been studying this \nissue for 40 years and the issues have not changed. Recent press \nreports continue to validate my concerns that all the talk and promises \nhave yielded nothing but the status quo, and efforts to encourage the \nindustry to police itself continue to yield meager results.\n  Enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 marked the second \ntime Congress has passed legislation to encourage the entertainment \nindustry to limit the amount of violence seen on television. The first \ntime was the effort in the late 1980's led by our former colleague from \nIllinois, Paul Simon. Senator Simon's approach, the Television Program \nImprovement Act, was designed to grant the industry a 3-year antitrust \nexemption to work together to adopt voluntary guidelines that would \nlead to reducing violence depicted in television programs. The result \nof this industry collaboration was announced in December 1992 with a \nstatement of joint standards regarding the broadcasting of excessive \ntelevision violence. In June 1993, the networks made a commitment that, \nbefore and during the broadcasting of programs that might contain \nexcessive violence, the following announcement would be made: ``Due to \nsome violent content, parental discretion is advised.'' The Independent \nTelevision Association, the trade group representing many of the \ntelevision stations not affiliated with one of the networks, adopted a \nsimilar voluntary code. Subsequent studies detailed, however, that \ndespite these voluntary guidelines, violence continued to rise.\n  In 1993, therefore, I introduced my safe harbor bill for the first \ntime. The Commerce Committee held one hearing in the 103d Congress and \na second hearing during the 104th. The Commerce Committee reported my \nbill, S. 470, by a vote of 16 to 1. The hearing record substantiates \nthe constitutionality of my safe harbor approach, with both Attorney \nGeneral Reno and Federal Communications Commission [FCC] Chairman Hundt \non record as testifying that the safe harbor approach is \nconstitutional. My efforts to bring my bill to the floor for a vote \nwere repeatedly blocked.\n  The second time, Congress legislated in this area was last year when \nthe so-called V-Chip provision was incorporated into the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996. I voted for this provision but had my \ndoubts about its effectiveness. Once again, Congress relied on the \nindustry to help parents limit the amount of violence. To make the V-\nchip work, the 1996 act encouraged the video programming industry to \n``establish voluntary rules for rating video programming that contains \nsexual, violent or other indecent material about which parents should \nbe informed before it is displayed to children,'' and to broadcast \nvoluntarily signals containing these ratings.\n  Pursuant to the 1996 act, all segments of the entertainment industry \ncreated the TV ratings implementation group--ratings group, headed by \nthe Motion Picture Association of America [MPAA] president Jack \nValenti. The group devised an age-based ratings system--not a content-\nbased system. The proposal has been met with widespread criticism as \nbeing too broad and vague for parents. I recommend that my colleagues \nread this past Saturday's New York Times February 22, 1997, to \nunderstand the confusion surrounding this issue. The age-based ratings \nsystem does not give parents sufficient information. Parents want the \nability and the choice to block out specific content they find \nunsuitable for their children.\n  So, here we are. Congress passes legislation designed to limit the \namount of television violence, again relying on the industry to act \nresponsibly. The voluntary ratings system proposed by the industry, \ncalled the TV parental guidelines, consists of the following six age-\nbased ratings:\n\n\n                                  TV-Y\n\n  All Children. This program is designed to be appropriate for all \nchildren. Whether animated or live action, the themes and elements in \nthis program are specifically designed for a very young audience, \nincluding children from ages 2 through 6. This program is not expected \nto frighten younger children.\n\n\n                                 TV-Y7\n\n  Directed to older children. This program is designed for children age \n7 and above. It may be more appropriate for children who have acquired \nthe developmental skills needed to distinguish between make-believe and \nreality. Themes and elements in this program may include mild physical \nor comedic violence, and may frighten children under the age of 7. \nTherefore, parents may wish to consider the suitability of this program \nfor their very young children.\n\n\n                                  TV-G\n\n  General Audience. Most parents would find this program suitable for \nall ages. Although this rating does not signify a program designed \nspecifically for children, most parents may let younger children watch \nthis program unattended. It contains little or no violence, no strong \nlanguage and little or no sexual dialogue or situations.\n\n\n                                 TV-PG\n\n  Parental Guidance Suggested. This program may contain some material \nthat some parents would find unsuitable for younger children. Many \nparents may want to watch it with their younger children. The theme \nitself may\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\ncall for parental guidance. The program may contain infrequent coarse \nlanguage, limited violence, some suggestive sexual dialogue and \nsituations.\n\n\n                                 TV-14\n\n  Parents Strongly Cautioned. This program may contain some material \nthat many parents would find unsuitable for children under 14 years of \nage. Parents are strongly urged to exercise greater care in monitoring \nthis program and are cautioned against letting children under the age \nof 14 watch unattended. This program may contain sophisticated themes, \nsexual content, strong language, and more intense violence.\n\n\n                                  TV-M\n\n  Mature Audience Only. This program is specially designed to be viewed \nby adults and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17. This \nprogram may contain mature themes, profane language, graphic violence, \nand explicit sexual content.\n  I ask my colleagues, how will parents be able to block out a specific \nviolent program based on this system?\n  There are several problems with this approach.\n  The 1996 Act envisioned that the ratings system, and consequently, \nthe encoded programming, would allow parents to block specific \nprogramming content they found objectionable. Under the proposed age-\nbased ratings system, parents are unable to block specific violent \nprogramming. The proposed age-based ratings place the entertainment \nindustry in the position of making the judgment about program \nsuitability--not the parent. Moreover, one of the biggest problems with \nthe proposed age-based ratings system is that it intermingles three \ntypes of programming content: violence, sexual material, and adult \nlanguage. Thus it prevents parents from gaining any specific \ninformation about whether or not a show actually contains any violent \ndepictions.\n  The National PTA, the American Medical Association [AMA], the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics [AAPA], the National Education \nAssociation [NEA], Children Now, the American Psychological Association \n[APA], the Coalition for America's Children, the Children's Defense \nFund, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry [AACAP], \nthe Family Research Council, the Foundation to Improve Television, and \nthe Center for Media Education all have criticized the age-based \nratings systems. Instead, they advocate ratings based on specific \nprogram content. These groups have criticized the proposed age-based \nratings as too vague and broad for parents to decide what is right for \ntheir child to watch in their own home. In addition, the groups state \nthat the ratings raise more questions than they answer.\n  The AACAP was particularly critical of the ratings system, stating \nthat:\n\n       Programs portraying graphic and realistically appearing \n     violence, sex, horror, adult language, and illegal behavior \n     without social consequences increase the risk of dangerous \n     behaviors and aberrant emotional and intellectual development \n     by children and adolescents. . . . An age-based system, such \n     as the one now being proposed, carries the risk of missing \n     significant developmental variations in young people.\n\n  The V-chip legislation was intended to empower parents with the \nability to block out objectionable content-specific programming. The \nratings system does not accomplish this objective. To correct this, I \nhave decided to reintroduce my safe harbor legislation with the \naddition of a new provision. The new version requires confining the \ndistribution of violent programming to hours of the day when children \nare not likely to comprise a substantial portion of the audience unless \nthe broadcasters adopt a content-specific ratings system that allows \nparents to block out violent programming. If the industry continues to \ninsist upon the age-based ratings, then my safe harbor would apply for \nviolent programming. It's a very simple proposition. Either the intent \nof the 1996 law is met and parents can block out objectionable content, \nor my safe harbor will ensure that violent programming is aired at \nhours later in the day to protect children from the harmful effects of \nviolent programming.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 363\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide legal standards and procedures for \nsuppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical devices; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n             THE BIOMATERIALS ACCESS ASSURANCE ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, together with \nSenator McCain and a number of other Senators from both sides of the \naisle, the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1997. This bipartisan \nbill responds to a looming crisis affecting more than 7 million \npatients annually who rely on implantable life-saving or life-enhancing \nmedical devices such as pacemakers, heart valves, artificial blood \nvessels, hydrocephalic shunts, and hip and knee joints. These patients \nare at risk of losing access to the devices on which their lives and \nwell-being depend because, as a result of actual and potential \nskyrocketing legal costs, the companies that supply the raw materials \nwithout which those devices cannot be made are simply refusing to sell \ntheir raw materials to device manufacturers. If we do not act soon, \nmakers of the life-saving medical devices that we take for granted \ntoday may no longer able to buy the raw materials and components \nnecessary to produce their products, and the public health may be \nseriously jeopardized. By taking the small step Senator McCain and I \npropose today, millions of Americans will no longer have to worry about \nlosing access to the life-saving medical devices on which they depend.\n  The reason for this impending crisis is an all too common one: an \nout-of-control product liability system. During hearings I held in \n1994, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulation and Government \nInformation, and again during hearings held by the Commerce Committee \nlast Congress, we heard the same story from witness after witness. They \nall explained that the current legal system makes it too easy to bring \nlawsuits against raw materials suppliers and too expensive for those \nsuppliers to defend themselves--even when the suppliers are not at \nfault and end up winning, as they virtually always do. According to one \nstudy, only three out of hundreds of liability cases brought against a \nraw material supplier led to a finding of wrongdoing against the \nsupplier. Nevertheless, in all of those cases, the suppliers had to \nspend enormous amounts of money to defend themselves--often much more \nthan the supplier ever profited from its sale of the raw materials. \nMany suppliers consequently have made the entirely rational decision \nthat the costs of defending these lawsuits are just too high to justify \nselling raw materials to the makers of implantable medical devices. In \nshort, for those suppliers, it just isn't worth it.\n  How could this happen? A study by Aranoff Associates paints a clear, \nbut dismal, picture. That study surveyed the markets for polyester \nyarn, resins such as DuPont's Teflon, and polyacetal resin such as \nDuPont's Delrin. The study showed that sales of these raw materials for \nuse in manufacturing implantable medical devices was just a tiny \npercentage of the overall market--$606,000 out of total sales of over \n$11 billion, or just 0.006 percent. In return for that extra $606,000 \nin total annual sales, however, that raw material supplier, like \nothers, faced potentially huge liability related costs, even if they \nnever lost a lawsuit.\n  To take one example, a company named Vitek manufactured an estimated \n26,000 jaw implants using about 5-cents worth of DuPont Teflon in each \ndevice. The device was developed, designed, and marketed by Vitek, \nwhich was not related to DuPont. When those implants failed, Vitek \ndeclared bankruptcy, its founder fled to Switzerland, and the patients \nsued DuPont. DuPont has won virtually all these cases, but the cost has \nbeen staggering. The study estimated that DuPont spent at least $8 \nmillion per year over 6 years to defend these suits. To put this into \nperspective, DuPont's estimated legal expenses in these cases for just \n1 year would have bought over a 13-year supply of DuPont's Dacron \npolyester, Teflon, and Delrin for all U.S. makers of implantable \nmedical devices, not just makers of jaw implants. Faced with this \noverwhelming liability, DuPont decided to stop selling its products to \nmanufacturers of permanently implanted medical devices.\n  One supplier's decision alone might not be troublesome, but it is not \njust one supplier that has reached that decision. When I rose during \nthe debate over the product liability bill last year, I put in the \nrecord the names of twelve suppliers who had withdrawn from the \nbiomaterials market. Since then, I have learned that at least two more \nsuppliers have done the same. There is no reason to believe that the \neconomics will be different for other suppliers around the world. One \nof the witnesses at our 1994 hearing testified that she contacted 15 \nalternate suppliers of polyester yarn worldwide. All were interested in \nselling her raw materials--except for use in products made and used in \nthe United States. By itself, this is a powerful statement about the \nnature of our American product liability laws, and it makes a powerful \ncase for reform.\n  What's at stake here, let me be clear, is not protecting suppliers \nfrom liability and not even just making raw materials available to the \nmanufacturers of medical devices. What's at stake is the health of \nmillions of Americans who depend on medical devices for their everyday \nsurvival. What's at stake is the health of children like Thomas Reilly \nfrom Houston, TX, who suffers from hydrocephalus, a condition in which \nfluid accumulates around the brain. A special shunt enables him to \nsurvive. But continued production of that shunt is in doubt because the \nraw materials' suppliers are concerned about the potential lawsuit \ncosts. At our hearing in 1994, Thomas' father, Mark Reilly, pleaded for \nCongress to move forward quickly to assure that the supply of those \nshunts will continue.\n  What's at stake is the health of adults like Peggy Phillips of Falls \nChurch, VA, whose heart had twice stopped beating because of \nfibrillation. Today, she lives an active, normal life because she has \nan implanted automatic defibrillator. Again, critical components of the \ndefibrillator may no longer be available because of potential product \nliability costs. Ms. Phillips urged Congress to move swiftly to enact \nlegislation protecting raw materials and component part suppliers from \nproduct liability.\n  The scope of this problem affects young and old alike. Take a \npacemaker. Pacemakers are installed in patients whose hearts no longer \ngenerate enough of an electrical pulse to get the heart to beat. To \nkeep the heart beating, a pacemaker is connected to the heart with \nwires. These wires have silicone rubber insulation. Unfortunately, the \nsuppliers of the rubber have begun to withdraw from the market. With \nthis pacemaker, thousands of Americans can live productive and healthy \nlives for decades.\n\n  Take another example, a heart valve. Around the edge of a heart valve \nis a sleeve of polyester fabric. This fabric is what the surgeon sews \nthrough when he or she installs this valve. Without that sleeve, it \nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to install the valve. Without \nthat valve, patients die prematurely.\n  In short, this developing product liability crisis will have \nwidespread and serious effects. We cannot simply allow the over 7 \nmillion people who owe their health to medical devices to become \ncasualties of an outmoded legal liability system. Because product \nliability litigation costs make the economics of supplying raw \nmaterials to the implantable medical device makers very unfavorable, it \nis imperative that we act now. We cannot rationally expect raw \nmaterials suppliers to continue to serve the medical device market out \nof the goodness of their hearts, notwithstanding the liability related \ncosts. We need to reform our product liability laws, to give raw \nmaterial suppliers some assurance that unless there is real evidence \nthat they were responsible for putting a defective device on the \nmarket, they cannot be sued simply in the hope that their deep pockets \nwill fund legal settlements.\n  I have long believed that liability reform could be both proconsumer \nand probusiness. I believe the testimony we heard on this subject \nduring the past two Congresses proved this once again. When fear of \nliability suits and litigation costs drives valuable, lifesaving \nproducts off the market because their makers cannot get raw materials, \nconsumers are the ones to suffer. When\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\ncompanies divert money from developing new lifesaving products to \nreplace old sources of raw materials supplies, consumers are again the \nones to suffer. When one company must spend millions just to defend \nitself in lawsuits over a product it did not even design or make--for \nwhich it simply provided a raw material worth 5 cents--it is the \nconsumer that suffers the most.\n  Based on the testimony we heard in 1994, I, along with my \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona, committed to forging a solution \nto remedy this immediate threat to our national public health. That \nyear, and again in the 104th Congress, we introduced the Biomaterials \nAccess Assurance Act, which we reintroduce again today. This bill will \nestablish clear national rules to govern suits against suppliers of raw \nmaterials and component parts for permanently implantable medical \ndevices. Under this bill, a supplier of raw materials or component \nparts could be sued only if the materials they supplied do not meet \ncontractual specifications, or if they properly can be classified as a \nmanufacturer or seller of the whole product. They could not, however, \nbe sued for deficiencies in the design of the final device, the testing \nof that device, or for inadequate warnings with respect to that device.\n\n  Our colleagues recognized the need for that bill last year, and so \npassed it as part of the 104th Congress' product liability reform bill. \nUnfortunately, President Clinton vetoed that bill, but in his message \nto Congress, he made clear that he viewed the biomaterials provision \nportion of it as, in his words, ``a laudable attempt to ensure the \nsupply of materials needed to make life-saving medical devices.'' We \nhope that he continues to see the provision in that light.\n  I believe that enactment of this bill would help ensure that \nAmerica's patients continue to have access to the best lifesaving \nmedical devices in the world. We must act now, however. This piece of \nlegislation is preventative medicine at its best and is just the cure \nthe patients need.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 364\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access \n     Assurance Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

APPLICABILITY.\n\n       This Act shall apply to all civil actions covered under \n     this Act that are commenced on or after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, including any such action with respect to which \n     the harm asserted in the action or the conduct that caused \n     the harm occurred before the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Lieberman and I are here to \nannounce the introduction of bipartisan legislation to address a health \ncare crisis facing over 7 million Americans who each year receive life-\nsaving or life-enhancing medical implants. The availability of these \nimplants is jeopardized because the suppliers of raw materials used in \nthe implants can no longer afford to expose themselves to the \nridiculous and unjust litigation costs that can result from doing \nbusiness with implant makers.\n  The problem is that, in the quest for a deep pocket, biomaterials \nsuppliers are roped into product liability lawsuits concerning the \nimplant even though those suppliers are not involved in the design, \nsale or manufacture of the implant. Biomaterials suppliers just provide \nraw materials used in the production of vital medical devices such as \nbrain shunts, pacemakers, and artificial joints.\n  In virtually every case, biomaterials suppliers are not found liable \nin these lawsuits. Unfortunately, the massive cost of defending these \nlawsuits often overwhelms the relatively small\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\namount of revenue biomaterials suppliers receive through the sale of \ntheir product to implant makers. As one might expect, biomaterials \nsuppliers are deciding they cannot risk financial ruin to supply \nbiomaterials.\n  This bill, the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1997, shields \nbiomaterials suppliers from the crushing costs of unwarranted \nlitigation. The bill simply permits suppliers of biomaterials to be \nquickly dismissed from a lawsuit if they did not manufacture or sell \nthe implant and if they met the contract specifications for the \nbiomaterial. This bill will not prohibit someone who has been injured \nfrom filing a lawsuit and recovering damages.\n  This legislation is critically important to saving lives. In 1995, \nTara Ransom, a young girl from Arizona, wrote me a letter indicating \nher concern that she would die because a new brain shunt would not be \navailable for her. Tara has a life-threatening condition called \nhydrocephalus where excess fluid builds up on the brain. Without a \nsilicone-based brain shunt to drain the fluid build-up, the pressure \nwould likely kill Tara.\n  The supplier of the silicone for Tara's brain shunt has indicated \nthey must withdraw from the biomaterials market due to the risk of \nunwarranted litigation. Thirteen other companies have also indicated \nthey will no longer supply biomaterials due to concerns about \nunwarranted litigation.\n  We cannot let this insanity continue. Lives are at stake, and we have \na moral duty to Tara and the thousands of others whose lives are at \nstake to pass this litigation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my \ncolleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman, in supporting \nbiomaterials access assurance legislation to confront a looming health \ncare crisis in our country.\n  This legislation is of vital importance to the 8 million Americans \nwho require life-saving and life-enhancing implantable medical devices. \nMost of us have a family member or friend who has benefitted from these \nwondrous products. The availability of the biomaterials necessary for \nmedical device production is critical to the health of millions of \nAmericans. The ramifications of unavailability are severe and, in the \nend, it is those in need of the devices who will suffer the most.\n  This bill helps to curtail the impending health crisis by encouraging \nsuppliers of raw materials and component parts to re-enter the medical \nimplant market. Under the bill's provisions, a supplier of raw \nmaterials and/or component parts cannot be sued for design or \nmanufacturing deficiencies of the final product unless the supplier can \nproperly be classified as the designer, manufacturer or seller of the \nproduct as a whole.\n  In recent years, and due in no small part to the prospect of \nderivative participation in broad-based lawsuits, major biomaterial \nsuppliers have expressed their intent to limit or cease their shipments \nto manufacturers in the medical implant device market. Often, such a \nsupplier has minimal or no knowledge or control of the design, \nmanufacture or sale of an implant device. Nonetheless, under current \nproduct liability law, such a supplier can be named as a defendant in a \nproduct liability lawsuit based on the design, manufacture and sale of \nthe device itself. And, although suppliers have been found not liable \nin the overwhelming number of such lawsuits, they must give great \nconsideration to potential damage verdicts and the oppressive financial \nburden of lawsuit defense costs before deciding to supply manufacturers \nwith raw materials and component parts.\n\n  The detrimental effects of the biomaterials shortage are beginning to \ntake their toll.\n  Although the United States has been a leader in the medical implant \nfield, that may change as our ability to focus on new technologies and \nto contribute funds to research and development is impaired by the \ndiversion of available resources now directed to the search for and \nqualification of alternative biomaterials suppliers.\n  As medical device manufacturers find it increasingly difficult to \nobtain needed raw materials and component parts, the industry's \nresearch and development resources, otherwise devoted to improving \nexisting health care technologies, are drained and redirected to ensure \nmaterial availability to meet current production demand. In some \ninstances, no alternative sources for materials are found to exist.\n  Just as many suppliers cannot afford the risk of liability suits, \nmany manufacturers cannot afford the terms of indemnification contracts \nrequired by suppliers. Consider the case of Baxter Healthcare Corp., \nwhich operates a manufacturing plant in Cleveland, MS, employing \napproximately 1,000 people. A major manufacturer of life-saving and \nlife-enhancing implantable medical devices such as heart valves, sewing \nrings, and left ventricular assist devices, Baxter is highly dependent \nupon medical-grade biomaterials for production.\n  In facing a future based upon operation within this shortage \nscenario, Baxter is now diverting millions of dollars from research and \ndevelopment to fund its quest for finding alternative materials. Like \nmanufacturers in other parts of the country, Baxter is dealing with \nsuppliers that are faced with product liability risks that far exceed \nthe benefit gained in dealing with a medical device manufacturer.\n  For example, Baxter needed to purchase resin--less than 10 pounds a \nyear--with a cost on the open market of less than $3 per pound. The \nsupplier required an iron-clad indemnification contract before the \nmaterials could be sold to Baxter, and also demanded an annual fee of \nnearly $100,000 over and above normal material costs for continued use \nof the material--in other words, a surcharge for the risk associated \nwith potential liability.\n  This drain on manufacturers, as well as the uncertainty of obtaining \nany materials for the manufacture of their products, is directly \nattributable to the biomaterials shortage.\n  Mr. President, the stability of the manufacturing process is in \nconstant peril, and patients' lives hang in the balance. Let's act to \nlimit liability to instances of genuine fault, and not encourage more \nfrivolous lawsuits where they are, in fact, so often detrimental to \nconsumer interests.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will recognize the seriousness of the \nbiomaterials shortage and that we will support this effort to encourage \nsuppliers to re-enter the medical device market and to ensure that \npatients have available these critical, often life-saving options.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to articulate the \nurgency and criticality of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL:\n  S. 365.

Res. 17. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to prohibit retroactive increases in \ntaxes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                         TAX REFORM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to offer a tax reform \npackage to provide greater tax fairness and to protect citizens from \nInternal Revenue Service--IRS--abuses. This package includes three \ninitiatives: a constitutional amendment called the retroactive tax ban \namendment, a bill to establish a new budget point of order against \nretroactive taxation, and the Internal Revenue Service Accountability \nAct.\n  The first, the retroactive tax ban amendment, is a constitutional \namendment to prevent the Federal Government from imposing any tax \nincrease\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\nretroactively. The amendment states simply ``No Federal tax shall be \nimposed for the period before the date of enactment.'' We have heard \ndirectly from the taxpayers, and looking backward for extra taxes is \nunacceptable. It is not a fair way to deal with taxpayers.\n  In addition, I am introducing a bill that would create a point of \norder under the Budget Act against retroactive tax increases. Because \namending the Constitution can be a very long prospect--just look at the \ndecades-long effort on behalf of the balanced budget amendment--I \nbelieve this legislation is necessary to provide needed protection for \nAmerican families from the destabilizing effects of retroactive \ntaxation.\n  It was clear to Thomas Jefferson that the only way to preserve \nfreedom was to protect its citizens from oppressive taxation. Even the \nRussian Constitution does not allow you to tax retroactively. \nRetroactive taxation is wrong, and it is morally incorrect.\n  Families and businesses and communities must know what the rules of \nthe road are and that those rules will not change. They have to be able \nto plan their lives, plan their families, and plan their tax burdens in \nadvance. They cannot come to the end of a year and have a Congress of \nthe United States and a President come forward and say, ``All your \nplanning was for naught, and we don't care.''\n  Mr. President, my third proposal is the Internal Revenue Service \nAccountability Act. It is wide-ranging and deals with a number of \nfaults within the IRS that I have become aware through my constituent \nservices work and through discussions with everyday Americans. Whenever \nI travel through my State, or across the Nation for that matter, \nconcerns inevitably are raised about the IRS. This agency seems to \nbelieve the vast majority of American taxpayers are looking to cheat \nthe Government. Instead, I believe American taxpayers are honest and \nhardworking, and they deserve to be treated accordingly.\n  Our Nation suffers under an unfair and incomprehensible tax code that \ntakes far too much of what we earn. Even worse, the organization \nresponsible for enforcement of the tax code--the IRS--often seeks to \nintimidate and frighten honest citizens. We cannot tolerate a Tax Code \nthat punishes families, and we cannot tolerate an IRS eager to bully \nand harass taxpayers.\n\n  Let me briefly outline my proposal. First, the IRS Accountability Act \nwould make agents of the IRS responsible for their actions. My \nlegislation would make it a crime for an agent to use extortion-like \ntactics when collecting a tax. Agents must know there are real \nconsequences for their actions. When they abuse their authority by \nmaliciously and willfully disregarding the statutory procedures \nestablished for collecting taxes from honest taxpayers, they must be \nheld accountable.\n  In addition, this legislation would lift the current shield \nprotecting IRS agents from holding any personal liability for their \nactions in the course of collecting a tax. I was surprised to learn \nthat this shield remains in place even when their abusive actions \nresult in judgments against the United States for hundreds of thousands \nof dollars. How ironic that American taxpayers end up footing the bill \nfor the abuses they suffer. My legislation would end this intolerable \narrangement.\n  My legislation also protects the privacy of taxpayers. A few years \nback, I was shocked to learn that nearly 370 employees of the Atlanta \nIRS office were caught accessing the tax returns and return information \nof friends, neighbors, and celebrities without proper authorization. \nThey were file snooping. The IRS Accountability Act would make this \nactivity a crime and allows the offender to be held personally liable.\n  Further, my legislation requires notification of any taxpayer who \nsuffers this abuse. Unfortunately, what should seem to be a simple \nmatter of decency must be required of the IRS. In response to \nsuggestions taxpayers be notified when their privacy has been invaded \nby file snoopers, IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson stated, ``I'm \nnot sure there would be serious value to that in terms of protecting \nthe taxpayers' rights.'' With all respect, such sentiment is typical of \na Washington status quo mentality that is out-of-touch with the rest of \nAmerica.\n  Recent reports in the press suggesting the IRS has been conducting \naudits for political reasons, add weight to the need for limitations on \nthis activity. The IRS Accountability Act requires that all audits be \nreasonably justified. It also prohibits random audits and reauditing of \nreturns or issues of a return unless approved by court order in the \ncourse of a criminal investigation. Further, the IRS will be limited \nexplicitly to 3 years from the time a return is filed in which to \nconduct an audit unless approved by court order in the course of a \ncriminal investigation.\n  The IRS Accountability Act also would extend the time responsible \ntaxpayers have to pay a tax without suffering a penalty. I could not \nsay how often I hear complaints about the inaccessibility of the IRS. \nTime and time again, taxpayers cannot get answers from the IRS or even \nspeak with a customer service agent.\n\n  According to the IRS Taxpayer Advocate's recent report, one of the \nmost common complaints against the IRS is its failure to acknowledge \ntaxpayer correspondence.\n  The IRS's only responses seems to be more threats and higher \npenalties. The IRS Accountability Act will help taxpayers by offering \nsome needed relief.\n  This legislation also preserves the integrity of judicial decisions \nagainst the IRS. This section grants a Federal court the authority to \ndismiss a case of controversy involving the IRS if it is shown that a \nsimilar or identical case already has been decided within the court's \njurisdiction or circuit. The IRS places itself above our Federal \njudiciary and will choose to disregard a court decision in subsequent \ncases when it believes the court's decision is in error. This arrogance \nmust be held in check.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would place limits I believe are \nneeded on the IRS when it seizes or levies assets. How many times have \nwe heard press reports that a child's earnings from a paper route has \nbeen seized or that a child's pennies have been taken to pay the tax \nbill of a relative.\n  In Georgia, I recently learned of an instance where the care and \nhealth of an elderly nursing home patient was jeopardized by the IRS \nwhen it seized her account to pay the tax bill of a relative. Even \nthough it was well documented that the account contained only her \nSocial Security benefits and were used to pay for her care, the IRS \nrefused to relent until my office interceded. In addition, we have \nheard numerous examples where assets have been taken erroneously. My \nlegislation would ensure that all levies and seizures are proper under \nthe law and are warranted by requiring the IRS to obtain prior court \napproval.\n  My legislation also places what I believe are reasonable limits on \nthe accrual of interest and penalties. Specifically, it would decouple \nthe two, preventing interest from accruing on the penalty portion of an \nunpaid tax bill.\n  Keep in mind the IRS' track record on responding to taxpayers. \nAccording to the IRS Taxpayer Advocate, it isn't good. Now add the \nfollowing to the mix: interest on the unpaid tax, penalties on the \nunpaid tax, and interest on the penalty on the unpaid tax. If a \nhardworking taxpayer is unfortunate enough to run afoul of the IRS, \nbefore he or she knows it, the tax bill has doubled, even tripled. For \ntoo many taxpayers, when they become aware a problem exists, their bill \nhas turned into a burden they cannot hope to pay.\n  Further, this legislation would equalize the interest rates charged \nby the IRS and against the IRS. Current law gives the IRS an advantage \nin interest charges over taxpayers. I believe this is predicated on the \nassumption that the Federal Government is more entitled to a taxpayer's \nincome than the taxpayer. Nothing should be farther from the truth. \nRequiring equal rates to be charged will provide equity and bring to a \nclose another instance where Washington thinks it knows best with what \nto do with families' income.\n  Finally, the IRS Accountability Act provides fairness in cases of \nmathematical and clerical errors. For honest mistakes, the taxpayer \nshould have an opportunity to correct it without getting slapped by a \ntax bill full of interest and penalty charges. Under my legislation, a \ntaxpayer would have a 60-day grace period after notification in which \nto pay the unpaid tax or to file\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\nan abatement request without incurring penalty or interest charges. \nHowever, should the 60-day period elapse without the taxpayer selecting \neither option, penalties and interest would be owed in full.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me say what I have stated many times \nbefore on the floor of the Senate. American families already send 55 \npercent of their income to government in the form of taxes and other \ncosts. Out of the remaining 45 percent, we expect them to clothe, feed, \nhouse, educate, and otherwise raise America.\n  We also know that if things do not change, future generations will \nface a lifetime tax rate of 84 percent. Already, families are bullied \nand harassed by an agency eager to intimidate. How much farther would \nthe IRS be willing to go to collect an 84 percent tax burden? The time \nhas come to bring reason to the IRS. I invite my colleagues to join me \nin this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 367. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nallow leave to address domestic violence and its effects, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               battered women's employment protection act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, while we have begun to make important \nprogress toward seriously addressing the devastating physical and \nemotional effects of domestic violence, little attention has been paid \nto the severe economic consequences of domestic abuse. The Battered \nWomen's Employment Protection Act, which I am introducing today, will \nensure eligibility for unemployment compensation to women who are \nseparated from their jobs as a direct result of domestic violence. \nSeveral new studies illustrate the need for the legislation I am \nintroducing today. The evidence is irrefutable, domestic violence \ndramatically affects women's ability to work and support themselves and \ntheir children.\n  According to New York City's Victims Service, one-quarter of battered \nwomen recently surveyed who have survived abuse had lost their jobs due \nto the effects of domestic violence.\n  Abusive husbands and partners harass 74 percent of employed battered \nwomen at work, either by showing up at the workplace or calling them at \nwork. It is not unusual for women in abusive relationships to be late \nfor work at least 5 times a month, to leave early at least 5 times a \nmonth, and to miss at least 3 full days of work a month--National Work-\nplace Resource Center on Domestic Violence.\n  There have been cases brought to my attention in my home State of \nMinnesota where the women trying to escape abusive relationships could \nhave benefited from this legislation, and we know that, sadly, there \nare many more such stories throughout the country.\n  On February 12, 1997, a woman came into the Women's Rural Advocacy \nProgram in Marshall, MN, after her partner had emotionally, verbally, \nand physically assaulted her. After many years of fighting, her abuser \nfinally let her get a drivers license and a car. His motivation for \nallowing her to do this was that she could get a job, resulting in more \nmoney for himself. Three months into her job, her partner assaulted her \nand she was in need of safe housing and constant protection. Because of \nthe fear of her abuser finding her and her child, it was not safe for \nher to take their child to daycare, so she was unable to get to work. \nSeeing that this was a new job, she did not have any vacation days she \ncould use.\n  Her abuser soon found out where she was located. She panicked and \ntook her child and left the shelter, presumably the city, her friends, \nand her job. The shelter advocate we spoke to had no idea where she \nwent, but was sure she had no money, very little clothes, and no car.\n  A woman, known as Sarah, is a 34-year-old college educated mother of \n5 children, all under the age of 12. Sarah and her husband of 15 years \nhad a successful market research company. Their combined salaries \ntotaled over $225,000. The husband was the president of the company, \nSarah the vice president. They were equal share holders in the company \nuntil Sarah came in contact with law enforcement and the Lewis House \nShelter due to her hospitalization for extensive injuries suffered at \nthe hands of her abusive husband.\n  Sarah admits that the abuse has gone on for years. She filed for an \norder of protection, filed assault charges, and filed for divorce. Her \nhusband then fired Sarah from the company they started. Her lawyer \ntells Sarah that she can sue for her position to be reinstated in the \ncompany. Sarah knows she is not safe and that nothing can protect her \nor her children from the repeated pattern of abuse. She is faced with \nthe loss of her position, her income, legal fees, medical bills, as \nwell as the foundation of her children's lives.\n  It took Sarah 6 months to find a full-time position. She has \nsupported herself by using credit cards she maintained in her own name. \nShe begins her new life with $30,000 of new debt. Her batterer \nmaintains his company today, with no loss of position and an increase \nin income.\n  For women attempting to escape a violent environment, this \nlegislation can be a lifeline.\n  There has been great progress in the last few years in societal and \nlegislative response to violence within the home. One area that has not \nbeen sufficiently addressed, in my opinion, is the economic cost of \ndomestic abuse.\n  The Bureau of National Affairs recently estimated that domestic \nviolence costs employers between 3 and 5 billion dollars per year. \nDomestic violence results in lower productivity, greater absenteeism, \nand increased health costs.\n  The National Institute for Justice estimates that from 1987 to 1990, \ndomestic violence cost Americans $67 billion a year.\n  According to annual estimates for reported domestic violence \ninjuries, family violence exacts a significant economic toll on the \nwell-being of the family, and the United States.\n  Forty-four million, three hundred ninety-three thousand, seven \nhundred dollars total annual medical costs, 21,000 hospitalizations, \n28,700 emergency room visits, and 175,000 days lost from work.\n  In addition--50 to 80 percent of women on AFDC are victims or past \nvictims of domestic violence (Taylor Institute Study, 1996). One year \nafter divorce, women's incomes average only 67 percent of their pre-\ndivorce incomes compared to 90 percent for men (Report of the American \nPsychological Association Presidential Task Force on Violence and the \nFamily, 1996).\n  The Battered Women's Employment Protection Act will help women retain \nemployment and financial independence by ensuring that employed victims \nof domestic violence can have time off from work to make necessary \ncourt appearances, seek legal assistance, and get help with safety \nplanning, without penalty from the employer.\n  This bill enables employees to use their family, medical, sick, and \nother leave in order to deal with circumstances arising from domestic \nabuse.\n\n  Circumstances that would allow an employee to take leave include \ngoing to the doctor for injuries caused by domestic violence, seeking \nlegal remedies such as going to court, seeking orders of protection, or \nmeeting with a lawyer.\n  Current Federal and State laws fail to address the negative economic \nconsequences domestic violence can cause. Today, battered women are not \nexpressly allowed to take leave from work to address the consequences \nof family violence--both the physical and legal effects. This bill will \nhelp women to escape abusive situations by helping them retain \nemployment and financial independence. And, by requiring employers to \nprovide leave to employees for the purpose of dealing with domestic \nviolence and its aftermath--it does not increase costs to employers, it \npermits employees to use their existing leave to deal with domestic \nviolence.\n  Furthermore, to ensure that battered women can retain the \nindependence necessary to leave their abusers without having to rely on \nwelfare, the bill requires that States provide unemployment benefits to \nwomen who are forced to leave work as a result of domestic abuse. The \nbill ensures eligibility for unemployment compensation to women who are \nseparated from their jobs as a direct result of domestic violence. For \nexample, victims of abuse could not be denied unemployment if they were \nforced to leave their jobs because they had to relocate for safety\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\nreasons. Similarly, a woman would be eligible for unemployment \ncompensation if she was fired from her job because she repeatedly \nshowed up late for work with physical signs of abuse or was excessively \nabsent from work as a result of abuse. In addition, the bill provides \nfor specialized training of personnel in assessing unemployment \ncompensation claims based on domestic violence.\n  All of us here today are committed to doing what we can to help \nbattered women and their children escape domestic violence. I urge my \ncolleagues to join in this effort by cosponsoring the Battered Women's \nEmployment Protection Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 367\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Battered \n     Women's Employment Protection Act ''.\n       (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal \n     is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of the Family and \n     Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) violence against women is the leading cause of physical \n     injury to women, and the Department of Justice estimates that \n     intimate partners commit more than 1,000,000 violent crimes \n     against women every year;\n       (2) approximately 95 percent of the victims of domestic \n     violence are women;\n       (3) in the United States, a woman is more likely to be \n     assaulted, injured, raped, or killed by a male partner than \n     by any other type of assailant;\n       (4) the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that women will \n     account for two-thirds of all new entrants into the workforce \n     between now and the year 2000;\n       (5) violence against women dramatically affects women's \n     workforce participation, insofar as one-quarter of the \n     battered women surveyed had lost a job due at least in part \n     to the effects of domestic violence, and over one-half had \n     been harassed by their abuser at work;\n       (6) a study by Domestic Violence Intervention Services, Inc \n     found that 96 percent of employed domestic violence victims \n     had some type of problem in the workplace as a direct result \n     of their abuse or abuser;\n       (7) the availability of economic support is a critical \n     factor in a women's ability to leave abusive situations that \n     threaten them and their children, and over one-half of the \n     battered women surveyed stayed with their batterers because \n     they lacked resources to support themselves and their \n     children;\n       (8) a report by the New York City Victims Services Agency \n     found that abusive spouses and lovers harass 74 percent of \n     battered women at work, 54 percent of battering victims miss \n     at least 3 days of work per month, 56 percent are late for \n     work at least 5 times per month, and a University of \n     Minnesota study found that 24 percent of women in support \n     groups for battered women had lost a job partly because of \n     being abused;\n       (9) a survey of State unemployment insurance agency \n     directors by the Federal Advisory Council on Unemployment \n     Compensation found that in 31 States battered women who leave \n     work as a result of domestic violence do not qualify for \n     unemployment benefits, in 9 States the determination often \n     varies depending on the facts and circumstances, and in only \n     13 States are they usually considered qualified for \n     unemployment benefits;\n       (10) a study by the New York State Department of Labor \n     found that, when filing for unemployment insurance benefits, \n     domestic violence victims frequently hide their victimization \n     and do not disclose the domestic violence as a reason for \n     their problems with the job or need to separate from \n     employment;\n       (11) 49 percent of senior executives recently surveyed said \n     domestic violence has a harmful effect on their company's \n     productivity, 47 percent said domestic violence negatively \n     affects attendance, and 44 percent said domestic violence \n     increases health care costs, and the Bureau of National \n     Affairs estimates that domestic violence costs employers \n     between $3,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000 per year; and\n       (12) existing Federal and State legislation does not \n     expressly authorize battered women to take leave from work to \n     seek legal assistance and redress, counseling, or assistance \n     with safety planning and activities.\n       (b) Purposes.--Pursuant to the affirmative power of \n     Congress to enact this Act under section 5 of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment to the Constitution, as well as under clause 1 of \n     section 8 of Article I of the Constitution and clause 3 of \n     section 8 of Article I of the Constitution, the purposes of \n     this Act are--\n       (1) to promote the national interest in reducing domestic \n     violence by enabling victims of domestic violence to maintain \n     the financial independence necessary to leave abusive \n     situations, to achieve safety and minimize the physical and \n     emotional injuries from domestic violence, and to reduce the \n     devastating economic consequences of domestic violence to \n     employers and employees, by--\n       (A) providing unemployment insurance for victims of \n     domestic violence who are forced to leave their employment as \n     a result of domestic violence; and\n       (B) entitling employed victims of domestic violence to take \n     reasonable leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of \n     1993 (29 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) to seek medical help, legal \n     assistance, counseling, and safety planning and assistance \n     without penalty from their employer;\n       (2) to promote the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment by \n     protecting the civil and economic rights of victims of \n     domestic violence and by furthering the equal opportunity of \n     women to employment and economic self-sufficiency;\n       (3) to minimize the negative impact on interstate commerce \n     from dislocations of employees and harmful effects on \n     productivity, health care costs, and employer costs from \n     domestic violence; and\n       (4) to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) \n     , (2) and (3) in a manner that accommodates the legitimate \n     interests of employers.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) Unemployment compensation.--Section 3304(a) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (18);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (19) and \n     inserting ``;

Mr. President, today I am pleased to announce my \nsupport for S. 318, a bill introduced by the distinguished chairman of \nthe Senate Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato. This bill, the \nHomeowners Protection Act of 1997 will protect consumers across the \ncountry from paying millions of dollars in unnecessary private mortgage \ninsurance PMI premiums. This bill corrects a serious inequity faced by \nmany first-time, middle class homeowners, and I commend Senator D'Amato \nfor his thoughtful approach to this problem.\n  No one can argue that PMI has served a useful and admirable purpose \nby allowing middle class families a greater opportunity for home \nownership. Traditionally, mortgage lenders expect home buyers to make a \ndown payment of at least 20 percent. For credit-worthy borrowers who \nlack the cash to make such a large down payment, PMI enables them to \npurchase a home while protecting lenders from default until the \nborrower has built significant equity in the home. To that end, \nrequiring the purchase of PMI is good policy.\n  The problem arises when homeowners make several years of mortgage \npayments and reach the point where they have built up enough equity, \nusually 20 percent of the original value of the loan, to virtually \neliminate the risk of default. At that point, the need for continued \nPMI coverage disappears and borrowers should have the right to cancel \ntheir policies. Yet, according to many reports in the newspapers and on \nTV, many uninformed borrowers continue to pay unnecessary premiums \nwhich can cost additional hundreds or even thousands of dollars each \nyear. Others who have sought to cancel their coverage have faced \nunbelievable redtape and confusion.\n  Senator D'Amato's bill will eliminate these problems and make home \nownership more affordable and more attainable for all Americans. Under \nthis bill, homeowners will have the right to cancel PMI when they have \naccumulated 20 percent equity in their homes, the value generally \ndetermined to be sufficient to protect lenders from default. The bill \ntakes the reasonable step of allowing the Federal Reserve the ability \nto grant exceptions to this rule--either to protect consumer access to \ncredit or to protect lenders from economic factors which may create \nunique default\n\n[[Page S1684]]\n\nrisks. The bill also will require that notice be provided to homeowners \nat closing and at least once a year thereafter of their right to cancel \ntheir PMI coverage once they have reached the equity threshold.\n  I commend my good friend, the distinguished Senator from New York and \nI am pleased to be a cosponsor of this thoughtful bill. I hope that \nCongress will work hard this year to pass it, so that we correct this \nflaw in the system and provide middle class borrowers with a greater \nopportunity to own a home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1683-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SIDNEY W. DEAN\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Sidney W. Dean was a man devoted \nat once to the public and to the private. Before he passed away last \nmonth at the age of 91, he had worked for 41 years toward the cause of \ngood government in New York, while at the same time becoming one of the \ncity's strongest advocates of free speech and the right to privacy.\n  He will doubtless be remembered as longtime trustee, president, and \nchairman of the City Club of New York, but perhaps as much so as an \nadvocate of using the emerging technology of cable television as a way \nfor those who are poor and ignored to be seen--and heard.\n  Long before most others, he saw the potential power of television \npressing the city to require cable companies to provide public access \nchannels. He met with some success, though perhaps not exactly what he \nhad envisioned. Few things turn out that way.\n  His devotion to free speech was instilled in him by his father, a \nnewspaper editor. A member of the American Civil Liberties Union and \nAmericans for Democratic Action, he took up the cause, helping to keep \nNew York what it has always been: the center of the world of ideas and \nthe free exchange of information.\n  I ask that the full text of the New York Times obituary of February 3 \nbe included in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 3, 1997]\n\n      Sidney W. Dean Is Dead at 91; Served as Trustee of City Club\n\n                        (By David Cay Johnston)\n\n       Sidney W. Dean Jr., a longtime trustee of the City Club of \n     New York and a strong advocate of free speech who fought for \n     years to make cable television a positive force for the city, \n     died on Jan. 24 at his Greenwich Village apartment.\n       He was 91 and died after suffering a stroke, his wife, \n     Eugenia, said.\n       Mr. Dean was an advertising and marketing executive who in \n     1952 became a trustee of the City Club of New York, the \n     city's oldest good-government organization. For the next 41 \n     years he used his roles as trustee, president and chairman of \n     the City Club, as well as volunteer positions with the \n     American Civil Liberties Union and Americans for Democratic \n     Action, to argue for municipal policies favoring free speech.\n       ``He was on the forefront of telling us about the privacy \n     and First Amendment issues and teaching us about \n     communications and communications technologies,'' said Amy \n     Isacs, national president of Americans for Democratic Action.\n       In 1970, when cable television franchises were first being \n     proposed for New York City, Mr. Dean began pressing the city \n     to require numerous public access channels and to prevent \n     cable operators from having any financial interest in \n     programs or channels they carry.\n       ``So long as cable systems can control their content they \n     will attempt to deny market access to all other producers and \n     distributors of print and electronic communications,'' Mr. \n     Dean wrote in a 1973 letter to The New York Times. Such \n     issues persist today as Rupert Murdoch tries to get his new \n     24-hour news channel onto the cable system operated by Time \n     Warner, his rival in the news and entertainment business and \n     the owner of CNN.\n       Today Time Warner owns many of the channels on its system \n     and so does Cablevision, the other cable franchise holder in \n     the city.\n       In 1980 Mr. Dean criticized the city's process for awarding \n     cable television franchises as a ``blind man's bluff-\n     purchasing agent act'' in which the city was ``settling for \n     too little from the cable companies.'' He said that nothing \n     in the city's franchise award plans ``holds out any hope of \n     cable reaching out to the poor, ghettoized and handicapped.'' \n     Today, fewer than half the households in the city subscribe.\n       During the debates over awarding cable franchises, Mr. Dean \n     was once invited to a private meeting of city officials and \n     representatives of the franchise seekers, but declined. ``I \n     will never go into a backroom discussion,'' he told Sally \n     Goodgold, another City Club trustee.\n       Mr. Dean was the son of a Boston newspaper editor who \n     constantly preached the First Amendment's virtues to his son.\n       After graduating from Yale University in 1926, Mr. Dean \n     joined J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, and later \n     worked with other marketing companies.\n       During World War II, as an Army Air Force officer, he \n     analyzed photographs of bomb damage. He volunteered to fly on \n     some bombing runs because he felt it would make his analysis \n     more accurate, his friend Peter Stanford said.\n       Mr. Dean is survived by his wife and a son, Ronald Stowe, \n     who lives in the Philippines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1684-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF MINGO JOB CORPS\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, on Saturday, February 1, Wilcomb \nWashburn, a champion of unfashionable truths and a scholar in the \ntruest sense of the word, died here in Washington. He had retired as \ndirector of the Smithsonian's American Studies Program exactly a month \nbefore, on January 1, after almost 40 years at the institution. He was \n72 years old.\n  He remained dedicated, most especially, to the integrity of academic \nlife and to keeping the spirit of free inquiry from being compromised \nby politics. Perhaps more than anyone else, he recognized the grave \nthreat posed by the politicization of scholarly professional \nassociations.\n  Last year I had the honor to present him with the National \nAssociation of Scholars' Sidney Hook Award in recognition of his work. \nIn his acceptance speech, he quoted the sociologist James Coleman, the \nfirst recipient of the Hook Award: ``The greatest enemies of academic \nfreedom in the university are the norms that exist about what kinds of \nquestions may be raised in research.'' Coleman was nearly expelled from \nthe American Sociological Association for his findings on the effect of \nhome and neighborhood environment on learning. Wilcomb Washburn had a \nvision of the academy as a place that would live up to the ideal of the \nopen society in which no claims on truth are more privileged than \nothers. As he said in his acceptance speech that day ``let us hope that \nthose who have chosen to speak truth to power rather than power to \ntruth will prevail.''\n  Wilcomb Washburn was also a U.S. Marine, serving in both World War II \nand Korea. As both a scholar and a soldier, he combined the exacting \nrigor of the former with the tenacity of the latter to attack, often \nsinglehandedly, the bastions of irrationality.\n  We honor his life and mourn his passing.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the obituary from the Washington Post of \nFebruary 2 be printed in the Record.\n  The obiturary follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 2, 1997]\n\n              Wilcomb Washburn, Smithsonian Official, Dies\n\n       Wilcomb Edward Washburn, 72 a retired American studies \n     program director of the Smithsonian Institution, past \n     president of what is now the Historical Society of Washington \n     and teacher of history at three area universities, died of \n     prostate cancer Feb. 1 at his home in Washington. He also had \n     a home in Princess Anne, Md.\n       He came to Washington and joined the Smithsonian in 1958 as \n     acting curator of its political history division. From 1965 \n     to 1968, he was chairman of the American studies department \n     of the National Museum of History and Technology, now the \n     National Museum\n\n[[Page S1685]]\n\n     of American History. In 1968, he became the Smithsonian's \n     American studies program director, a post he held until \n     retiring on Jan. 1, 1997.\n       He was president of the Historical Society of Washington \n     from 1976 to 1980. He was a past national president of the \n     American Society for Ethnohistory, the American Studies \n     Association and the Society for the History of Discoveries. \n     He had been an advisory editor of ``Terrae Incognitae,'' the \n     annals of the Society of American Historians, and had served \n     on the commandant's advisory committee on Marine Corps \n     history.\n       Over the years, while working for the Smithsonian, he had \n     taught at the University of Maryland and at George Washington \n     and American universities.

He was a 1948 summa cum laude graduate of \n     Dartmouth College, where he also was elected to Phi Beta \n     kappa. He received his doctorate in the history of American \n     civilization from Harvard University.\n       He served with the Marine Corps as a Japanese language \n     officer in World War II and served on active duty again \n     during the Korean War.

ROBINSON\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nPennsylvania constituent and a very dedicated public servant from \nPhiladelphia, PA.\n  On January 11, George Robinson was honored upon his retirement from \nthe Philadelphia Fire Department. After graduating from the \nPhiladelphia Public School System, Mr. Robinson joined the department \non August 3, 1959. Since then, he has served the city of Philadelphia \nwith distinction for 37 years. Mr. Robinson rose through the department \nto the position of battalion chief, and he also served as acting deputy \nchief.\n  During his career, Mr. Robinson successfully completed ``Career \nDevelopment Three'' at the National Fire Academy, as well as related \ncourses at the Philadelphia Fire Academy. He has also received various \ncertificates of training from the city of Philadelphia Training Center.\n  As a battalion commander, Chief Robinson coordinated all aspects of \nfire alarm response. In addition to conducting preliminary \ninvestigations of fire causes, he inspected company personnel, fire \nstations, apparatus, equipment, records, reports, and safety hazards.\n  In 1992, Chief Robinson became the department's executive officer. \nDuring this time, he also served as the integrity officer, chaired the \ncritical incident debriefing team, and served on a steering committee \nto streamline the office of the inspector general. Moreover, Chief \nRobinson coordinated all transfer requests, assignments, and officer \nrotations.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring George \nRobinson for his distinguished service to the city of Philadelphia Fire \nDepartment with the following proclamation:\n\n                              PROCLAMATION\n\n       Whereas, George Robinson has served for thirty-seven years \n     as a member of the Philadelphia Fire Department, gained \n     promotions to the rank of Battalion Chief and served as \n     Acting Deputy Chief, and;\n       Whereas, George Robinson, has served as the Fire \n     Department's Executive Officer, Integrity Officer and head of \n     the Critical Incident Team; and\n       Whereas, George Robinson was honored upon his retirement \n     from the Philadelphia Fire Department at a testimonial dinner \n     on January 11, 1997;\n       Therefore, I, Senator Rick Santorum, offer my best wishes \n     on his retirement and honor his loyalty to the City of \n     Philadelphia and to the Philadelphia Fire Department; \n     acknowledge the respect he has gained from every level and \n     authority in the Department; and recognize the distinction he \n     has brought through his achievements to his community and \n     country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1685-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RETIREMENT OF CWO 0-5, HARRY FLOYD HINKLE, JR.\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly \nabout an American hero and an American patriot, CWO-05, Harry Floyd \nHinkle, Jr.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am presented \nalmost daily with young men and women who have dedicated their lives to \nthe service of their country in our Armed Forces. As I know my \ncolleagues agree, these men and women are truly America's finest. \nToday, it is an honor for me to present to the Senate an example of \nAmerica's best, Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle.\n  Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle will soon be retiring from the Marine \nCorps after 30 years of honor, patriotism and distinguished service. I \nhave not had the privilege of meeting CWO-05 Hinkle personally, \nhowever, a review of his record clearly demonstrates why it is \nappropriate for the Senate to honor him today.\n  CWO-05 Hinkle joined the Marine Corps on February 7, 1967. He spent 3 \nyears in Vietnam with the First Armored Amphibian Company, 11th Marine \nCorps Regiment. While serving in Vietnam he was awarded the Bronze Star \nwith Combat V.\n  Mr. President, for most men and women that service alone would have \nbeen more than above and beyond the call of duty, but not for Chief \nWarrant Officer-05 Hinkle. He returned from Vietnam where he was \nappointed warrant officer and later commissioned as an officer \neventually reaching the grade of captain. In 1990 when his country \ncalled upon him to once again serve in the face of great danger, Chief \nWarrant Officer-05 Hinkle responded. He served in Desert Storm and \nDesert Shield where he guided deployments to southwest Asia for \ninstalling and operating secondary imagery dissemination devices.\n  Mr. President, Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle has served as an \nenlisted marine, officer, and warrant officer. He has shown gallantry \non the battlefield and has been a model marine in the classroom. He \nserved heroically in the past and has helped make America's future \nsafer by training the marines, airmen, soldiers, and sailors of \ntomorrow. Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle's personal decorations \ninclude the Bronze Star with Combat V, the Meritorious Service Medal, \nthe Navy Commendation Medal, the Navy Achievement Medal with Combat V, \nthe Good Conduct Medal and the Combat Action Ribbon, the Kuwait \nLiberation Medal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal, and the Southeast \nAsia Service Medal.\n  Mr. President, after 30 years of service to his country, I believe \nthat America owes Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle a thank you, a heart-\nfelt God's speed, and a proud semper fi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1685-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1685-S1686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LAWRENCE A. FLEISCHMAN\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, though perhaps most Americans \noutside the world of art will not readily recognize the name of \nLawrence Fleischman, they will know his legacy. Before he died last \nweek at 71, his extraordinary contribution to the Nation's major \nmuseums ensured that his name will live on, along with the magnificent \nartistic treasures he and his family so generously donated.\n  As an art dealer, he was, by any measure, a success. But his \nrefreshingly modest attitude toward the worldly goods he accumulated \nbears repeating. Many of these were priceless antiquities from ancient \nGreece, Rome, and Etruria. If I may quote from the New York Times \nobituary:\n\n       ``No one owns a work of art,'' he said. ``You're the \n     custodian of it for the future. You take care of it, you have \n     the pleasure of living with it, and then you pass it on. It \n     is our hope that we leave it to the public.''\n\n  Here in Washington, he helped establish the Archives of American Art, \na wonderful research resource of the Smithsonian Institution. In New \nYork, the Lawrence A. and Barbara Fleischman Gallery of American Art \nwill stand as long as the Metropolitan Museum stands, as well as the \nthree other galleries the couple so thoughtfully supported. He has also \npromised the New York Public Library a substantial gift.\n  In short, Lawrence Fleischman was a philanthropist, a word with a \ndistinctly archaic ring to it. But in an age\n\n[[Page S1686]]\n\nof private wealth and public stringency, it is a word we need to hear \nmuch more often.\n  There being no objection, I ask that the full text of Carol Vogel's \nobituary from the February 4 New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 4, 1997]\n\n               Lawrence A. Fleischman, 71, an Art Dealer\n\n                            (By Carol Vogel)\n\n       Lawrence A. Fleischman, chairman and chief executive \n     officer of Kennedy Galleries in Manhattan, an authority on \n     American art from the 18th through 20th centuries and a major \n     collector of antiquities, died on Friday at his home in \n     London. He was 71 and also lived in Manhattan.\n       The cause was heart failure, said Lillian Brenwasser, vice \n     president of Kennedy Galleries.\n       Besides being an expert on American art, Mr. Fleischman was \n     known for his philanthropic activities. In June, he and his \n     wife, Barbara, gave a large portion of their antiquities \n     collection to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif. In \n     an arrangement whereby they donated most of the collection \n     and the Getty purchased the rest, the museum was able to add \n     about 300 objects, worth an estimated $80 billion, to its \n     collection.\n       The works, from ancient Greece, Rome and Etruria, dated \n     from 2800 B.C. to A.D. 400. They had been collected by the \n     Fleischmans over the last 40 years.\n       The Fleischmans have also been major supporters of the \n     British Museum as well as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the \n     Detroit Institute of Art, the Cleveland Museum and the \n     Vatican Museum.\n       In 1982 the couple endowed a chair in the Metropolitan \n     Museum's department of American art and supported the \n     installation of three galleries in its American Wing that \n     feature examples of American art from the museum's permanent \n     collections. The Lawrence A. and Barbara Fleischman Gallery \n     is an oval room that houses John Vanderlyn's ``Panoramic View \n     of the Palace of Versailles (1818-1819). A room endowed by \n     Kennedy Galleries is filled with folk and painted furniture \n     as well as decorative arts. The third gallery, the Martha and \n     Rebecca Fleischman Gallery, named after the couple's \n     daughters, shows American examples of 19th-century revival \n     styles.\n       In 1983 the Fleischmans also gave money to establish a \n     gallery of late medieval secular art at the museum that also \n     is named after them. A decade later they helped underwrite a \n     permanent position for a senior scholar in the Met's \n     department of Greek and Roman art.\n       Mr. Fleischman worked to foster wider appreciation of \n     American art. He served on a White House advisory committee \n     during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and was co-\n     founder with the art historian E. P. Richardson of the \n     Archives of American Art, which was created as a primary art \n     research resource for writers and scholars and is now a part \n     of the Smithsonian Institution.\n       Mr. Fleischman also founded the American Art Journal in \n     1969 and was a board member of the Art Dealers Association of \n     America and a fellow of the Pierpont Morgan Library. In 1991 \n     he became chairman of Caryatides, a group that supports the \n     British Museum's department of Greek and Roman antiquities. \n     He also began and was chairman of the American Friends of the \n     British Museum.\n       In 1978 Pope Paul VI named Mr. Fleischman a Papal Knight of \n     the Order of St. Sylvester and in 1986 he was named a Knight-\n     Commander of St. Sylvester, one of the highest distinctions a \n     lay person can receive from the church.\n       Born in 1925 in Detroit, Mr. Fleischman studied at the \n     Western Military Academy in Alton, Ill., at Purdue University \n     and at the University of Detroit, from which he graduated in \n     1948. That year he married Barbara Greenberg.\n       His interest in antiquities had begun during World War II \n     when, as a soldier stationed in Paris, he visited ancient \n     Roman sites.\n       In 1966 he and his family moved from Detroit to New York, \n     where he became a partner in Kennedy Galleries.\n       Mr. Fleischman had recently committed himself to \n     refurbishing a room at the British Museum and had just \n     promised the New York Public Library a gift described by the \n     Kennedy Galleries to be ``in the seven figures.''\n       In addition to his wife and his daughters, Rebecca, of \n     Portland, Ore., and Martha, president of Kennedy Galleries, \n     he is survived by a son, Arthur, of Boston.\n       Mr. Fleischman always insisted that he and his wife were \n     only ``temporary custodians'' of their collections.\n       ``No one owns a work of art,'' he said. ``You're the \n     custodian of it for the future. You take care of it, you have \n     the pleasure of living with it, and then you pass it on. It \n     is our hope that we leave it to the public.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/26/senate-section/article/S1685-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   JOINT MEETING OF THE TWO HOUSES--ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE \n                           REPUBLIC OF CHILE\n\n  Mr. COATS.

A bill to award a congressional gold \nmedal to not only recognize Frank Sinatra, as one of the most notable \nentertainers of our time, but also to recognize his unsurpassed \nhumanitarian efforts.\n  I am speaking of Frank Sinatra's generous and unostentatious \nphilanthropic accomplishments. This one man has raised hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to benefit the poor, the hungry, the chronically \nand terminally ill, and a variety of charities for children all over \nthe world.\n  The lives of countless ailing youngsters have been touched by the \nbenevolence of Frank Sinatra through his funding of entire hospital \nunits dedicated to caring for children. Specifically, the Frank Sinatra \nChild Care Unit at St. Jude's Children's Research Center in Memphis, \nTN, and the Sinatra Family Children's Unit for the Chronically Ill at \nChildren's Orthopedic Hospital in Seattle, WA.\n  Let me mention two examples of Frank Sinatra's generosity. This great \nman set out on a world tour to benefit children's hospitals, \norphanages, and schools. He personally and completely financed 30 \nconcerts in 10 weeks stopping in the international capitals of the \nworld. All in all he raised more than $1 million throughout this \neffort. And that was in 1962.\n  More recently, starting in 1979, Frank Sinatra coordinated a \nhistorical series of five annual concerts showcasing and sharing the \nstage with renowned entertainers such as Ella Fitzgerald, Victor Borge, \nDiana Ross, and opera singers Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, and \nMontserrat Caballe.\n  These five concerts generated $11 million, I repeat, $11 million for \nthe Frank Sinatra Fund of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. \nThese donations have helped ensure that patients of the cancer center \nwho cannot afford treatment are not turned away.\n  Frank Sinatra's generosity has channeled money for strengthening \neducational opportunities and programs for inner-city youths as well as \nuniversity coeds. Examples of his work stretch from Hoboken, NJ, to the \nHebrew University in Jerusalem and many points in between.\n  Not only has Frank Sinatra done more than a lion's share to assist \nhis fellow man, he has done so through anonymity. He is not one to \ntrumpet his goodwill. And that, Mr. President is a class act.\n  I am proud to say that support for this bill from my colleagues has \nbeen overwhelming. I thank all of my friends on both sides of the aisle \nwho have looked to the goodness in a fellow man and made the easy \ndecision to recognize that goodness.\n  Mr. President, that is the right thing to do. That is what we should \ndo more of. We should rally 'round and show our thanks for the goodwill \nof individuals who willingly share the fruits of their success with \nthose less fortunate.\n  On another note, Mr. President, I feel very strongly that the pubic \nsale of\n\n[[Page S1687]]\n\nbronze duplicates of the original Frank Sinatra gold medal has a very \nreal potential to raise money for the Treasury.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent the bill be deemed read a third \ntime, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill appear at this point in the record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 305) was deemed read a third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
